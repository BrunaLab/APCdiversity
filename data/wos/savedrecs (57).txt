AB The primary objective of this research was to remove recalcitrant nutrients from anaerobically digested sludge dewatering centrate. A struvite precipitation methodology is proposed where salt crystals are encouraged to ballast colloidal particles through heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. The secondary objective was to assess presence of micropollutants in precipitates, Four biologically unique dewatering centrates were used to test the precipitation methodology on the variety of anaerobic digester configurations that can be expected from municipal wastewater treatment plant. The effect of digestion sludge retention time (2 day, 20 day) and digestion temperature (35 degrees C, 55 degrees C) on the removal of dissolved unreactive phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) was monitored. Averaged across all four centrates, the precipitation methodology resulted in dissolved unreactive P and N removal of 82.4% and 66.6%, respectively. Antimicrobial contaminants (triclosan, triclocarban) were observed in the precipitates at minute concentrations (<18 ng/g-dry solids). Therefore, mass struvite precipitation can provide a means of recalcitrant nutrient treatment and reactive nutrient recovery without the micro pollutant burden of biosolids land application.

AB Waste stabilization ponds (WSP) are one of the most common forms of wastewater treatment for smaller communities globally, but have poor phosphorus removal. It is known that WSP algae can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells in excess of that needed for cell function. If polyphosphate accumulation could be triggered at the higher range of WSP cell concentrations, phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater could be significantly improved. However, this phenomenon is sporadic and still not fully understood. With a view of building a fundamental understanding to underpin the engineering of a new phosphorus removal process, this paper examines eight previously untested variables that may influence the cellular phosphorus content of WSP biomass. Although calcium, magnesium, and potassium are key constituents of polyphosphate granules, the concentrations tested were not limiting to polyphosphate accumulation. While literature also pointed to inoculum characteristics as potentially having an impact, no significance was found in this research. Conversely, three important new triggers where identified that significantly (90%.confidence) affected the cellular phosphorus content of WSP biomass. An increase in cellular phosphorus content was triggered by decreasing the organic load, or allowing the pH to increase as compared to pH control. By contrast, the presence of mixing decreased the phosphorus content of the WSP biomass. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drinking water can contain low levels of micropollutants, as well as disinfection by-products (DBPs) that form from the reaction of disinfectants with organic and inorganic matter in water. Due to the complex mixture of trace chemicals in drinking water, targeted chemical analysis alone is not sufficient for monitoring. The current study aimed to apply in vitro bioassays indicative of adaptive stress responses to monitor the toxicological profiles and the formation of DBPs in three drinking water distribution systems in France. Bioanalysis was complemented with chemical analysis of forty DBPs. All water samples were active in the oxidative stress response assay, but only after considerable sample enrichment. As both micropollutants in source water and DBPs formed during treatment can contribute to the effect, the bioanalytical equivalent concentration (BEQ) approach was applied for the first time to determine the contribution of DBPs, with DBPs found to contribute between 17 and 58% of the oxidative stress response. Further, the BEQ approach was also used to assess the contribution of volatile DBPs to the observed effect, with detected volatile DBPs found to have only a minor contribution as compared to the measured effects of the non-volatile chemicals enriched by solid-phase extraction. The observed effects in the distribution systems were below any level of concern, quantifiable only at high enrichment and not different from bottled mineral water. Integrating bioanalytical tools and the BEQ mixture model for monitoring drinking water quality is an additional assurance that chemical monitoring is not overlooking any unknown chemicals or transformation products and can help to ensure chemically safe drinking water.

AB Pharmaceutical discharges into the aquatic ecosystem are of environmental concern and sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been pointed out as the major source of these compounds to coastal zones, where oceanic disposal of sewage occurs through submarine outfalls. Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water, but little is known about the effects on marine organisms. In this study, we employed a tiered approach involving the determination of environmental concentrations of DCF in marine water and the adverse biological effects for fertilization, embryo-larval development and biomarker responses of the mussel Perna perna. Results indicate that effects in fertilization rate and embryo-larval development were found in the order of mg.L-1. However, low concentrations of DCF (ng.L-1) significantly decreased the lysosomal membrane stability and COX activity, as well as triggered DNA damage, oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant defenses. Our results point to an environmental hazard at coastal ecosystems and suggest the need for improvements in the treatment of domestic wastewater aiming to reduce DCF concentrations, as well as regulation on current environmental legislation and monitoring of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Fabrication of compositionally-graded magnetic-nonmagnetic bimetallic structures was successfully completed using a laser engineered net shaping (LENSTM) system. A graded magnetic functionality was implemented by directly transitioning from non-magnetic austenitic stainless steel 316 (SS316) to magnetic ferritic stainless steel 430 (SS430) in a single structure. LENS (TM) additive manufacturing utilizes a high-powered laser to continuously melt and bond metallic powder in successive layers to create the 3D structure. Microstructures revealed a preferred grain growth direction at the interfaces of the deposited layers. Micro-hardness values across the part's cross-section exhibited a smooth transition from the highest value of 266 +/- 4 HV in the SS430 region to the lowest value at the SS316 substrate of 174 +/- 3 HV. Magnetic functionality was observed on the SS430 side of the bimetallic structure, showing how LENS (TM) can additively combine materials of varying compositions for location-specific functionality.

AB The friction and wear behavior of n-Na2B4O7/ion nitrocarburized duplex layer under alternating load was deeply studied. Compared with the intermediate frequency quenched surface lubricated by CD15W-40 oil, the n-Na2B4O7/ion nitrocarburized duplex layer has a better friction reduction and wear resistance under alternating load. The reason is that the n-Na2B4O7 particles inlaying in the pores of the ion nitrocarburized layer play the "micro-nano bearing" function during friction process, and the chemical reaction film including the sulphate, nitride and sulphide formed on the friction surface plays solid lubrication function and segregates the direct contact between the two friction surfaces.

AB The Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C composite with hollow coaxial structure has been successfully synthesized via a facile repeated immersion method induced by cotton fibers. The morphologies, structures and properties are investigated by X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C composite displays a unique hollow coaxial structure constructed by hollow carbon fibers filled with Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C particles inside and coated by Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C layer outside. Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C composite exhibits good rate performance with a specific capacity of 115.7 mAh g(-1) at 15 C rate between 3.0 and 4.3 V. The improved properties can be attributed to the formation for hollow coaxial structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this report, we present the electrical and optical properties of four-layered perovskite ferroelectric ABi(4)Ti(4)O(15) (with A = Sr, Ba, Ca), prepared by solid-state reaction route. The X-ray diffraction study asserts single-phase orthorhombic structure with A2(1)am space group. Scanning electron microscopy observation shows plate-like grains in all the samples. Notably orthorhombic distortion (b/a) decreases with increase in ionic radius of A-site cation, which was explained by tolerance factor. Additionally, good ferroelectric, piezoelectric, optical and thermal stability obtained in SBT system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polymer spheres with tunable particle size were synthesized by hydrothermal method derived from sucrose. Afterwards, zircon was coated on their surface to form the zircon encapsulated carbon (C@ZrSiO4) black pigment after calcination. The corresponding relationship between the particle size of polymer spheres and the chromaticity of C@ZrSiO4 pigments was investigated. The results revealed that the chromatic performance of C@ZrSiO4 pigment can be significantly improved by decreasing the colorant size and the relationship between them was approximately linear. The pigment exhibits deep black hue, as L*=41.04, a*=1.01, b*=3.22, with the colorant size of 123 nm. Moreover, it also presents excellent thermal and chemical stability, indicating its potential candidate for ceramic decoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Core-shell structure exists widely in as-atomized immiscible alloy. For its formation mechanism, the previous studies have shown that the core formed by the migration and subsequent coalescence of globule minority phase in sample center. In this paper, however, a novel route against traditional understanding was proposed from the visualized phase separation in transparent succinonitrile-water systems with critical and off-critical compositions. For phase separation with off-critical composition, core-shell structure forms in a conventional way, whereas, for that with critical composition, it evolves from a novel ring-shaped structure with a new route which has never been reported. This scenario is analyzed by the different dynamic characteristics of spinodal decomposition and nucleation-growth. Our results can provide deep insight into the formation mechanism on the core-shell-corona structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) films on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were prepared by electrodeposition method followed with heat-treatment process using a thiol-amine as solvent mixture under ambient conditions. The structure and properties of the Sb2S3 films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical workstation. The results show Sb2S3 films mainly consist of orthorhombic phase with micro-nanorods morphology. Sb2S3 films exhibit good electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation with a low detection limit of 0.4 mu M.

AB A novel method to generalize kinetic data of viscous crack healing in glasses is proposed. The method assumes that crack healing progress is proportional to the healing time, t, and indirect proportional to viscosity, eta. This way, crack length and crack width data, normalized to the initial crack length and plotted versus t/eta, allow to compare crack healing progress for different cracks and healing temperatures in a master curve. Crack healing experiments conducted in this study demonstrate the applicability of this method for a commercial microscope slide glass. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work investigates the effect of gravity during melt electrospinning writing (MEW) and explores the feasibility of developing MEW devices with lateral and upside down print head configurations. Average fibre diameters of printed constructs using different printing directions and their variability reveal particular differences.

TI CrOOH as high-performance surface passivation material for

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

   Hydrothermal synthesis; P-type dye-sensitized solar cell
AB alpha-CrOOH was firstly explored as a passivation material for p-type dye-sensitized solar cell based on 3R-CuCrO2 delafossite and its beneficial effect on photovoltaic performance of p-type DSSC was demonstrated. alpha-CrOOH nanomaterial was obtained by a simple hydrothermal method using strong acid solution. The n-type alpha-CrOOH passivation of the p-type 3R-CuCrO2 film has provided a doubling of J(SC) and a threefold increase in the V-OC compared to the pure 3R-CuCrO2 photocathode in DSSC. This remarkable enhancement could be explained in that alpha-CrOOH layer acts as a barrier layer for charge recombination between the holes in the valence band and the electrolyte or dye. In addition, formed p-n junction would facilitate the charge separation. Therefore, the alpha-CrOOH is proposed as a promising material to modify the photocathode of p-type DSSC with excellent photovoltaic efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of novel s-triazine based tri-imidazole derivatives were successfully prepared through the substitution reaction of cyanuric chloride with imidazole (IM), 2-methylimidazole (2MI), 2-ethylimidazole (2EI) and 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole (EMI), respectively. The synthesized tri-imidazole derivatives were applied in epoxy resin (EP) to investigate their curing behaviors and thermal latency. Compared with the EP systems containing the unmodified imidazoles, the curing exothermic peaks of the EP systems containing s-triazine based tri-imidazole derivatives shifted to higher temperature regions. Moreover, the EP systems containing s-triazine based tri-imidazole derivatives had much longer storage stability at room temperature. The s-triazine structure with strong electron withdrawing effect reduced the nucleophilicity of pyridine-like nitrogen atom of imidazole ring, resulting in the suppression of reactivity of the modified imidazole derivatives towards EP at room temperature. Nevertheless, the s-triazine based tri-imidazole derivatives regained fast curing performance towards EP at elevated temperatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An all solid-state thin-film Lithium-ion Battery with Ti/ZnO/LiPON/LiMn2O4/Ti structure was successfully deposited on the glass substrate by magnetron sputtering without any heat treatments. With the protection of LiPON films, the cell formed by crystal ZnO, amorphous LiPON and LiMn2O4, and Ti films presents a stable reversible capacity of 22 mu Ah/cm(2) between 0.5 and 5 V at the current density of 5 mu A/cm(2) in the air at the room temperature. The microstructure and phase structure of cell were characterized with XRD, SEM and Raman spectroscopy techniques, respectively. Good electrical performance proves it could be useful for low-power thin film battery applications onto lower-temperature substrate materials and battery stacks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Eutectic high entropy alloys (EHEAs) are recently of great interest due to their excellent mechanical properties. However, only a few EHEAs have so far been designed because of the lack of multi-component phase diagrams. Here, a new Fe20Co20Ni41Al19 EHEA was successfully designed and studied. The alloy exhibited a nano-lamellar eutectic microstructure composed of ordered BCC (B2) phase and ordered FCC (L1(2)) phase. The room-temperature tensile strength and total elongation of the alloy were as high as 1103 MPa and 18.7%, respectively, which were better than those of a majority of as-cast high entropy alloys. The new alloy has a potential application in industry and will promote the further study of EHEAs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this letter, we report the variety of surface topography and shapes of columns of CeO2 films deposited at different temperatures using glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. The wettability of the films was also investigated. Rough and triangular pyramid surface and regular nanorods were successfully obtained at a deposition temperature of 400 degrees C. Water contact angle (WCA) tests show that the rougher and regular the surface is, the higher WCA we get, and a maximum WCA of 43.2 degrees was obtained at the temperature of 400 degrees C.

DE Metals and alloys; Metallurgy; Corrosion; Simulated body fluid
AB The mechanical performance and electrochemical stability in simulated body fluid (SBF) of a lightweight Fe-30Mn-10Al-1C (in wt.%) alloy after gas nitridation were investigated. The gas nitriding process was performed at 550 degrees C for 5 h under pure NH3 atmosphere. The nitrided layer was similar to 45 mu-thick and consisted predominantly of fine AlN. The surface microhardness, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation of the present gas-nitrided alloy are 1814 Hv, 1078 MPa, 1024 MPa, and 77%, respectively. The corrosion tests in SBF showed that the gas-nitrided alloy exhibited a corrosion current density (I-corr) of 5.0 x 10(-9) A/cm(2), a pitting corrosion current density (I-pit) of 5.1 x 10(-7) A/cm(2), and a passivation region with Delta E (equivalent to E-p - E-corr) approximate to + 1804 mV, respectively, which are substantially better than those obtained in the plasma-nitrided and hydroxyapatite-coated 316L stainless steel. The results demonstrated that the present gas-nitrided alloy having an excellent combination of strength, ductility and corrosion resistance is a promising candidate to replace 316L stainless steel for medical implants.

The structural properties using X ray diffraction (XRD) has revealed the formation of polycrystalline CZTS thin films. We noted that the increase of the copper concentration has improved the crystallinity of the CZTS thin films.

TI Secondary phases in Cu2ZnSnS4 films obtained by spray pyrolysis at

ID CZTS THIN-FILMS; GROWTH
AB Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films prepared by the spray pyrolysis method were studied. This deposition method does not require sophisticated technological setup and allows to easily varying different technological parameters, which is perspective in terms of mass application. Here we show how the variation of the substrate temperature and of the Cu/Zn stoichiometry ratio in the precursor solutions influence the optical and structural properties of CZTS film. The Raman spectra reveal that an increase in the substrate temperature and Cu content leads to a higher disorder of the crystal structure and to the secondary phase formation, in particular, Cu2-xS. In turn, the formation of secondary phases significantly affected the CZTS bandgap. We have found that the films with the substrate temperature 289 degrees C and the Cu/Zn stoichiometric ratio equal to 2.0 comprise a minimum content of secondary phases and having the best crystal structure.

AB Sputtered WS2 films can be modified by adding some amount of hetero-elements to overcome the porous columnar microstructure and thereby to enhance the wear resistance. However, the recession of tribological properties of WS2-hetero-element composite films in low earth orbit environment would be a potential danger because most hetero-elements succumbed to oxidation by atomic oxygen. Herein, by altering deposition argon pressure to adjust the plasmas bombard function on growing WS2 film, the characteristic porous microstructure disappeared. At the optimization condition, the sputtered WS2 film exhibited a dense microstructure, high ratio of S to W, and thereby much better wear-resistance. However, the excessive bombardment would result in the prominent loss of S atoms in WS2 film and the deterioration of tribological properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ternary compounds like B5SiC2 and B3Si2C2 as products of reaction between B4C and silicon were proposed to exist in early investigations. According to the recent publications the products of high temperature reaction are SiC and the ternary phase(s) BxCyCz. The crystals of the newly appearing ternary phase (s) have relatively big dimensions (10-20 mu m), rather strict crystal facets. Twinning may be frequent for these phases. According to energy dispersive and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy the composition of these crystals tends to B3Si2C2, their diffraction lines are similar to those of BxSiyCz phase, described earlier.

AB Thin film of silicon is an interesting material for many technological applications in electronic industry and in energy harvesting technologies, but requires a method for controlled growth of thin films. The purpose of this study is to screen a wide variety of Si content precursors for Si atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactions using state-of-the-art density-functional calculations. Among the studied 85 Si content precursors we found that C7H12OSi-Methoxy-trivinyl-silane and C7H9NSi-Benzyliminosilane show positive indications for ALD reactivity for Si deposition. We believe that this finding will be helpful to develop low-cost, high-energy efficiency thin-film solar cells for future scale up implementation in photovoltaics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Nanomaterials; Perovskite; Functional; Sensors; Semiconductors
AB ZnO nanoflowers synthesized via a hydrothermal route were decorated with LaMnO3 perovskite oxide and the gas sensing performance was studied. The perovskite particles had a size of several to tens of nanometers, and were uniformly adhered to the smooth surface of ZnO nanoflowers. In comparison with the pristine ZnO sensor, 1 wt% LaMnO3 decoration led to significantly enhanced ethanol sensing performance. The response of the LaMnO3@ZnO sensor to ethanol gas was increased by 74% and the response time was reduced by similar to 5 times. Moreover, lower optimal working temperature, higher sensitivity, much faster recovery speed, and improved ethanol selectivity were achieved. The greatly improved ethanol sensing performance of the LaMnO3@ZnO sensor may be ascribed to formation of p-n heterojunction and the excellent catalytic activity to oxygen reduction reaction of LaMnO3.

AB The prospect of introducing natural biological secrets to improve the crack resistance of gray cast iron is presented. We demonstrated that the mechanism of resisting crack owned by plant leaf can be referred to fabricate an alternating structure of hard and soft with low cost, high strength, and an exceptional ability to resist crack growth. Laser alloying was introduced to fabricate the hard phase which associated with the original matrix constituted the alternating structure. A homogeneous microstructure and a uniform distribution of chemical composites were achieved in hard phase. Nanoindentation test showed the resistance to plastic deformation of hard phase was improved. Crack propagation tests verified the crack resistance was enhanced by the alternating structure which could change and prolong crack path, and the effectiveness of resisting crack propagation was proportional to the size of hard phase.

AB 0.7Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.3PbTiO(3) (PMN-PT) ferroelectric thin films were epitaxially integrated on GaN (0002) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO)/TiO2 buffer layers are designed to decrease the lattice mismatch between PMN-PT and GaN, which promotes the epitaxial growth of pure perovskite PMN-PT (111) thin films. Meanwhile, LSCO/TiO2 heterostructures could be served as the bottom electrodes for integrated ferroelectric devices. Epitaxial relationship of the multilayer is determined to be (111) [1 (1) over bar0] PMN-PT//(111) [1 (1) over bar0]LSCO//(100)[001] TiO2//(0002) [11 (2) over bar0] GaN. The integrated PMN-PT (111) films exhibit good ferroelectric and dielectric properties with remanent polarization of 11.3 mu C/cm(2), coercive field of 34.1 kV/cm at 100 Hz, dielectric constant of 2035 and dielectric tunability of 68.1% at 1 kHz, which make it a potential candidate for the applications in GaN-based integrated ferroelectric devices.

ID NANOFIBERS
AB SiBNO ceramic fibers are promising materials in radar-wave-transparent applications due to their excellent dielectric property and high mechanical strength. In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) fluffy SiBNO ultrafine fibers were fabricated by electrospinning of polyborosiloxane (PBSO) sol and pyrolysis up to 1000 degrees C under NH3. The construction of fluffy structure was well manipulated through adjusting the environmental humidity during the electrospinning process. The obtained SiBNO fibers with typical amorphous structure display a uniform distribution with an average diameter of 1.5 mu m. Moreover, the SiBNO fibers exhibit excellent dielectric property with the average dielectric constant and loss tangent of 4.44 and 0.0029 at 2-18 GHz, respectively. These fluffy architectures demonstrate great potentials in nano-composite materials, which can promote precursor impregnation into three dimensions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An e-beam exposure can be applied to charging of dielectrics. In SiO2 this phenomenon is investigated fundamentally, but nobody use the charged dielectric layer as substrate for controllable CVD. In the present work it is shown that the growth of graphene-like films (transparent conductive continuous films which possess a high value from applied viewpoint) can be controlled by e-beam irradiating the substrate surface with various exposure doses. The quality and the thickness of GLF on SiO2/Si increase together with preliminary exposure dose. The mechanism of the observed effect is discussed. Quasi-3D structures with different thicknesses of GLFs are grown during a single synthesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A quarternary Co-free Ni35Al21.67Cr21.67Fe21.67 high entropy alloy was designed and prepared by arc melting. The Ni35Al21.67Cr21.67Fe21.67 high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses disordered BCC phase and ordered BCC phase (B2). A "sunflower-like" microstructure was found in Ni35Al21.67Cr21.67Fe21.67 high entropy alloy. B2 phase forms the continuous matrix with the disordered BCC spherical particles (200 nm-300 nm) in 'core' region. In 'petal' region, striped B2 phases are inlaid in disordered BCC matrix. Moreover, the result of mechanical property test suggests that alloy presents outstanding compressive strength and excellent ductility with the microstructure of B2/BCC phase. The alloy showed an excellent comprehensive properties at room temperature (yield strength sigma(0.2) = 1471 MPa, compressive strength sigma(b) = 35 41 MPa and compression rate epsilon = 40%), which was superior to some traditional metallic materials. High strength was mainly attributed to high volume fraction of hard B2 phase matrix and B2 precipitations strengthening. Dislocations motion in disordered BCC matrix provided ductility for the alloy. The Ni35Al21.67Cr21.67Fe21.67 HEA has promising use in future structural applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioactive coatings were prepared on titanium foils using anodic oxidation at applied voltage of 350 V and current density of 70 mA.cm(-2) for 10 min. New formulation of electrolyte was introduced which consist of 0.04 M beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP), 0.4 M calcium acetate (CA), and 1.0 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with different volume fractions. The results showed that the nanoflower sodium titanate was deposited on the titanium which anodically oxidised in electrolyte containing 50 vol% of beta-GP + CA and 50 vol% NaOH. After soaking in SBF for 7 days, highly crystalline bone-like apatite was fully covered on surface of that particular sample. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ALUNITES; NANOFLOWERS; AMMONIUM
AB In this study, a novel superstructure of hexagonal rose-like ammonioalunite was produced by hydrothermal synthesis in acidic condition. Urea was a precipitant in the system. The sharp peaks in the XRD pattern and the clear electron diffraction spots in selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicated that ammonioalunite was highly crystallized. SEM images proved that the average diameter of the prepared ammonioalunite is similar to 8 mu m with a thickness of similar to 6 mu m. This highly ordered 3D superstructure can expand the scope of potential applications of ammonioalunite in the areas of ceramics, catalysis, electronics, and optoelectronics. The possible mechanism is that the rose-like ammonioalunite was obtained by self-assembling from nanosheets with spiral growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ni-containing SrFeO3-delta/Al2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-delta/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and deposited onto surfaces of porous alumina oxide foams. The measured oxygen storage capacity values are 1448 and 1275 mu mol-O/g for SrFeO3-delta and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-delta powder, respectively (about 55% and 75% of their theoretical values). The experimental reactor using exhaust gas of a gasoline engine was assembled. Decrease of CO and other harmful components in case of Ni/SrFeO3-delta/Al2O3 coating is comparable to that of Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-delta/Al2O3 layer. After reactor conditions (700 degrees C during 15-20 min), microstructure of both catalysts remains unchanged. Strontium ferrite maintained an orthorhombic brownmillerite-type crystal structure, whereas nickel was detected in both metallic and oxide forms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of ammonia plasma on the luminescence and stability of the porous silicon (PS) has been studied. Samples were cut into different parts to compare the as-deposited sample with the low (5 W) and high RF power (75 W) treated parts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shown that the samples treated at 5W did not demonstrate a change in the structural aspects, whereas, samples treated at 75W shown some modifications in the final structure. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed strong diminishment in the luminescence as an outcome of plasma treatment for both samples. In comparison to sample treated at 5W, high RF power treated sample did not show recovery in the PL with the course of time. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis shown the alterations in the hydrogen and oxygen bonding with time for the sample treated at 5W. On the other hand, the appearance of stable nitrogen peaks (Si-N, N-H) were found for the other sample. PL quenching could be due to the appearance of plasma-induced defects and/or hydrogen-related dangling bonds and further shown the stability of the sample treated at 75W (no recovery in PL) for optoelectronic applications.

The polished Ti64 surfaces were hydrothermally treated in urea solutions with or without the subsequent heat treatment. Hydrothermal treatment increases the hydrophilicity and Vickers hardness of Ti64 surface. Heat treatment deteriorates the hydrophilicity of Ti64 surface although it enhances the surface hardness.

DE Biomaterials; Structural; Antibacterial ions; Corrosion resistance
AB The hierarchical micro/nanostructure has been proved to improve the integration of an implant and its surrounding bone tissue. However, excellent antibacterial properties and good corrosion resistance are also important to increase the success rates of implants. Therefore, in this paper, the micro/nanostructure containing antibacterial ions (silver, copper and zinc ions) was fabricated on the surface of titanium by the combination of sandblasting, acid etching, alkali-heat treatment, and ion exchange. And the corrosion resistance was evaluated by polarization curve test. The results demonstrated that the more active metal ions on the surface of micro/nanostructured titanium were, the worse the corrosion resistance was. Nevertheless, compared to polished titanium, the corrosion current of micro/nanostructured titanium with antibacterial ions was increased due to the effect of surface topography and chemical composition. This study provides a promising insight into the antimicrobial design of titanium surfaces in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently much research has been conducted towards finding, fast and accurate pattern classifiers applied to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems. In this way, researchers have proposed new methods based on Fuzzy ARTMAP Network (FAN) in order to enhance the success rate for structural damage classification applied to SHM applications. Conversely, the performance of methods based on FAN is very dependent of its setup parameters. In several SHM approaches in the literature, authors have proposed selecting those parameters by using several attempts (empirical and manual selection) and keeping them fixed for all cases in the resulting analysis, hampering the success rate of the neural network. To overcoming that, this paper introduces a new strategy for enhancement of structural damage identification focusing on supervised learning of FAN by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for selecting optimal setup parameters automatically for the FAN algorithm. Also, the Kappa coefficient is used as an objective function to be maximized through the PSO algorithm. As a result, the optimum setup parameters improved the success rate while the damage identification is being carried out. Indeed this proposed method is certainly very promising and constitutes a novelty. The proposed method achieves more than 75% hit rate that is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art approaches as presented in this paper. Furthermore, this approach yields a 20% improvement when considering the worst case scenario. Hence, this approach shows a practical application of expert and intelligent systems applied to damage identification in SHM systems. To conclude, the proposed approach successfully identifies structural damage with accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature selection is an effective pre-processing step to remove possible redundant and irrelevant features for various machine learning paradigms, which can help build a more understandable machine learning based component in hybrid expert systems. Single-label quadratic programming feature selection (QPFS) model is formulated as a QP problem with a unit simplex constraint to both minimize feature-feature redundancy and maximize feature-label relevance simultaneously. Since its redundancy matrix is desired not to be positive semi-definite and then estimated by Nystrom low-rank approximation method, its performance depends greatly on under-sampling rate and random permutation. In this paper, without any approximation, we extend this model to construct a regularized version (rQPFS), resulting in a strictly convex QP problem, to achieve a globally optimal subset of features. To reduce the increment of computational time for entire redundancy matrix, Frank-Wolfe method with a sub-linear convergence rate and its special cases for strictly convex function and unit simplex constraint are applied to solve our rQPFS efficiently. Furthermore, to tackle multi-label FS paradigm, pruned problem transformation trick is used to evaluate feature-label relevance to describe label correlations sufficiently. The detailed experimental study on eight data sets shows that our proposed method performs the best, compared with six state-of-the-art multi-label FS methods, according to six instance-based performance evaluation measures.

AB The objectives of this work are to develop a technological solution designed to support active aging of frail older individuals and to conduct a first evaluation of the devices. We wish to bring a reflection in the field of connected health by setting up a remote medical follow-up. In this context, the connected object presented in this article aims at implementation a longitudinal follow-up of the walk by a health professional. Continuous remote data analysis applies behavior learning methods by modeling walking habits and allows the detection of deviations by application of thresholds defined by the expert. We propose an instrumented shoe insole to provide such monitoring (number of steps, distance covered and gait speed). In this perspective, we designed a low power microelectronic device integrated into the thickness of an insole in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of such a device in laboratory and in living conditions. The project called "FOOT-TEST" is funded by the DIRECCTE of the Midi-Pyrenees Region in France. This project brought together a manufacturer who specializes in the design of foot-care systems, geriatricians and our laboratory specialized in electronics to propose a technical solution adapted to frail individuals. Two smart insole prototypes have been produced and a first evaluation of the smart insole in real use conditions has been performed. According to user feedback, the smart insole seems to be much easier to use than commercial connected pedometers. Moreover, in terms of performance, the smart insole provides better results. In this paper, we present specifications of the device, technological choices and the design of two versions of the smart insole, methods used to measure desired settings, a first evaluation of the system and, finally, preliminary conclusions and work in progress.

AB Recent efforts regarding mobile social networks aim at connecting people in smart environments considering not only their social behavior but also their context. In this perspective, this work presents a model, named SSN, based on the concept of Spontaneous Social Network, which allows the interaction of people anywhere and anytime without the need of any preexisting relation. The main scientific contribution of the SSN model is the possibility of creating social communities based on a combination of multiple contexts, including location, profile and data obtained from external online social networks. In this way, SSN focus on suggesting communities that users are interested in. In the process of developing the model, we propose a methodology for building semantic-based recommendation systems. In terms of evaluation, we performed two experiments using a developed mobile application called Dino. First, we presented hypothetical scenarios based on possible real-world SSN applications to measure users' perceived sense of community. Second, we asked users to consider their real interests in suggested groups. We computed average values of 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall, respectively. The experiments' results to assess the proposed scenarios ascertain average values of agreement above 80% for sense of community, belonging, social usefulness, member loyalty, and communities' ephemerality. Therefore, our evaluation depicts that dynamic virtual communities formed by a SSN model based application would beneficially improve a social-aware virtual environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Real world decision making problems under uncertainty face different challenges. These challenges include lack of information, the necessity of quick decisions, and problems may change across time. When the uncertainty involved is due to fuzziness and vagueness, the use of fuzzy linguistic information can facilitate the elicitation of decision makers' preferences of alternatives by allowing assessment of alternatives in unipolar scales. However, in some cases decision makers need to express negative, positive and neutral attitudes that cannot be modeled by unipolar scales. This paper aims at developing a dynamic linguistic multi-criteria decision making model dealing with bipolar linguistic scales in which both alternatives and criteria may vary across time. In order to consider the historical evolution of alternatives leading-up to the current assessments, a fusion process based on transformation functions and uninorm aggregation operator is proposed to deal with the membership functions of bipolar linguistic assessments. Finally the performance of this model is compared with a non-dynamic method in a supplier selection problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning classification algorithms are widely applied to different malware analysis problems because of their proven abilities to learn from examples and perform relatively well with little human input. Use cases include the labelling of malicious samples according to families during triage of suspected malware. However, automated algorithms are vulnerable to attacks. An attacker could carefully manipulate the sample to force the algorithm to produce a particular output. In this paper we discuss one such attack on Android malware classifiers. We design and implement a prototype tool, called lagoDroid, that takes as input a malware sample and a target family, and modifies the sample to cause it to be classified as belonging to this family while preserving its original semantics. Our technique relies on a search process that generates variants of the original sample without modifying their semantics. We tested lagoDroid against RevealDroid, a recent, open source, Android malware classifier based on a variety of static features. IagoDroid successfully forces misclassification for 28 of the 29 representative malware families present in the DREBIN dataset. Remarkably, it does so by modifying just a single feature of the original malware. On average, it finds the first evasive sample in the first search iteration, and converges to a 100% evasive population within 4 iterations. Finally, we introduce RevealDroid*, a more robust classifier that implements several techniques proposed in other adversarial learning domains. Our experiments suggest that RevealDroid* can correctly detect up to 99% of the variants generated by lagoDroid. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Truss optimization aims to provide the lightest truss to gain the maximum benefit out of available resources. Truss optimization may subject to static and dynamic constraints. Static constraints include structural kinematic stability, maximum allowable stress in truss members, maximum allowable deflection in the truss nodes and critical buckling load. However, dynamic constraints impose limits on the natural frequency of the desired truss to avoid the destructive resonance phenomenon. Taking both static and dynamic constraints into account may lead to growth in the search space but dwindling its feasible region; the search space becomes very non-convex and may subterfuge the solver to trap in a local optimum. Another design consideration may include fabricational constraints to present design variables from a set of available cross-sections to satisfy the design codes. This paper proposes a hybrid genetic programming algorithm to deal with the barriers of this complex problem. It looks for the optimum connectivity table (among the truss nodes) and optimal cross-sectional areas for its members subject to design constraints. It also benefits from a Nelder-Mead local search operator to improve the competence and true convergence of the algorithm. Our algorithm has been applied to some numerical examples considering both types of continuous and discrete design variables; It proved its efficiency to find better solutions (lighter trusses) in comparison with other methods in the literature for most of the cases.

AB Bi-level optimization has widespread applications in many disciplines including management, economy, energy, and transportation. Because it is by nature a NP-hard problem, finding an efficient and reliable solution method tailored to large sized cases of specific types is of the highest importance. To this end, we develop a hybrid method based on machine-learning and optimization. For numerical tests, we set up a highly challenging case: a nonlinear discrete bi-level problem with equilibrium constraints in transportation science, known as the discrete network design problem. The hybrid method transforms the original problem to an integer linear programing problem based on a supervised learning technique and a tractable nonlinear problem. This methodology is tested using a real dataset in which the results are found to be highly promising. For the machine learning tasks we employ MATLAB and to solve the optimization problems, we use GAMS (with CPLEX solver). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seam-carving is used for adjusting the size of an image as well as removing objects from images. When seam-carving is applied to delete the object in the image, it may lead to the distortion of the information transmitted by the image, misleading the public, and endangering human health. Therefore, detecting the location of objects removed by seam-carving techniques is a scientific challenge to the image forensics. According to the position movement law of the related pixel in the seam-carving process, a method of the detecting and locating the objects deleted based on the block artifact grid (BAG) mispairing characteristic is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the BAG is extracted from the JPEG image; secondly, 10-dimensional features of the BAG chart is constructed; thirdly, clustering technique is applied on the extracted features of the BAG to obtain the classification results; finally, the location of the removed object is computed based on the previous classification results. Experiment result shows that the proposed method can efficiently detect and locate the object removed from an image by seam-carving. The proposed method in this paper opens up a new research direction for the location and detection of tampering, and has important application value for the intelligent forensics system based on seam carving.

AB A novel pseudo-incremental ensemble rough set pseudo-outer product (PIE-RSPOP) fuzzy neural network is proposed for learning and prediction of trends in complex temporal series. It incorporates four theories pertaining to the learning and memorizing mechanisms in human beings. BCM theory of synaptic meta plasticity replaces Hebbian learning of weights of fuzzy rules and allows for a more natural associative dissociative learning of weights. Short term forgetting of weights of the fuzzy rules is integrated for rules that are recalled and rules that are not recalled by an instance of data through Ebbinghaus theory of forgetting due to decay and displacement. The long term forgetting of networks in the ensemble is also incorporated through exponential decay of weights based on the age and strengths of the networks. Lastly, a hippocampal mechanism for caching the memories for subsequent recall is proposed. Another contribution of PIE-RSPOP is its ability to deal with concept drift and less storage of historical data. Lastly, despite the usually uninterpretable nature of incremental ensembles of fuzzy networks, a scheme to derive simple interpretable single knowledge base is also proposed. Variety of numerical results on standard datasets are used to demonstrate the advantages of PIE-RSPOP over other incremental learning methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

ID RESILIENCE
AB Remediation actions are performed in scenarios in which consequences of a problem should be promptly mitigated when its cause takes too long to be addressed or is unknown. Such scenarios are recurrent in the real world, including in the context of computer science. Existing approaches that address these scenarios are application-specific. Nevertheless, the reasoning about remediation actions as well as cause identification and resolution, in order to address problems permanently, can be abstracted in such a way that they can be incorporated to autonomous software components, often referred to as agents. They can thus autonomously deal with these scenarios, which we refer to as critical cause-effect situations. In this paper, we propose a domain-independent extension to the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture that provides such agents with this automated reasoning. Our work provides an extensible solution to this recurrent problem-solving strategy and allows agents to flexibly deal with resource-constrained scenarios. This solution removes the need for manually implementing the coordination of actions performed by agents, using causal models to capture the knowledge required to carry out this task. Therefore, it not only allows the development of systems with remediative behaviour, but also enables the reduction of development effort by means of a reusable infrastructure that can be used in several different domains. Our approach was evaluated based on an existing solution in the network resilience domain, which showed that our extended agent can autonomously address a network challenge, with a reduction in the development effort and no impact in agent performance.

ID BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES
AB A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates a medium to translate the human motion intentions using electrical brain activity signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) into control signals. EEG signals are non-stationary and subject specific. A major challenge in BCI research is to classify human motion intentions from non-stationary EEG signals. We propose a novel subject specific multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) based filtering method, namely, SS-MEMDBF to classify the motor imagery (MI) based EEG signals into multiple classes. The MEMD method simultaneously decomposes the multichannel EEG signals into a group of multivariate intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs). This decomposition enables us to extract the cross-channel information and also localize the specific frequency information. The MIMFs are considered as narrow-band, amplitude and frequency modulated (AFM) signals. The statistical measure, mean frequency has been used to automatically filter the MIMFs to obtain enhanced EEG signals which better represent motor imagery related brainwave modulations over mu and beta rhythms. The sample covariance matrix has been computed and used as a feature set. The feature set has been classified into multiple MI tasks using Riemannian geometry. The proposed method has helped achieve mean Kappa value of 0.60 across nine subjects of the BCI competition IV dataset 2A which is superior to all the reported methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Decision making in the field of financial management is a very complicated and dynamic process. How to incorporate domain knowledge into evolutionary computing to solve financial decision-making problems has long been an interest of researchers. This paper investigates the use of domain knowledge in an evolutionary process, especially in the mutation process. A semantic network of financial attributes is created and used to measure the variation between parents and offspring introduced in the mutation process. The proposed distance-proportional mutation (DPM) constrains the mutation size to be a) small enough that the searching proceeds gracefully, while b) large enough to avoid being trapped into local optima. The hypothesis is that the DPM outperforms a random mutation or a constrained mutation in which only the component that is the closest to the one being mutated can be selected, and provides a better decision-making support for the stock classification problem. Experiments were implemented to test the hypothesis. DPM is also compared with other classifiers, such as decision trees. The results support the hypothesis and shed light on future directions to further delineate the theory of how evolutionary computation can gradually build on the body of human knowledge.

AB We present in this study an algorithmic framework of an intelligent scheduling system that aims to provide an optimum planning for the production process of cutting tools taking into consideration the constraining conditions such as production characteristics, capacity, and performance criteria. Once blunt, cutting tools are sent to the sharpening service composed of parallel machines capable of sharpening more than one tool at the same time. After sharpening, tools are sent back to the departments of origins to be used in other production processes. Thus, any delay in the sharpening service provokes delays in other departments. We develop first a genetic algorithm enhanced by a dynamic programming procedure capable of optimally scheduling a given job sequence. Then we develop a branch and bound method that emulates at each node possible decisions based on a postpone or schedule strategy. Numerical results show that both methods give high quality solutions for the scheduling of tool sharpening operations. Beside the minimization of total tardiness, many other types of decision making related to minimal operation time of a sharpening service, minimal amount of cutting tool inventory and the number of required sharpening machines can be deduced thanks to applying our models.

AB Clustering analysis is one of the major topics in unsupervised machine learning. A recent study proposes a novel density-based clustering algorithm called the Density Peaks. It is based on two intuitive assumptions: that cluster centers have a higher density than those of their neighbors, and that they also have a relatively large distance from other points with a higher density. To see whether a distance is relatively large, we should make a comparison of it and another one. However, such comparison is not explicitly modeled in the algorithm. Therefore, we propose the Comparative Density Peaks algorithm which takes the comparison into the design of the method. Furthermore, we give our analysis of Density Peaks from the perspective of the tree structure, and summarize two sufficient conditions that contribute to a good clustering performance under the Density Peaks framework. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the original Density Peaks clustering algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several biological research studies have shown that the number of individuals of certain species of anurans in a specific geographical region, and the evolution of this number over time, can be used as an indicator of climate change. To detect the presence of anurans, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are usually deployed with the aim of obtaining bio-acoustic information in a set covering numerous locations. However, the identification of the anuran species from a huge number of recordings usually involves an overwhelming task that has to be undertaken by expert and intelligent systems. Previous studies into this issue have proposed several classification techniques with a common approach: they all take into account the sequential characteristic of sounds by considering syllables or other kinds of vocal segments. In noisy sounds, as it is usually the case in recordings made in natural habitats, segmentation of the signal is no straightforward task and may cause low classification accuracy. To override this problem, a new non-sequential approach is proposed in this paper. It is based on considering very small pieces of sounds (frames) each of which is then classified without considering preceding or subsequent information. Up to nine frame-based classifiers are explored in this paper and their performances are compared to the most commonly used sequential classifier: the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Additionally, for featuring the frames, many choices have been described, although the application of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) has probably become the most common method. In this work, an alternative methodology is suggested: the use of a set of MPEG-7 parameters, which offers a normalized solution with a much greater semantic content. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method clearly outperforms the HMM, thereby showing the non-sequential classification of anuran sounds to be feasible. From among the algorithms tested, the decision-tree classifier has shown the best performance with an overall classification success rate of 87.30%, which is an especially striking result considering that the analyzed sounds were affected by a decidedly noisy background.

AB Many organizations and institutions are implementing accurate and practical tools to accelerate decision making process. In this regard, hospitals and healthcare centers are not exceptions, in particular, because they directly impact the health and well-being of the community. When it comes to disease diagnosis, practitioners may have different opinions, which lead to different decisions and actions. On the other hand, the amount of available information, even in a case of a typical disease is so vast that rapid and accurate decision-making may be difficult. For example, practitioners may prescribe several expensive tests in order to diagnose a heart disease whereas many of those tests might not even be required. Accordingly, a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can be very helpful here. In particular, such a CDSS can be developed as an expert system for those patients who have a high likelihood of developing heart diseases. This study develops an expert system based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Inference System in order to evaluate the condition of patients who are being examined for heart diseases. The Fuzzy AHP is used to calculate weights for different criteria that impact developing heart diseases, and the Fuzzy Inference System is used to assess and evaluate the likelihood of developing heart diseases in a patient.

TI A data reduction strategy and its application on scan and backscatter

AB In the last few years, the telecommunications scenario has experienced an increase in the volume of information generated, as well as in the execution of malicious activities. In order to complement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), data mining techniques have begun to play a fundamental role in data analysis. On the other hand, the presence of useless information and the amount of data generated by telecommunication services (leading to a huge dimensional problem), can affect the performance of traditional IDSs. In this sense, a data preprocessing strategy is necessary to reduce data, but reducing data without affecting the accuracy of IDSs represents a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new data preprocessing strategy which reduces the number of features and instances in the training collection without greatly affecting the achieved accuracy of IDSs. Finally, our proposal is evaluated using four different rule-based classifiers, which are tested on real scan and backscatter data collected by a network telescope. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to modeling errors in designing ontologies, an ontology may carry incorrect information. Ontology debugging can be helpful in detecting errors in ontologies that are increasing in size and expressiveness day by day. While current ontology debugging methods can detect logical errors (incoherences and inconsistencies), they are incapable of detecting hidden modeling errors in coherent and consistent ontologies. From the logical perspective, there are no errors in such ontologies, but this study shows some modeling errors may not break the coherency of the ontology by not participating in any contradiction. In this paper, contextual knowledge is exploited to detect such hidden errors. Our experiments show that adding general ontologies like DBpedia as contextual knowledge in the ontology debugging process results in detecting contradictions in ontologies that are coherent.

AB Technological innovation is critically important for high-tech firms in laying the groundwork for corporate growth and competitive advantages. It is hoped that evaluating risk accurately and effectively will contribute to assign appropriate priorities of technological innovation projects and to enhance the success rate for the whole project. In considering the issue of risk evaluation, the essential question that arises concerns strong fuzziness, ambiguity, and inexactness during the process of assessing risks. However, comparatively little research has focused on accommodating higher degrees of uncertainty in evaluating risks associated with technological innovation projects. Because the existing risk evaluation methods (such as models using net present values, internal rates of return, fuzzy logic, real options, and stochastic simulation) have certain limitations, this paper takes the powerfulness of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets into account to handle imprecise and ambiguous information and to characterize complex uncertainty in practical risk evaluation problems. This paper aims to propose an IVPF inferior ratio(IR)-based assignment model and to establish a novel risk evaluation method of technological innovation for the purpose of appropriately tackling highly uncertain information in intricate and varied circumstances. The proposed method provides an effective way to fuse complicated information about risk assessments and to identify an aggregate ranking of technological innovation projects that has the closest agreement with all indicator-wise precedence ranks. The feasibility and applicability of the IVPF IR-based assignment model are illustrated via a real-world case concerning the risk evaluation of technological innovation in high-tech enterprises. Furthermore, the practicality and effectiveness of the developed methodology are verified through a comparative analysis with other relevant approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper applies the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) to detect and diagnose faults in industrial chemical processes. This machine learning classification technique discovers hidden knowledge in industrial datasets by revealing interpretable patterns, which are linked to underlying physical phenomena. The patterns are then combined to build a decision model that serves to diagnose faults during the process operation, and to explain the potential causes of these faults. LAD is applied to two case studies, selected to exemplify the difficulty in interpreting faults in complex chemical processes. The first case study is the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a well-known benchmark problem in the field of process monitoring and control that uses simulated data. The second one uses a real dataset from a black liquor recovery boiler in a pulp mill. The results are compared to those obtained by other common machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), k nearest neighbors (kNN), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machine (SVM). In addition to its explanatory power, the results show that LAD's performance is comparable to the most accurate techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm is nature inspired global optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitic behavior of cuckoos. It has proved to be an efficient algorithm as it has been successfully applied to solve a large number of problems of different areas. CS employs Levy flights to generate step size and to search the solution space effectively. The local search is carried out using switch probability in which certain percentages of solutions are removed. Though CS is an effective algorithm, still its performance can be improved by incorporating the exploration and exploitation during the search process. In this work, three modified versions of CS are proposed to improve the properties of exploration and exploitation. All these versions employ Cauchy operator to generate the step size instead of Levy flights to efficiently explore the search space. Moreover, two new concepts, division of population and division of generations, are also introduced in CS so as to balance the exploration and exploitation. The proposed versions of CS are tested on 24 standard benchmark problems with different dimension sizes and varying population sizes and the effect of probability switch has been studied. Apart from this, the best of the proposed versions is also tested on CEC 2015 benchmark suite. The modified algorithms have been statistically tested in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and bat algorithm (BA). The numerical and statistical results prove the superiority of the proposed versions with respect to other popular algorithms available in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel method, namely centrifugeless dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, is introduced for the efficient extraction of banned Sudan dyes from foodstuff and water samples. In this method, which is based upon the salting-out phenomenon, in order to accelerate the extraction process, the extraction solvent (1-undecanol, 75 mu L) is dispersed into the sample solution. Then the mixture is passed through a small column filled with 5 g sodium chloride, used as a separating reagent. In this condition, fine droplets of the extraction solvent are floated on the mixture, and the phase separation is simply achieved. This method is environmentally friendly, simple, and very fast, so that the overall extraction time is only 7 min. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the preconcentration factors in the range of 90-121 were obtained for the analytes. Also good linearities were obtained in the range of 2.5-1200 ng mL(-1) (r(2) >= 0.993).

AB Hazelnut shells are the major byproduct of the hazelnut industry. The objectives of this study were to optimize the conditions for extracting phenolics and to identify and quantify the phenolics in hazelnut shells. Preliminary optimization showed that a high recovery of phenolics could be achieved with shell particle size less than 0.5 mm when extracted with acetone at 50 degrees C. Response surface experiments showed that a 10 g/l liquid to solid ratio, 58% acetone, and 12 h extraction time yielded the highest amount of phenolics. Twenty-seven phenolic compounds were identified in hazelnut shells by mass spectrometry. Coumaroylquinic acid, epicatechin gallate, quercetin, and six other phenolics were identified in hazelnut shells for the first time. The most abundant phenolics in hazelnut shells were catechin, epicatechin gallate, and gallic acid, as quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These results can be useful for the development of industrial extraction processes of natural antioxidants from hazelnut shells.

Hydroperoxide-based kinetic parameters (IP, induction period, min; k(i), rate constant during IP, meq/kg min) of control sample (38.0; 2.0346) were considerably improved by TBHQ (201.1; 0.0267), followed by GA (163.8; 0.0837), MG (151.2; 0.0983), and the combinations (similar to 184.4; similar to 0.0861) with an average synergy of 18.6%. Regarding the polar compounds inhibition, the best antioxidant performance (the ratio of IP to oxidized triacylglycerol monomers at IP, min/%; time reaching 10% of triacylglycerol dimers and polymers, min) in general belonged to MG/GA 75:25 (42.4; 263.0), GA (43.2; 249.9), MG (38.0; 237.5), and TBHQ (17.7; 214.4), respectively. The kinetic parameters based on the formation of polar compounds than hydroperoxides provided more reliable results to evaluate antioxidant potency at high temperature.

AB Rennet gelation is used to produce many types of cheese. The effect of native whey protein on rennet gelation kinetics was investigated. Milks with a wide range of whey protein: casein (WP:CN) ratios (with standardised casein concentrations) were made from powders produced by microfiltration. Measurements of casein macro peptide release showed that native whey protein inhibited the enzymatic action of chymosin, which delayed the onset and reduced the subsequent rate of gelation. Experiments in which increased chymosin concentrations compensated for the inhibition, demonstrated that other factors also contributed to the reduced gelation rate. Neither an increase in viscosity nor a reduction in soluble calcium was responsible, leading to the conclusion that in addition to inhibiting chymosin, native whey proteins present a physical barrier to para-casein aggregation. This study demonstrates and explains how casein-enriched retentates from microfiltration gel faster than regular cheese milk that contains higher amounts of native whey protein.

AB A changing climate has led to winegrapes being harvested with increased sugar levels and at greater risk of berry shrivel. A suggested easy-to-adopt strategy to manage the associated rising wine alcohol levels is the pre-fermentative substitution of juice with either "green harvest wine" or water. Our study investigates the effects of this approach on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon wine quality attributes. Wines were also made from fruit collected at consecutive earlier harvest time points to produce wines comparable in alcohol to the substituted wines. Tannin concentrations and colour did not change significantly in the wines with modified alcohol content even at higher juice substitution rates. Differences in polysaccharide and tannin composition indicated variability in extraction dynamics according to substitution rate and type of blending component. In scenarios where berry shrivel is inevitable, the incorporation of water in particular offers much promise as part of a strategy to manage wine alcohol content.

AB An efficient method has been developed for determining tridemorph in banana using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The dissipation and terminal residue of tridemorph in banana fields were carried out at good agricultural practice (GAP) conditions. The average recoveries ranged from 84.4% to 90.0% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 3.0%-7.0% at three different spiking levels. The results indicated that the tridemorph dissipated quickly in banana with half-lives of 7.0-7.7 days. The results of residual distribution ranged from 0.01 to 0.26 mg/kg, 0.01-0.62 mg/kg and < 0.01 mg/kg in whole banana, peel and pulp, respectively. The relationship between application factor and residue was discussed. The results of risk assessment showed that the risk quotient (RQ) value was all below RQ = 1. Given that China has not set an maximum residue limit (MRL) value for tridemorph in banana, this study could provide guidance for the reasonable use of tridemorph.

AB The phenolic profiles and antioxidant status of hazelnut samples [natural (raw) hazelnut, roasted hazelnut, and roasted hazelnut skin] were compared. Free and bound (ester-linked and glycoside-linked) phenolic acids were examined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Comprehensive identification of phenolics was carried out using Q-exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-OT-MS). Samples were also assessed for their total phenolics and antioxidant activities using three different assays. Ten free and bound phenolic acids were quantified in hazelnut samples. Roasted hazelnut skin contained the highest content of total phenolic acids, followed by natural and roasted hazelnuts. The majority of phenolic acids were present in the bound form. Using a Q-OT-MS, 22 compounds were tentatively identified, 16 of which were identified for the first time in hazelnut samples. The newly identified compounds consisted of flavonoids, phenolic acids and related compounds, hydrolysable tannins and related compounds, and other phenolics. Three antioxidant assays demonstrated similar trends that roasted hazelnut skin rendered the highest activity. The present work suggests that roasted hazelnut skin is a rich source of phenolics and can be considered as a valueadded co-product for use as functional food ingredient and antioxidant.

AB Proteome analysis was performed to understand intramuscular variations in muscle fiber distribution in semimembranosus (SM) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles associated with pork quality. Fifteen SM and ST muscles were separated into dark and light portions. The relative area of oxidative fiber was higher (P <.0001) in dark portion than that in light portion, while glycolytic fiber types were distributed primarily (P <.01) in light portions regardless of muscle types. Myosin-1, myosin-4, troponin complex (fast), myosin light chains, and metabolic enzymes responsible for fast-twitch glycolytic types were overexpressed in light portions (P <.05). However, myosin-2, myosin-7, myoglobin, and mitochondrial oxidative metabolic enzymes were closely related to slow-twitch oxidative fibers. These resulted in high pH, redness, and tenderness but low lightness and drip loss of pork quality. In conclusion, differentially expressed muscle proteins are associated with fiber type (oxidative vs. glycolytic) distribution, resulting in intramuscular variations of pork quality.

AB We report the use of an Ultrafast 2D NMR approach applied on a benchtop NMR system (43 MHz) for the authentication of edible oils. Our results demonstrate that a profiling strategy based on fast 2D NMR spectra recorded in 2.4 min is more efficient than the standard 1D experiments to classify oils from different botanical origins, since 1D spectra on the same samples suffer from strong peak overlaps. Six edible oils with different botanical origins (olive, hazelnut, sesame, rapeseed, corn and sunflower) have been clearly discriminated by PCA analysis. Furthermore, we show how this approach combined with a PLS model can detect adulteration processes such as the addition of hazelnut oil into olive oil, a common fraud in food industry.

AB Hen egg yolk (EY) has a complicated structure consisting of lipids and proteins, and its structure is deeply related with its functional properties. P-31-NMR is an efficient technique to non-destructively detect the dynamic behaviour of phospholipids, the main component of bio-membranes. We determined conditions for measuring the P-31 NMR spectra of EY and identified the components. P-31-NMR was used to detect phosvitin, inorganic phosphate, and lipoprotein as well as structural changes such as granule collapse and freeze-thaw denaturation as signal changes. Freeze-thaw denaturation generated a new denaturation peak. We separated aggregates of LDL from freeze-thawed plasma using centrifugation. TEM and P-31-NMR observations revealed that the denaturation peak corresponded to LDL aggregates. The P-31-NMR spectra suggested the formation of multiple forms of LDL aggregates in which the head groups of phospholipid molecules adopt a face-to-face orientation, similar to that observed following the flocculation of lipoproteins or in the lamellar-like structures of phospholipids.

AB Amadori rearrangement products are potent "activated flavor precursors". This study describes a stepwise optimization of DFG(1-deoxy-1-fructosylglycine) formation from glycine and glucose, varying temperature, water activity a(w), concentration, and ratio/state of precursor mix. In the solid state reaction at 50 degrees C for 16 h, yield of DFG increased with decreasing water activity with a peak at a(w) = 0.22-0.33. In water the conversion was slower and negatively correlated with water activity in the range a(w) = 0.8-1. An industrially applicable 2-step vacuum drying and heating process was explored, which first concentrates precursor solution to a(w) = 0.5-0.6 and then continues the heating in a closed vessel for an additional 2-4 h. Over 40 mol% conversion from glucose to DFG was obtained on a multi-gram scale. Fine tuning of conditions will be needed for other amino acid/carbohydrate combinations and may offer new perspectives for tailored product flavor generation under moderate heating.

AB In this study visible/near-infrared spectroscopy (Vis/NIRS) was evaluated to rapidly classify intact chicken breast fillets. Five principal components (PC) were extracted from reference quality traits (L*, pH, drip loss, expressible fluid, and salt-induced water gain). A quality grades classification method by PC1 score was proposed. With this method, 150 chicken fillets were properly classified into three quality grades, i.e., DFD (dark, firm and dry), normal, and PSE (pale, soft and exudative). Furthermore, P(C)1 score could be predicted using partial least squares regression (PLSR) model based on Vis/NIRS (R(2)p= 0.78, RPD= 1.9), without the measurement of any quality traits. Thresholds of PC1 classification method were applied to classify the predicted PC1 score values of each fillet into three quality grades. The classification accuracy of calibration and prediction set were 85% and 80%, respectively. Results revealed that PC1 score classification method is feasible, and with Vis/ NIRS, this method could be rapidly implemented.

AB Extractable total phenolic content of American non-toasted oak (Quercus alba L.) shavings has been determined using near infrared hyperspectral imaging. A like-wine model solution was used for the simulated maceration procedure. Calibrations were performed by partial least squares regression (MPLS) using a number of spectral pre-treatments. The coefficient of determination of wood for extractable total phenolic content was 0.89, and the standard error of prediction was 6.3 mg g(-1). Thus, near infrared hyperspectral imaging arises as an attractive strategy for predicting extractable total phenolic content in the range of 0-65 mg g(-1), of great relevance from the point of view of quality assurance regarding wood used in the wine sector. Near infrared hyperspectral imaging arises as an attractive strategy for the feasibility of enhancing the value of cooperage byproduct through the fast determination of extractable bioactive molecules, such as polyphenols.

AB Fluorescence sensors are useful tools for the non-destructive assessment of grape berry anthocyanins. The Multiplex (Mx) sensor here studied provides two anthocyanin indices: ANTHR= log(1/Chl-fluorescence_R) and ANTHRG= log(Chl-fluorescence_R/Chl-fluorescence_G), based on the chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence excited with red (R) and green (G) light. These indices were calibrated against wet chemistry. The dependence of anthocyanin prediction models on cultivar, season and site was studied on four cultivars in two Italian regions during three consecutive years. The 2010 global model (all cultivars at both growing sites) gave relative prediction errors on anthocyanin content less than 14.1% (ANTHR) and 19.0% (ANTHRG). The ANTHRG was independent of season, maintaining a relative error of about 20% in both 2011 and 2012. In field applications of the calibrated Mx, it showed its ability to detect inter-plot and inter-season differences on both growing sites.

AB Alkylated caseinates (Cn-caseinates) containing selected C8-C16 alkyl groups were successfully synthesized through a two-step reaction between the protein and fatty acids. The substitution degree (SD) of the alkyl groups was 5.2-72.9%, which depended on the feed molar ratio of reagents and fatty acid chain length. The SD value was positively associated with the surface hydrophobicity index (S-0) of the Cn-caseinate. Among the tested Cn-caseinates (n = 0, 8, 12, 14 and 16), C16-caseinate showed the best self-assembly and curcumin-loading properties in water. With increased palmitoyl group SD, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of C16-caseinate was decreased from 5.15 to 3.77 mg/L and the encapsulation efficiency of curcumin-loaded C16-caseinate self-assemblies was increased from 31.16% to 69.87%. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated a desirable sphere assembly.

AB 9,10-Anthraquinone (AQ) was a new contaminant, with unknown sources, occurred globally in tea. European Union (EU) fixed the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 0.02 mg/kg. The pollution source of AQ in tea was traced from the view of AQ deposit on tea crop by simulation. The possible contamination pathway and main factors to decrease AQ were explored in tea cultivation-tea manufacture-tea infusion, on the basis of AQ analytical methods by using solvent extraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) quantification. 58.8-84.6% of AQ degraded in tea processing, and drying played a key role to reduce the AQ contamination. Certain concentration of AQ deposited on tea shoots could resulted in AQ beyond the MRL of 0.02 mg/kg in tea. AQ leaching into tea brew (about 10%) could lead to the possible health risk. AQ deposit on tea crop during the tea cultivation might cause the AQ contamination in tea.

AB Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) constitute a novel class of biodegradable and inexpensive solvents. In this study, twenty choline chloride-and glycerol-based NADESs were prepared and investigated as washing agents in the removal of cadmium (Cd) from rice flour for the first time. Choline chloride-based NADESs demonstrated good Cd removal (51%-96%). A natural, biodegradable surfactant, saponin, was mixed with the NADESs to enhance their efficiency. No increase in Cd removal was observed when glycerol-based NADESs were combined with 1% saponin; however, synergistic effects between saponin and choline chloride-based NADESs were observed during the washing process and > 99% Cd was removed using NADES-saponin mixtures. Moreover, NADESs washing process did not affect the main chemical components or structure of rice flour. The mechanism of Cd removal by NADESs and regeneration of Cd-contaminated NADESs were also explored. The study presents a green and efficient way of removing Cd from contaminated rice.

AB "Long storage" tomato is a crop traditionally cultivated in the Mediterranean area under no water supply, that recently has attracted the interest of breeders for its high tolerance to drought and as potential genetic source in breeding programs for water stress resistance. A collection of 28 genotypes of "long storage" tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) was studied for carotenoid and polyphenol profile and content, vitamin C, and other physicochemical traits of fruits. Tomato carotenoids and polyphenols were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and electrospray-mass spectrometry (HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS); nineteen different phenolic compounds and six different carotenoids, for a total of 25 markers, have been detected, quantified and used to discriminate among the different landraces to find out which could be the best candidate for a medium-to-large scale cultivation. Different statistical approaches (ANOVA, Principal Components Analysis, Cluster Analysis) have been used for data analysis.

AB This study determined feasibility of krill protein isolated with isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) as wall material to microencapsulate krill oil by freeze-drying. Effects of krill oil/krill protein ratio on properties of microcapsules were investigated. With increased ratio, crude protein of microcapsules decreased, while total lipid increased. Although microcapsule oil loading capacity increased, loading and encapsulation efficiencies decreased. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) confirmed abundance of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic; and thus, resulted in stable emulsion (emulsion stability index). Microcapsules contained omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at 43-60, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 28-41 and 9-11 g/100g of total FAs, respectively. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis revealed proteolysis of ISP krill protein, probably causing reduced loading and encapsulation efficiencies. SEM showed that krill oil/krill protein ratio affected surface microstructure. ISP krill protein showed potential as a wall material to microencapsulate krill oil; and thus, expand application of krill oil/protein for human consumption.

AB A comparative study between microwave assisted and sonication methods was carried out to extract arsenic (As) species in shellfish samples using different extractants. Six As species including arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As (V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AsB) and arsenocholine (AsC) were simultaneously separated and determined by the HPLC-ICP-MS method. The microwave assisted method exhibited higher efficiency than sonication, especially using diluted HNO3 as extractant. By compromising extraction efficiency, pretreatment time and stability of As species, the microwave assisted method using 1% HNO3 at 100 degrees C for 1.5 h was selected to extract As from real samples. The proposed method has been applied to extract and determine As species in shellfish samples. The result of correlation analysis indicated that the proportion of AsB in the shellfish samples was decreased with total As concentration increasing due to the biotransformation threshold from inorganic As to AsB.

AB Gluten free (GF) diets are prone to mineral deficiency, thus effective monitoring of the elemental composition of GF products is important to ensure a balanced micronutrient diet. The objective of this study was to test the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis combined with chemometrics for at-line monitoring of ash, potassium and magnesium content of GF flours: tapioca, potato, maize, buckwheat, brown rice and a GF flour mixture. Concentrations of ash, potassium and magnesium were determined with reference methods and LIBS. PCA analysis was performed and presented the potential for discrimination of the six GF flours. For the quantification analysis PLSR models were developed; R(2)cal were 0.99 for magnesium and potassium and 0.97 for ash. The study revealed that LIBS combined with chemometrics is a convenient method to quantify concentrations of ash, potassium and magnesium and present the potential to classify different types of flours.

AB In vitro assays are widely used to analyze the antioxidant potential of compounds, but they cannot accurately predict antioxidant behavior in living systems. Cell-based assays, like the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay, are gaining importance as they provide a biological perspective. When the CAA assay was employed to study phenolic antioxidants using hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells, quercetin showed antioxidant activity in HepG2 cells; 25 and 250 mu M quercetin reduced fluorescence by 17.1 +/- 0.9% and 58.6 +/- 2.4%, respectively. (+)-Catechin, a phenolic antioxidant present in many foods, bestowed virtually no CAA in HepG2 cells. When Caco-2 cells were employed, more robust antioxidant activity was observed; 50 mu M (+)-catechin and quercetin reduced fluorescence by 54.1 +/- 1.4% and 63.6 +/- 0.9%, respectively. Based on these results, likely due to differences in active membrane transport between the cell types, the Caco-2-based CAA assay appears to be a more appropriate method for the study of certain dietary phenolics.

AB In this study, the total contents, leachability into tea infusions, and bioaccessibility of lithium from black, Earl Grey, and green teas were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Leachabilities were evaluated after infusion for 2, 5, or 10 min. Bioaccessibility was determined in vitro under simulated stomach and intestinal digestion conditions. Addition of lemon juice, sugar, or milk for consumption, and calcium, tannic acid, and citric acid as additives were evaluated to determine if they affected bioaccessibility of lithium from black tea. The bioaccessible lithium contributed to 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03% of the recommended dietary allowances of lithium for black, Earl Grey, and green tea samples, respectively. These contributions may increase up to 4.4 times or decrease up to seven times with certain additives.

AB This study describes the impact of crop genetics and processing in two pea lines (Pisum sativum L.) on starch digestion kinetics. Mutation at the rugosus (r) locus leads to wrinkled pea seeds, a reduction in starch content and a lower extent of in vitro starch digestibility. The Logarithm of Slope (LOS) kinetic model was used to analyse digestion curves obtained using porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase for a range of particle size fractions. Changes in starch structure induced by the r mutation led to clear differences in starch digestion kinetics for purified starches and pea flours. Larger particle size fractions showed slower starch digestion relative to the purified starch, but significant differences still existed between r and wild type pea lines. It is expected that this work will help inform the design of future studies where both starch structure and food structure are important determinants of digestion behaviour.

AB Atlantic sardines (Sardina pilchardus) captured in the Portuguese mainland coast and maintained in captivity for one year feeding on artificial diet showed significant differences in muscle total lipids (TL) content in relation to wild fish (25% after one year compared to 14% in wild). Captive sardines had higher percentage of non-polar lipids (NPL) in their muscle, presented higher levels of 18:1n-9 and lower of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in NPL than those observed in wild fish. TL in the liver were not significantly different between captive and wild fish, but the NPL fraction of captive sardines presented higher levels of 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3 than those registered in the wild. Polar lipids (PL) were less influenced by captivity since the fatty acids profile was more stable. The excess of energy in the diet of captive sardines was reflected in lipid accumulation in subcutaneous layer and visceral fat and not in the liver.

AB Chitin degradation is catalyzed by a two-component chitinolytic enzyme system, chitinase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase). In this paper, the full-length cDNA sequence encoding NAGase (EcNAG) was obtained from Exopalaemon carinicauda. The deduced amino acid sequence of EcNAG open reading frame (ORF) contained one Glycohydro_20b2 domain and one Glyco_hydro_20 domain. Based on the cDNA sequence, the genomic structure of EcNAG was characterized and it was composed of six exons and five introns. EcNAG mRNA majorly expressed in the hepatopancreas and epidermis. During the molting stages, EcNAG mRNA expression was well-regulated and its expression reached the highest level at the molting stage E. In addition, EcNAG was recombinant expressed in Pichia pastoris and the partial enzymatic characterization of recombinant EcNAG was confirmed. After being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, the expression of EcNAG was up-regulated significantly at 6 h and reached the peak at 12 h. And then, the expression began to down-regulated and came to the normal level at 72 h. It is helpful to research the relationship between the molt related hormones and chitinlytic enzymes.

AB The best hypothesis to explain Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) pathogenesis is offered by the "triple risk model", which suggests that an interaction of different variables related to exogenous stressors and infant vulnerability may lead to the syndrome. Environmental factors are triggers that act during a particular sensible period, modulated by intrinsic genetic characteristics. Although literature data show that one of the major SIDS risk factors is smoking exposure, a specific involvement of molecular components has never been highlighted. Starting from these observations and considering the role of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes functional polymorphisms in the detoxification process, we analyzed GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotype frequencies in 47 SIDS exposed to tobacco smoke and 75 healthy individuals.
   A significant association (p < .0001) between the GSTM1 null genotype and SIDS exposed to smoke was found. On the contrary, no association between GSTT1 polymorphism and SIDS was determined. Results indicated the contribution of the GSTM1 -/- genotype resulting in null detoxification activity in SIDS cases, and led to a better comprehension of the triple risk model, highlighting smoking exposure as a real SIDS risk factor on a biochemical basis.

AB The barbel chub Squaliobarbus curriculus is an important commercial fish species in China, and has shown significant resistance to grass carp reovirus (GCRV). In this study, the cDNA sequence of interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) from Squaliobarbus curriculus, designated as ScIRF3, was cloned, and its effect against GCRV was investigated. The full-length 1837 base pair (bp) cDNA of ScIRF3 contained a complete open reading frame of 1374 bp and encoded a putative polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The ScIRF3 protein contained conserved domains, including an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal IRF association domain, and a serine-rich domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ScIRF3 was closely clustered with IRF3s from Carassius auratus and Ctenopharyngodon idellus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression levels of ScIRF3 in Squaliobarbus curriculus were the highest in the spleen and lowest in the muscle. After GCRV infection, expression levels of both ScIRF3 and type I interferon (IFN) were initially up-regulated and subsequently down-regulated in the spleen and intestine. Correlation analysis showed that the expression level of type I IFN is significantly positively correlated with that of ScIRF3 (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.883, P: 0.004) in the intestine. The expression level of type I IFN was also significantly up-regulated and the GCRV titer was significantly decreased (P < .05) in GCRV-infected ScIRF3-overexpressing Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells. These results indicate that ScIRF3 may play a role in the type I IFN immune response against GCRV in Squaliobarbus curriculus and can also inhibit GCRV replication in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells.

AB Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the initial symptoms of many heart diseases. We found that miR-672-5p may participate in the regulation of heart disease development in mouse, but the association between miR-672-5p and cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. In the present study, we found that the abundance of miR-672-5p decreased in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by phenylephrine, angiotensin II (Ang II) and insulin-like growth factor 1. Putative target genes of miR-672-5p were identified using four pipelines, miRWalk, miRanda, RNA22 and Targetscan, and a total of 834 genes were predicted by all four pipelines. Among these target genes, 98 were associated with the development of heart disease. PPI networks showed that the Jun proto-oncogene product (JUN), a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor, had the highest node degree, and it was defined as the hub gene of the PPI networks. Luciferase assays showed that miR-672-5p bound to the 3' UTR of the JUN gene and decreased luciferase activity, indicating that JUN is a target of miR-672-5p. Finally, we found that increasing the abundance of miR-672-5p in cardiomyocytes controlled the relative cell area in Ang II-stimulated hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Correspondingly, the abundance of JUN, a target of miR-672-5p, was decreased in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes on both mRNA and protein levels, implying that miR-672-5p had suppressive effects on cardiac hypertrophy through regulating the expression of Jun in cardiomyocytes.

AB Study on kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis and A. deliciosa) color mainly concentrated in green and yellow-fleshed cultivars, less about molecular mechanism of red-fleshed trait formation, rarely in all red-fleshed fruit. Using 'Tianyuanhong' and 'Yongfengyihao' ('TY', a kind of all red-fleshed cultivar, from Actinidia arguta; 'YF', a kind of all green-fleshed cultivar, also from Actinidia arguta) as experimental material, we performed RNA-seq to obtain 202,742 unigenes with an average length of 603 bp and N50 of 873 bp via transcriptome data analysis. Of these unigenes, 72,508 (35.76%) were annotated and 997 were assigned to secondary metabolic pathways, of which 104 unigenes were involved in flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis. According to the parameter log2fold-change and p-adjusted, 12 differentially expressed structural genes were selected for performing expression profiles and cluster analysis. Physiological traits including color ration, hue angle, and anthocyanin content were also investigated. From the results, we concluded AaLDOX (genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase) maybe the key gene controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in flesh of 'TY' kiwifruit, which promoted accumulation of anthocyanin, finally leading to the red flesh coloration.

AB The known functions of the human GCOM1 complex hub gene include transcription elongation and the intercalated disk of cardiac myocytes. However, in all likelihood, the gene's most interesting, and thus far least understood, roles will be found in the central nervous system. To investigate the functions of the GCOM1 gene in the CNS, we have cloned human and rat brain cDNAs encoding novel, 105 kDa GCOM1 combined (Gcom) proteins, designated Gcom15, and identified a new group of GCOM1 interacting genes, termed Gints, from yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens. We showed that Gcom15 interacts with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor by co-expression in heterologous cells, in which we observed bi-directional co-immunoprecipitation of human Gcom15 and murine NR1. Our Y2H screens revealed 27 novel GCOM1 interacting genes, many of which are synaptic proteins and/or play roles in neurologic diseases. Finally, we showed, using rat brain protein preparations, that the Gint internexin-alpha (INA), a known interactor of the NMDAR, co-IPs with GCOM1 proteins, suggesting a GCOM1-GRIN1-INA interaction and a novel pathway that may be relevant to neuroprotection.

AB Introduction: Drug response and target therapeutic dosage are different among individuals. The variability is largely genetically determined. With the development of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, widespread research have provided us a wealth of information on drug-related genetic polymorphisms, and the very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) variants have been identified for the major populations around the world whereas less is known regarding minorities in China, including the Yi ethnic group. Our research aims to screen the potential genetic variants in Yi population on pharmacogenomics and provide a theoretical basis for future medication guidance.
   Materials and methods: In the present study, 80 VIP variants (selected from the PharmGKB database) were genotyped in 100 unrelated and healthy Yi adults recruited for our research. Through statistical analysis, we made a comparison between the Yi and other 11 populations listed in the HapMap database for significant SNPs detection. Two specific SNPs were subsequently enrolled in an observation on global allele distribution with the frequencies downloaded from ALlele FREquency Database. Moreover, F-statistics (Fst), genetic structure and phylogenetic tree analyses were conducted for determination of genetic similarity between the 12 ethnic groups. Results: Using the chi(2) tests, rs1128503 (ABCB1), rs7294 (VKORC1), rs9934438 (VKORC1), rs1540339 (VDR) and rs689466 (PTG52) were identified as the significantly different loci for further analysis. The global allele distribution revealed that the allele "A" of rs1540339 and rs9934438 were more frequent in Yi people, which was consistent with the most populations in East Asia. F-statistics (Fst), genetic structure and phylogenetic tree analyses demonstrated that the Yi and CHD shared a closest relationship on their genetic backgrounds. Additionally, Yi was considered similar to the Han people from Shaanxi province among the domestic ethnic populations in China.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated significant differences on several polymorphic SNPs and supplement the pharmacogenomic information for the Yi population, which could provide new strategies for optimizing clinical medication in accordance with the genetic determinants of drug toxicity and efficacy.

AB Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and cardiac conduction disease (CCD) are two kinds if diseases that can induce heart failure, syncope and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). DCM patients can experience CCD at the same time. In recent research, some disease-causing genes and variants have been identified in patients with DCM and CCD, such as Alpha-Actinin-2 and TNNI3 Interacting Kinase (TNNI3K). In this study, we employed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to explore the potential causative genes in a Chinese family with DCM and CCD. A novel splice site mutation (c.333 + 2 T > C) of TNNI3K was identified and co-segregated with the affected family members. This novel mutation was also absent in 200 healthy local controls and predicted to be disease-causing by Mutationtaster. The splice site mutation (c.333 + 2 T > C) may result in a premature stop codon in exon 4 of the TNNI3K gene and can induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Real-time qPCR also confirmed that the level of TNNI3K mRNA expression was decreased significantly compared with the controls, which may lead to myocardial structural disorder and arrhythmia. In this study we reported the third novel mutation of TNNI3K in DCM and CCD patients which further supported the important role of TNNI3K in heart development and expanded the spectrum of TNNI3K mutations. The results may contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with DCM and CCD.

AB GATA4 is a well-known transcription factor of the GATA family implicated in regulation of sex determination and gonadal development in mammals. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of Paralichthys olivaceus gata4 (Po-gata4). Phylogenetic, gene structure, and synteny analysis showed that Po-GATA4 is homologous to GATA4 of teleost and tetrapod. Po-gata4 transcripts were detected in Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, oogonia and oocytes, with higher transcript levels overall in the testis than the ovary. The promoter region of P. olivaceus R-spondin1 was found to contain a GATA4-binding motif. Results of CBA (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence based binding assay) indicated that GATA4 could indeed bind to the promoter sequence of R-spondin1. Moreover, human GATA4 recombinant protein could upregulate R-spondinl in P. olivaceus ovary cells and FBCs (flounder brain cell line). In FBCs, overexpression of Po-gata4 resulted in elevated transcript levels of R-spondin1. Taken together, our results indicate that Po-GATA4 is involved in gonadal development by regulating R-spondin1 expression.

AB Vitiligo is an immune-related disease with patchy depigmentation of skin and hair caused by selective destruction of melanocytes. In recent decades, many studies have shown the association between vitiligo and HLA genes; however, the results of Han Chinese are scarce. In this study, we performed a fine-mapping analysis of the MHC region in 2818 Han Chinese subjects through a widely used HLA imputation method with a newly built large-scale Han-MHC reference panel. Three new four-digit HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1 * 02:02, HLA-DQA1 * 02:01 and HLA-DPB1 * 17:01) were identified to be associated with the risk of vitiligo, and four previously reported alleles were confirmed. Further conditional analysis revealed that two important variants, HLA-DQ beta 1 amino acid position 135 (OR = 1.79, P = 1.87 x 10(-11)) and HLA-B amino acid positions 45-46 (OR = 1.44, P = 5.61 x 10(-11)), conferred most of the MHC associations. Three-dimension ribbon models showed that the former is located within the 132 domain of the HLA-DQ beta 1 molecule, and the latter lies in the alpha 1 domain of the HLA-B molecule, while both are involved in specific antigen presenting process. Finally, we summarized all significant signals in the MHC region to clarify their complex relationships, and 8.60% of phenotypic variance could be explained based on all reported variants in Han Chinese so far. Our findings highlight the complex genetic architecture of the MHC region for vitiligo in Han Chinese population and expand our understanding of the roles of HLA coding variants in the etiology of vitiligo.

AB SEIPIN is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, regulating adipocytes differentiation and lipolysis. Deficiency of Seipin in mice causes severe general lipodystrophy, accompanied by insulin resistance, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and steatohepatitis. In atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr null (Ldlr(-/-)) mice, lipodystrophy caused by Seipin deletion even led to severe hypercholesteremia and accelerated atherogenesis, when challenged with an atherogenic diet. However, whether the phenotypes observed in Seipin(-/-) (-)Ldlr(-/-) ice were a common consequence due to lipodystrophy, rather than genetic background restricted or diet dependent, was unknown. Herein we explored the lipodystrophy-related dyslipidemia, steatohepatitis and atherogenesis in another atherosclerosis-prone murine model, apolipoprotein E null (apoE(-/-)) mice. Besides, we also compared phenotypes between sexes in apoE(-/-) mice with Seipin deletion (Seipin(-/-) apoE(-/-)). We found that compared with apoE(-/-) controls, Seipin(-/-) apoE(-/-) ice also developed severe general lipodystrophy with hyperlipidemia, steatohepatitis and increased atherogenesis. Although the severity of adipose loss in female and male Seipin(-/-) apoE(-/-) mice were similar, hyperlipidemia, steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis were less severe in females than in males. Therefore, we demonstrated that lipodystrophy-related metabolic disorders, caused by Seipin deletion, were independent of genetic background and experimental diet, as seen in Ldlr(-/-) and apoE(-/-) mice. However, gender factor affected the disease progression, with females more resistant to developing lipodystrophy-related metabolic consequences.

AB Background: The polymorphic alleles of APOA5 (rs2266788 (C), rs3135506 (G)), LPA (rs10455872 (A), rs3798220 (G)) and 9p21.3 (rs1333049 (C), rs2383207(A)) have been reported in association with susceptibility of coronary artery disease (CAD) from genome wide association studies. We aimed to assess the association of genetic variants with coronary angiogram proven CAD, severity scored with modified Gensini score and association of risk for myocardial infraction (MI) in North Indian population.
   Methods: We recruited 512 angiographic proven CAD patients (mean age 58.1 +/- 10.2 years) and 272 controls (mean age 50.3 +/- 11.1 years) with normal coronaries from North Indian population. The genotyping technique polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was employed for rs2266788, rs3135506 and rs10455872. Amplified refractory mutation system-PCR (ARMS-PCR) was used for genotyping of rs1333049, rs2383207 and rs3798220 genetic variants.
   Results: The polymorphic risk allele of variants rs2266788 (C), rs1333049 (C), rs2383207 (A) and heterozygous polymorphic alleles of rs2266788 (TC) were significantly associated with CAD. The homozygous alleles of rs22667788 (CC) and rs1333049 (CC) had also been significantly associated with CAD. The significance of association of rs2266788 (C, CC, TC) and rs1333049 (C, CC) increases with severity of CAD. The presence of mutant allele of rs2266788 (C) was associated with risk of MI and unstable angina (UA). Also, homozygous risk allele of rs2266788 (CC) significantly associated with risk of MI and UA in patients of chronic stable angina (CSA) patients. Whereas, the risk allele of rs1333049 (C) have shown the association with MI and UA compared to controls. The genetic variants of rs3135506 (G), rs10455872 (A) and rs3798220 (G) have low frequency in our population and reflected no association with CAD.
   Conclusion: The polymorphic variants of Apo-A5; rs2266788 (C), 9p21.3; rs1333049 (C) rs2383207 (A) are associated with CAD, its severity and exerts the risk of MI in North Indian population.

AB Fork head box O (FOXO) transcription factor is a key player in an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The mammalian FOXO family consists of FOXO1, 3, 4 and 6, are highly similar in their structure, function and regulation. To maintain optimum body function, the organisms have developed complex mechanisms for homeostasis. Importantly, it is well known that when these mechanisms dysregulate it results in the development of age-related disease. FOXO proteins are involved in a diverse cellular function and also have clinical significance including cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, tumour suppression, DNA repair, longevity, diabetic complications, immunity, wound healing, regulation of metabolism and thus treatment of several types of diseases. By the combinations of post-translational modifications FOXO's serve as a 'molecular code' to sense external stimuli and recruit it as to specific regions of the genome and provide an integrated cellular response to changing physiological conditions. Akt/Protein kinase B a signaling pathway as a main regulator of FOXO to perform a diverse function in organisms. The present review summarizes the molecular and clinical aspects of FOXO transcription factor. And also elaborate the interaction of FOXO with the nucleosome remodelling complex to target genes, which is essential to cellular homeostasis.

AB The level of rescue of clock function in genetically arrhythmic Drosophila melanogaster hosts using interspecific clock gene transformation was used to study the putative intermolecular coevolution between interacting clock proteins. Among them PER and TIM are the two important negative regulators of the circadian clock feedback loop. We transformed either the D. pseudoobscura per or tim transgenes into the corresponding arrhythmic D. melanogaster mutant (per01 or tim01) and observed > 50% rhythmicity but the period of activity rhythm was either longer (D. pseudoobscura-per) or shorter than 24 h (D. pseudoobscura-tim) compared to controls. By introducing both transgenes simultaneously into double mutants, we observed that the period of the activity rhythm was rescued by the pair of hemizygous transgenes (similar to 24 h). These flies also showed a more optimal level of temperature compensation for the period. Under LD 12:12 these flies have a D. pseudoobscura like activity profile with the absence of morning anticipation as well as a very prominent earlier evening peak of activity rhythm. These observation are consistent with the view that TIM and PER form a heterospecific coevolved module at least for the circadian period of activity rhythms. However the strength of rhythmicity was reduced by having both transgenes present, so while evidence for a coevolution between PER and TIM is observed for some characters it is not for others.

TI Why France is making eight new vaccines mandatory
SO VACCINE

DE Compulsory vaccination; Vaccine hesitancy; Health democracy; Policy
AB France is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in the world. In an attempt to raise vaccination coverages, the French government made on January 1, 2018 eight more vaccines mandatory in addition to the three required until then. The process that led to this policy choice is of particular interest. We describe how vaccines became contentious in France and how French authorities came to view mandatory vaccination as the solution to the rise in vaccine hesitancy. In a bold move, French public health authorities turned to a new type of institutional device grounded in the ideal of democracy and public participation to political decision-making: "a citizen consultation". This consultation anchored the idea that legal coercion could be the solution to France's crisis with vaccines. Time will tell whether the French extension of mandatory vaccination will reduce tensions around vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Healthcare workers (HCWs) at an Australian cancer centre were evaluated using a voluntary declination form program to determine factors contributing to declination of annual influenza vaccination. Overall, 1835/2041 HCWs (89.9%) completed a consent or declination form; 1783 were vaccinated and 52 declined. Staff roles with minimal patient contact were significantly associated with lower vaccine uptake (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.99). Reasons for vaccine refusal included personal choice (41%), previous side-effects (23.1%), and medical reasons (23.1%). Of these, a large proportion may not be amenable to intervention, and this must be considered in setting threshold targets for future campaigns. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is caused by nervous necrosis viruses (NNVs) belonging to genus Betanodavirus (Nodaviridae). It is one of the most serious diseases in aquaculture industry worldwide. In the present study, the kinetics of NNV-infectivity and NNV-specific antibodies in convalescent seven band grouper Hyporthodus septemfasciatus after NNV infection was determined. When fish were infected with NNV at 17.5 degrees C, and reared for 84 days at natural seawater temperature (increasing rate: approximately 0.1 degrees C/day), NNV infectivity peaked on day 14 with 10(7.80) TCID50/g at the highest, and declined to below the detection limit. When convalescent fish were reared at 27 degrees C, and re-infected with NNV at 10(4.3) or 10(6.3) TCID50/fish, no mortality was observed although NNV multiplied up to 10(8.80) and 10(7.80) TCID50/g at the highest, respectively, suggesting NNV-specific immune response. It also revealed that convalescent fish were re-infected by NNV although NNV multiplication was strongly regulated. Interestingly, NNV-specific antibodies were detectable in 20% and >= 80% of convalescent fish before and after re-infection with NNV, respectively. However, no NNV-neutralizing activity was detected before and after re-infection in almost all of the convalescent fish. Therefore, NNV-neutralizing antibodies might not be necessary for the protection of convalescent fish against NNV re-infection after previous NNV infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 2015, outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Middle East were discovered to be caused by a viral lineage (A/ASIA/G-VII), which has recently emerged from the Indian sub-continent. In vitro vaccine matching data generated by the World Reference Laboratory (WRLFMD) indicated that A/ASIA/G-VII field viruses were poorly matched with vaccines (A-SAU-95, A22 IRQ and A-IRN-05) that are already used in the region. In order to assess the likely performance of one of these commercially available FMD vaccines, sixteen cattle were vaccinated with a polyvalent vaccine which contained two serotype A components (A-SAU-95 and A-IRN-05) with a homologous potency of at least 6PD(50), and two cattle were left unvaccinated as controls. Twenty-one days later, all 18 cattle were challenged by tongue inoculation with an FMDV field isolate A/IRN/22/2015 from the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage, in line with the European Pharmacopeia PPG test conditions. The two control animals developed generalised FMD, and 7/16 vaccinated animals developed at least one foot lesion, thus only 56.3% were defined as protected. For the vaccine components, there was a significant increase in the probability of protection with increasing serological titres for A-SAU-95 (p = 0.03), but not for A-IRN-05 (p = 0.42). Analysis of FMDV in blood and nasal swabs suggested that vaccination reduced shedding and potential onward spread of FMD virus even if the animal developed foot lesions. In summary, the results from this study suggest that whilst this vaccine would not be appropriate for use in an emergency situation (in previously FMD-free countries), it may be partially effective in the field in endemic countries where repeat prophylactic vaccination is practiced. For emergency reactive vaccination, the findings from this study support the idea that a new vaccine strain should be developed that is tailored to the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage.

AB In 2017, Minnesota battled its largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years, with 79 cases, most of them Somali-American children. In this study, we gathered vaccination and enrollment data for incoming kindergarteners in Minnesota over fall 2012-2016 from the Minnesota Department of Health. We also gathered the number of measles cases by county in 2017. We found that MMR coverage has substantial variation across districts and district types. The minimum MMR coverage is 58.3% and the maximum is 100%. Private schools, which represent approximately six percent of Minnesota's kindergarten enrollment, have a substantially lower coverage rate, with an overall coverage of 83.00%. The 2017 outbreak was relatively isolated. However, the MMR coverage data suggests that other communities could have been at risk given their geographic proximity to the outbreak and modest coverage rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) still remains as an unmet global threat. The current vaccine is not fully effective and novel alternatives are needed. Here, two vaccine candidate strains derived from BCG carrying deletions in the BCG1416c or BCG1419c genes were analysed for their capacity to modulate the cytoldne/chemokine profile and granuloma formation in a human lung tissue model (LTM). We show that the clustering of monocytes, reminiscent of early granuloma formation, in LTMs infected with BCG strains was similar for all of them. However, BCG Delta BCG1419c, like M. tuberculosis, was capable of inducing the production of IL-6 in contrast to the other BCG strains. This work suggests that LTM could be a useful ex vivo assay to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of novel TB vaccine candidates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation of the full disease burden caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is challenging due to the difficulties in assigning the aetiology especially in lower and upper respiratory infections. We estimated the pneumococcal disease burden by using the vaccine-preventable disease incidence (VPDI) of PHiD-CV10 vaccine (GSK) in our clinical trial setting.
   Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) trial was a cluster-randomized, double-blind trial in children <19 months who received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis BSA vaccine as control in 26 clusters according to 3+1 or 2+1 schedules (infants < 7 months) or catch-up schedules (children 7-18 months). Outcome data were collected using Finnish routine health-care registers, consisting of THL National Infectious Diseases Register, THL Care register, and Benefits Register of Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Blinded follow-up lasted from the date of first vaccination (trial enrolment Feb-2009 through Aug-2010) to January 31, 2012 for Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) and to end of December 2011 for four other outcomes: non-laboratory-confirmed IPD, hospital-diagnosed pneumonia, tympanostomy tube placements, and antimicrobial purchases. VPDI was estimated as difference in disease incidences between PHiD-CV10 clusters and control clusters.
   Altogether >47,000 children were enrolled. In 30,527 vaccinated infants <7 months at first dose, the VPDIs per 100,000 person-years were 75 for laboratory-confirmed IPD, 210 for non-laboratory confirmed IPD, 271 for hospital-diagnosed pneumonia, 1143 for any tympanostomy tube placements and 11,381 for antimicrobial outpatient prescription, mainly due to otitis media.
   In a European developed-country setting, over 95% of the disease episode reductions in vaccinated children were seen in mild upper respiratory infections. The VPDIs of severe diseases are underestimated, because the majority of invasive disease goes undetected with routine blood-culture-based definitions. Evaluation of the absolute reduction achievable with vaccinations using sensitive case detection is essential for understanding the full disease burden, for valid cost-effectiveness analyses and for appropriate vaccination policy decisions.

AB Purpose: The aims of this study are to evaluate the impact of a novel immunization curriculum based on the Preferred Cognitive Styles and Decision Making Model (PCSDM) on internal medicine (IM) resident continuity clinic patient panel immunization rates, as well as resident immunization knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP).
   Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed among 143 IM residents at Mayo Clinic to evaluate the PCSDM curriculum plus fact-based immunization curriculum (intervention) compared to fact-based immunization curriculum alone (control) on the outcomes of resident continuity clinic patient panel immunization rates for influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus, pertussis, and zoster vaccines. Pre-study and post-study immunization KAP surveys were administered to IM residents.
   Results: Ninety-nine residents participated in the study. Eighty-two residents completed pre-study and post-study surveys. Influenza and pertussis immunization rates improved for both intervention and control groups. There was no significant difference in immunization rate improvement between the groups. Influenza immunization rates improved significantly by 33.4% and 32.3% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The odds of receiving influenza immunization at the end of the study relative to pre-study for the entire study cohort was 4.6 (p < 0.0001). The odds of having received pertussis immunization at the end of the study relative to pre-study for the entire study cohort was 1.2 (p = 0.0002). Both groups had significant improvements in immunization knowledge. The intervention group had significant improvements in multiple domains that assessed confidence in counseling patients on immunizations.
   Conclusions: Fact-based immunization education was useful in improving IM resident immunization rates for influenza and pertussis. The PCSDM immunization curriculum did not lead to increases in immunization rates compared with the fact-based curriculum, but it did significantly increase resident confidence in communicating with patients about vaccines.

AB We inactivated a virulence determinant, ArcA, in an Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae quadruple deletion mutant SLW06 (Delta apxIC Delta apxIIC Delta orf1 Delta cpxAR, serovar 1), and a quintuple deletion mutant SLW07 was generated. SLW07 showed decreased adherence to and invasion of host cells, compared to its parent strain SLW06. SLW07 was more sensitive in RAW264.7 macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and clearance. SLW07 was less virulent in mice. An immunization assay indicated that both SLW07 and SLW06 preferentially stimulated T helper cell type 2 response in mice. Live vaccines induced the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by splenic lymphocytes. Furthermore, the protective immunity of SLW07 was not affected after ArcA mutation. Immunization with SLW07 could provide a complete protection following virulent A. pleuropneumoniae challenge in mice. Our results suggest that SLW07 is a promising live vaccine candidate, which is further attenuated from and shares similar protective efficacy with its quadruple deletion parent SLW06.

AB An anti-Brucella vaccine candidate comprising rough Salmonella vector delivering Brucella antigens was developed. This system provides a platform for live Brucella-free vaccine development as it can mimic active-intracellular infection of Brucella organism. Exploiting this phenomenon thus provides significant protection at a single dose and also re-assured the safety. To date, no human anti-Brucella vaccines are available, owing to the lack of safe and effective formulation. This study investigated the safety of the vaccine formulation in mice model and in vitro human cell cultures. The experiment was designed to determine the LD50 of the vaccine formulation. The vaccine formulation did not induce any mortality even when mice were administered at 8 x 10(9) CFU per oral or per subcutaneous (SC), which was 100-times more than the actual vaccine dose intended for mice model. In contrast, wild-type (WT) Salmonella positive control strain induced 100% mortality at 8 x 10(7) CFU per mice via oral or SC routes. Interaction of the vaccine with phagocytic (THP-1 derived macrophage) and non-phagocytic (Caco-2) human cell lines as well as human PBMC was investigated. In in vitro experiments, inflammatory and pyretic cytokines TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta inductions were significantly lower in vaccine group as compared to WT group. Further, apoptosis, nitric oxide synthase and cytotoxicity inductions were comparable and not exacerbated, given that the strain is based on a rough bacterial vector that may have endotoxic lipid-A more readily exposed. These findings corroborated that the vaccine formulation is highly safe in mice model and is relatively mild in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and cellular changes in human cell lines.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) has caused multiple global outbreaks with increased frequency of neuroinvasive disease in recent years. Despite many years of research, there are no licensed therapeutics or vaccines available for human use. One of the major impediments of vaccine development against WNV is the potential enhancement of infection by related flaviviruses in vaccinated subjects through the mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). For instance, the recent finding of enhancement of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection by pre-exposure to WNV further complicates the development of WNV vaccines. Epidemics of WNV and the potential risk of ADE by current vaccine candidates demand the development of effective and safe vaccines. We have previously reported that the domain Ill (DIII) of the WNV envelope protein can be readily expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, purified to homogeneity, and promote antigen-specific antibody response in mice. Herein, we further investigated the in vivo potency of a plant-made DIII (plant-Dill) in providing protective immunity against WNV infection. Furthermore, we examined if vaccination with plant-Dill would enhance the risk of a subsequent infection by ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV). Plant-DIII vaccination evoked antigen-specific cellular immune responses as well as humoral responses. Dill-specific antibodies were neutralizing and the neutralization titers met the threshold correlated with protective immunity by vaccines against multiple flaviviruses. Furthermore, passive administration of anti-plant Dill mouse serum provided full protection against a lethal challenge of WNV infection in mice. Notably, plant Dill-induced antibodies did not enhance ZIKV and DENV infection in Fc gamma receptor-expressing cells, addressing the concern of WNV vaccines in inducing cross-reactive antibodies and sensitizing subjects to subsequent infection by heterologous flavivirus. This study provides the first report of a WNV subunit vaccine that induces protective immunity, while circumventing induction of antibodies with enhancing activity for ZIKV and DENV infection.

AB Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected at least 2040 patients and caused 712 deaths since its first appearance in 2012, yet neither pathogen-specific therapeutics nor approved vaccines are available. To address this need, we are developing a subunit recombinant protein vaccine comprising residues 377-588 of the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which, when formulated with the AddaVax adjuvant, it induces a significant neutralizing antibody response and protection against MERS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To prepare for the manufacture and first-in-human testing of the vaccine, we have developed a process to stably produce the recombinant MERS S377-588 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To accomplish this, we transfected an adherent dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cell line (adCHO) with a plasmid encoding S377-588 fused with the human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc). We then demonstrated the interleukin-2 signal peptide-directed secretion of the recombinant protein into extracellular milieu. Using a gradually increasing methotrexate (MTX) concentration to 5 mu M, we increased protein yield by a factor of 40. The adCHO-expressed S377-588-Fc recombinant protein demonstrated functionality and binding specificity identical to those of the protein from transiently transfected HEK293T cells. In addition, hCD26/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice vaccinated with AddaVax-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc could produce neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and survived for at least 21 days after challenge with live MERS-CoV with no evidence of immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement. To prepare for large scale-manufacture of the vaccine antigen, we have further developed a high-yield monoclonal suspension CHO cell line. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The continued detection of zoonotic influenza infections, most notably due to the avian influenza A H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes, underscores the need for pandemic preparedness. Decades of experience with live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) for the control of seasonal influenza support the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine platform. All LAW candidates are derived from one of two licensed master donor viruses (MDVs), cold-adapted (co) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 or ca A/Leningrad/134/17/57. A number of LAIV candidates targeting avian H5 influenza viruses derived with each MDV have been evaluated in humans, but have differed in their infectivity and immunogenicity. To understand these differences, we generated four H5N2 candidate pandemic LAIVs (pLAIVs) derived from either MDV and compared their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that all candidate pLAIVs, regardless of gene constellation and derivation, were comparable with respect to infectivity, immunogenicity, and protection from challenge in the ferret model of influenza. These observations suggest that differences in clinical performance of H5 pLAIVs may be due to factors other than inherent biological properties of the two MDVs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which is a considerable economic threat to the poultry industry. QX-like IBV strains have increasingly emerged in China in recent years. Hence, development of a specific vaccine to guard against their potential threat is important. In this study, we sought to develop an attenuated vaccine strain. First, attenuated QX-like IBV strain SZ130 was created by continuous passage in chicken embryos for 130 generations, and then its safety was tested. We also evaluated the protective efficacy of different doses of SZ130 against challenge with QX-like IBV field strain SD in chickens. SZ130-infected birds did not experience IB-like signs and organ lesions. Additionally, an excellent protective effect of SZ130 vaccination was observed when vaccinated birds were challenged with SD, with no clinical signs or gross lesions, decreased target tissue replication rates, and lower ciliostasis scores in all immunized groups. These findings indicate that attenuated IBV strain SZ130 is highly safe in chicks and may serve as an effective vaccine against the threat posed by QX-like IBV strains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effectiveness of maternal pertussis vaccination in preventing infection
   and disease in infants: The NSW Public Health Network case-control study
SO VACCINE

ID TRANSMISSION; SEVERITY; VACCINES; MODEL; TDAP
AB Background: Infants are at the highest risk of severe complications - including death - as a result of pertussis infection. Controlling pertussis in this group has been challenging, particularly in those too young to be vaccinated. Following revised national recommendations in March 2015, the state of New South Wales, Australia, introduced a funded maternal vaccination campaign at 28 - 32 weeks of gestation using a 3-component tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa; Boostrix, GSK). This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of maternal vaccination and add to the growing body of evidence for this strategy.
   Methods: A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted between 16 August 2015 and 17 August 2016. Cases were laboratory or doctor notified, laboratory confirmed (nucleic acid testing or culture) and aged <6 months at onset. Each control infant was randomly selected from public hospital births in the same geographical area in the period up to 3 days before and after the case's birthdate. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 - OR.
   Findings: In total, 117 cases and 117 controls were recruited. The overall VE estimate was non significantly protective for infants <6 months old (VE 39%, 95% CI - 12 to 66%). Higher VE was observed for infants <3 months old (VE 69%, 95% CI 13-89%) and against hospitalisation (VE 94%, 95% CI 59-99%).
   Interpretation: Maternal pertussis vaccination with a 3-component acellular vaccine was found to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in infants, but was less effective at preventing disease which did not require hospitalisation. The overall VE reported in this study was lower than in prior studies and suggests that maternal vaccination, while an effective strategy at preventing severe pertussis, is less effective at protecting against infection or mild disease.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in cystic fibrosis patients. Its eradication is difficult due to a wide phenotypic adaptability and an increase of its resistance to antibiotics. After the failure of several recombinant vaccines which mainly triggered humoral response, live-attenuated vaccines received attention thanks to their ability to elicit a broad immunity with both humoral- and cell-mediated responses, essential to fight this pathogen. In this study, we developed an innovative and safer live-attenuated Pa vaccine based on a Killed But Metabolically Active (KBMA) attenuation method. KBMA Pa has been further rationally designed to overexpress beneficial effectors like the type 3 secretion system apparatus. We demonstrated that KBMA Pa elicits a high and broad humoral response in mice against several antigens of particular interest such as OprF and PcrV proteins. Moreover, we assessed cytokines in the serum of immunized mice and showed that KBMA Pa elicits Th1, Th2 and especially Th17 pathways of cell-mediated immune responses. Th17 pathway involvement was also confirmed after specific stimulation of helper T cells in immunized mice. Finally, we showed that this vaccine is safe and has a protective effect in a murine acute pulmonary infectious challenge. In conclusion, KBMA Pa is a new platform with high potential for the development of a vaccine against Pa. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of 1 and 2 doses of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroup A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-IT) given alone or co administered with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in toddlers.
   Methods: In this phase III, open-label, controlled, multicentre study (NCT01939158), healthy toddlers aged 12-14 months were randomised into 4 groups to receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at month (M) 0 (ACWY_1), 2 doses of MenACWY-TT at MO and M2 (ACWY_2), MenACWY-TT and PCV13 at MO (Co-ad), or PCV13 at MO and MenACWY-TT at M2 (PCV13/ACWY). Immune responses were assessed 1 month post-each vaccination. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms were recorded for 4 and 31 days post-each vaccination, respectively; serious adverse events (SAEs) and new onset of chronic illnesses (NOCIs) up to M9 from first vaccination.
   Results: 802 toddlers were vaccinated. Post-dose 1 of MenACWY-TT, >= 92.8% of toddlers had rSBA titres >= 1:8, and >= 62.5% had hSBA titres >= 1:4 for each meningococcal serogroup. Post-dose 2 of MenACWY-TT, rSBA titres >= 1:8 were observed in >= 98.0% and hSBA titres >= 1:4 in >= 95.3% of toddlers. Percentages of toddlers with hSBA titres >= 1:4 were higher after 2 doses versus 1 dose of MenACWY-TT for MenW (97.1% versus 62.5-68.9%) and MenY (95.3% versus 64.3-67.6%). Non-inferiority of immune responses to co-administered MenACWY-TT and PCV13 over their separate administration was demonstrated. AEs incidence was comparable among groups. SAEs were reported for 4.9%, 5.1%, 5.5% and 7.5%, and NOCIs for 2.0%, 3.0%, 0.5% and 3.5% of toddlers in the ACWY_1, ACWY_2, Co-ad and PCV13/ACWY groups, respectively; 4 SAEs reported in 3 toddlers were vaccine-related. Two fatal vaccine-unrelated SAEs were reported.
   Conclusion: MenACWY-TT was immunogenic when administered as a single dose at 12-14 months of age. A second dose in toddlers increased hSBA responses against MenW and MenY. MenACWY-TT and PCV13 can be co-administered without impairing the immunogenicity or safety profile of either vaccine. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol free base loaded pellet starter cores were coated with Eudragit RS, plasticized with 25% triethyl citrate (TEC). The initial drug loading and coating level were varied from 10 to 40 and 0 to 20%, respectively. Drug release was measured in 0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The water uptake and swelling kinetics, mechanical properties and TEC leaching of/from coated pellets and/or thin, free films of identical composition as the film coatings were monitored. The following unusual tendencies were observed: (i) the relative drug release rate from coated pellets increased with increasing initial drug content, and (ii) drug release from pellets was much faster for metoprolol free base compared to metoprolol tartrate, despite its much lower solubility (factor > 70). These phenomena could be explained by plasticizing effects of the drug for the polymeric film coatings. In particular: 1) Metoprolol free base is a much more potent plasticizer for Eudragit RS than the tartrate, leading to higher film permeability and overcompensating the pronounced differences in drug solubility. Also, Raman imaging revealed that substantial amounts of the free base migrated into the film coatings, whereas this was not the case for the tartrate. 2) The plasticizing effects of the drug for the film coating overcompensated potential increasing limited solubility effects when increasing the initial drug loading from 10 to 40%. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates how important the plasticization of polymeric controlled release film coatings by drugs can be, leading to unexpected formulation effects.

AB DB213 is an HIV-1 replication inhibitor targeting the Central Nervous System for the treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Current study aims to develop an in situ thermosensitive gelling system for intranasal delivery of DB213 facilitated by Statistical Design of Experiment (DoE) to conduct a more efficient experimentation by extracting the maximum amount of information from limited experiments. In our current study, information was extracted from twenty-five experimental designs from MODDE (R) Software and a mathematical model was successfully developed to predict formulations to achieve desired performance as well as to analyze relationships between the amount of Pluronic F-127, Pluronic F-68, Chitosan, DB213 and the performances of in situ thermosensitive gels. Based on DoE, in situ thermosensitive gels of 1% DB213 (F1) and 5% DB213 (F2) were developed for further in vivo bioavailability and brain uptake evaluations in Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. In comparison to DB213 water solution, intranasal administrations of F1 at 1 mg/kg in rats and F2 at 25 mg/kg in mice demonstrated relative bioavailabilities of 145% and 165% with significant increase in brain uptake.

AB Baicalin is a multi-purpose flavonoid used in the treatment of different ocular diseases. Owing to its poor stability in basic pH and its poor solubility, a suitable carrier system is needed to enhance its ocular therapeutic potential. Therefore, the objective of this work was to prepare and contrast different baicalin vesicular systems; namely liposomes, penetration enhancer vesicles PEVs and transfersomes. Results revealed that baicalin vesicles exhibited suitable particle size and zeta potential, high entrapment efficiency and controlled release. Depending on the vesicular composition, selected formulations were able to resist physical changes of particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release after storage for 3 months, while retarding the degradation of baicalin. Selected vesicular formulations displayed equivalent or superior antioxidant potential compared to baicalin solution, with absolute superiority over ascorbic acid reference, while demonstrating sterilization endurance and safety on ocular tissues. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that transfersomes displayed the fastest onset of action, while liposomes displayed the highest extent of absorption as concluded from the T-max, C-max, and AUC(0-infinity) values with 4-5 folds increase in bioavailability compared to baicalin control solution. This delineates baicalin vesicular systems as a promising platform for treatment of ocular diseases such as inflammation, cataract and diabetic retinopathy.

AB Orodispersible films (ODF) have clinical potential as extemporaneous pharmacy preparations for individualized pharmacotherapy. However, the conventional method of ODF preparation using a film applicator may limit its application, due to content uniformity challenges arising from viscosity changes of the casting solution and varied operator manipulation. This study proposes the unit-dose (UD) plate as an alternative to the film applicator for compounding individual ODFs. Using a design-of-experiments approach, we developed an extemporaneous ODF formulation for an antiemetic drug, ondansetron hydrochloride dihydrate (OND), at a clinically relevant dose. ODFs cast with the UD plate showed excellent content uniformity independent of the viscosity of the casting solution and drug concentration. Formulations were evaluated for performance with respect to patient acceptability and product quality. The effects of critical process parameters on critical quality attributes of the ODF were studied. HPMC concentration and volume of casting solution were the main factors affecting disintegration time and mechanical properties of the film, while drug concentration had no significant effect. However, further studies incorporating different drugs in larger concentration ranges are needed to investigate the impact of drug concentration and to establish a design space. Nevertheless, our results indicate the potential of using the UD plate to prepare ODFs with customized drug doses from a generic casting solution. Results from this study provide a framework for an extemporaneous ODF platform.

   FORMULATION; STABILITY
AB Recently, a continuous freeze-drying process for the production of unit doses was presented and evaluated. In this concept, the freezing step is modified compared to traditional batch freeze-drying, as glass vials filled with a liquid formulation, are rotated around their longitudinal axis while cooled and frozen with a cold, sterile and inert gas (i.e. spin freezing). Finally, a thin frozen product layer spread over the entire vial wall is achieved. The aim of this paper is twofold: firstly, the relation between the rotation velocity and the relative difference between top and bottom of the frozen product layer thickness was determined for different vial types. Secondly, the impact of shear and centrifugal forces generated during spinning was examined, to find out whether they might cause pharmaceutical instability and sedimentation, respectively. Mechanistic and experimental evaluation showed that shear has no effect on proteins. Calculations showed that the sedimentation and diffusion velocity is too low to cause inhomogeneity in the product layer. In addition, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and Uncertainty Analysis (UA) were performed in order to account for the uncertainty of the used mechanistic model.

AB Surfactant-based intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs) are constituents of several oral macromolecule formulations in clinical trials. This study examined the interaction of a test panel of surfactant-based PEs with isolated rat colonic mucosae mounted in Ussing chambers in an attempt to determine if increases in transepithelial permeability can be separated from induction of mucosal perturbation. The aim was to assess the effects of PEs on (i) apparent permeability coefficient (P-app) of [C-14]-mannitol (ii) histology score and (iii) short-circuit current (Delta I-sc) responses to a cholinomimetic (carbachol, CCh). Enhancement ratio increases for P-app values followed the order: C-10 > C-9 = C-11:1 > a bile salt blend > sodium choleate > sucrose laurate > Labrasol (R) > C12E8 > C-12 > Cremophor (R) A25 > C-7 > sucrose stearate > Kolliphor (R) HS15 > Kolliphor (R) TPGS. Exposures that increased the P-app by >= 2-fold over 120 min were accompanied by histological damage in 94% of tissues, and by a decreased Delta I-sc response to CCh in 83%. A degree of separation between the increased P-app of [C-14]-mannitol and histological damage and diminution of the Delta I-sc response to CCh was observed at selected concentrations of Labrasol (R). Overall, this surfactant-based PE selection caused transcellular perturbation at similar concentrations to those that enhanced permeability.

AB An innovative approach to improve drug delivery is the use of glycerol monooleate nanoparticles. Numerous studies describe their high versatility, low toxicity and ability to carry relatively high loads of conjugated compounds including scarcely soluble ones, providing sustained drug release and increasing drug diffusion and half-life. Despite a growing interest in their potential use for therapeutic applications, there are surprisingly few literature data concerning the toxic effects of these nanoparticles at high concentrations in vitro and in vivo, and their effects on cell metabolism. We produced and characterized from a physical-chemical point of view glycerol monooleate nanoparticles and tested them on the PC12 cell line, a rat model of neuronal differentiation. The toxicity of these nanoparticles was evaluated by molecular methods on cell viability, cell cycle, nanoparticle uptake and induction of apoptosis. The results showed that glycerol monooleate nanoparticles up to 100 mu g/mL had no toxic effects on PC12 cells, did not induce significant changes in the cell cycle nor cause apoptosis. The nanoparticles entered PC12 cells 8 h after treatment, successfully delivering the conjugate compound inside cells. Overall, glycerol monooleate nanoparticles did not exhibit significant toxicity on PC12 cell line in concentrations up to 100 mu g/mL, supporting their therapeutic use as drug delivery systems.

AB The relationships between the physicochemical properties of milled starch and drug release from tablets were investigated quantitatively using a drug release kinetic method and X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The samples were prepared from raw beta-starch by milling in a planetary ball mill. The tablets, containing 5% theophylline (TH), 94% milled starch, and 1% magnesium stearate, were compressed at 6 kN. The drug-release and gel-forming processes were measured simultaneously using an original dissolution tester with an XCT instrument. Drug release from the tablet was delayed with increasing milling time, because the TH tablet formed a typical gel-layer on the outside of the tablet. The relationship between the crystallinity of milled starch and mean drug release time (MDT) for the TH tablets showed almost a straight inverse proportional relationship. The plots of MDT against area under the curve of the swelling ratio profiles of the TH tablets had a good straight line.

AB Synthetic membranes that are utilized in diffusion studies for topical and transdermal formulations are usually porous thin polymeric sheets for example cellulose acetate (CA) and polysulfones. In this study, the permeability of human skin was compared using two synthetic membranes: cellulose acetate and Strat-M (R) membrane and lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds either as saturated or formulated solutions as well as marketed dosage forms. Our data suggests that hydrophilic compounds have higher permeation in Strat-M membranes compared with lipophilic ones. High variation in permeability values, a typical property of biological membranes, was not observed with Strat-M. In addition, the permeability of Strat-M was closer to that of human skin than that of cellulose acetate (CA > Strat-M > Human skin). Our results suggest that Strat-M with little or no lot to lot variability can be applied in pilot studies of diffusion tests instead of human skin and is a better substitute than a cellulose acetate.

AB Phenytoin sodium (PS) has a tendency to convert to its base form; phenytoin base (PHT) during manufacturing, packaging, shelf life and in-use conditions that can influence its clinical performance. The objective of the present work was to develop a non-destructive, quick and easy analytical method for quantification of PHT in the drug product. A formulation was prepared to contain the excipients of commercial capsule formulation of PS. The formulation containing either 100% PHT or PS was prepared and these formulations were mixed in different proportion to achieve 0-100% PHT matrices. FTIR, NIR and Raman spectra of samples were collected. Data were truncated and mathematically pretreated before development of partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) regressions model. The models were assessed by slope, intercept, R, R-2, root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error (SEP). The models exhibited good linearity over the selected range of PHT in the formulations with low error as indicated by slope that was close to one and small values of intercept, RMSE and SE. The models of NIR based data were more accurate and precise than Raman data based models as indicated by the low values of RMSE and SE. Prediction accuracy of independent samples containing 25% PHT using NIR models were similar to Raman models. On the other hand, the prediction was more precise for the independent sample containing 5% PHT using NIR data based models compared to Raman data based models as indicated by standard deviation. In conclusion, chemometric models based on NIR and Raman spectroscopies provides a fast and easy way to monitor the disproportionation of PS in the drug products.

AB Vaginal rings are gynecological drug delivery devices with fixed shapes, sizes and drug doses. Here 3D printed personalized progesterone-loaded vaginal rings were prepared. Progesterone was mixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 to form a solid dispersion that was cut into pieces. The mixture of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/polycaprolactone (PCL) (8:2) and Tween 80 were mixed with the above pieces and hot-melted to form filaments. A fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer was used to prepare "O", "Y" or "M"-shaped vaginal rings with the filaments. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction showed that amorphous progesterone existed in the rings. Moreover, progesterone did not decompose in the preparation according to the thermal gravimetric analysis. Surface pores and inner channels appeared in the rings due to PEG 4000 dissolution and Tween 80 made the rings wettable. The "O" ring had higher dissolution than the "Y" and "M" rings due to its higher surface area/volume ratio and special shape. The vaginal rings showed the long-term sustained release of progesterone for more than 7 days with diffusion-controlled release behavior. The 3D printed vaginal rings are promising local gynecological medications. 3D printing is an effective strategy for preparation of personalized and customized medications.

AB The aim of the study was to optimize a tablet coating process for a continuous manufacturing line. High throughputs should be achieved while inter-tablet coating variability should be as small as possible. Drug-free cores were coated with a colored suspension. All processes were monitored in-line with Raman spectroscopy. A statistical design of experiment was performed to find optimum process parameters. Tablet loading, spray rate and drum rotation speed were studied. Image analysis was performed using a computer scanner. Tablet hue and saturation were evaluated to obtain information about the inter-tablet color variabilities and the numbers of outliers. Low variabilities could be achieved using low spray rates and high rotation speeds and they were independent from the tablet batch sizes in the studied factor space. For the prediction of the coating thickness, univariate analysis was compared to PLS-regression. Calibration models were built based on the three center points of the statistical design of experiment resulting in RMSEC of 1.07% of sprayed suspension with R-2 of 0.9989 and Q(2) of 0.9987. Model prediction was possible independent from loading, spray rate and drum rotation speed. The experiment with lowest color variability was conducted with a desired throughput rate of 25 kg/h and with a RMSEP of 2.5%.

AB Cancer is an abnormal condition leading to uncontrolled cell division which causes damage to the body tissues. Around 100 types of cancer are studied so far namely breast cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer and lymphoma. Major cancer therapies include chemotherapy, surgery and radiations but their major drawbacks are non-specifically distributed antitumor agents, uneven delivery of drug concentration to the tumour and low monitoring. Nanoparticles (NPs) are the newly trending field of nanomedicine implied in cancer therapy. The structural characteristics of NPs makes them excellent mode for targeting and penetrating the abnormal cell growth caused by cancer. They can potentially enter the abnormal cells causing DNA damage and determine the defects in the genes. Apart from targeting cancer cells they also aid in drug delivery, imaging of abnormal cells, release and monitoring of therapeutic agents against cancer. The present review deals with the inorganic NPs mediated pharmacotherapy, potential strategies for developing drug delivery system, evaluate the merits and demerits of traditional chemotherapy and nanotherapy for significantly improving the treatment of cancers.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics of a mini vessel and a USP 2 dissolution testing system were obtained and compared to predict the tablet-liquid mass transfer coefficient from velocity distributions near the tablet and establish the dynamic operating conditions under which dissolution in mini vessels could be conducted to generate concentration profiles similar to those in the USP 2. Velocity profiles were obtained experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to predict the velocity distribution and strain rate around a model tablet. A CFD-based mass transfer model was also developed. When plotted against strain rate, the predicted tablet-liquid mass transfer coefficient was found to be independent of the system where it was obtained, implying that a tablet would dissolve at the same rate in both systems provided that the concentration gradient between the tablet surface and the bulk is the same, the tablet surface area per unit liquid volume is identical, and the two systems are operated at the appropriate agitation speeds specified in this work. The results of this work will help dissolution scientists operate mini vessels so as to predict the dissolution profiles in the USP 2, especially during the early stages of drug development.

AB The compression physics of powders must be considered when developing a suitable tablet formulation. In the present study, the gravitation-based high-velocity method was utilized to analyze mechanical properties of eight common pharmaceutical excipients: two grades of lactose, anhydrous glucose, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, three grades of microcrystalline cellulose and starch. Samples were compressed five times consecutively with varying pressure and speed so that Setup A produced higher pressure and longer contact time than Setup B. The important parameters obtained from samples were porosity profiles, compaction pressure, contact time, internal energy change and the amount of elastic recovery. All acquired data was only based on distance-time profile of the compression event. Lactose and glucose fragmented effectively while calcium hydrogen phosphate remained in rearrangement phase, due to its hardness and insufficient pressure applied. Microcrystalline cellulose samples showed plastic behaviour and starch was most elastic of all the samples. By utilizing the method, examined excipients could be categorized according to their compression behaviour in an accurate and cost-efficient manner.

AB Melanoma is an incurable disease for which alternative treatments to chemotherapy alone are sought. Here, using a melanoma model, we investigated the antitumor potential of combining ultrasound (US) with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). The aim was to achieve synergistic tumoricidal activity through direct and indirect US-mediated damage of tumor cells combined with sustained and potentially controllable release (when combined with US) of DOX from microspheres. An in vitro release assay demonstrated an ability of US to affect the release kinetics of DOX from DOX-loaded PLGA microspheres by inducing a 12% increase in the rate of release. In vitro viability assays demonstrated that combining US with DOX-loaded PLGA microspheres resulted in synergistic tumor cell (B16-F10 melanoma cells) killing. Melanoma-bearing mice were treated intratumorally with DOX (8 mu g)-loaded microspheres and subjected to US treatment at the tumor site. This treatment could significantly extend survival (mean survival (MS) = 22.1 days) compared to untreated mice (MS = 10.4 days) and most other treatments, such as blank microspheres plus US (MS = 11.5 days) and DOX (8 mu g)-loaded microspheres alone (MS = 13 days). The findings that immune checkpoint blockade did not significantly extend survival of mice treated with DOX (8 mu g)-loaded microspheres plus US, and that tumor-free ("cured") mice were not protected from subsequent tumor re-challenge suggests minimal involvement of the adaptive immune response in the observed antitumor activity. Nevertheless, the synergistic increase in survival of melanoma-challenged mice treated with the combination of US and DOX-loaded microspheres implicates such a treatment methodology as a promising additional tool for combatting otherwise currently incurable cancers.

AB Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) have been used as a formulation strategy to overcome the challenges in formulating poorly water soluble drugs. The objective of the present study was to report on the solubilizing capacity of sulforaphane (SFN) and its utilization to formulate SEDDS of poorly water soluble drugs. A set of 24 drugs was tested for their solubility in SFN of which Cyclosporine A, Celecoxib, Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, and Curcumin were selected for subsequent SEDDS formulation development utilizing SFN as common solubilizer. SFN-SEDDS formulations were developed utilizing a step-wise screening method that enabled the selection of the most efficient surfactants and co-surfactants to yield transparent microemulsions by microscopic analysis and absorbance data. The optimized SEDDS formulation for curcumin was selected for further investigation by DSC and FTIR, and was subjected to a dissolution study where more than 95% of the drug was found to dissolve within 10 min in both simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The physical stability of the SEDDS was also confirmed in both media when monitored at three different temperatures (4, 25 and 37 degrees C) up to 30 days. This study introduced a new approach to formulating SEDDS by utilizing the solubilizing capacity of SFN and introduced high throughput screening approach to formulation development and stability study.

As a preliminary demonstration to mitigate all these challenges, at MIT we have developed active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing in a miniature platform. However, manufacturing of final oral solid dosage as tablets from drug substances had not been demonstrated. In this study, a compact, portable, re-configurable, and automated tablet manufacturing system, roughly the size of a North American household oven, [72.4 cm (length) x 53.3 cm (width) x 134.6 cm (height)] was designed, built and demonstrated. This miniature system is able to manufacture on-demand tablets from drug crystals on a scale of hundreds to thousands per day. Ibuprofen and Diazepam, each having different drug loading, were manufactured using this miniature system and meet U.S. Pharmacopeia standards. We foresee this flexible, miniature, plug-and-play pharmaceutical solids dosage manufacturing system advancing on-demand ready-to-use pharmaceuticals enabling future treatment of human diseases at the point-of-care.

AB Poorly soluble drug molecules often have low bioavailability issues and absorption problems in the clinical setting. As the number of poorly soluble drugs increases from discovery, developing technologies to enhance their solubility, while also controlling their release is one of the many challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry today. Liquid crystalline systems, nanoparticulate or macro-matrix, self-assemble in the presence of an aqueous environment and can provide a solubility enhancement, while also controlling the drug release rate. This review examines the fundamentals of liquid crystalline systems through the representative literature, concluding with examples of liquid crystalline systems in clinical trials development. The review focus is on the potential of utilizing liquid crystalline systems for poorly soluble drugs, in the areas of oral delivery and IV/subcutaneous, followed by water soluble molecules. Key considerations in utilizing liquid crystalline systems advantages while also discussing potential areas of key research that may be needed will be highlighted.

AB Achieving adequate content uniformity (CU) is a significant challenge in the development and manufacturing of low dose oral tablets. Using four model active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), we show that loading APIs into a grade of mesoporous silica, Aeroperl (R), is effective for achieving excellent CU. All APIs in the Aeroperl (R) composites were amorphous. After six months under accelerated stability conditions, the drug-Aeoperl composites exhibited good physical stability for all four APIs. The performance of Aeroperl (R)-based formulations was robust since their good CU and manufacturability were insensitive to model APIs. In addition, the dissolution rate of composite-based formulations was higher than corresponding physical mixtures. Overall, the Aeroperl (R) based platform formulation is a promising approach for successfully developing low dose oral tablet products.

AB The use of natural and synthetic repellents, marketed in different pharmaceutical forms, is growing in the world due to the emerging vector-borne viral diseases as Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, Yellow Fever and Malaria. The choice of the ideal formulation will depend on a series of factors to be analyzed: type of repellent active (natural or synthetic), pharmaceutical forms (spray, lotion, cream, gel), action time duration (short or long), environment of exposure and the user (adult, pregnant women, children, newborn). The most used repellents are DEET, IR3535 (Ethyl Butylacetylaminopropionate) (EB), Icaridin (Picaridin) and essential oils, each of them presenting advantages and disadvantages. DEET is the oldest and the most powerful repellent available in the market, thus being the reference standard. For this reason, there are many classic formulations available in the market containing the chemical component DEET in spray forms and lotions. However, due to its toxicity, DEET is not recommended for children up to 6 months and pregnant women. DEET has been an option along with other market-shared products as IR3535 and Icaridin (Picaridin), which present less toxicity in their composition. IR3535 is the less toxic and may be prescribed for children over 6 months of age and pregnant women so that they have been the best option because of the lower toxicity levels presented. IR3535 is the one that has the lowest toxicity level among the three options and may be prescribed for children above 6 months of age and pregnant women.
   Icaridin is as potent as DEET, but less toxic, and has the advantage of having the long-lasting action among the aforementioned repellents. The new formulations have been based on controlled release systems (CRS). The CRSs for repellents comprise polymer micro/nanocapsules, micro/solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions/microemulsions, liposomes/niosomes, nanostructured hydrogels and cyclodextrins. There are many formulations based on micro and nanocapsules containing DEET and essential oils to increase repellent action time duration and decrease permeation and consequently, systemic toxicity. The development of new formulations for the IR3535 and Icaridin is a research field yet to be explored. The current trend is the use of natural repellent actives such as essential oils, which present low toxicity, do not harm the environment, but present reduced repellent action time due to rapid evaporation after skin application. CRSs have been used as vehicle of natural repellents to improve long-lasting repellent action, reduce skin permeation and systemic effects.

AB Background/aim MicroRNA-93-5p (miR-93-5p) dysregulation has been reported in many types of human cancer. However, the collective effect of miR-93-5p in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and the mechanism underlying miR-93-5p involvement in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) is unknown. Herein, our purpose was to reveal the role and explain this mechanism, with the goal of contributing to the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and individualized therapeutic targets.
   Materials and methods: We examined miR-93-5p expression in NSCLC specimens (including lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) by qPCR. The effects of miR-93-5p inhibitor on proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells were determined by MIT assay, colony formation assays, apoptosis assay, cell cycle assay and transwell chamber assays, respectively. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects were investigated via dual luciferase reporter assay and western blotting.
   Results: MiR-93-5p expression levels were significantly correlated with NSCLC patients overall survival rate. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were significantly inhibited by miR-93-5p down-regulation. Dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-93-5p directly bound with the 3'-untranslated region of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and RB1.
   Conclusion: MiR-93-5p is up-regulated in NSCLC and plays an oncogenic role by inhibiting PTEN and R131, suggesting miR-93-5p may be a novel prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target in NSCLC.

AB Insect gut immunity plays a key role in defense against microorganism infection. The knowledge of insect gut immunity has been obtained mostly from Drosophila melanogaster. Little is known about gut immunity in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a pest destroying cruciferous crops worldwide. In this study, expressions of the immune-related genes in the midgut of P. xylostella orally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coil and Pichia pastoris were profiled by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches. The results revealed that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways and possibly the prophenoloxidase activation system in P. xylostella could be activated by oral infections, and moricins, gloverins and lysozyme2 might act as important effectors against microorganisms. Subsequent knock-down of IMD showed that this gene was involved in regulating the expression of down-stream genes in the IMD pathway. Our work indicates that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways may synergistically modulate immune responses in the P. xylostella midgut, implying a complex and diverse immune system in the midgut of insects.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate genes expression by directly binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of specific target mRNAs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed to be important in the development of breast cancer (BC). In the present study, we conducted a case-control study with 266 BCE patients and 288 control women to examine the possible association of miRNAs polymorphisms (miR100 rs1834306, miR-124-1 rs531564, miR-218-2 rs11134527, miR-301b rs384262, miR-605 rs2043556, and miR-4293 rsl 2220909) with BC susceptibility. Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The findings showed miR-218-2 rs11134527 variant increased the risk of BC (OR = 7.70, 95%CI = 3.84-15.43, P <.0001, GA vs GG and OR = 6.86, 95%CI = 3.47-13.57, P <.0001, A vs G). Regarding miR-301b rs384262 polymorphism, we observed that this variant significantly increased the risk of BC (OR = 3.12, 95%CI = 2.20-4.45, P <.0001, AG vs AA and OR = 2.22, 95%CI = 1.68-2.93, P <.0001, G vs A). Our findings did not support an association between miR100 rs1834306, miR-124-1 rs531564, miR-605 rs2043556 and miR-4293 rs12220909 polymorphism and the risk of BC.
   In conclusion, the finding showed that miR-218-2 rs11134527 and miR-301b rs384262 variant might contribute to increase the risk of BC in a sample of Iranian population. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and different ethnicities are necessary to confirm our finding.

AB Background and aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, and results from interaction between modifiable and non-modifiable factors, including genetic predisposition. Previous genomewide association studies and meta-analysis identified DENND1A as PCOS susceptibility locus in some, but not all populations. We investigated whether the association of DENNDIA gene variants with PCOS was similar between Tunisian and Bahraini Arab women.
   Subjects and methods: This was retrospective case-control study. Study subjects comprised 320 women with PCOS, and 446 age-and ethnically-matched control women. Genotyping of DENNDIA rs10818854, rs2479106, and rs10986105 variants was done by real-time PCR.
   Results: Minor allele frequency of rs10818854 and rs10986105 DENND1A variants were significantly higher among women with PCOS. Setting homozygous wild-type genotype carrier as reference, rs10818854 and rs10986105 were associated with increased risk of PCOS, which persisted after controlling for key covariates, while reduced PCOS risk was seen with only rs2479106 under the additive model. This assigned PCOS susceptibility and protective nature to these genotypes, respectively. Both rs10818854 and rs10986105 were positively associated with HOMA-IR and AMH in women with PCOS. Haploview analysis revealed limited linkage disequilibrium between the tested DENNDIA variants. Extensive diversity in haplotypes assignment was seen, with most haplotypes (99.5%) captured by 5 haplotypes. Taking GAT haplotype as reference, AAG, and GAG haplotypes were positively, while GAT haplotype was negatively associated with PCOS.
   Conclusion: The association of DENNDIA rs10818854 and rs10986105 variants with PCOS in Tunisian but not Bahraini women confirms the dependence of this association on the ethnic/racial origin of study subjects.

AB Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic commonly used to treat serious infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Recently, low-level linezolid resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains have emerged worldwide, but the resistant mechanisms remain undefined. Whole-transcriptome profiling was performed on an E. faecalis strain P10748 with low-level linezolid resistance in comparison with a linezolid-susceptible strain 3138 and the standard control strain ATCC29212. The functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predicted, with some DEGs potentially involved in drug resistance were validated by PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNA-Seq on three E. faecalis strains generated 1920 unigenes, with 98% of them assigned to various function groups. A total of 150 DEGs were identified in the linezolid resistant strain P10748 compared to the linezolid susceptible strains 3138 and ATCC29212. Functional analysis indicated a significant transcriptomic shift to membrane transportation and biofilm formation in strain P10748, with three significantly up-regulated DEGs predicted to be associated with drug resistance through active efflux pumps and biofilm formation. The existence of these three DEGs was further confirmed by PCR and qPCR. The significant upregulation of genes associated with efflux pumps and biofilm formation in the linezolid resistant strain suggests their roles in low-level resistance to linezolid in E. faecalis.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in the modulation of muscle development and muscle-related diseases. To explore potential regulators of muscle differentiation, we determined the expression profiles of IncrtNAs and mRNAs in C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line using microarray analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed to explore their function. We also constructed co-expression, cis/trans-regulation, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks with bioinformatics methods. We found that 3067 lncRNAs and 3235 mRNAs were differentially regulated (fold change >= 2.0). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the principal functions of the transcripts were related to muscle structure development and morphogenesis. Co-expression analysis showed 261 co-expression relationships between 233 lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs, and nine lncRNAs interacted with myog and MEF2C collectively. Cis/trans-regulation prediction revealed that lncRNA Myh6 could be a valuable gene via cis-regulation, and lncRNAs such as 2310043L19Ris, V00821, and AK139352 may participate in particular pathways regulated by transcription factors, including myog, myodl, and foxol. The myog-specific ceRNA network covered 10 lncRNAs, 378 miRNAs, and 1960 edges. The upregulated lncRNAs Filipl, Myll, and 2310043L19Rik may promote myog expression by acting as ceRNAs. Our results offer a new perspective on the modulation of lncRNAs in muscle differentiation.

AB The rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus was the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability of biosynthesizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from C-18 PUFA precursors, and all genes encoding the key enzymes for LC-PUFA biosynthesis have been cloned and functionally characterized, which provides us a potential model to study the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts. As the primary step to clarify such mechanisms, present research focused on promoter analysis of gene encoding Delta 6/Delta 5 fatty acyl desaturase (Fad), a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the first step in the conversion of C18 PUFA to LC-PUFA. First, 2044 bp promoter sequence was cloned by genome walking, and the sequence from -456 bp to +51 bp was determined as core promoter by progressive deletion mutation. Moreover, binding sites of transcription factors (TF) such as CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), nuclear factor 1 (NF-1), stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1), nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), activated protein 1 (AP1), sterol regulatory element (SRE), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) were identified in the core promoter by site-directed mutation and functional assays. Moreover, NF-1 and HNF4 alpha were confirmed to interact with the core promoter region by gel shift assay and mass spectrometry. This is the first report of the promoter structure of a Delta 6/Delta 5 Fad in a marine teleost, and a novel discovery of NF-1 and HNF4 alpha binding to the Delta 6/Delta 5 Fad promoter.

AB Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML that is a mixture of hematological malignancy, characterized by a specific translocation t(15;17). The using of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) or chemotherapeutic agents or both of these agents, composes main treatment strategy of APL. While it is possible to achieve success in treatment of low-risk APL with current treatment regimens, such success is not mentioned in high-risk APL. So, it may develop new approaches for treatment regimens for high-risk APL. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of combinational of a classic anticancer agent paclitaxel and antidiabetic agent metformin on HL-60 APL cell line. The combination dose of paclitaxel and metformin was determined by WST-1 analysis. The effect of combinational dose on apoptosis was assessed in fluorescence microscope after using AnnexinV-EGFP Apoptosis and JC-1 Assay Kit. The effect of combinational dose on cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation, and signaling pathways were determined investigating gene expression changes by using real time qRT-PCR. The combinational dose of paclitaxel and metformin was determined as 4.8 mu M and 398.7 mu M for 72 h, respectively. The combination dose significantly increased apoptosis for 48 h. In expression changes of genes associated cell cycle, apoptosis, cytokines, co-stimulator molecules, NF-kappa B and MAP/MAPK pathways, TLRs (Toll-like receptors) were found to be decreased or increased to provide apoptosis or differentiation. Consequently, we suggest that the combination of paclitaxel and metformin can be used as an option assessable for development of new treatment strategies for APL.

AB Hearing loss (HL) is the most common neurosensory disorder affecting humans. The screening, prevention and treatment of HL require a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Genetic predisposition is one of the most common factors that leads to HL. Most HL studies include few Spanish, Hispanic and Latino participants, leaving a critical gap in our understanding about the prevalence, impact, unmet health care needs, and genetic factors associated with hearing impairment among Spanish, Hispanic and Latino populations. The few studies which have been performed show that the gene variants commonly associated with HL in non Spanish and non-Hispanic populations are infrequently responsible for hearing impairment in Spanish as well as Hispanic and Latino populations (hereafter referred to as Hispanic). To design effective screening tools to detect HL in Spanish and Hispanic populations, studies must be conducted to determine the gene variants that are most commonly associated with hearing impairment in this racial/ethnic group. In this review article, we summarize gene variants and loci associated with HL in Spanish and Hispanic populations. Identifying new genetic variants associated with HL in Spanish and Hispanic populations will pave the way to develop effective screening tools and therapeutic strategies for HL.

AB Marine red macroalgae have received much attention as sustainable resources for producing bio-based products. Therefore, understanding the metabolic pathways of carbohydrates from red macroalgae, in fermentative microorganisms, is crucial for efficient bioconversion of the carbohydrates into bio-based products. Recently, the novel catabolic pathway of 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose (AHG), the main component of red macroalgae, was discovered in a marine bacterium, Vibrio sp. strain EJY3. However, the global metabolic network in response to AHG remains unclear. Here, the intracellular metabolites of EJY3 grown on AHG, glucose, or galactose were comparatively profiled using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The global metabolite profiling results revealed that the metabolic profile for AHG significantly differed from those for other common sugars. Specifically, the metabolic intermediate of the AHG pathway, 3,6-anhydrogalactonate, was detected during growth only in the presence of AHG; thus, the recently discovered key steps in AHG catabolism was found not to occur in the catabolism of other common sugars. Moreover, the levels of metabolic intermediates related to glycerolipid metabolism and valine biosynthesis were higher with AHG than those with other sugars. These comprehensive metabolomic analytical results for AHG in this marine bacterium can be used as the basis for having fermentative microbial strains to engineered to efficiently utilize AHG from macroalgal biomass.

AB Envenoming by scorpion is a major health problem in Maghreb regions as well as in several regions of the world. Immunotherapy is the only effective treatment for scorpion stings. The immune sera are obtained from hyper-immunized animals with a formulation of venom associated to Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA). This formulation seems to protect against several alterations in immunized animals leading to worsening of their health due to added toxicity of native venom and FCA adjuvant. This study aims to provide a more efficient and non-toxic alternative to this formulation. Two formulations of saponin or FCA associated to irradiated venom of Androctonus australis hector (Aah) were used to compare their safety and their efficiency to better enhance the antibody titers against toxic antigens.
   Both of these formulations were used in immunization schedule of three months. Blood samples were collected every week, cell count, myeloperoxydase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activities and specific antibody titers were evaluated. Four months after the last immunization, rabbits were challenged with increased doses of native Aah venom.
   Results showed that immunization with saponin formulation induced lower inflammatory cell activation as well as reduced MPO and EPO activities compared to that using FCA. The formulation of irradiated venom with saponin seems also to be more efficient in the activation of lymphocytes resulting in higher titers of specific IgG. The immunoprotective effect evaluation showed that the formulation using saponin seems to protected animals until 3 LD50 of native venom compared to that using FCA which protected only until 2 LD50. These results indicate that saponin formulation with irradiated antigen could be more efficient and safe immunizing preparation for the production of sera against scorpion envenomation.

AB Background: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the most common bacterial lower airway infection in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis, is associated with progression to bronchiectasis. We determined whether vaccination with 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) reduced NTHi lower airway infection compared to children not PHiD-CV-vaccinated. Our unique childhood vaccination schedule and prospective 9-year bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) collection provided an exclusive opportunity to examine this hypothesis.
   Methods: Paired BAL fluids and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from 543 children (2007-2016) undergoing bronchoscopy for chronic cough. Children who received a primary course of >= 2 doses of one pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and <2 doses of another PCV were included in each vaccine group. Logistic regression determined associations between NTHi lower airway infection (>= 10(4) colony-forming units/mL BAL) and age, sex, Indigenous status, antibiotic exposure, and PHiD-CV vaccination.
   Results: Of 262 PCV7-vaccinated, 53 PHiD-CV-vaccinated and 166 PCV13-vaccinated children (62 had mixed schedules, <2 PCV doses or missing vaccination data), NTHi lower airway infection was detected in 89 (34%), 9 (17%) and 47 (28%), respectively. On multivariate regression, significant independent factors associated with reduced NTHi lower airway infection were PHiD-CV vaccination (ORadjusted = 0.42, 95%CI 0.19-0.93), macrolide use (ORadjusted = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93) and increasing age (ORadjusted = 0.88, 95%CI 0.80-0.96). PHiD-CV vaccination had no impact on NTHi NP carriage.
   Conclusions: PHiD-CV-vaccinated children were significantly less likely to have NTHi lower airway infection than children not PHiD-CV-vaccinated. PHiD-CV is likely an effective intervention for reducing NTHi endobronchial infection in children at risk of chronic suppurative lung diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (4vHPV) for use in females and males aged 9-26 years, since 2006 and 2009 respectively. We characterized reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a US spontaneous reporting system, in females and males who received 4vHPV vaccination.
   Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports of adverse events (AEs) following 4vHPV from January 2009 through December 2015. Signs and symptoms were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). We calculated reporting rates and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reports. Clinicians reviewed available information, including medical records, and reports of selected pre-specified conditions.
   Findings: VAERS received 19,760 reports following 4vHPV; 60.2% in females, 17.2% in males, and in 22.6% sex was missing. Overall, 94.2% of reports were non-serious; dizziness, syncope and injection site reactions were commonly reported in both males and females. Headache, fatigue and nausea were commonly reported serious AEs. More than 60 million 4vHPV doses were distributed during the study period. Crude AE reporting rates were 327 reports per million 4vHPV doses distributed for all reports, and 19 per million for serious reports. Among 29 verified reports of death, there was no pattern of clustering of deaths by diagnosis, co-morbidities, age, or interval from vaccination to death.
   Interpretation: No new or unexpected safety concerns or reporting patterns of 4vHPV with clinically important AEs were detected. Safety profile of 4vHPV is consistent with data from pre-licensure trials and postmarketing safety data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Safety testing is one major part of the licensing procedure for veterinary vaccines and demands a large number of animals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was tested as an alternative, which may lead to a reduction in numbers of animals required for safety testing, and, correspondingly to a detailed description of the three-dimensional extent of the local tissue reaction repetitively in live pigs. In previous pig studies the following questions arose:
   (1) Can MRI be used in suckling pigs in terms of safety testing?
   (2) Does the injection of 2 ml saline solution lead to a volume effect resulting in tissue alterations comparable to a vaccine response?
   (3) Is the local reaction size affected by the tattoo marking of the injection point for the final pathomorphologic examination?
   To answer these questions the following study was performed by comparing two vaccine groups of suckling piglets (8 animals per group; A and B) with two control groups (4 animals per group; C and D). One control group was injected with a saline solution (C) and the other was only tattoo marked (D). The animals were examined using MRI at days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 post vaccination, ending with a final pathomorphologic examination. Pathomorphologic examination confirmed MRI findings. Saline solution does not result in a local tissue reaction as detected after injecting vaccines. Tattoo marking causes no local tissue reaction, neither in MRI nor in pathomorphologic examination. Therefore, MRI can be used as an alternative method for safety testing of vaccines in pigs of different age categories offering repetitive measurements of local tissue reactions. Involved cells might be examined only in a final pathomorphologic examination at the end of the trial on a reduced number of animals. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Maternal vaccination is a safe and effective strategy to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality from pertussis and influenza. However, despite recommendations for maternal vaccination since 2010, uptake remains suboptimal. Barriers to uptake have been studied widely and include lack of integration of vaccination into routine pregnancy care and access to vaccination services. Standing orders for administration of vaccines without the need for a physician review or prescription have been demonstrated to improve uptake as part of multi-model interventions to increase antenatal influenza and post-partum pertussis vaccination.
   Monash Health is a university-affiliated, public healthcare network in Melbourne, Australia providing maternity services across three hospitals. In this study we compared three different immunisation models - an immunisation nurse-led immunisation service, standing orders for midwife-administered pertussis vaccination within pregnancy care clinics, and delivery by general practitioners in primary care. Uptake of maternal pertussis vaccine was measured as recorded in the state-wide perinatal data collection tool.
   Uptake improved significantly at all three hospitals over the study period with the most significant change (39% to 91%, p < .001) noted at the hospital where standing orders were introduced.
   Our study highlights the diversity of immunisation service models available in maternity care settings. We demonstrated significant improvement in uptake of maternal pertussis vaccination with introduction of midwife-administered vaccination but each maternity service should consider the model best suited to their needs.

AB Widespread administration of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has decreased global incidence of poliomyelitis by approximate to 99.9%. However, the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) is threatening polio eradication program. Primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients are at higher risks of vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and prolonged excretion of immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPV).
   We searched Embase, Medline, Science direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and CDC and WHO databases by 30 September 2016, for all reports of iVDPV cases. Patient-level data were extracted form eligible studies. Data on immunization coverage and income-level of countries were extracted from WHO/UNICEF and the WORLD BANK databases, respectively. We assessed bivariate associations between immunological, clinical, and virological parameters, and exploited multivariable modeling to identify independent determinants of poliovirus evolution and patient's' outcomes. Study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016052931).
   4329 duplicate-removed titles were screened. A total of 107 iVDPV cases were identified from 68 eligible articles. The majority of cases were from higher income countries with high polio-immunization coverage. 74 (69.81%) patients developed VAPP. Combined immunodeficiency patients showed lower rates of VAPP (p < .001) and infection clearance (p = .02), compared to humoral immunodeficiency patients. The rate of poliovirus genomic evolution was higher at early stages of replication, decreasing over time until reaching a steady state. Independent of replication duration, higher extent (p = .04) and rates (p = .03) of genome divergence contributed to a less likelihood of virus clearance. PID type (p < .001), VAPP occurrence (p = .008), and income-level of country (p = .04) independently influenced patients' survival.
   With the use of OPV, new iVDPV5 will emerge independent of the rate of immunization coverage. Inherent features of PIDs contribute to the clinical course of iVDPV infection and virus evolution. This finding could shed further light on poliomyelitis pathogenesis and iVDPV evolution pattern. It also has implications for public health, the polio eradication effort and the development of effective antiviral interventions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB E. coli O 157:H7 is a foodborne pathogen responsible for bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The objective of the present work was to evaluate the ability of colostral IgG obtained from Stx2-immunized cows to prevent against E. coli O157:H7 infection and Stx2 cytotoxicity. Hyperimmune colostrum (HC) was obtained from cows intramuscularly immunized with inactivated Stx2 or vehicle for controls. Colostral IgG was purified by affinity chromatography. Specific IgG antibodies against Stx2 and bovine lactoferrin (bLF) levels in HC and the corresponding IgG (HC-IgG/bLF) were determined by ELISA. The protective effects of HC-IgG/bLF against Stx2 cytotoxicity and adhesion of E. coli O157:H7 and its Stx2-negative mutant were analyzed in HCT-8 cells. HC-IgG/bLF prevention against E. coli 0157:H7 was studied in human colon and rat colon loops. Protection against a lethal dose of E. coli O157:H7 was evaluated in a weaned mice model. HC-IgG/bLF showed high anti-Stx2 titers and high bLF levels that were able to neutralize the cytotoxic effects of Stx2 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HC-IgG/bLF avoided the inhibition of water absorption induced by E. coli O157:H7 in human colon and also the pathogenicity of E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:H7 Delta stx2 in rat colon loops. Finally, HC-IgG/bLF prevented in a 100% the lethality caused by E. con O157:H7 in a weaned mice model. Our study suggests that HC-IgG/bLF have protective effects against E. coli O157:H7 infection. These beneficial effects may be due to specific anti-Stx2 neutralizing antibodies in combination with high bLF levels. These results allow us to consider HC-IgG/bLF as a nutraceutical tool which could be used in combination with balanced supportive diets to prevent HUS. However further studies are required before recommendations can be made for therapeutic and clinical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: An overall increase has been reported in vaccination rates among adolescents during the past decade. Studies of vaccination coverage have shown disparities when comparing foreign-born and U.S.-born populations among children and adults; however, limited information is available concerning potential disparities in adolescents.
   Methods: The National Immunization Survey-Teen is a random-digit-dialed telephone survey of care-givers of adolescents aged 13-17 years, followed by a mail survey to vaccination providers that is used to estimate vaccination coverage among the U.S. population of adolescents. Using the National Immunization Survey-Teen data, we assessed vaccination coverage during 2012-2014 among adolescents for routinely recommended vaccines for this age group (>= 1 dose tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis [Tdap] vaccine, >= 1 dose quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate [MenACWY] vaccine, >= 3 doses human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccine) and for routine childhood vaccination catch-up doses (>= 2 doses measles, mumps, and rubella IMMRI vaccine, >= 2 doses varicella vaccine, and >= 3 doses hepatitis B [HepB] vaccine). Vaccination coverage prevalence and vaccination prevalence ratios were estimated.
   Results: Of the 58,090 respondents included, 3.3% were foreign-born adolescents. Significant differences were observed between foreign-born and U.S.-born adolescents for insurance status, income-to-poverty ratio, education, interview language, and household size. Foreign-born adolescents had significantly lower unadjusted vaccination coverage for HepB (89% vs. 93%), and higher coverage for the recommended >= 3 doses of HPV vaccine among males, compared with U.S.-born adolescents (22% vs. 14%). Adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors accounted for the disparity in HPV but not HepB vaccination coverage.
   Conclusions: We report comparable unadjusted vaccination coverage among foreign-born and U.S.-born adolescents for Tdap, MenACWY, MMR, >= 2 varicella. Although coverage was high for HepB vaccine, it was significantly lower among foreign-born adolescents, compared with U.S.-born adolescents. HPV and >= 2-dose varicella vaccination coverage were low among both groups. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DECISION-MAKING; HESITANCY; EXEMPTION; POLICIES; CHILDREN; PARENTS;

AB Background: In 2015, Michigan implemented an education requirement for parents who requested nonmedical exemptions from school or daycare immunization mandates. Michigan required parents to receive education from public health staff, unlike other states, whose vaccine education requirements could be completed online or at physicians' offices.
   Methods and Findings: Results of focus group interviews with 39 of Michigan's vaccine waiver educators, conducted during 2016 and 2017, were analyzed to identify themes describing educators' experiences of waiver education. The core theme that emerged from the data was that educators changed their perception of the purpose of waiver education, from convincing vaccine-refusing parents to vaccinate their children to promoting more diffuse and forward-looking goals.
   Conclusions: Michigan, and other communities that require vaccine waiver education, ought to investigate whether and how waiver education contributes to public health goals other than short-term vaccination compliance. Research shows that education requirements can decrease nonmedical exemption rates by discouraging some parents from applying for exemptions, but further studies are needed to identify ways in which waiver education can promote other public health goals, while minimizing costs and burdens on staff.

AB Background: Due to competing health priorities and limited resources, many low-income countries, even those with a high disease burden, are not able to introduce pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Objective: To determine the cost-utility of 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 and PCV13) compared to no vaccination in Bhutan.
   Methods: A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed in the Bhutanese context using a government perspective. A Markov simulation model with one-year cycle length was used to estimate the costs and outcomes of three options: PCV10, PCV13 and no PCV programmes for a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3% per annum was applied. Results are presented using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in United State Dollar per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (USD 1 = Ngultrum 65). A one-way sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess uncertainty.
   Results: Compared to no vaccination, PCV10 and PCV13 gained 0.0006 and 0.0007 QALY5 with additional lifetime costs of USD 0.02 and USD 0.03 per person, respectively. PCV10 and PCV13 generated ICERs of USD 36 and USD 40 per QALY gained compared to no vaccination. In addition, PCV13 produced an ICER of USD 92 compared with PCV10. When including PCV into the Expanded Programme on Immunization, the total 5-year budgetary requirement is anticipated to increase to USD. 3.77 million for PCV10 and USD 3.75 million for PCV13. Moreover, the full-time equivalent (FTE) of one health assistant would increase by 2.0 per year while the FTE of other health workers can be reduced each year, particularly of specialist (0.6-1.1 FTE) and nurse (1-1.6 FTE).
   Conclusion: At the suggested threshold of 1xGDP per capita equivalent to USD 2708, both PCVs are cost-effective in Bhutan and we recommend that they be included in the routine immunization programme. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Polio virus 2; Polio outbreak response; Polio vaccines
AB Background: Outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses type 2 (cVDPV2) remain a risk to poliovirus eradication in an era without live poliovirus vaccine containing type 2 in routine immunization. We evaluated existing outbreak response strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for control of cVDPV2 outbreaks.
   Methods: Seronegative children for poliovirus type 2 (PV2) at 22 weeks of life were assigned to one of four study groups and received respectively (1) one dose of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV); (2) monovalent OPV 2 (mOPV2); (3) tOPV together with a dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV); or (4) mOPV2 with monovalent high-potency IPV type 2. Stool and blood samples were collected and assessed for presence of PV2 (stool) and anti-polio antibodies (sera).
   Results: We analyzed data from 265 children seronegative for PV2. Seroconversion to PV2 was achieved in 48, 76, 98 and 100% in Groups 1-4 respectively. mOPV2 was more immunogenic than tOPV alone (p < 0.001); and OPV in combination with IPV was more immunogenic than OPV alone (p < 0.001). There were 33%, 67%, 20% and 43% PV2 excretors in Groups 1-4 respectively. mOPV2 resulted in more prevalent shedding of PV2 than when tOPV was used (p < 0.001); and tOPV together with IPV resulted in lower excretion of PV2 than tOPV alone (p = 0.046).
   Conclusion: mOPV2 was a more potent vaccine than tOPV. Adding IPV to OPV improved immunological response; adding IPV also seemed to have shortened the duration of PV2 shedding. mIPV2 did not provide measurable improvement of immune response when compared to conventional IPV. WHO recommendation to use mOPV2 as a vaccine of first choice in cVDPV2 outbreak response was supported by our findings. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The burden of influenza is increasingly recognised in Africa. The WHO recommends introducing influenza vaccination to high-risk groups: pregnant women, children <5 years, and the elderly. The Gambia currently has no influenza vaccination policy, but the NASIMMUNE study, a clinical trial of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) in young children provided an opportunity to study maternal attitudes towards LAW for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa. We assess acceptability of LAIV, influenza knowledge and attitudes towards influenza vaccination in Gambian women. Additionally, we investigate predictors of willingness to receive influenza vaccine (intent) in pregnancy or seasonally for children <5.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gambian women at two urban health facilities. To assess LAIV acceptability, the exposure group (women whose children had received LAIV during the NASIMMUNE study) were compared to a control group (women whose children were not enrolled in the NASIMMUNE study). Demographics and health belief constructs were analysed as predictors of influenza knowledge and vaccine intent.
   Findings: The exposure group (n = 150) expressed a higher preference for a nasal spray vaccine than an injection compared to the control group (n = 304) (93.3% vs. 34.9%, OR = 26.15, p < 0.0001). Those in the exposure group who preferred the nasal spray found it less distressing, safer or equally safe, and easier or equally easy to give (all p < 0.001) than injections. Influenza knowledge increased with education level (p = 0.006 for higher education vs. none), and varied between sites (p = 0.0005). Vaccine intent was >98%, but no association with influenza knowledge or difference between groups was observed. Various health belief constructs were associated with vaccine intent.
   Conclusion: LAIV acceptability was higher in those with first-hand experience. Influenza vaccine intent was also high. Incorporation of seasonal LAIV into the childhood immunisation schedule in The Gambia would be feasible, particularly if combined with community-based health education. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Discovery of new properties and special functionalities at the nanoscale materials caused nanotechnology to become one of the leading parts in all sciences namely biology and medicine. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) are among interesting nanomaterials in biomedical arena, which have attracted the attention of many researchers owing to their extensive capabilities. Due to the simple, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly production processes, biosynthesis is of paramount importance between different methods of nanoparticles production. In the current study, we succeeded to synthesize MIONPs using a newly extracted bacteria supernatant. Produced nanoparticles were characterized using FE-SEM, DLS, VSM, UV-vis, FT-IR and EDS spectroscopy. Analysis showed that the average particle size of very stable spherical MIONPs is about 29.3 nm. The bacteria protein profile obtained by SDS-PAGE analysis indicated induction of different proteins. In vitro cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on the viability of MCF7 and 3T3 cell lines was assessed by MTT assay. The results show that toxicity of the produced nanoparticles (IC50, MCF-7 > 5 mg/ml and IC50, 3T3 > 7.5 mg/ml) follows a concentration dependent manner.

AB Lignocellulose degradation is a challenging step for value added products and biofuels production. Cellulomonas fimi secretes complex mixtures of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) which synergistically degrade cellulose and hemicelluloses. Their characterization may provide new insights for enzymatic cocktails implementation. Bioinformatic analysis highlighted 1127 secreted proteins, constituting the in silico secretome, graphically represented in a 2DE map. According to Blast2GO functional annotation, many of these are involved in carbohydrates metabolism. In vivo secretomes were obtained, growing C. fimi on glucose, CMC or wheat straw for 24 h. Zymography revealed degradative activity on carbohydrates and proteomic analysis identified some CAZymes, only in secretomes obtained with CMC and wheat straw. An interaction between cellobiohydrolases is proposed as a strategy adopted by soluble multimodular cellulases. Such approach can be crucial for a better characterization and industrial exploitation of the synergism among C. fimi enzymes.

AB Autoinducers are indispensable for bacterial cell-cell communication. However, due to the reliance on culture-based techniques, few autoinducer-hydrolyzing enzymes are known. In this study, we characterized soil metagenome-derived unique enzymes capable of hydrolyzing 3-hydroxypalmitic acid methyl ester (3-OH PAME), an autoinducer of the plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. Among 146 candidate lipolytic clones from a soil metagenome library, 4 unique enzymes capable of hydrolyzing the autoinducer 3-OH PAME, termed ELP86, ELP96, ELP104, and EstDL33, were selected and characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that metagenomic enzymes were novel esterase/lipase candidates as they clustered as novel subfamilies of family I, V, X, and family XI. The purified enzymes displayed various levels of hydrolytic activities towards 3-OH PAME with optimum activity at 40-50 degrees C and pH 7-10. Interestingly, ELP104 also displayed N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone hydrolysis activity. Heterologous expression of the gene encoding 3-OH PAME hydrolase in R. solanacearum significantly decreased exopolysaccharide production without affecting bacterial growth. mRNA transcription analysis revealed that genes regulated by quorum-sensing, such as phcA and xpsR, were significantly down-regulated in the stationary growth phase of R. solanacearum. Therefore, metagenomic enzymes are capable of quorum-quenching by hydrolyzing the autoinducer 3-OH PAME, which could be used as a bio-control strategy against bacterial wilt.

AB The 2'-N-deoxyribosyltransferases [NDT; EC 2.4.2.6] are a group of enzymes widely used as biocatalysts for nucleoside biosynthesis. In this work, the molecular cloning, expression and purification of a novel NDT from Lactobacillus animalis (LaNDT) have been reported. On the other hand, biocatalyst stability has been significantly enhanced by multipoint covalent immobilization using a hetero-functional support activated with nickel-chelates and glyoxyl groups. The immobilized enzyme could be reused for more than 300 h and stored during almost 3 months without activity loss. Besides, the obtained derivative (Ni2+-Gx-LaNDT) was able to biosynthesize 88 mg floxuridine/g biocatalyst after 1 h of reaction. In this work, a green bioprocess by employing an environmentally friendly methodology was developed, which allowed the obtaining of a compound with proven anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the obtained enzymatic biocatalyst meets the requirements of high activity, stability, and short reaction times needed for low-cost production in a future preparative application.

AB Substantial progress is being reported in the techniques for plant transformation, but successful regeneration of some genotypes remains a challenging step in the attempts to transform some recalcitrant species. GhSERK1 gene is involved on embryo formation, and its overexpression enhances the embryogenic competence. In this study we validate a short GhSERK1 probe in order to identify embryogenic cotton genotypes using RT-qPCR and blotting assays. Cotton genotypes with contrasting somatic embryogenic capacity were tested using in vitro procedures. High expression of transcripts was found in embryogenic genotypes, and the results were confirmed by the RT-PCR-blotting using a non-radioactive probe. The regeneration ability was confirmed in embryogenic genotypes. We confirmed that GhSERK1 can be used as marker for estimating the somatic embryogenesis ability of cotton plants.

AB Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is the etiological agent of BVD causes substantial economic losses and endemic in world-wide cattle population. Mucosal immunity plays an important role in protection against BVDV infection and Lactobacillus casei is believed as an excellent live vaccine vector for expressing foreign genes. In this study, we have constructed a novel recombinant L. casei/pELX1-E2 strain expressing the most immunogenic E2 antigen of BVDV; using growth phage dependent surface expression system pELX1. The expression of E2 protein was verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. The immune responses triggered by the E2 producing recombinant L. casei were evaluated in BALB/c mice revealed that oral and intranasal (IN) administration of the recombinant strain was able to induce a significantly higher level of specific anti-E2 mucosal IgA and serum IgG as well as the greater level of cellular response by IFN-gamma and IL-12 than those of intramuscular (IM) and control groups of mice. However, IN inoculation was found the most potent route of immunization. The ability of the recombinant strain to induce serum neutralizing antibody against BVDV and reduced viral load after viral challenge indicated better protection of BVDV infection. Therefore, this recombinant L. casei expressing E2 could be a safe and promising mucosal vaccine candidate against BVD.

AB The baculovirus insect cell expression system has become a firmly established production platform in biotechnology. Various complex proteins, multi-subunit particles including veterinary and human vaccines are manufactured with this system on a commercial scale. Apart from baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, the Trichoplusia ni (HighFive) cell line is alternatively used as host organism. In this study, we explored the protein production capabilities of Tnms42 insect cells, a new derivative of HighFive, which is free of latent nodavirus infection. As a model system, a cytosolic (mCherry) and a secreted (hemagglutinin) protein were overexpressed in Tnms42 cells. The response of the host cells was followed in a time course experiment over the infection cycle by comparative transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq). As expected, the baculovirus infection per se had a massive impact on the host cell transcriptome, which was observed by the huge total number of differentially expressed transcripts (> 14,000). Despite this severe overall cellular reaction, a specific response could be clearly attributed to the overexpression of secreted hemagglutinin, revealing limits in the secretory capacity of the host cell. About 400 significantly regulated transcripts were identified and assigned to biochemical pathways and gene ontology (GO) categories, all related to protein processing, folding and response to unfolded protein. The identification of relevant target genes will serve to design specific virus engineering concepts for improving the yield of proteins that are dependent on the secretory pathway.

AB Enzyme cost is considered to be one of the most significant factors defining the final product price in lignocellulose hydrolysis and fermentation. Enzyme immobilization and recycling can be a tool to decrease costs. However, high solid loading is a key factor towards high product titers, and recovery of immobilized enzymes from this thick liquid is often overlooked. This paper aims to evaluate the economic feasibility of immobilized enzymes in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of lignocellulose biomass in general, as well as the recuperation of magnetic immobilized enzymes (m-CLEAs) during high solid loading in simultaneous saccharification, detoxification and fermentation processes (SSDF) of lignocellulose biomass.
   Enzyme prices were obtained from general cost estimations by Klein-Marcuschamer et al. [KleinMarcuschamer et al. (2012) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 109, 1083-1087]. During enzyme cost analysis, the influence of inoculum recirculation as well as a shortened fermentation time was explored. Both resulted in 15% decrease of final enzyme product price. Enzyme recuperation was investigated experimentally and 99.5 m/m% of m-CLEAs was recovered from liquid medium in one step, while 88 m/m% could still be recycled from a thick liquid with high solid concentrations (SSF fermentation broth). A mathematical model was constructed to calculate the cost of immobilized and free enzyme utilization and showed that, with current process efficiencies and commercial enzyme prices, the cost reduction obtained by enzyme immobilization can reach around 60% compared to free enzyme utilization, while lower enzyme prices will result in a lower percentage of immobilization related savings, but overall enzyme costs will decrease significantly.
   These results are applied in a case study, estimating the viability of shifting from sugar to lignocellulose substrate for a 100 t lactic acid fermentation batch. It was concluded that it will only be economically feasible if the enzymes are produced at the most optimistic variable cost and either the activity of the immobilized catalyst or the recovery efficiency is further increased.

AB A broad methanotrophic community consisting of 16 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was detected by particulate methane monooxygenase A (pmoA) gene analyses of reactor sludge samples obtained from an industrial biogas plant. Using a cloning-sequencing approach, 75% of the OTUs were affiliated to the group of type I methanotrophs (gamma-Proteobacteria) and 25% to type II methanotrophs (alpha-Proteobacteria) with a distinct predominance of the genus Methylobacter. By database matching, half of the total OTUs may constitute entirely novel species. For evaluation of process conditions that support growth of methanotrophic bacteria, qPCR analyses of pmoA gene copy numbers were performed during a sampling period of 70 days at varying reactor feeding scenarios. During the investigation period, methanotrophic cell counts estimated by qPCR fluctuated between 3.4x10(4) and 2x10(5) cells/mL with no distinct correlation to the organic loading rate, the amount of CH4, O-2 and NH4-N. Methanotrophic activity was proofed even at low O-2 levels (1%) by using stable carbon isotope labelling experiments of CH4 in batch experiments inoculated with reactor sludge. Supplementation of C-13 labelled CH4 in the headspace of the reaction vials unambiguously confirmed the formation of C-13 labelled CO2. Thus, industrial biogas reactors can be considered as a further methanotrophic habitat that exhibits a unique methanotrophic community which is specifically adapted to high CH4 and low O-2 concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first accurate detection and quantification of methanotrophic bacteria in industrial biogas reactors.

AB In order to reduce the Cyrtotrachelus buqueti population, which is a serious pest in the bamboo industry, a range of approaches is required, which will be dependent on diverse gene expression influenced by environmental factors. In this study, samples from two regions of China, Muchuan in Sichuan Province and Chishui in Guizhou Province, were investigated through RNA-seq. Approximately 44 million high-quality reads were generated and 94.2% of the data was mapped to the transcriptome. A total of 15,641 out of the 29,406 identified genes were predicted. Moreover, 348 genes were differentially expressed between the two groups of imagoes (77 upregulated and 271 downregulated). The functional analysis showed that these genes were significantly enriched in the ribosome and metabolic pathway categories. The candidate genes contributing to the reduction in C. buqueti included 41 genes involved in the ribosome constitution category, five in the one-carbon pool pathway by folate category, and five heat shock protein genes. The downregulation of these candidate genes seems to have impaired metabolic processes, such as protein, DNA, RNA, and purine synthesis, as well as carbon and folate metabolism, subsequently resulting in the observed population reduction of C. buqueti. Furthermore, temperature, heavy metal content, and pH might influence the population by altering the expressions of genes involved in these metabolic processes.

AB Mutations in the exonuclease domain of polymerase epsilon (POLE), an enzyme of DNA synthesis, are involved in a newly described syndrome of colorectal polyposis and cancer, and have been associated with a high mutation burden with or without microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype. The exonuclease domain of POLE executes a proofreading function that decreases the mutation rate during DNA replication by an estimated of one to two orders. The high mutation burden resulting from its loss of function could create a load of neo-antigens that would put the neoplastic cells in severe disadvantage of an immune attack if properly presented to the immune system. This paper investigates the mutagenic effect of different POLE mutations in various cancers, in published genomic studies and the effect that these POLE mutations have in selecting for mutations of the beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) gene involved in antigen presentation.

AB Etoposide, an anticancer DNA topoisomerase II poison, plays an important role in the therapy for human cancers. Unfortunately, many cancers develop etoposide resistance and do not respond to chemotherapy, leading to difficulty in treatment and poor prognosis. In this study, we investigate the effects of HBXIP gene silencing on etoposide chemosensitivity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We find that etoposide increases HBXIP expression and promotes mobilization of HBXIP to the nucleus in MCF-7 cells. Knockdown of HBXIP alleviates etoposide-induced G2/M or S phase arrest. Upregulation of p53 and p21 upon etoposide treatment is attenuated in HBXIP knock-down cells. Moreover, HBXIP gene silencing sensitizes etoposide-induced cell apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP in MCF-7 cells. Knockdown of HBXIP expression by RNAi abrogates the etoposide-activated ERK and Akt. These results indicate that HBXIP can modulate the etoposide sensitivity of MCF-7 cell lines and further implicate HBXIP as a target for human breast cancer.

AB Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) gene polymorphisms have been extensively evaluated as predisposing factors to human reproductive disorders. However, the evidence available is inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide the first comprehensive synopsis of case-control studies that investigated the association of MMP and TIMP gene polymorphisms with disorders that influence fertility and pregnancy complications. Literature search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases. We included 42 case-control studies in the systematic review for the following disorders: adenomyosis, endometriosis, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth and recurrent spontaneous abortion. Although a large number of MMP and TIMP gene polymorphisms were tested, no exclusive and unambiguous risk factors were identified for any of the disorders. The majority of statistically significant associations were confirmed in just one study. Additionally, we performed two meta-analyses for MMP9 rs3918242 polymorphism in endometriosis/adenomyosis and preeclampsia but found no association with either disorder. Considering the modest associations and conflicting results between individual case-control studies, new data is needed for further research of this subject.

AB Our preview studies showed TPI gene which encodes the Triosephosphate isomerase was overexpressed in human gastric cancer (GC) tissues. However, the potential molecular mechanisms how TPI influences the GC development is not clear. Here, we performed global gene expression profiling for TPI knockdown using microarrays in human GC cell line MGC-803 cells. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Then the DEGs were analyzed by an online software WebGestalt to perform the functional analysis, pathway analysis and network analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were visualized by Cytoscape and the module analysis was performed by ClusterONE. As a result, a total of 920 DEGs including 197 up- and 723 down-regulated genes were screened out. The DEGs were found to be significantly associated with the metabolic process, biological regulation, protein binding and ion binding. There were 11 significant pathways were enriched, and one of the most significant pathway was transcriptional misregulation in cancer (P < 0.01), which contained common cancer-related genes, such as DUSP6, ETV5, IL6, PLAU, PPARG and HMGA2. Two PPI networks were constructed from BioGRID and TCGA_RNASeq_STAD, respectively. One network presented 25 genes with degree > 10, and EGFR was the most "hub gene" with degree of 74. Four significant modules were identified and mainly enriched in protein domain of Histone and G-protein beta WD-40 repeat. Another network had 4 significant modules and they were associated with protein domain of MHC class I-like antigen recognition and Epidermal growth factor receptor ligand. In conclusion, DEGs and hub genes identified in the present study help us understand the molecular mechanisms of TPI in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer.

AB Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In > 80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRLI, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-beta/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
   The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRLI transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

AB Non-syndromic stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disruptions in normal flow of speech in the form of repetition, prolongation and involuntary halts. Previously, mutations with more severe effects on GNPTAB and GNPTG have been reported to cause Mucolipidosisll (ML-II) and MucolipidosisIII (ML-III), two lysosomal storage disorders with multiple pathologies. We used homozygosity mapping and Sanger sequencing to investigate variants of the three genes in 25 Iranian families with at least two first degree related non-syndromic stutterers. Bioinformatic evaluation and Segregation analysis of the found variants helped us define probable consequences. We also compared our findings with those related to Mucolipidosis. 14 variations were found in the three genes 3 of which, including a novel variant within intronic region of GNPTG and a heterozygous 2-bp deletion in coding region of GNPTAB, co-segregated with stuttering in the families they were found. Bioinformatics analysis predicted all three variants causing deleterious effects on gene functioning. Our findings support the role of these three variants in non-syndromic stuttering. This finding may challenge the current belief that variations causing stuttering are at different sites and have less severe consequences than genetic changes that cause ML-II and ML-III.

AB Copy number variations (CNVs) recently have been recognized as another important genetic variability followed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) gene plays an important role in cell proliferation. This study was performed to determine the presence of GBP2 CNV (relative to Angus cattle) in 466 individuals representing six main cattle breeds from China, identify its relationship with growth, and explore the biological effects of gene expression. There were two CNV regions in the GBP2 gene, for three types, CNV1 loss type (relative to Angus cattle) was more frequent in XN than other breeds, and CNV2 loss type (relative to Angus cattle) was more frequent in XN and CDM than other breeds. Though the GBP2 gene copy number presented no correlation with the transcriptional expression of JX (P > .05), but the transcriptional expression in heart is higher than other tissues, and the copy number in muscles and fat of JX is higher than others breeds. Statistical analysis revealed that the GBP2 gene CNV1 and CNV2 were significantly associated with growth traits (P < .05). In conclusion, this research established the correlations between CNVs of GBP2 gene and growth traits in different cattle breeds, and our results suggested that the CNVs in GBP2 gene may be considered markers for the molecular breeding of Chinese beef cattle.

AB The core circadian clock gene, Clock, is a positive component of the transcription/translation feedback loop in the master pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals. The robust daytime peak of some clock genes in the wild-type SCN is absent in Clock mutant mice. However, very little is known about the impact of Clock mutation on the expression of other functional genes in SCN. Here, we performed cDNA microarray and found 799 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at zeitgeber time 2 (ZT2) and 1289 DEGs at ZT14 in SCN of Clock(Delta 19/Delta 19) mutant mice. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the changed mRNAs were highly associated with hedgehog signaling pathway, retinol metabolism, allograft rejection, drug metabolism, hematopoietic cell lineage and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The top 14 and 71 hub genes were identified from the protein protein interaction (PPI) network at ZT2 and ZT14, respectively. The sub-networks revealed hub genes were involved in olfactory transduction and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways. These results demonstrate the Clock(Delta 19/Delta 19) mutation alters the expression of various genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological function in mouse SCN, which are helpful for better understanding the function of Clock and potential regulatory mechanisms.

AB Since two genome-wide association studies identified the same susceptible region at ARID5B and IKZFI for acute leukemia in Caucasians in the same time, several research groups have confirmed the similar results in different ethnicities and of different acute leukemia subtypes (ALL and AML). However, the causal variants of these two genes were not identified. In this study, we systematically screened 6 potentially functional SNPs in ARID5B and IKZFI genes, and conducted a case-control study including 660 AML cases and 1034 cancer-free controls to investigate the associations between these SNPs and AML risk. We found that the variant alleles of rs4509706 and rs11761922 could significantly increase the risk of AML (rs4509706: OR = 1.35, 95%Cl = 1.12-1.62 in additive model; rs11761922: OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.02-1.62 in recessive model). Luciferase reporter assay showed that both rs11761922-G and rs4509706-C significantly increased the luciferase levels as compared with rs11761922-C and rs4509706-T in K562 cells (P < 0.05 for rs11761922 and P < 0.001 for rs4509706). Our results indicated that rs4509706 and rs11761922 may play important roles in AML development in Chinese population.

AB Two different phenotypes are described in alpaca, identified as surf and huacaya, which differ in the type of fleece. The huacaya fleece is characterized by compact, soft and highly crimped fibers, while the surf fleece is longer, straight, less-crimped and lustrous. In our study, the Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) was investigated as a possible candidate gene for hair length in alpaca (Vicugnapacos). As previously identified in other mammals, our results show that the alpaca FGF5 gene gives rise to a short (FGF5S) and a long (FGF5) isoform. Interestingly, in the long isoform, we observed a point mutation (i.e., a transition C > T at position 499 downstream of the ATG codon) that is able to generate a premature termination codon (PTC). The highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequence after PTC suggested a readthrough event (RT) that was confirmed by western blot analysis. The analysis of cDNA sequence revealed motifs and structures of mRNA undergoing RT. In fact, the event is positively influenced by particular signals harbored by the transcript. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a readthrough event on PTC reported for the FGF5 gene and the first case of this translational mechanism in alpaca.

AB Neuritin plays an important role in the development and regeneration of the nervous system, and shows good prospects in the treatment and protection of the nervous system. To characterize neuritin function, we constructed a baculovirus expression system of neuritin, and identified the biological activity of the neuritin protein. The results and showed that the expression product could promote the neurite growth of dorsal root ganglion in chicken embryos. The neuritin open reading frame was amplified and cloned into the plasmid pFastBac (TM) FITA. The pFastBac (TM) HTA-neuritin was confirmed to be correct by PCR and DNA sequencing, and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH10Bac. The high purity recombinant Bacmid-neuritin (shuttle vectors) was obtained from DH10Bac through screening and identification. Recombinant virus, including the neuritin gene (virus-neuritin), was produced by transfection of SF9 cells using the bacmid-neuritin, and then amplified repeatedly to express the neuritin fusion protein. Finally, we identified the fusion protein with SDS-PAGE and western blotting, and optimized the best expression time of the neuritin fusion protein. We also analyzed the activity of the expressed protein by dorsal root ganglion from chicken embryos.

AB Multiple genetic variations have been identified in FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated) gene. Among them, FTO rs9939609 polymorphism is shown to be associated with the risk of primary venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, its role in recurrent VTE is not known. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and the risk of VTE recurrence in a prospective follow-up study in both male and female patients. FTO rs9939609 polymorphism (T/A) was analyzed in the Malmo thrombophilia study (MATS, followed for-10 years) by using TaqMan PCR. MATS patients (n = 1050) were followed from the discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment until diagnosis of VTE recurrence or the end of follow-up. A total of 126 patients (12%) had VTE recurrence during follow-up. Cox regression analyses showed that sex modified the potential effect of FTO rs9939609 polymorphism on VTE recurrence. Male patients with the AA genotype for the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism had significantly higher risk of VTE recurrence as compared to the TT or AT genotypes (univariate hazard ratio [HR] = 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-3.5, P = 0.009 and adjusted HR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.2-3.6, P = 0.013). There was no association between FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and VTE recurrence in female patients. In conclusion, our results show that FTO rs9939609 polymorphism in recurrent VTE may differ according to gender and FTO polymorphism may predict VTE recurrence in male patients.

AB Our previous study using comparative genome analysis revealed a significant gene copy number gain of Dissostichus mawsoni selenoprotein P (Dm-SEPP) during the evolutionary radiation of Antarctic notothenioids, suggesting that Dm-SEPP contribute to this process, but the detailed structure and function of this gene product remain unclear. In the present study, the Dm-SEPP cDNA was cloned and characterized. The Dm-SEPP cDNA contains 17 selenocysteines (Sec) encoded by TGA codons and 2 typical SECIS elements located in the 3'-UTR. Evolutionary analysis of the Dm-SEPP gene revealed that it's closely related to the SEPP gene of zebrafish (Danio rerio), showing 51% amino acid similarity. Over-expression of Dm-SEPP could protect mammalian cells under cold pressure, probably via eliminating ROS. Further study showed an increase of endogenous SEPP in zebrafish ZF4 cells under cold pressure, and knockdown of SEPP decreased cell viability, accompanied with increased ROS. Our results suggested a protective role of Dm-SEPP in cold adaptation in Antarctic notothenioids.

AB Psoriasis is a complex autoimmune disease with multiple genes and proteins being involved in its pathogenesis. Despite the efforts performed to understand mechanisms of psoriasis pathogenesis and to identify diagnostic and prognostic targets, disease-specific and effective biomarkers were still not available. This study is compiled regarding clinical validation of computationally proposed biomarkers at gene and protein expression levels through qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques using skin biopsies and blood plasma. We identified several gene and protein clusters as systems biomarkers and presented the importance of gender difference in psoriasis. A gene cluster comprising of P13, IRF9, IFIT1 and NMI were found as positively correlated and differentially co-expressed for women, whereas SUB1 gene was also included in this cluster for men. The differential expressions of IRF9 and NMI in women and SUB1 in men were validated at gene expression level via qRT-PCR. At protein level, PI3 was abundance in disease states of both genders, whereas PC4 protein and WIF1 protein were significantly higher in healthy states than disease states of male group and female group, respectively. Regarding abundancy of PI3 and WIF1 proteins in women, and PI3 and PC4 in men may be assumed as systems biomarkers at protein level.

AB Piwi proteins play an important regulatory role in germ cell division during gametogenesis and gonad development. In order to understand the function of Piwi genes in the reproductive process of the dark sleeper, we identified and characterized Piwil1 and Piwil2 from gonad tissue. The tissue distribution demonstrated that Piwils were highly expressed in the gonad of the dark sleeper. During gonad development, higher expression was observed in stage I of both the testes and ovaries than in subsequent stages at mRNA and protein levels. The results of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Piwils were predominantly distributed in the spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and early oocytes. When treated with the HPG axis hormone (HCG and LHRH-A2), the expression of Piwils was significantly decreased in the testes and ovaries at mRNA and protein levels. All of these results indicated that Piwils play a vital role in gonad development and gametogenesis. Our findings provide valuable evidence to further clarify the underlying modulation mechanism of Piwils in teleosts.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 is predominantly associated with the development of cervical adenocarcinomas, whereas data on HPV18 genetic variability in China are limited. HPV18 genetic variants were formed phylogenetic tree, including lineages A, B, and C. We aimed to evaluate the diversity of HPV18 genetic variants by sequencing the entire E6, E7 and L1 genes. Between 2012 and 2015, a total of 138 (0.8%, 138/17669) women with single HPV18 infection were selected in this study. Finally, we observed 122 HPV18 isolates of the complete E6-E741 sequences, and obtained 36 distinct variation patterns which the accession GenBank numbers as KY457805-KY457840. Except KY457805, KY457813, KY457819, KY457827, KY457829, the rest of HPV18 isolates (81.1%, 31/36) are novel variants. All of HPV18 variants belong to lineage A, while no lineage B, and C was found in our population of Taizhou region, Southeast China. Sublineage A1 was the most common variants (85.2%, 104/122), followed by sublineage A4, A3 and A5, while no sublineage A2 was obtained. Based on the tree topologies, there were three newly identified candidates' sublineages A6-A8. Out of 122 women, 67 (54.9%) had diagnosed by biopsy, including 49 women who diagnosed with cervicitis, 12 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, 4 with CIN2/3, and 2 with adenocarcinomas, respectively. Nevertheless, there was no association between HPV18 (sub) lineages and CIN1 or worse (CIN1 +) lesions comparing with normal biopsies (P = .469). In conclusion, knowledge of the distribution of geographic/ethnical HPV18 genetic diversity provides critical information for developing diagnostic probes, epidemiologic correlate of cervical cancer risk and design of HPV vaccines for targeted populations.

AB The fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) rs9939609 gene polymorphism is most widely studied in terms of obesity in various populations. Recently, the prevalence of obesity has been reported to be very high among the North-Eastern State of India. The major aim of the present study is to understand the extent of FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism and its association with obesity among the two North-East Indian tribal populations with similar East Asian ancestry.
   Somatometric data and fasting blood sample were collected from 521 tribal individuals (258 Liangmai and 263 Mizo) of Manipur after obtaining written informed consent. Genotyping of FTO rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism method for PCR-amplified fragments.
   Both the presently studied populations were not following Hardy-Weinberg law. The prevalence of obesity and minor allele frequency of FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was found to be significantly higher among the Mizo tribe compared to that of Liangmai. The selected polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with obesity (BMI) only among the Liangmai tribe (Odds ratio-3.0; 95% CI-1.4, 6.4; p-0.003), after adjusting for age and occupation. Age-cohort wise distribution and absolute fitness analysis indicated the lower fitness of minor allele in the higher age group among the Liangmai tribe.
   To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first study, associating FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism and obesity in the North-eastern Indian tribal populations with East-Asian ancestry. This study revealed the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism is observed to be associated with obesity only among the Liangmai tribe not among the Mizo tribe. The differential distribution and association observed in the two selected tribes, inhabited in a similar geographical region, could be attributed to differences in their migratory histories in terms of both route and time of settlement.

AB This study aimed to explore the underlying microRNA (miRNA) targets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The expression profile with accession number GSE24952 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Based on the dataset, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs in ccRCC tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues were analyzed. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were then predicted. Expression levels of several key miRNAs and genes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 168 up- and 288 downregulated DEGs, and 26 up and 54 downregulated differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. The target genes of miRNA-429 (TGEB1, CCND1, EGFR, and LAMC1) and miRNA-206 (CCND1 and EGFR) were upregulated. Based on the tumor suppressor (TS) gene and tumor-associated gene (TAG) databases, miRNA-142-5p was selected from the upregulated miRNAs. miRNA-429, miRNA-422a, miRNA-206, miRNA-132-3p, and miRNA-184 were selected from the downregulated miRNAs. Moreover, the miRNA regulation network revealed that CCND1 was the common target gene of miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184, and ATP1B1 was the common target gene of miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p. qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of miR-140-3p and CCND1 significantly increased, while that of ATP1B1 significantly decreased in 786-O cells compared with those in human renal tubular epithelial cells, which was in accordance with the predicted results of bioinformatic analysis. In conclusion, miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184 and their target gene CCND1, as well as miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p and their target gene ATP1B1, might play key roles in ccRCC progression and could be useful biomarkers during ccRCC development.

AB Acephalic spermatozoa is an extremely rare disease associated with primary infertility. A recent study showed that genetic alterations in the SUN5 gene lead to this disease, and SUNS mutations could explain the disease in about half of the patients. Therefore, in the present study, to re-visit the genetic contribution of SUNS mutations to acephalic spermatozoa, we recruited 15 unrelated affected individuals and screened the SUN5 gene for mutations by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. Five of the 15 (33.33%) subjects were found to carry the same homozygous mutation in the SUNS gene c.381delA (p.V128Sfs*7). Neither homozygous nor compound heterozygous mutations in SUN5 were found in the other 10 patients. The c.381delA mutation resulted in the truncation of the SUN5 protein and decreased the expression and altered the distribution of the outer dense fiber 1 (ODF1) protein. Thus, in our study SUNS mutations accounted for only one-third of the patients in our cohort, which is lower than the percentage reported previously. Thus, our study suggests that the contribution of SUNS mutations to acephalic spermatozoa might not be as high as described previously. These results will help in the genetic counseling of patients with acephalic spermatozoa.

AB The cysteine-and glycine-rich protein (CRP) family members, including the cysteine-and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRPI), cysteine-and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2), and the cysteine-and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), have exhibited various cellular functions during cell development and differentiation. However, the sequences of the three CSRP genes and their functions are still poorly understood in newts. In this study, we cloned the complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences of the three CSRP genes from the Chinese fire-bellied newt, Cynops orientalis (C. orientalis). The complete ORF sequences of Co-CSRPI, Co-CSRP2, and Co-CSRP3 were 582, 582, and 576 bp, respectively, and encoded 193, 193, and 191 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three CRP members showed high similarities with that of other species, particularly, with amphibians. Co-CSRPI was highly expressed in the kidney, limb, and stomach, however, the expression was low in the spleen, heart, intestine, liver, and tail (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of Co-CSRP2 was higher in the kidney and heart than that in other organs (P < 0.05). It was observed that Co-CSRP3 was only expressed in the heart, limb, and tail. The mRNA expression of Co-CSRPI and Co-CSRP3 was lower in the digits in comparison to other limb segments. However, there was no significant difference of Co-CSRP2 mRNA expression in the four limb segments. The Co-CSRPI and Co-CSRP2 mRNA expressions were significantly increased, whereas the expression of Co-CSRP3 was remarkably decreased during the limb regeneration. This study will provide useful information for further elucidating the role of Co-CSRP genes during newt limb regeneration.

AB The endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters the function of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse effects in intact organisms. Bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most common endocrine disrupting chemicals is a carbon-based synthetic compound used in the production of water bottles, cans, and teeth suture materials. It is known to be a xenoestrogen as it interacts with estrogen receptors and acts as agonist or antagonist via estrogen receptor-dependent signaling pathways. BPA has been associated with serious health effects in humans and wildlife. It elicits several endocrine disorders and plays a role in the pathogenesis of several hormone-dependent tumors such as breast, ovarian, prostate cancer and others. More complicate to this picture, its effects rely on several and diverse molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that converge upon endocrine and reproductive systems.
   The present review gives an overview of general hazards of BPA, its epigenetic modifications and the molecular mechanisms of BPA action in different types of cancers as the increase in information about responses and action mechanisms of BPA may bring a better understanding of the risks of BPA exposure in humans and provide an important platform on which human health can be improved.

AB In order to uncover the remarkable pathogenic genes or molecular pathological process in Parkinson's disease (PD), we employed a microarray analysis upon the cellular PD model induced by rotenone. Compared to the control group, 2174 genes were screened out to be expressed differently in the rotenone-induced group by certain criterion. GO analysis and the pathways analysis showed the significant enrichment of genes that were associated with the biological process of cell cycle, apoptotic process, organelle fusion, mitochondrial lesion, endoplasmic reticulum stress and so on. Among these significant DE genes, some were sorted out to be involved in cell cycle and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. As the PPI network analysis showed, the interaction relationship of the DEGs involved in the process of protein generation in endoplasmic reticulum(ER) was clearly showed up. As a prediction, we emphasized the genes EDEM1, ATF4, TRAF2 might play central roles in the protein misfolding process during the progression of Parkinson's disease and these new-found genes might be the future research focus and therapeutic targets in PD.

AB The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a highly efficient and convenient genome editing tool, which has been widely used for single or multiple gene mutation in a variety of organisms. Disruption of multiple homologous genes, which have similar DNA sequences and gene function, is required for the study of the desired phenotype. In this study, to test whether the CRISPR/Cas9 system works on the mutation of multiple homologous genes, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting three fucosyltransferases encoding genes (FUT1, FUT2 and SEC1) was designed. As expected, triple gene mutation of FUT1, FUT2 and SEC1 could be achieved simultaneously via a sgRNA mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system. Besides, significantly reduced serum fucosyltransferases enzymes activity was also determined in those triple gene mutation rabbits. Thus, we provide the first evidence that multiple homologous genes knockout (KO) could be achieved efficiently by a sgRNA mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system in mammals, which could facilitate the genotype to phenotype studies of homologous genes in future.

AB The present study shows the characterization of the chromosome 15 (SSC15) region that is highly rich in quantitative traits loci (QTLs) associated with pork quality, growth performance, fat and meat carcass contents. The analytic method that was utilized included targeted enrichment DNA sequencing and RNA hybridisation probes. The research included two pig breeds (Pulawska and Polish Landrace) that are significantly different in terms of carcass and meat quality features. Filtered sequences were aligned to the Sscrofa 10.2 assembly genome with the STAR aligner and GATK HaplotypeCaller was used for identified gene variants in SSC15 region. In Pulawska pigs, which were characterized by high meat quality, mutations were predominantly observed in non coding regions such as introns and intergenic regions. The highest over 50% frequencies of alternate alleles were identified in the introns of TNS1, VIL1 and USP37 genes. In the upstream gene regions of the Polish Landrace pigs, were observed more mutations than in the upstream gene regions of Pulawska. The present study showed interesting gene variant panel that could be analyzed in the further association studies in order to understand the impact on important productive pig traits.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of similar to 22-nt non-coding small RNA that play an important role in various metabolic processes, mainly through suppressing the expression of protein coding genes at post-transcriptional level. Drip loss (DL) is one of the most important meat quality traits affecting the end product yield and quality of pork. To date, the underlying regulatory factors involved in DL trait are still incompletely understood. In the present study, we constructed two small RNA libraries with longissimus dorsi muscles from the higher DL (WJJ-H group) and the lower DL (WJJ-L group) individuals, and applied RNA-Seq technology to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs between the two extreme phenotypes of DL groups. A total of 184 and 176 porcine known miRNAs were detected from WJJ-H and WJJ-L groups, respectively. Moreover, 73 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between two groups, of which 40 were up-regulated and 33 were down-regulated. In addition, 133 and 140 novel potential miRNAs were predicted from WJJ-H and WJJ-L groups, respectively. Notably, we preliminary confirmed that both miRNA-499 and miRNA-22 were potential candidates influencing DL trait by their expression pattern analysis. Overall, our data enhance the knowledge of porcine skeletal muscle miRNAs, and provide foundation for clarifying the miRNA regulatory mechanisms involved in DL trait.

AB Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) as its most severe clinical complication remain the leading causes of mortality in the majority of countries. Despite the progress in the treatment of MI, quite often the patients, after the first-time MI, develop subsequently a variety of adverse cardiovascular events. In this retrospective study we evaluated the contribution of allelic variations in 9p21.3 locus and in 21 atherogenesis-related genes to the development of hard cardiac events in a cohort of patients of Russian ethnicity after the first acute MI during long-term follow-up (7-10 years). Death from cardiac causes and recurrent nonfatal MI were considered as key clinical outcomes. We have shown the association of rs1333049 and rs10757278 in 9p21.3 and MTHFR rs1801133 with recurrent unfavorable events, the latter was observed in time-dependent manner. Multilocus analysis additionally suggested the influence of carriage of the CRP and ENOS genes variants at the development of subsequent adverse events after MI. The composite model built for prediction of the individual genetic risk of postinfarction hard cardiac events included 9p21.3 rs1333049*GG and MTHER*TT and was characterized by area under the curve (AUC) = 0.65. Our data show that 9p21.3 locus and MTHFR gene polymorphisms could influence long-term prognosis of recurrent hard cardiac events in patients who underwent the first MI. It is possible that addition of genotyping at such loci to existing clinical scores could improve their predictability.

AB A systems biology approach was used to study all the biofilm related genes of P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the interaction of titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase with biofilm related proteins. Among the 71 genes, the interactions of all the nodal pairs were extracted by STRING 10.5 database. The inter-relationship among these genes was predicted by constructing complete PPI network and visualized in Cytoscape v 3.4.0. Total number of nodes of the network was found to be 335 and edges were 795. The network was further investigated for its clusters and the best cluster was further analyzed for the hub proteins which significantly contribute in cross-regulation of the biofilm related process. The hub proteins were identified based on four topological parameters of degree, closeness, betweeness and radiality. Four major hub proteins of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were identified to be algD, gacS, rpoS and rpoN which were common in all the hubs. Further, we have also elucidated the probable mechanism of TiO2 interaction with P. aeruginosa PAO1 at molecular level. Using STITCH server, the major target gene of TiO2 was identified as katA which also appeared commonly in our main dataset and this gene has been focused for the further study because of its unique common appearance in gene-gene network as well as gene-anatase network. The direct interacting partners of katA were found to be dnaK, hfq, rpoS and rpoA. Based on these findings and available gene regulatory information, probable TiO2 interacting cascade has been represented. This in silico study of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm genes and the interaction of protein products with TiO2 might be significant to understand the perspective pathogenic resistance as well as the toxicity research pertaining to nanoparticles.

AB Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This study aims to explore molecular mechanism of NSCLC.
   Methods: Microarray dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and analyzed by using GEO2R. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Then, STRING, Cytoscape and MCODE were applied to construct the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and screen hub genes. Following, overall survival (OS) analysis of hub genes was performed by using the Kaplan-Meier plotter online tool. Moreover, miRecords was also applied to predict the targets of the differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs).
   Results: A total of 228 DEGs were identified, and they were mainly enriched in the terms of cell adhesion molecules, leukocyte transendothelial migration and ECM-receptor interaction. A PPI network was constructed, and 16 hub genes were identified, including TEK, ANGPTI, MMP9, VWF, CDH5, EDN1, ESAM, CCNE1, CDC45, PRC1, CCNB2, AURKA, MELK, CDC20, TOP2A and PTTG1. Among the genes, expressions of 14 hub genes were associated with prognosis of NSCLC patients. Additionally, a total of 11 DEMs were also identified.
   Conclusion: Our results provide some potential underlying biomarkers for NSCLC. Further studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of NSCLC.

AB In this study, the waste heat recovery performance of a hexagonal thermoelectric generator (TEG) was investigated experimentally. Based on the system configuration and dimensions, a total of 18 thermoelectric modules (TEMs) were used for thermal energy harvesting. The internal finned structures of the hexagonal TEG were placed on the inner surface of the exhaust gas channel, in consideration of the thermal resistance and friction factor, in order to augment the heat transfer from the exhaust gas to the thermoelectric modules (TEMs), under various operating conditions. The surface of the TEMs was positioned on the hexagonal-shaped exhaust gas channel surface, whereas the other surface of the TEMs was maintained cool by a set of coolers through which the engine coolant flowed. The coolant line was modified in order to induce a total coolant flow of 10 LPM at 353 K from a coolant controller to the hexagonal TEG. In this study, the assembled hexagonal TEG was installed in the middle of the exhaust gas pipe of the internal combustion engine manufactured for hybrid electric vehicles, and was used as the heat source. The waste heat recovery performance of the hexagonal TEG was evaluated by considering eight engine-operating conditions under which the automotive vehicles were most frequently driven. The output power of the hexagonal TEG tended to increase with the increase in engine speed and load, and ranged between 21.2 and 98.8 W, which corresponded to a conversion efficiency of similar to 1.3-2.6%. An acceptable maximum pressure drop across the hexagonal TEG of similar to 2.1 kPa was observed for the maximum exhaust gas flow rate condition.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal operating conditions and performance for the design of ORC based biomass compact CHP for 2 kW of electric, 25 kW of thermal power productions and 60 degrees C warm water supply. Eight organic working fluids were selected based on thermo-physical properties and related environmental regulations: cyclopentane, isopentane, n-pentane, diethyl ether, HFO-1233zd, HFC-245fa, HFE7000 and HFE-7100. The selected organic fluids were classified into three groups considering latent heat and boiling point. The group A fluids contained cyclopentane, isopentane, n-pentane and diethyl ether. The group B fluids contained HFO-1233zd and HFC-245fa. The group C fluids contained HFE-7000 and HFE-7100. A micro CHP system composed of a biomass boiler (200 degrees C heat source), an ORC power cycle and a cooling water line (20 degrees C cooling water supply) was modeled in four variants depending on whether post-heater and IHE were applied or not. The subcritical ORC cycle and saturated vapor state at the inlet of the expander were considered for the analysis. As a result of thermodynamic analyses and optimizations, the group A fluids have the best CHP performance because of the greatest latent heat amount. The systems using the group A fluids have the lowest mass flow rates from 0.053 kg/s to 0.081 kg/s, the lowest required heat supplies from 31.64 kW to 34.61 kW, the highest ORC efficiencies from 5.95% to 7.29% and the CHP efficiencies from 71.83% to 72.32%. The group B fluids have the mass flow rates from 0.157 to 0.215 kg/s, the highest required heat supplies from 36.98 kW to 46.41 kW, the lowest system efficiencies from 4.59% to 6.05% and the highest CHP efficiencies from 72.05% to 73.41%. The group C fluids have the highest mass flow rates from 0.213 kg/s to 0.230 kg/s, the required heat supplies from 32.30 kW to 40.54 kW, the system efficiencies from 5.07% to 6.36% and the lowest CHP efficiencies from 71.31% to 72.33%. In addition, ORC systems using the group A or group C fluids can operate at low pressure and can meet system requirements with low cooling water mass flow rate because of the high boiling points. For the group A fluids, both post-heater and IHE are very effective for the system, and the system using the group B fluids can highly improve the system through the application of the post-heater. For the group C fluids, application of the IHE significantly improves system performance.

AB As the environmental regulations have become more stringent, the shipping industry has been focusing on more efficient and environmentally friendly means of propulsion and electric power generation. In this respect, dual fuel engines, which operate either in diesel mode or dual fuel (DF) mode by burning diesel fuel or natural gas and pilot diesel fuel to initiate ignition respectively, has become one of the most promising solutions as their dual fuel operation leads to reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as almost elimination of particulate matter (PM) and sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions. The present study focuses on the comprehensive investigation of a large marine two-stroke dual fuel engine of the low gas pressure concept by using the GT-Power software. Appropriate combustion, scavenging, heat transfer and friction models were used to fully represent the engine performance and emissions characteristics, whereas a knocking model was employed to characterise the engine abnormal combustion. The simulation results were initially validated against the manufacturer data and subsequently, the entire engine envelope in both operating modes was simulated. The derived results were used for analysing and discussing the engine operation, performance and emissions as well as for comparing the two operating modes in terms of the turbocharger matching. In addition, a parametric investigation was performed in the dual fuel mode and the results were used for identifying the settings that can further optimise the engine operation in terms of CO2 and NOx emissions trade-off. The results indicate that the CO2 and NOx emissions can be simultaneously reduced; however, the engine optimisation in the high load region is challenging due to the permissible cylinder pressure constraint.

AB Power augmentation features have been proven as one of the wind turbine performance enhancement methods particularly for vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Researches showed that with the aid of a deflector, shroud or a single plate, the power output of a VAWT can be increased remarkably. In this paper, lab tests and simulations were performed to investigate the aerodynamic effects and the flow field around a flat plate deflector as a power augmentation device which is placed at the lower upstream of a micro H-rotor VAWT. From the study, the deflector is able to induce a high velocity wind at the near-wake region which was about 25% higher compared to the oncoming wind velocity. The deflected wind flows improve the performance significantly as well as reduce the self-start velocity of the turbine. Nonetheless, it is highly dependent on the positioning of the flat plate deflector. Both experiment and simulation showed a notable observation on the position effect of the flat plate deflector. From the lab test, with the deflector at the optimal position, the maximum coefficient of power (C-p) achieved was 7.4% increment compared to the bare turbine. Also, from the simulation, the optimal position showed an improvement of averaged C-p up to 33% compared to the bare turbine. The flat plate deflector is simple, low cost, and can be easily retrofitted to existing stand-alone VAWT systems to improve the efficiency making them suitable for on-site power generation in urban and isolated places.

AB A considerable amount of global energy consumption is attributable to the machining energy consumption of the machine tool. Thus, reducing the machining energy consumption can alleviate the energy crisis and energy related environmental pollution. It has been approved that feature sequencing is an effective and economical approach to reduce the machining energy consumption. The single objective model that only minimises the machining energy consumption has been developed in previous research. However, the machining time and deviation, which are also affected by the feature sequence, have not been considered. Thus, this article first aims to understand and model the sequence-related machining time, deviation, and energy consumption (S-MT, S-MD, and S-MEC) while machining a part. Accordingly, a multi-objective feature sequencing problem, which optimises the trade-off among S-MT, S-MD, and S-MEC, is introduced. To solve it, two optimisation approaches, including Non-dominated Inserting Enumeration Algorithm (NIEA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), are proposed and employed. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the developed models and the optimisation approaches. The experiment results show that the optimal or near-optimal solution sets can be obtained for eight machine parts. By comparison, 20.51% S-MT, 5.29% S-MD, and 16.66% S-MEC can be reduced. Between the two algorithms, NIEA is recommended for the part that has fewer than 12 features. Finally, more optimisation approaches for the multi-objective problem are proposed and discussed.

AB This work aimed to numerically study the effect of hydrogen injection strategies on mixture formation and combustion process in a hydrogen direct injection plus natural gas port injection (HDI + NGPI) rotary engine. Two major factors, namely hydrogen injection timing (HIT) and hydrogen injection angle (HIA), were considered. Four HITs which were used in simulation, were from the early stages of intake stroke to the late stages of compression stoke. Comparing the fuel movement and combustion process among the four HITs with three HIAs (-60 degrees, 0 degrees and 60 degrees), it was found that for hydrogen movement, when the HIT was at early stages of intake stroke, this advanced HIT led to the fact that the hydrogen distribution areas at ignition timing all spread across the whole combustion chamber for all three HIA cases. When the HIT was at the late stages of the intake stroke and the whole compression stroke, with an increased hydrogen injection angle (HIA) (from -60 degrees, 0 degrees to 60 degrees), the hydrogen accumulation area moved from the front towards the rear of combustion chamber. In addition, with retarded HIT, the hydrogen aggregation degree increased continuously. For combustion process, to obtain a higher overall combustion rate, the hydrogen injection strategy should make as much hydrogen spread between the two spark plugs at ignition timing. In addition, the hydrogen concentration near the LSP and the TSP should be conducive to the flame kernel formation. This is mainly because of the fact that the above hydrogen distributions, not only lead to the rapid formation of the flame kernel near the LSP and the TSP, but also make use of the hydrogen at the early stage of combustion stroke. Under the computational condition, the overall combustion rate for case A: 140 - 60 which had a HIT of 140 degrees CA (BTDC) and a HIA of -60 degrees CA, was the fastest. Compared with case C: 300 + 60 which had a HIT of 300 degrees CA (BTDC) and a HIA of 60 degrees CA, the peak pressure of case A: 140 - 60 was raised by 31.1%. However, compared with other cases, the NO emissions of case A: 140 - 60 at 80 degrees CA (ATDC) was the maximum. Furthermore, for engineering applications, this study also provided a scheme of the change of the optimum HIA under different HITs for improving the performance of the HDI + NGPI rotary engine.

AB A TEG module with 199 thermoelectric (TE) couples was simulated with constant and variable property parameters respectively. It is indicated that the simulative results with variable property parameters are closer to the experimental results. Meanwhile, it is found that the open circuit voltage and output power are proportional to the number of TE couples. The parameterized rectangle-TEG(R-TEG) and circle-TEG(C-TEG) modules with 2 TE couples were established respectively; it was found that the performances of TEG have not relevant to the shape of TE couple. When the hot side temperature is constant, the internal resistance, the open circuit voltage and the efficiency increased but the output power decreased with the decrease of cross sectional area; when the cross sectional area is constant, the open circuit voltage, output power and efficiency increased with the increase of the hot side temperature. The intersection of the respective output power and efficiency of R-TEG and C-TEG are regarded as an optimized value. The performances of the optimized R-TEG and the original TEG are compared, it can be seen that their output power and efficiency increase with the increase of hot side temperature. The maximum output power and efficiency of the optimized R-TEG can reach to 91.88 W and 4.5% respectively.

AB The kinetics of microalgae pyrolysis is investigated to analyze the thermal degradation of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in different species of microalgae. The pyrolysis processes of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31, Nannochioropsis oceanica CY2, and Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4 are examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and independent parallel reaction (IPR) model is adopted to approach the pyrolysis kinetics. To maximize the fit quality between the established kinetic models and experimental data, particle swarm optimization (PSO), a kind of evolutionary computation, is employed. The thermal degradation characteristics of the three microalgal species are compared with each other. The results suggest that the thermal degradation curves of the three microalgae can be predicted with a fit quality of at least 97.9%. The activation energies of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the microalgae are in the ranges of 53.28-53.30, 142.61-188.35, and 40.21-59.23 kJ mol(-1), respectively, while the thermal degradation of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are in temperature ranges of 164-497, 209-309, and 200-635 degrees C, respectively. It is proved in this work that the IPR model and the calculation of the PSO can be used to predict the pyrolysis kinetics of microalgae to a good level of fitness.

AB In this paper, hybrid-coprecipitation and combustion methods were used to synthesis MgAl2O4 spinel. Of interest was also to evaluate the effect of different synthesis methods on the characteristics and performance of MgO/MgAl2O4 catalyst in biodiesel production. Physicochemical characteristics of synthesized catalysts were evaluated by XRD, FESEM, surface particle size distribution (SPSD), EDX-Dot Mapping, BET-BJH and FTIR analysis. Moreover, the final performance of the samples was investigated in biodiesel production. The results of the XRD analysis showed that the highest crystallinity and crystal size belonged to the sample synthesized by the combustion method. Furthermore, the FESEM analysis showed that the sample synthesized by the combustion method had a unique morphology and the other samples had almost the same morphology. The BET-BJH analysis indicated that the least surface area and pore volume were related to the sample prepared by the combustion method. However, by perusing the samples in biodiesel production, it was found that the combustion prepared sample had the largest conversion value (95.7%) and great reusability (6 cycles). According to the total analysis, it can be said that the size and shape of the pores as well as the catalyst crystallinity are the most important specifications for biodiesel production.

AB This paper presents a new hybrid system to reduce wind curtailment and improve scheduling flexibility. This hybrid system includes a wind farm, a concentrated solar power plant with thermal energy storage, and an electric heater. The major role of the electric heater is to convert the redundant wind power into thermal energy, and the thermal energy is stored in the thermal energy storage of the concentrated solar power plant. The optimal scheduling of this hybrid system is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to maximize the profit subjected to technical constraints. The effects of the electric heater on the system are studied under different weather conditions. The test results show that the electric heater is helpful for reduction of the both deviation from generation plan and wind curtailment. The maximum relative deviation falls from 5.15% to 0% during the clear sky day, and 47.49% to 31.74% during the partial cloudy day. The wind curtailment rate decreases by 52.59% and 100% for clear and partial cloudy days, respectively. An annual simulation for the system shows that the overall daily cumulative deviations of the new system are significantly decreased, and the wind curtailment can be reduced by greater than 90% for 151 days, validating the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB As one of promising renewable energy, wind energy has an important position in the field of energy market and it has been always used to generate electricity, thus, the high precision wind speed forecasting is important but challenging for power generation system. Many researchers have devoted their attention to establish efficient Wind speed forecasting models, limited by the structure of original models and database, these models could not solve overfitting problem very well and it is rare that a single wind speed forecasting model is always best in all cases since each model has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. The combining method, composed of multiple forecasting models, is regarded as a type of outstanding approach to take advantage of strengths of each model. However, the properties of the individual forecasting models may vary over time, which leads to poorly performance of the combining method using fixed weights, thus, it is more appropriate to allow the combining weights to change according to the time-varying underlying process. This study develops a reliable combination model for wind speed forecasting based on an improved Adaboost algorithm named time-vary-forecasting-effectiveness (TW-FE-Adaboost) algorithm in order to improve the overall forecasting accuracy. In the proposed model, concept drift is firstly used to deal with wind speed time series mainly because the contributions of samples which are varying with time, the second order forecasting effectiveness is used to measure the performance of weak learners. Then, the multi-step ahead forecasting for each site is conducted using TW-FE-Adaboost model in which the input-output sample pairs are determined in a reasonable way. Finally, the ultimate forecast result of wind speed is obtained by aggregating the forecast result of each weak learner. The proposed model is tested using four sites wind speed series collected in Hexi corridor from wind farms located in northwest of China. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all other comparison models in this paper, which demonstrates that the proposed model has superior performances for wind speed forecasting.

AB Chemical looping air separation (CLAS) is considered as a promising method for providing an efficient and economic oxygen supply for integration into oxy-fuel combustion power plants. This study is the first to develop a process model, identify the process characteristics, and optimize the thermodynamic behavior for CLAS processes using fluidized bed reactors. In the process developed model, a fast fluidized bed model and a bubbling fluidized bed model are used to respectively represent the oxidation reactor and the reduction reactor, while fluidized bed hydrodynamics and oxygen carrier redox reaction kinetics are considered to grasp the unique characteristics of CLAS process. The effects of operating parameters on CLAS operation are identified and observed that high reduction temperature and high fluidizing gas flow rate can enhance oxygen carrier conversion and reduce energy penalty in the reduction reactor. Multi-variable optimization to minimize specified energy consumption illustrates that, 38.1% energy savings can be achieved and the optimal oxidation operating temperature, reduction operating temperature, air flow rate, and fluidizing gas flow rate are determined as 830 degrees C, 950 degrees C, 1133.7 L/h, and 58.4 L/h, respectively. These results are valuable for use by engineers to optimize the process design and achieve energy-efficient operation for CLAS processes.

AB In order to further improve the efficiency of the gas turbine, a novel combined supercritical CO2 regenerative cycle and organic Rankine cycle using zeotropic mixtures for waste heat recovery of gas turbine is proposed. The zeotropic mixtures used in the present study are cyclopentane/R365mfc. Exergoeconomic analysis is reported for the proposed system and parametric studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of system parameters on the exergy efficiency and the unit cost of electricity. The multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm is chosen to obtain the optimum system parameters. The results show that the overall values of the exergoeconomic factor, the optimal exergy efficiency and the optimal unit cost of electricity of the proposed system are 31.88%, 62.23% and 3.95 cent/kW h, respectively. The obtained result reveals the superiority of the proposed combined regenerative S-CO2 cycle and ORC system compared to the combined basic S-CO2 cycle and ORC system, the combined recompression S-CO2 cycle and ORC system. Therefore, the proposed system is suitable for gas turbine waste heat recovery, and it has advantages of deep utilization of waste heat, high efficiency and low cost.

AB An experimental investigation was conducted on a single cylinder, VCR diesel engine for various biodiesel-diesel blends with varying load conditions (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 kg). Aim of present work was to examine physicochemical characteristics, performance and exhausts emissions of the engine for various load conditions using biodiesel produced from a non-edible feedstock, Jatropha curcus line and its various blends. Jatropha curcus methyl esters (JCMEs) were synthesized by two stage chemical processes i.e. esterification followed by transesterification, as the feedstock comprises high free fatty acid content of 6.16 mg of KOH/g. Sulfuric acid was employed as acid catalyst in esterification stage at optimized molar ratio of 1:6 (oil:methanol), 1.0% v/v H2SO4 and 60 min of reaction time at 65 +/- 0.5 degrees C temperature to ensure reduction of initial FFA from 6.16 to 0.3 mg of KOH/g. In second stage, transesterification was performed where 1:20 M ratio (oil:methanol), 1.5 wt% potassium impregnated zinc oxide 60IC/Zn0.900 as heterogeneous base catalyst, at a temperature of 65 +/- 0.5 degrees C with 600 rpm agitation speed for time 55 min conditions resulted in 97.00% conversion of JCMEs. Synthesis of biodiesel was ascertained by FTIR and NMR (C-13 and H-1) techniques. The reusability studies reveled that catalyst can be reused up to five successive reaction cycles with no significant decrease of its catalytic activity. In order to understand, reaction rate constant and activation energy required for the reaction, kinetics of the process was also investigated. Different JCMEs blends were prepared as JB10%, JB20%, JB30%, JB100% and B00% (diesel fuel) on volume basis with diesel fuel. All blends had shown the promising results of important physicochemical properties such as density, calorific value, flash point, fire point and cetane index as per ASTM standards. Furthermore, the influence of these prepared blends on engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated under various load conditions. As compared with diesel fuel, blended fuel resulted in improved performance of engine as indicated by high brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). In terms of exhaust gas emissions, all blended fuels resulted in lower carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as higher hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous oxide (NOx), and oxygen (O-2) emissions. The study concludes that the blended fuel can be used as tenacious source of eco-friendly and alternative fuel for commercial engine as it has been observed for better performance and exhaust emissions profile as compared with diesel fuel.

AB A new improvement of chemical looping gasification (CLG) process is based on microwave pretreatment, which is expected to obtain the kinetics analysis of CLG process for the utilization of microalgae. Thermo-gravimetric characteristics of CLG on Chlorella vulgaris are studied in a thermo-gravimetric analyzer under different heating rates and pretreatment conditions. TG characteristics, weight loss rate, reactivity rate, Homogeneous Model (HM) and Shrinking Core Model (SCM) were investigated in order to study the influence of microwave pretreatment on the CLG kinetics for the utilization of microalgae. The results indicated that microwave pretreatment would improve the TG characteristics and reactivity of microalgae. Moreover, the reactivity rate of CLG increased by 5.77% compared with SiO2: Chlorella and it would increase by 6.79% after microwave pretreatment. Furthermore, the higher the heating rate was, the greater the reactivity and weight loss rate of were. Further, HM could simulate CLG better than SCM. Microwave pretreatment could reduce the activation energy of Chlorella vulgaris and promote CLG. As a result, microwave pretreatment was beneficial to CLG reaction.

AB Based on the study of the effect of different final pyrolysis temperatures on the production of bio-oil by catalytic microwave pyrolysis of sludge, a mathematical model has been used to accurately calculate the calorific value of each component in the bio-oil mixture, making it enable to study the variations in the calorific value of bio-oil at a final pyrolysis temperature from a single-component perspective. Results showed that the yield and calorific value of bio-oil reached the maximum at 22.60% and 35.47 MJ kg(-1), respectively, with iron oxide as a catalyst, increasing by 5.16% and 16.83% compared with those without a catalyst. The calculation model based on Huggett's oxygen consumption method realized the accurate calculation of the calorific value of a single component in the bio-oil, which could explain why the calorific value of the bio-oil mixture varies with the final pyrolysis temperature. The relative deviation between the model calculating value and the measured value of the component was lower than 5%. The content of fatty hydrocarbons and high-carbon compounds gradually decreased with temperature increased. Increasing temperature leaded to the breakage of chemical bonds of the high-carbon compounds and the formation of low-carbon compounds, which resulted in a decrease in the calorific value of bio-oil. The content of high-calorific value components, such as octadecane and docosane, reached a maximum of 35.78% in the bio-oil mixture at 550 degrees C, which was significantly higher than the contents at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C. This result may explain why the calorific value of the bio-oil mixture was obviously higher at 550 degrees C.

AB Hybridization of solar and biomass energies, as two types of renewables, represents a resourceful way of complementing each other to overcome their individual drawbacks. In the present work, two novel solar-biomass hybrid power generation systems are proposed, modeled and compared with each other as well as with the standard biomass-based system without solar energy. In both the proposed systems biomass is first gasified in a gasifier and then syngas is used in a gas turbine plant combined with a Rankine cycle. In proposed systems the solar energy is used in the bottoming Rankine cycle, where the first system employs it in an indirect way to heat the feed water before deaerator while the second system adopts the solar energy in direct steam generation mode to generate additional steam for low pressure steam turbine. Thermodynamic and economic models are developed to investigate the systems' performances from the viewpoints of energy, exergy, economic and environmental. According to the results of economic evaluation, the levelized cost of electricity for standard, the first and second proposed configurations are obtained 79.34, 79.88 and 74.94 $/MWh, respectively. Also, the values of 0.79, 0.77 and 0.62 t/MWh are calculated for CO2 emission for standard, the first and second proposed configurations, respectively.

AB In this study, the thermodynamics, combustion and emission characteristics of a NG-diesel dual fuel engine with varying pilot injection degree at low speed and low load were investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and bench test. Based on tested in-cylinder pressure, the in-cylinder combustion process of NG-diesel dual fuel engine was quantitatively analyzed. On this basis, both the one-dimensional and three-dimensional CFD simulated models were built and then validated by tested data, which were used to analyze the combustion and emission characteristics of NG-diesel dual fuel engine. From this study, the effects of advanced pilot injection degree (AND) on the thermodynamics, combustion and emission characteristics of NG-diesel dual fuel engine were found. With the advancing of pilot injection degree, both the SOC and 50% combustion position are advanced, which leads the maximum in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) to increase. The 10-50% combustion duration decreases slightly but the 50-90% combustion duration increases obviously. Meanwhile, both the effective expansion efficiency (EEE) and the percent of heat transfer loss increase, while their increase rates are different, which make the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) firstly increase and then decrease. The BSNOx increases largely while the BSTHC is almost unchanged with the advance of injection timing. Although more HC is generated in the early stage as the pilot injection degree is retarded, the post-combustion becomes clear which accelerates the oxidation of HC. All these have provided theoretical guidance and data support for improving the performance of NG-diesel dual fuel engine.

AB To respond to the global climate change, Taiwan has announced an ambitious target for the development of renewable energy, which is characterized by solar power 20 GW and wind power 4.2 GW by 2025, but the intermittency of renewable energy sources might have serious impacts on the existing power grid. Not only the energy system but also water resources will be impacted by the global climate change. In Taiwan, the strength of rainfall increases but the frequency of rain decreases; this factor combined with a disadvantageous topography to store rainfall worsens the water-shortage issues. As a solution of the aforementioned issues related to the renewable energy sources and water resources concurrently, an integrated system and its operating model for renewable energy sources and water resources are proposed according to which hydropower, pumped-storage hydropower, solar power, wind power, desalination plants and the conjunctive use of water between two reservoirs are considered. A mathematical model is established to describe how the system works under various input data. The results show that, with a retrofit of existing old units and the addition of 102-MW new units, the hydropower unit of the proposed system can eliminate a requirement of 853-MW gas-fired power plants during peak loading in the reference case; the cost, US$45 million per year, of power generation can be saved. With 1099-MW pumped-storage hydropower units added, the proposed system and its operating model further enhance the peak-loading support; relative to a battery-storage system in the reference case, the cost of energy storage can save US$166 million per year. As for the desalination plants in the proposed system, the cost of producing water still exceeds that of the planned reservoir in the reference case because of its greater cost of operation. On considering the total benefit from the water and energy sector, the extra expense, US$41 million per year, for desalination can, however, be readily compensated; the proposed system can save more, US$171 million per year, than the reference case.

AB In this paper, a finned heat pipe assisted passive heat sink based on a newly emerging high performance phase change material (PCM), the low melting point metal (LMPM), was developed for thermal buffering of high power electronics which works intermittently with heat generation rate up to 1000 W (10 W/cm(2)). Firstly, thermal performances of the PCM heat sink under different thermal shocks (from 200 W to 1000 W) were experimentally evaluated, in comparison with that of an organic PCM which has similar melting point. It was found that, the former one can prolong the working duration 1.4-2.4 times that of the latter one. Then, the performance of the heat sink was improved through reducing the contact thermal resistance and by increasing the fin number. Furtherly, an air cooling radiator was configured to accelerate the solidification process of the PCM module, which makes it capable of maintaining its highest temperature below 85 degrees C under 1000 W periodic thermal shock (10 min on and 15 min off). Moreover, energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis was conducted to verify the compatibility of the LMPM PCM and the structural materials. Finally, a simplified numerical model was developed and validated for the currently constructed finned heat pipe assisted LMPM PCM heat sink, which can be much helpful for future practical thermal design and optimization of this kind of thermal buffering module.

AB Biometric systems based on retinal image analysis are of interest for highly accurate person verification. In this framework, we present a person verification method involving retina segmentation, co-registration, feature extraction and matching. All processes are based on the construction and use of a direction map and of an associated score map. An interesting feature of the method is the possibility to accomplish satisfactorily person verification also when the retinal image is not fully available at high quality, as it could be the case due to aging or retinal diseases of the subject. The proposed approach has been tested on the two publicly available datasets specifically created for evaluating biometric systems for retinal image based person verification, VARIA and RIDB. The approach has been compared with the other verification methods in the recent literature for which an evaluation on the above datasets is available. The experimental results confirm the goodness of the proposed approach and show that direction and score maps have a key role in person verification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The permutation flow shop scheduling problem is one of the most studied operations research related problems. Literally, hundreds of exact and approximate algorithms have been proposed to optimise several objective functions. In this paper we address the total tardiness criterion, which is aimed towards the satisfaction of customers in a make-to-order scenario. Although several approximate algorithms have been proposed for this problem in the literature, recent contributions for related problems suggest that there is room for improving the current available algorithms. Thus, our contribution is twofold: First, we propose a fast beam-search-based constructive heuristic that estimates the quality of partial sequences without a complete evaluation of their objective function. Second, using this constructive heuristic as initial solution, eight variations of an iterated-greedy-based algorithm are proposed. A comprehensive computational evaluation is performed to establish the efficiency of our proposals against the existing heuristics and metaheuristics for the problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Group recommendation; Group activity; Decision making; Topic model;

AB In this paper, a Topic-based probabilistic model named GIST is proposed to infer group activities, and make group recommendations. Compared with existing individual-based aggregation methods, it not only considers individual members' interest, but also consider some subgroups' interest. Intuition might seem that when a group of users want to take part in an activity, not every group member is decisive, instead, more likely the subgroups of members having close relationships lead to the final activity decision. That motivates our study on jointly considering individual members' choices and subgroups' choices for group recommendations. Based on this, our model uses two kinds of unshared topics to model individual members' interest and subgroups' interest separately, and then make final recommendations according to the choices from the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. Moreover, the link information in the graph topology of the groups can be used to optimize the weights of our model. The experimental results on real-life data show that the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved by GIST comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The bankruptcy prediction research domain continues to evolve with many new different predictive models developed using various tools. Yet many of the tools are used with the wrong data conditions or for the wrong situation. Using the Web of Science, Business Source Complete and Engineering Village databases, a systematic review of 49 journal articles published between 2010 and 2015 was carried out. This review shows how eight popular and promising tools perform based on 13 key criteria within the bankruptcy prediction models research area. These tools include two statistical tools: multiple discriminant analysis and Logistic regression; and six artificial intelligence tools: artificial neural network, support vector machines, rough sets, case based reasoning, decision tree and genetic algorithm. The 13 criteria identified include accuracy, result transparency, fully deterministic output, data size capability, data dispersion, variable selection method required, variable types applicable, and more. Overall, it was found that no single tool is predominantly better than other tools in relation to the 13 identified criteria. A tabular and a diagrammatic framework are provided as guidelines for the selection of tools that best fit different situations. It is concluded that an overall better performance model can only be found by informed integration of tools to form a hybrid model. This paper contributes towards a thorough understanding of the features of the tools used to develop bankruptcy prediction models and their related shortcomings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Opinion mining using ensemble text hidden Markov models for text

AB With the rapid growth of social media, text mining is extensively utilized in practical fields, and opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, plays an important role in analyzing opinion and sentiment in texts. Methods in opinion mining generally depend on a sentiment lexicon, which is a set of predefined key words that express sentiment. Opinion mining requires proper sentiment words to be extracted in advance and has difficulty classifying sentences that imply an opinion without using any sentiment key words. This paper presents a new sentiment analysis method, based on text-based hidden Markov models (TextHMMs), for text classification that uses a sequence of words in training texts instead of a predefined sentiment lexicon. We sought to learn text patterns representing sentiment through ensemble TextHMMs. Our method defines hidden variables in TextHMMs by semantic cluster information in consideration of the co-occurrence of words, and thus calculates the sentiment orientation of sentences by fitted TextHMMs. To reflect diverse patterns, we applied an ensemble of TextHMM-based classifiers. In the experiments with a benchmark data set, we show that this method is superior to some existing methods and particularly has potential to classify implicit opinions. We also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method in a real-life data set of online market reviews. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an increasingly used treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, acute allograft rejection is still a problem in postoperative care of liver transplantation with immunosuppressive therapy and it can lead to allograft damage and harm the survival of liver transplantation patient. This work proposes to use data-driven approach to build a predictive model for acute rejection. We consider not only prediction accuracy, but also interpretability of the prediction outcome in building the predictive model, so that the medical staffs can identify how the prediction is induced from data. The experiments use the real data provided by liver transplantation intensive care unit (ICU) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. In this work, the data is from a medical center, in which the patient data ranges from 2004 to 2013, and the number of data records is approximately 2 million. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using a large-scale database to focus on liver transplantation and generate interpretable rules that could be used by medical staffs. We compare with several methods, including SVM, ANN and random forest, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed method is comparative, and provides interpretable results. Central to the proposed method is to consider interpretability, and the goal is to provide interpretable results for the medical staffs to make decisions. The proposed transformation algorithms belong to data-driven approaches, so they could be applied to other intelligent or expert systems. Moreover, the outcomes are presented in rule format, which could be used by medical staffs and other expert systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RATINGS; MODEL
AB Information filtering is a key task in scenarios with information overload. Group Recommender Systems (GRSs) filter content regarding groups of users preferences and needs. Both the recommendation method and the available data influence recommendation quality. Most researchers improved group recommendations through the proposal of new algorithms. However, it has been pointed out that the ratings are not always right because users can introduce noise due to factors such as context of rating or user's errors. This introduction of errors without malicious intentions is named natural noise, and it biases the recommendation. Researchers explored natural noise management in individual recommendation, but few explored it in GRSs. The latter ones apply crisp techniques, which results in a rigid management. In this work, we propose Natural Noise Management for Groups based on Fuzzy Tools (NNMG-FT). NNMG-FT flexibilises the detection and correction of the natural noise to perform a better removal of natural noise influence in the recommendation, hence, the recommendations of a latter GRS are then improved.

ID REPRESENTATION; MODEL
AB Object Bank (OB) is a high-level image representation encoding semantic and spacial information, and has superior performance in scene classification tasks. However, the dimensionality of OB feature is high, which demands massive computation. Existing dimensionality reduction methods for OB are incapable of achieving both high classification accuracy and substantial dimensionality reduction simultaneously. In order to solve this problem, we propose a threshold value filter pooling method to avoid noise accumulation in histogram-pooling and represent more useful information than max-pooling. We also propose a Matthew effect normalization method to highlight the useful information, and thus boost the performance of OB-based image scene classification. Finally, we apply these two methods in a dimensionality reduction framework to simplify OB representation and construct more proper descriptors, and thus achieve both dimensionality reduction and classification accuracy increase. We evaluated our framework on three real-world datasets, namely, event dataset UIUC-Sports, natural scene dataset LabelMe, and mixture dataset 15-Scenes. The classification results demonstrate that our framework not only obtains accuracies similar to or higher than the original OB representation, but also reduces the dimensionality significantly. The computational complexity analysis shows that it can reduce the time complexity of classification. Therefore, our framework can improve OB-based image scene classification through both computational complexity reduction and accuracy increase. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wine polymeric material (WPM), which includes polysaccharides, proteins, and polyphenolic compounds, interacts with anthocyanins. To determine the contribution of polysaccharides in these interactions, the diffusion performance of anthocyanins along a dialysis membrane was determined in the presence and absence of isolated mannoproteins (MP) and arabinogalactans (AG) from WPM. Furthermore, to estimate the extent of the interaction between WPM and polyphenolic compounds, the activation energy (Ea) required for their diffusion in the presence of WPM was determined. AG, generally more abundant than MP in wine, interact in a greater extent with anthocyanins, showing their relevant contribution for WPM/anthocyanins interactions. The Ea for the diffusion of polyphenolic compounds in presence of WPM indicated the occurrence of interactions with relative weak to strong intensities (2.6-50.8 kJ/mol). As not all polyphenolic compounds were able to be released from WPM, stronger interactions, possibly by covalent linkages, are involved, providing new insights on WPM/polyphenolic compounds relationships.

AB N-epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) is measured in food, but there is a controversy concerning the most convenient yet reliable method(s) for this task. This work compares three different ELISA assays and HPLC-ESI-ITMS/MS for the analysis of CML in several food items. The four methods showed the same decreasing order of CML concentration: beef, bacon > chicken > fish > dairy products > grain products > fruits/vegetables. HPLC-ESIITMS/ MS results highly correlated with those obtained by ELISA performed with monoclonal CML-antibody (beta = 0.98, p < 0.0001) whereas My Bio Source (R) kit results were not correlated with those provided by Lamider (R). Small differences of CML concentrations in food items prepared by different culinary treatment were clearly distinguished by HPLC-ESI-ITMS/MS, but could not always be detected by ELISA. This work demonstrates a reasonable relationship between CM determined by ELISA and HPLC-ESI-ITMS/MS and therefore supports the implementation of ELISA in food CML/AGEs screening.

AB Fresh-cut (FC) red pitaya fruit were treated with 5 g a.i.l(-1) apple polyphenols (APP) and then stored at 20 degrees C for up to 4 days to evaluate the effects on attributes. Results showed that FC pitaya fruit with APP treatment showed greater colour retention, delayed softening, reduced loss of soluble solids content, titratable acidity, betacyanin and total phenolics compared with untreated FC fruit. APP treatment also maintained antioxidant activity, as indicated by higher DPPH radical-scavenging activity and reducing power compared with untreated FC pitaya fruit. APP treatment strongly suppressed microbial growth, contributing to improvement of product safety. Because APP is a natural product, we propose that application of APP could be a convenient, safe and low-cost approach to maintain the quality and extend the shelf life of FC red pitaya fruit.

AB In this study, the degradation of polysaccharides from blackcurrant (BCP) was investigated. Two low-molecularweight polysaccharides (DBCP-1, DBCP-2) were obtained using Fe2+ with different concentrations of H2O2 solution. IR spectra showed DBCPs had obvious characteristic peaks of polysaccharides. GC analysis confirmed DBCPs were composed of the same monosaccharide units as BCP but with different molar ratios. NMR analysis indicated DBCPs and BCP had similar glycosidic linkage patterns. The surface area of fragmented structure in DBCPs was reduced compared to BCP, and they had no triple helix structure. The results of bioactivity assays indicated that DBCPs exhibited higher antioxidant, alpha-amylase and a-glucosidase inhibitory activities than BCP, and the degraded polysaccharides with the lower molecular weight possessed higher bioactivities. These results suggested that Fe2+ - H2O2 degradation did not change the main structure of polysaccharide and the degree of degradation could play a key role in the bioactivities of the polysaccharides.

AB Moroccan and French honeys from different geographical areas were classified and characterized by applying a voltammetric electronic tongue (VE-tongue) coupled to analytical methods. The studied parameters include color intensity, free lactonic and total acidity, proteins, phenols, hydroxymethylfurfural content (HMF), sucrose, reducing and total sugars. The geographical classification of different honeys was developed through threepattern recognition techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVMs) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Honey characterization was achieved by partial least squares modeling (PLS). All the PLS models developed were able to accurately estimate the correct values of the parameters analyzed using as input the voltammetric experimental data (i.e. r > 0.9). This confirms the potential ability of the VE-tongue for performing a rapid characterization of honeys via PLS in which an uncomplicated, costeffective sample preparation process that does not require the use of additional chemicals is implemented.

AB Commercial interest on the application of starch nanoparticles (SNP) in food is rapidly growing. Since gums are commonly used in food processing for their texturizing functionality, it is important to understand the influence of SNP on gum rheology.lambda-Carrageenan and xanthan gum were selected in this study due to their wide range of applications in food systems. SNP isolated from waxy (0% amylose) and high amylose maize (71% amylose) were used. Binary blends consisting of 0.5% (w/v) gum and different concentrations of SNP were prepared and their flow behaviors evaluated using a rheometer. The starch source, concentration and thermal stability of the SNP influenced the viscosity and viscoelastic properties of the gum-SNP blends, in particular in the low elasticity lambda-carrageenan. The blends containing high concentrations of high amylose maize SNP, when compared to waxy SNP, showed higher viscoelastic stability at temperatures up to 90 degrees C, possibly due to their higher thermal stability.

AB The effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) (12, 60 and 300 mu M/g protein) on the textural properties and stability of oxidized myofibrillar protein (MP) emulsion gels were investigated. A low dose (12 mu M/g) of RA significantly prevented the loss of thiol and epsilon-NH2 groups and the unfolding of the oxidized MP. However, a high dose of RA (300 mu M/g) covalently and non-covalently interacted with the MPs, which induced a significant loss of thiol and epsilon-NH2 groups and aggregation of the MPs, causing decreased solubility, resulting in a poor three-dimensional emulsion gel network, and hence, higher cooking loss and lower gel strength. Moreover, the emulsifying properties of the MP emulsion gel were jeopardized by 300 mu M/g RA. A high concentration of NaCl (0.6 M) enhanced the interaction between RA and MPs, increasing deterioration of the internal structure and leading to extremely unstable emulsifying properties of the MP emulsion gel.

AB In this study, electron spin resonance (ESR) and Raman spectroscopy were applied to characterize lipid oxidation of beef during repeated freeze-thaw (RFT). Besides the conventional indexes including peroxide values (PV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and acid values (AV) were evaluated, the radical and molecular structure changes were also measured by ESR and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that PV, TBARS and AV were increased (P < 0.05) after RFT. This suggested that lipid oxidation was occurred during RFT. With the increase of radical signal intensity, lower oxidation stability was presented by ESR. Raman intensity of nu(C=C) stretching region (1655 cm(-1)) was decreased during RFT. Furthermore, lower Raman intensity ratio of I-1655/I-1442, I-1655/I-1745 that determine total unsaturation was also observed. Significant correlations (p < 0.01) were obtained among conventional methods, ESR and Raman spectroscopy. Our result has proved that ESR and Raman spectroscopy showed great potential in characterizing lipid oxidation process of beef during RFT.

AB Increasing evidence indicates that crude extracts derived from mulberry confer protection against oxidative stress. However, the antioxidant capacity of mulberry extract among different cultivars remains elusive. The main objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the effect of black mulberry extract (BMB) and white mulberry extract (WMB) on ethyl carbamate (EC)-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. This study showed that the contents of total phenolics, total flavonoids, total procyanidins, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside of BMB were higher than that of WMB. Moreover, our results showed that phenolics-abundant BMB was stronger than WMB in scavenging ABTS and DPPH free radicals. BMB was more effective in ameliorating EC-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting excessive ROS generation, suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and increasing GSH concentration in HepG2 cells than WMB. Taken together, our study revealed that BMB afforded better protection against EC-caused cytotoxicity than WMB.

AB In this study, the effects of enzymatic hydrolysis of tallow and addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) were evaluated on the formation of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) esters and sensory characteristic of beef flavors. The enzymatic hydrolysis condition had significant effects on 3-MCPD mono/di-esters formation during the beef flavor preparation. Considering the safety and sensory characteristics of beef flavors, the optimal enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were selected as: lipase concentration 75 U/g tallow, tallow concentration 80% (w/v) and pH 7.0 at 47.5 degrees C for 9.5 h. Using the optimal enzymatic hydrolysis conditions, no 3-MCPD monoesters were detected and 3-MCPD-diesters concentration was strongly dependent on NaCl concentration and its addition moment (before or after thermal reaction) at different temperatures. In conclusion, beef flavor was prepared using the optimal hydrolysis conditions and heated at 110 degrees C for 100 min, then 10% NaCl was added when the system was cooled to 60 degrees C.

AB Phenylpropanoid glycosides (PPGs) are important bioactive polyphenolic compounds that are widely distributed in plants. In this paper, the inhibitory effects of four selected PPGs against trypsin were investigated. The interactions between these PPGs and trypsin were further investigated by multiple spectroscopic methods and molecular docking studies. The results showed that the binding of each of these PPGs to trypsin induced changes in the natural conformation of trypsin, which inhibited the enzyme in the following order: acteoside > syringalide A 3'-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside > lipedoside A-I > osmanthuside B. The binding constant (K-a) values followed the same trend. The hydrogen bond force played an important role in the interaction between each PPG and trypsin. Interestingly, the binding affinity and inhibitory effect increased as the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups increased. In addition, the effect of the phenolic hydroxyl group on the A ring had a greater effect than one on the B ring.

AB The study assessed the feasibility of developing a machine vision system based on pupil and gill color changes in tilapia for simultaneous prediction of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and total viable counts (TVC) during storage at 4 degrees C. The pupils and gills were chosen and color space conversion among RGB, HSI and L*a*b* color spaces was performed automatically by an image processing algorithm. Multiple regression models were established by correlating pupil and gill color parameters with TVB-N, TVC and TBA (R-2 = 0.989-0.999). However, assessment of freshness based on gill color is destructive and time-consuming because gill cover must be removed before images are captured. Finally, visualization maps of spoilage based on pupil color were achieved using image algorithms. The results show that assessment of tilapia pupil color parameters using machine vision can be used as a low-cost, on-line method for predicting freshness during 4 degrees C storage.

AB To investigate the non-aldehyde volatile profile resulting from deep-fat frying, volatile compounds formed during the processes of heating soybean oil (SO), frying wheat dough (WD), and frying chicken breast meat (CBM) were comparatively studied. By using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and internal standard method, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, ketones, nitrogen-containing volatiles (NCVs), and other volatiles were qualitatively and relatively quantitatively detected. NCVs were detected only in CBM-fried oil samples. Some volatiles (e.g. 2-pentylfuran and 2-pentylpyridine) were observed to increase in concentration, whereas others (e.g. 4-methyl-1,4-heptadiene and 7-methyl-3,4-octadiene) were observed to first increase and then decrease in concentration as the heating or frying time increased. Reduced quantity and concentrations of volatiles were observed in the food-fried oil samples which might be related to the intensified reactions induced by food components. The detection of some harmful volatiles in considerable concentrations indicated further attention might be paid to the safety of deep-fat frying.

AB A sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was established for the simultaneous determination of seven fluorescent whitening agents in flour matrix. Samples were ultrasonically extracted by trichloromethane-acetone. Then analytes were separated on a C18 column and detected by MS/MS. The developed method was validated in terms of the linearity, matrix effect, accuracy and precision. The method showed a good linearity (r > 0.997) for all analytes in their respective concentration ranges. The LOQ for seven analytes were in the range of 2.5-25.0 mu g/kg. The matrix effect was not significant and almost negligible. The average recoveries of seven analytes from the negative samples spiked at three different concentrations were in a range from 81.5% to 105%. The intra-day precision and inter-day precision were in the ranges of 2.9-9.0% and 6.7-11.2%. The developed method was successfully applied to analyze forty commercial flours and FWA184 was detected in three samples with the concentrations of 31-60 mu g/kg.

AB In this work, saturation transfer difference-NMR, isothermal microcalorimetry and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the individual interactions between basic, glycosylated and acidic proline-rich proteins (bPRPS, gPRPs, aPRPs) and P-B peptide with some representative food tannins [procyanidin B2, procyanidin B2 3'-O-gallate (B2g) and procyanidin trimer (catechin-4-8-catechin-4-8-catechin)]. Results showed that P-B peptide was in general the salivary protein (SP) with higher affinity whereas aPRPs showed lower affinity to the studied procyanidins. Moreover, B2g was the procyanidin with higher affinity for all SP. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds were present in all interactions but the major driving force depended on the procyanidin-SP pair. Furthermore, proline clusters or residues in their vicinity were identified as the probable sites of proteins for interaction with procyanidins. For bPRP and aPRP a significant change to less extended conformations was observed, while P-B peptide did not display any structural rearrangement upon procyanidins binding.

AB To detect the changes in molecular structure of chickpea starch during processing treatments, a thin layer chromatographic method for characterizing the molecular structure of chickpea starch was developed. With this method, the components in chickpea starch could be divided into amylopectin, small linear molecules and large linear molecules, and their contents could be determined. It was found that the degrees of polymerization of the large linear molecules and small linear molecules in chickpea enzyme-resistant starch were about 40 and below 15, respectively. Furthermore, the small linear molecules were more susceptible to alpha-amylase hydrolysis than the large linear molecules. The results suggested that the large linear molecules and small linear molecules in chickpea enzyme-resistant starch might mainly originate from the amylose and amylopectin of native chickpea starch, respectively, based on the retrogradation properties of amylose and amylopectin and the enzymatic degradation behavior of the large linear molecules and small linear molecules.

AB Fresh potatoes were intermittently deep-fried up to recommended limits (175 degrees C, 8 h/day, 28 h) in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), peanut oil (PO) and canola oil (CO), and compared for diverse chemical components and sensorial attributes, aiming to quantify the impact of prolonged frying on potatoes nutrients, and the potential alterations resulting from the use of different monounsaturated-rich oils.
   Independently of oil type, its degradation promotes time-dependent losses of important potato nutrients, as vitamin C. Regarding the monounsaturated-rich oils tested, potatoes fried in CO had more equilibrated fatty acid profiles, but higher amounts of aldehydes derived from PUFA oxidation, while in EVOO were enriched with phenolic compounds. Acrylamide amounts were not affected by oil type or frying hours. Sensory degradation was gradually perceived by the panellists, except in PO.
   Prolonged frying should not be studied only on the basis of oil degradation because, even if within regulated limits, it induces loss of important food compounds.

AB Yuba is the skin formed at the surface during the heating of soymilk. The 3rd, 7th, and 11th films were evaluated for properties at different RH. At 39% RH, the 11th film had the lowest moisture, while the 3rd film had the highest moisture. However, at 75% RH, reverse moisture results were obtained. The tensile strengths of the 3rd and 11th films were highest at 15% moisture, whereas the tensile strength of the 7th film was highest at 25% moisture. Elongation of the 3rd (127%) and 11th (85%) films were highest at 25% moisture. The light transmittance of the films was low and opaque at 5% moisture. The films were transparent at 23%-28% moisture, but became opaque as the moisture increased. The films at 39% RH (Delta H, 113-203 J/g) had higher thermal stability than those at 87% RH (Delta H, 315-493 J/g). Moisture content markedly changed the yuba film properties.

AB Using hard red spring (HRS), hard white (HW), and soft white (SW) wheat, this study examined how germination time affected the functionality of whole-wheat flour (WWF) and enhancement of.-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content through ultrasonication. The falling number values significantly decreased and the glucose content increased by 227-357% after 15 h of controlled germination. The setback value of WWF paste decreased from 654 to 6 cP (HW), 690 to 9 cP (SW), and 698 to 7 cP (HRS), respectively, showing significant decreases of starch retrogradation in an aqueous system. The gluten quality and dough mixing performance of WWF after 5-15 h of controlled germination was enhanced since gluten is less weakened during the dough heating stage of Mixolab testing. After a 72 h germination, the GABA content increased by 339% of the non-sprouting counterpart. Furthermore, the GABA content in the ultrasound-treated SW sample was 30.7% higher than that without ultrasound treatment.

AB This work seeks to assess the effects of micro-oxygenation (MOX) on the present and potential levels of Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs) of wine. With such purpose, three red wines with a tendency to develop sulfury off-odors were subjected to three different MOX conditions (4.4-20 mg/L delivered at 0.05 or 0.2 mg/L/day). Samples were further subjected to Accelerated Reductive aging (AR) and analyzed for free and Brine Releasable (BR) VSCs and redox potential. Although MOX induced strong decreases in the levels of all free VSCs, hardly affected the ability of the wine to release back hydrogen sulfide and other mercaptans during AR-aging. During aging BR-levels of MOX samples became in most cases similar or higher than non-oxygenated controls. BR-levels and the fractions free/BR follow characteristic sigmoid plots when represented versus redox potential suggesting that all changes are the result of reversible equilibria between free, metal-complexed and oxidized forms of VSCs.

AB This study aimed to investigate the relative reaction rate of protein and lipid oxidation in different biphasic model systems (linoleic acid; liposome; emulsion) containing myofibrillar protein (MFP at 1, 8 and 20 mg/mL) under hydroxyl radical stress. Protein oxidation markers exhibited significant changes in 2 h: reduced tryptophan fluorescence intensity, carbonyl formation, and extensive polymerization of myosin. In contrast, no detectable changes (P > .05) in lipid peroxide occurred within 2 h except for samples with 1 mg/mL MFP which showed an early TBARS formation. Of the three biphasic systems, the oxidative stability of lipids followed the order of emulsion > linoleic acid > liposome, indicating the steric role of proteins. In general, MFP was more susceptible to radicals than lipids, and a higher protein: lipid ratio was associated with a slower TBARS production and more rapid protein oxidation, suggesting a sacrificing role of MFP to protect lipids.

AB Four peptide fractions PF1 (> 5 ;kDa), PF2 (3-5 ;kDa), PF3 (1-3 ;kDa), PF4 (< 1 ;kDa) were isolated from soybean hydrolysate using the ultrafiltration method. Then, D-xylose and L-cysteine were reacted with specific peptide solution at 120 ;degrees C for 2 ;h, and the molecular weight distribution (MWD), pH, colour, browning intensity, DPPH radical-scavenging activity, free amino acids and sensory characteristics of corresponding Maillard reaction products (MRPF1, MRPF2, MRPF3 and MRPF4) were evaluated, respectively. Peptides with low molecular weight showed higher contribution to the changes of pH, colour and browning intensity during Maillard reaction. The DPPH radical-scavenging activity of PF4 was significantly improved after Maillard reaction. Aroma volatiles and PLSR analysis suggested MRPF3 had the best sensory characteristics with higher contents of umami amino acids and lower of bitter amino acids, therefore it could be deduced that the umami and meaty characteristics were correlated with the peptides of 1-3 ;kDa.

AB In order to investigate the effects of hydroxyl radicals on the myosin of pork, with focus on reducible and non-reducible oxidation of specific cysteine and methionine residues, extracted myofibrillar protein from longissimus dorsi of pork was incubated with H2O2 for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The thiol contents and crosslinking of myofibrillar protein were analyzed after oxidation of the protein. Moreover, cysteine (labeled with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetamide (IAM) before and after reduction, respectively) and methionine oxidation were detected by LC/MS using label-free quantitation. The result revealed that cysteine at head of myosin tended to form sulfinic and sulfonic acid, while the cysteine at coiled tail of myosin easily generated disulfide under same condition. Furthermore, it was also revealed that the methionine at the coiled tail of myosin was more easily oxidized than that of the head.

AB The effect of the composition of twelve varieties of extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) on their differentiation based in agronomic criteria and on the antioxidant capacity was studied. Principal component analysis permitted an overview of the samples and their compositions, showing evidence of grouping and correlation between antioxidant capacity, oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives (OLD) and specific extinction at 270. Oleic and linoleic acids, 3,4-DHPEA-EA and p-HPEA-EDA (OLD), unsaturated/saturated ratio and induction time (IT) allowed the correct classification of samples according to year of harvest, ripening stage and variety. The antioxidant capacity of EVOOs was satisfactory predicted through a partial least square model based on Delta K, hydroxytyrosol, pinoresinol, oleuropein derivate and IT. Validation of the model gave a correlation R > 0.83 and an error of 7% for independent samples. This model could be a useful tool for the olive industry to highlight the nutritional quality of EVOOs and improve their marketing.

AB The chemical changes (oxidation/nitrosation) of meat proteins during digestion lead to a decrease in their nutritional value. Moreover, oxidized and nitrosated amino acids are suspected to promote various human pathologies. To investigate the mechanisms and the kinetics of these endogenous protein modifications, we used a dynamic artificial digestive system (DIDGI (R)) that mimics the physicochemical conditions of digestion. The combined effect of meat cooking and endogenous addition of ascorbate and nitrite was evaluated on protein oxidation (by measuring carbonyl groups), protein nitrosation (by measuring nitrosamines), and proteolysis. Considerable carbonylation was observed in the digestive tract, especially under the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nitrosamines, caused by ammonia oxidation, were formed in conditions in which no nitrite was added, although the addition of nitrite in the model significantly increased their levels. Meat cooking and nitrite addition significantly decreased protein digestion. The interactions between all the changes affecting the proteins are discussed.

AB The detection of coffee adulteration with soybean and corn by capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry was accomplished by evaluating the monosaccharides profile obtained after acid hydrolysis of the samples. The acid hydrolysis, using H2SO4 as a catalyst, increases the ionic strength of the sample impairing the electrophoretic separation. Therefore, Ba(OH)(2) was used to both neutralize the medium and reduce the content of sulfate by precipitation of BaSO4. The best separation of nine determined monosaccharides (fucose, galactose, arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, xylose, mannose, fructose and ribose) plus inositol as internal standard was obtained in 500 mmol.L-1 triethylamine, pH 12.3. The monosaccharides are separated as anionic species at this pH. The proposed method is simple, fast (< 12.0 min), present linear calibration curves (r(2) = 0.995), and relative standard deviation for replicate injections lower than 5%. The LOQ for all monosaccharides was lower than 0.01 mmol.L-1, which is in accordance with the tolerable limits for coffee. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate interrelationships between the monosaccharide profile and the coffee adulteration with different proportions of soybean and corn. Fucose, galactose, arabinose, glucose, sucrose, rhamnose, xylose, mannose, fructose, and ribose were quantified in packed roast-and-ground commercial coffee samples, and differences between adulterated and unadulterated coffees could be detected.

AB High-pressure processing (HPP) at 250-700 MPa for 30-45 min affects the colour parameters, phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities of purple waxy corn kernels (p < 0.05). The higher pressure-level, the lower L*, a*, b*, C* and h(o) (p < 0.05). However, pressure-treated kernels at 700 MPa showed a similar colour profile to steam-treated kernels. HPP caused a loss in the total phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents and antioxidant activities. The pressure-treated kernels had a higher phytochemical content than the steam-treated kernels. The phytochemicals and antioxidant activities decreased as the pressure increased from 250 to 550 MPa, but the levels recovered at 700 MPa. The longer holding-time, the greater loss of the compounds and antioxidant activities (p < 0.05). Pressure treatment at 700 MPa yielded the highest total phenolic and anthocyanin contents (p < 0.05). Water-soluble compounds can leach from food materials due to cell rupture. Nevertheless, HPP is a potential process to preserve the phytochemicals in food.

AB A method was developed for the determination of eight synthetic pigments in beverage samples by liquid-liquid microextraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography. Using hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the microextraction solvent, several key parameters were optimized, including the type and volume of the hydrophobic DES, pH value, vortex time and salt content. Detection limits were in the range 0.016-1.12 ng/mL, recoveries were in the range 74.5-102.5% and relative standard deviations were < 5.4%. The method is simple, green and practical, and could be applied to the extraction and determination of synthetic pigments in beverages.

AB Rapeseed press-cake (RPC) is a byproduct of rapeseed oil production, rich in proteins and fiber. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of cold pressed RPC, RPC fiber isolate and RPC alkaline extract on the formation of acrylamide and 5-hydroxymethylfufural (HMF) in cookies. Both compounds were influenced by the ingredients: the addition of RPC led to a significant dose-dependent increase of HMF in the cookies and to an increase of acrylamide up to 66.9%. On the contrary, acrylamide concentration was reduced down to 39.6% in presence of the alkaline extract and down to 4.4% in the presence of the fiber extract. The Michael addition of free amino acids to acrylamide was further investigated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealing that cysteine was the preferred nucleophile for acrylamide elimination.

AB Mushrooms have been used extensively, owing to their nutritional and medicinal value, for thousands of years. Modern research confirms the therapeutic effect of traditionally used species. Inflammation is a natural response of the immune system to damaging factors, e.g. physical, chemical and pathogenic. Deficiencies of antioxidants, vitamins, and microelements, as well as physiological processes, such as aging, can affect the body's ability to resolve inflammation. Mushrooms are rich in anti-inflammatory components, such as polysaccharides, phenolic and indolic compounds, mycosteroids, fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamins, and biometals. Metabolites from mushrooms of the Basidiomycota taxon possess antioxidant, anticancer, and most significantly, anti-inflammatory properties. Recent reports indicate that edible mushroom extracts exhibit favourable therapeutic and health-promoting benefits, particularly in relation to diseases associated with inflammation. In all certainty, edible mushrooms can be referred to as a "superfood" and are recommended as a valuable constituent of the daily diet.

AB Trypsin was used for preparing peptides with high calcium-binding capacity from Antarctic krill. Hydroxyapatite chromatography (HAC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used to capture and purify calcium-binding peptides. The peptide sequence was determined to be VLGYIQIR (N-to C-terminal, MW = 960.58 Da), using LTQ Orbitrap XL. According to the results of FTIR and mass spectrometry, chelating site of calcium ions may possibly involve the carbonal or amino groups of Gln, Ile and Arg residues. Molecular dynamic simulation showed the conformation of peptide was markedly varied, and the distance between calcium ion and Gln and Ile residues was changing all the time. However, the distance between calcium ion and carboxyl oxygen of arginine residues was not changed significantly from 2 ns to 100 ns. Identified peptide can be used as a novel calcium supplement.

AB One hydrogenated and one non-hydrogenated shortening were baked with isolated components of a croissant matrix, including crystalline wheat starch, gelatinized wheat starch, gluten, and formed gluten network. The impact of the matrix components on fat crystallization was analyzed for polymorphism using powder X-ray diffraction, solid fat content by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance and thermal behaviour by differential scanning calorimetry. When compared to results obtained from croissants prepared with the respective short-enings, samples containing gelatinized wheat starch displayed notably similar results: polymorphic conversion, from the beta' to beta form over storage, and visually broader peaks in the melting endotherms indicating a greater temperature was required to completely melt all of the fat. All other component mixtures behaved similar to the respective fats in bulk. The measured rate of crystallization was greater in samples containing gelatinized wheat starch, indicating that the gelatinized starch could act as a nucleation site to speed crystallization.

AB In this study, the effect of microwave (360 W, 540 W and 720 W) oven roasting on oil yields, phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and fatty acid composition of some apricot kernel and oils was investigated. While total phenol contents of control group of apricot kernels change between 54.41 mgGAE/100 g (Sogancioglu) and 59.61 mgGAE/100 g (Hasanbey), total phenol contents of kernel samples roasted in 720 W were determined between 27.41 mgGAE/100 g (Cataloglu) and 34.52 mgGAE/100 g (Sogancioglu). Roasting process in microwave at 720 W caused the reduction of some phenolic compounds of apricot kernels. The gallic acid contents of control apricot kernels ranged between 7.23 mg/100 g (Kabaasi) and 11.23 mg/100 g (Cataloglu) whereas the gallic acid contents of kernels roasted in 540 W changed between 15.35 mg/100 g (Sogancioglu) and 21.17 mg/100 g (Cataloglu). In addition, oleic acid contents of control group oils vary between 65.98% (Sogancioglu) and 71.86% (Hasanbey), the same fatty acid ranged from 63.48% (Sogancioglu) to 70.36% (Hasanbey).

AB We developed a new microextraction method for separation and preconcentration of curcumin using deep eutectic solvent known as green solvent. Deep eutectic solvent (DES) formed by mixing of choline chloride and phenol was used as an extraction solvent in microextraction study to extract the curcumin at pH 4.0. The curcumin concentration in enriched DES phase was analyzed by UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The effect of parameters such as pH, mol ratio of DES composition, volume of DES, volume of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sample volume were examined. Interference effects of matrix components were investigated. The preconcentration factor was 12.5. The detection limit of method (n=10) was 2.86 mu g L-1 and the relative standard deviation (RSD, n=8) was 1.8%. The method was successfully applied to determination of curcumin in food and herbal tea samples. The mean recoveries were between 96% and 102% and standard deviations were found in the range of 1-6%.

AB Following a preliminary study to determine the possibility of using a grapevine shoot extract (VIN) as a sustainable alternative to sulfur dioxide (SO2), in this study, the chromatic features, phenolic composition, and sensory analysis of wines treated with VIN at two concentrations were studied during storage in bottle for the first time. The highest differences were found in phenolic compounds after 12 months of storage in bottle. The VIN wines had a low content of free anthocyanins and were high in vinyl-pyranoanthocyanins, and B-type vitisins. Consequently, they showed better chromatic characteristics. Moreover VIN, especially at high dose, preserved non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds better than SO2. However, at this high dose some organoleptic properties were affected. VIN, when used at a low dose, is able to preserve wine composition without loss of quality.

AB In this paper, we present a first direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent pipe flow using the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) on both a D3Q19 lattice grid and a D3Q27 lattice grid. DNS of turbulent pipe flows using LBM has never been reported previously, perhaps due to inaccuracy and numerical stability associated with the previous implementations of LBM in the presence of a curved solid surface. In fact, it was even speculated that the D3Q19 lattice might be inappropriate as a DNS tool for turbulent pipe flows. In this paper, we show, through careful implementation, accurate turbulent statistics can be obtained using both D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattice grids. In the simulation with D3Q19 lattice, a few problems related to the numerical stability of the simulation are exposed. Discussions and solutions for those problems are provided. The simulation with D3Q27 lattice, on the other hand, is found to be more stable than its D3Q19 counterpart. The resulting turbulent flow statistics at a friction Reynolds number of Re-tau=180 are compared systematically with both published experimental and other DNS results based on solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The comparisons cover the mean-flow profile, the r.m.s. velocity and vorticity profiles, the mean and r.m.s. pressure profiles, the velocity skewness and flatness, and spatial correlations and energy spectra of velocity and vorticity. Overall, we conclude that both D3Q19 and D3Q27 simulations yield accurate turbulent flow statistics. The use of the D3Q27 lattice is shown to suppress the weak secondary flow pattern in the mean flow due to numerical artifacts. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vesicle suspensions appear in many biological and industrial applications. These suspensions are characterized by rich and complex dynamics of vesicles due to their interaction with the bulk fluid, and their large deformations and nonlinear elastic properties. Many existing state-of-the-art numerical schemes can resolve such complex vesicle flows. However, even when using provably optimal algorithms, these simulations can be computationally expensive, especially for suspensions with a large number of vesicles. These high computational costs can limit the use of simulations for parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty quantification. One way to reduce the cost is to use low-resolution discretizations in space and time. However, it is well-known that simply reducing the resolution results in vesicle collisions, numerical instabilities, and often in erroneous results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a number of algorithmic empirical fixes (which are commonly used by many groups) in an attempt to make low-resolution simulations more stable and more predictive. Based on our empirical studies for a number of flow configurations, we propose a scheme that attempts to integrate these fixes in a systematic way. This low-resolution scheme is an extension of our previous work [51,53]. Our low-resolution correction algorithms (LRCA) include anti-aliasing and membrane reparametrization for avoiding spurious oscillations in vesicles' membranes, adaptive time stepping and a repulsion force for handling vesicle collisions and, correction of vesicles' area and arc-length for maintaining physical vesicle shapes. We perform a systematic error analysis by comparing the low-resolution simulations of dilute and dense suspensions with their high-fidelity, fully resolved, counterparts. We observe that the LRCA enables both efficient and statistically accurate low-resolution simulations of vesicle suspensions, while it can be 10x to 100x faster. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Weak constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation is an important method for incorporating data (typically observations) into a model. The linearised system arising within the minimisation process can be formulated as a saddle point problem. A disadvantage of this formulation is the large storage requirements involved in the linear system. In this paper, we present a low-rank approach which exploits the structure of the saddle point system using techniques and theory from solving large scale matrix equations. Numerical experiments with the linear advection-diffusion equation, and the non-linear Lorenz-95 model demonstrate the effectiveness of a low-rank Krylov subspace solver when compared to a traditional solver.

AB The expedient design of precision components in aerospace and other high-tech industries requires simulations of physical phenomena often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without exact solutions. Modern design problems require simulations with a level of resolution difficult to achieve in reasonable amounts of time-even in effectively parallelized solvers. Though the scale of the problem relative to available computing power is the greatest impediment to accelerating these applications, significant performance gains can be achieved through careful attention to the details of memory communication and access. The swept time-space decomposition rule reduces communication between sub-domains by exhausting the domain of influence before communicating boundary values. Here we present a GPU implementation of the swept rule, which modifies the algorithm for improved performance on this processing architecture by prioritizing use of private (shared) memory, avoiding interblock communication, and overwriting unnecessary values. It shows significant improvement in the execution time of finite-difference solvers for one-dimensional unsteady PDEs, producing speedups of 2-9 x for a range of problem sizes, respectively, compared with simple GPU versions and 7-300 x compared with parallel CPU versions. However, for a more sophisticated one-dimensional system of equations discretized with a second-order finite-volume scheme, the swept rule performs 1.2-1.9 x worse than a standard implementation for all problem sizes.

AB Shear bands are the key feature that control deformation in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). This study provides a comprehensive analysis of plastic deformation of a Zr-Cu-based BMG at room temperature. Experiments were conducted to observe the evolution of shear bands in the material. It was shown that shear bands formed discretely in the material which allows for material deformation to occur across it. Additionally, individual shear bands were characterised to obtain a better understanding of shear-band-induced plasticity. Assessment of mechanical properties, such as hardness and elastic modulus, indicate the deformed regions of the material were weaker than undeformed regions. No compositional or structural changes were found in shear-band of the studied BMG suggesting generation of local free volume in the deformed region.

AB Molecular dynamics simulation is employed to investigate the diffusion mechanism, dynamics and structure heterogeneity in a liquid SiO2 at ambient pressure and different temperatures. To explore these phenomena we propose the link-cluster and init-bond functions. The simulation shows that during a moderately long time the liquid has a two-domain structure that consists of separate mobile and immobile domains. These types of domains differ strongly in the rate of atomic rearrangement and fraction of defective atoms. The simulation also reveals a strong correlation between mobility of atoms and init-bond function which evidences the bond breaking mechanism and that the reactions are non-uniformly distributed in the space. The liquid exhibits dynamics heterogeneity which is accompanied with the structure heterogeneity and cooperative movement of atoms via like-molecules SixOy.

AB The glass-forming domain and physical properties, namely, the density, thermal, structural and linear optical properties of new glasses within the TeO2-TiO2-WO3 system have been investigated. By means of micro-Raman spectroscopy, the structure of these glasses was examined based on a full-scale spectral decomposition. The optical transmission and refractive index dispersion were measured by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry respectively. Consistent correlations were established between the structural and linear optical properties. Only minor structural modifications of the original TeO2-rich network are taking place upon adding TiO2 or WO3, suggesting the absence of Te-O-Te bond network depolymerization. Our results also suggest that, upon increasing TiO2 content, a phase separation occurs between amorphous TeO2-rich and amorphous TiO2-rich regions. We also argue that the structural trends upon adding WO3 evolve from uniformly dispersed WO6 octahedra (at low WO3 content) to amorphous WO3-like regions (at higher WO3 content) before the crystallization of gamma-WO3 at 30 mol% of WO3. The compositional dependence of the refractive index and several optical constants (Urbach E-u and dispersion Ed energies, oxide ion polarizabilities) is highlighted. These glasses collectively exhibit high refractive indices in the order of similar to 2.2.

In the electrolyte composed of ethylene glycol, 5 vol% H2O, and 0.23-0.9 wt% Na2CO3, uniform Ni-Ti-O nanopores with diameter of about 25 nm and Ni/ Ti atomic ratio exceeding 0.30 can be anodically grown on the NiTi alloy under proper applied voltage (20-40 V).

Good electro-chemical performance was achieved using non-covalent modification of MWCNT with an anionic steroid dispersant, which allowed excellent MWCNT dispersion and facilitated the fabrication of Mn3O4-MWCNT nanocomposites with uniform distributions of individual components. The electrodes showed activation behavior, related to capacitance increase, impedance reduction and enrichment of the Mn3+ and Mn4+ oxidation states. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A maximum 220 MPa shear strength is achieved. The high entropy alloy experiences the hardness increases 3-4 times after brazing. If the brazing temperature is higher than 1200 degrees C, the bonding strength suffers due to excessivediffusion between the base metal and the filler metal. The hardness behavior is attributed to a combination of the cocktail effect and lattice distortion induced by brazing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, a novel form-stable composite Phase change material (PCM) of Stearic Acid (SA)/Carbonized sunflower straw (CSS) was prepared by vacuum impregnation method. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to measure the chemical compatibility of SA/CSS. The thermal properties and thermal stability were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and ther-mogravimetry analysis (TGA) techniques. The results show that the SA/CSS melted at 66.4 degrees C with the latent heat of 186.1 J/g and freezed at 65.9 degrees C with the latent heat of 186.7 J/g and the composite PCM have a good thermal reliability above its working temperature. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of SA/CSS was 0.33 W/m/K which was 106.3% higher than that of SA. All results indicated that SA/CSS have suitable thermal properties used as thermal energy storage applications such as solar heat energy storage system and energy conservation buildings.

AB Bismuth-based perovskite solid solutions 0.36Bi(Sc-1 Zr-x(x))O-3-0.64PbTiO(3) (BSPT) were designed to obtain morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between phase tetragonal (T) and rhombohedral (R) to enhance the piezoelectric properties. Their phase structures were investigated by the X-ray diffraction, temperature dependence of dielectric constant. The morphotropic phase boundary separate the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases for the 0.36Bi(Sc-1 Zr-x(x))O-3-0.64PbTiO(3) system at x = 0.01. The piezoelectric coefficient d(33) for the ceramics at x = 0.01 is 559 pC/N at 250 degrees C and 270 pC/N at -100 degrees C, which is higher than that of traditional piezoelectric materials. Moreover, zirconium doping of 0.36BiScO(3)-0.64PbTiO(3) decreased the coercive field (E-c), dielectric dissipation factor tan delta, and electromechanical coupling factor k(p). Effect of zirconium doping on piezoelectric and electromechanical properties are reported and discussed as a function of temperature. This study indicated the BSPT material at redesigned MPB is a promising candidate for wide temperature range sensor applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the tribological and mechanical behaviour of tricalcium phosphate-Fluorapatite (beta-TCP-Fap) bioceramic was investigated. Indeed, the Fluorapatite was added to the tricalcium phosphate to improve its mechanical properties. The mixture of both powders is considered as a bioactive coating that is likely to be used in orthopaedic implants. The assays were conducted on the cylindrical blocs by compacting the mixture in a metal mould. The characteristics of the specimens were investigated with various methods, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation and a ball-disk tribometer. The lowest volume wear was measured for beta-TCP-26.52% Fap biocomposites under dry condition. Hence, beta-TCP-26.52% Fap specimens have revealed the best wear resistance properties. The results would be helpful to fully understand the effect of the addition of the Fluorapatite to beta-TCP matrix on its tribological properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing a simple method for fabricating nanotube materials is highly desired in nanomaterials research. In this work, LaFeO3/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) composite nanofibers were prepared by a single spinneret electrospinning method. Then, LaFeO3 nanotubes were obtained via a rapid annealing technology. The gas sensors based on LaFeO3 nanotubes were fabricated for investigating their gas sensing properties. The results show that the LaFeO3 nanotubes gas sensor is of good response and selectivity to ethanol, and the fast response/recovery times are about 2/4 s to 100 ppm ethanol at 160 degrees C. We expect that LaFeO3 nanotubes can be used to fabricate ethanol gas sensors, and the preparation method of LaFeO3 nanotubes can provide new ideas for synthesizing other nanotube materials.

AB By using H2O2 as clean oxidant instead of air in previous fabrication process, a new nano palladium catalyst supported on polyaniline (nano Pd@PANI) with low Pd loading can be smoothly achieved by oxidative polymerization of the aniline with a reduced amount of PdCl2 (currently 0.12% Pd only vs. previously 2.5% Pd). Although this new catalyst contains much less amount of Pd in comparison with the old nano Pd@PANI catalyst (currently only 0.75% Pd vs. previously 10.0% Pd), it is still found to be an effective catalyst for the Suzuki coupling of aryl halides and aryl boric acids, affording biphenyl products in excellent yields with dramatically enhanced turnover numbers (TON, 4.7 x 10(3) vs. 880).

The resulting films contain iodine throughout but are mostly fluorine free. Even though the precursor contains more fluorine than iodine, fluorine is only present in larger concentrations in the surface and interface region. The films are smooth, show a decreased hardness and a higher contact angle as compared to iodine free DLC films. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The copper and cobalt-doped bioactive glasses (BGs) from the basic SiO2-CaO-P2O5 system, differing in the CaO/SiO2 molar ratios, were produced using sol-gel method. The in vitro angiogenic response of human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on Cu-BGs and Co-BGs was investigated. The incorporation of Cu and Co into BGs significantly enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor secretion from fibroblasts. Cu-BGs and Co-BGs extracts might facilitate the migration of HUVECs and the self-assembled network formation after 3 days of culture without basement membrane matrix, demonstrating strong angiogenic activity. The results show that cellular response was correlated with Cu and Co release rate which, in turn, was affected by the CaO/SiO2 molar ratios, indicating new opportunities for controlling the release rate of therapeutic ions from BGs.

AB Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most potential energy storage devices owing to their high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness and low cost. However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are restricted by the low conductivity of sulfur, serious dissolution of intermediate polysulfides and fast capacity degradation. Herein, we design a titanium nitride (TiN) modified separator to improve the long-term cycle stability and discharge capacity of Li-S batteries. Strong interaction between the TiN particles and polysulfides can greatly restrain the "shuttle effect" and benefit the cycle stability. With this modified separator, cathodes with a sulfur loading of 78.1% could deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1296 mAh/g and demonstrate a decay rate of 0.17% per cycle under a high current density of 0.5C. Such superior electrochemical performances ascribe to the high conductivity of TiN and strong affinity between TiN particles and polysulfides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A controlled growth of nano/micro rods with defined morphologies are of great interest due to its special and unique properties. Here we report ethylene glycol mediated facile and controlled synthesis of ultralong (similar to 100 mu m) perfect hexagon shaped microrods of silver molybdate by a cost effective method of hydrothermal. The exact conditions are optimized by varying the effective parameters. The synthesis involves the mixing of different concentration of silver nitrate solution (0.025, 0.075, 0.125 M) with ammonium molybdate in the presence of 10 ml of ethylene glycol and then post hydrothermal treatment at 150 degrees C for 12 hrs. Only 0.075 M conc. of silver nitrate results perfect hexagons whereas the lower and higher concentrations result the formation of distorted edge shaped and longer microrods of Ag6Mo10O33. The magnetic measurement shows the perfect diamagnetic behavior of these mircorods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Metals and alloys; Liquid metal; Wear and tribology; Wide temperature

AB Microscopic contacts commonly exist on the surfaces when applying loads between the frictional pairs. Under harsh environments, such as extremely high temperature and load, sliding devices will encounter devastating wear loss, eventually leading to the materials failure. Traditional liquid lubricants could only work in a narrow temperature range due to their poor thermal stabilities. A kind of room temperature liquid metal (LM), Ga68.5In21.5Sn10, could be used in an ultra-wide range of temperatures. In this work, the tribological properties of LM has been investigated for Si3N4/steel contact at three temperatures (-10, 20 and 800 degrees C), which was the first research in such wide range of temperature for liquid lubricants. Results indicate that LM exhibited excellent tribological performances. Surface analyses suggest that the predominant properties at -10 and 20 degrees C were ascribed to the tribofilms composed of metal oxides, such as Fe2O3, Ga2O3, In2O3, and SnO2. The main product intermetallic compound FeGa3 contributed to forming the boundary lubrication film at 800 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We employ a sequential electrophoresis and electrodeposition approach to fabricate a large-area ordered macroporous Ni foam in 5 x 5 cm(2) via a template route. Images from scanning electron microscope exhibit hierarchical structures with hexagonally-arranged pores and interconnected pore channels. For as-prepared and annealed ordered macroporous Ni foams, the loading-depth profiles from nano indentation show typical elastic and plastic deformation. Upon annealing, moderate growth in grain size is observed, resulting in lower hardness and Young's modulus. In contrast, for disordered macroporous Ni foam and solid Ni film, nano indentation results reveal larger hardness and undetermined Young's modulus. The ordered macroporous foam reveals hardness that is 22% of that of solid Ni film, a value close to its theoretic packing density of 24%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Single crystalline platelet chalcostibite (CuSbS2) particles with good shape and size uniformity were successfully prepared using a hot injection method. In this synthesis, sulfur powder in oleylamine (OLA) was employed as a sulfonating agent. The synthesized CuSbS2 had an orthorhombic structure with a plate-like morphology. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed their single crystal nature. Band gap calculation from diffuse reflectance data revealed that it had both direct and indirect band gaps of 1.52 eV and 1.46 eV, respectively. Moreover, valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization. Optical and structural properties of CuSbS2 indicate its potential applicability for solar cell applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) has attracted a great deal of interest due to its electronic and optical properties, and has potential applications in biomedical field, while few studies have been conducted to investigate its biocompatibility. In this study, we prepared nanostructured ZnO on acid-etched pure Ti surface through a moderate hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution (pH = 12.6). By changing Zn precursor concentration and hydrothermal duration, it was feasible to synthesis flake-like ZnO nanostructures with variable spacings. The adhesion, proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of SaOS-2 cells were enhanced on the ZnO nanostructures when the Zn precursor concentration was 0.02 M and the hydrothermal duration was 4 h, compared to those on the acid-etched pure Ti without ZnO nanostructures. Narrower spacings (< 70 nm) between ZnO nanostructures are considered to contribute to this enhancement. Together, the results indicate that the superposition of ZnO nanostructures on titanium surfaces may be beneficial for the enhanced biological performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous Co3O4 flowers constructed by many nanoneedles are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method followed by calcinations in air. Such porous nanoneedles possess a rough surface and are consisted of numerous nanocrystals with a size ranging from 20 to 30 nm and many small intercrystallite pores. The BET surface area of Co3O4 microflowers is determined to be 61.37 cm(2) g(-1) with a dominant pore diameter of 8.5 nm. This facile strategy may be extended to synthesize other transition metal oxide materials with similar shapes, which may find application in sensors and supercapacitors due to their unique structural features.

AB Heretofore, the effects of scandium on the biocompatibility of biodegradable magnesium alloys are extremely limited recognized. In the present study, four Mg-1.5Zn-0.6Zr-xSc (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 wt%) alloys were fabricated and their hydrophilicity, cytotoxicity, and hemocompatibility were investigated. The contact angle measurements revealed that addition of Sc improved the hydrophilicity of the alloys. For biodegradable alloys, perfect hydrophilicity could promote the tissue attaching on implant surface, establishing a benign biological reaction and improving the therapeutic effectiveness. The viabilities of L-929 cells and SP2/0 cells for all the alloys were about 100% and 90% compared to negative control, respectively. No obvious differences existed in cell viabilities between different Sc contents. With increasing addition of Sc, the hemolysis percentages and the degree of platelet activation increased. It deteriorated the hemocompatibility of the alloys. Proteomics, genomics, and in vivo investigations are needed in the future to get more deep understandings of the biocompatibility of Sc.

AB The fast formation of Cu3Sn in a Cu/Sn(10 mu m)/Cu solder joints were investigated by induction heating process in a few minutes and under a low pressure of 0.01 MPa at ambient temperature. The introducing of induction heating process showed benefit effects on enhancing the interfacial reaction at the liquid Sn/solid Cu metallization interface. From the three-dimensional microstructural observation of interfacial IMCs at different bonding times, scallop-liked Cu6Sn5 was formed while planar-liked Cu3Sn was formed between Cu and Cu6Sn5 at initial soldering stage. After that, the scallop-liked Cu6Sn5 grew with a transition to dendritic-liked morphology while planar-liked Cu3Sn grew with a transition to columnar-liked morphology until the full Cu3Sn solder joint was eventually formed. Accompanying with the movement of Cu atoms in the molten Sn, the morphology of columnar-liked Cu3Sn compounds surrounded by dendritic-liked Cu6Sn5 compounds was formed due to constitutional super-cooling. The rapid microstructure evolution of the interfacial IMCs was caused by the joule heating effect as well as the electromagnetic stirring effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reduced graphene oxide/zinc ferrite (RGO/ZnFe2O4) hybrid nanocomposite was fabricated by a facile solvothermal route. ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter around 10.2 nm were homogeneously anchored on the surface of RGO sheets without large aggregation. Moreover, the effect of filler content on the microwave absorption performance of the hybrid nanocomposite was explored in detail. The as-prepared hybrid nanocomposite exhibited excellent microwave absorption performance with the minimum reflection loss of -41.1 dB for a thickness of 2.5 mm and effective absorption bandwidth (less than -10 dB) of 3.2 GHz for a thickness of 2.0 mm. Our results indicated that the deposition of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles on RGO sheets was an efficient way to fabricate RGO-based high-performance microwave absorbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanogranular tungsten oxide (WO3) with excess oxygen is synthesized and its battery performance is evaluated as an anode material for the Li-ion battery (LIB). The formation of a monoclinic WO3 phase is confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro (mu)-Raman spectroscopy analyses. The Rutherford back scattering results confirm the existence of excess oxygen in the film. The charge discharge processes are associated with the conversion of the WO3 from the oxide state to the metallic state, and vice versa, and it shows a maximum specific capacity of 778.8 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 Ag-1 in the first discharge. Even at a very high current density of 1 Ag-1, the sample retains the capacity of 228.6 mAh g(-1). It shows excellent rate capability and a long-term cycling stability over 500 charge-discharge cycles, with capacity retention of 217%. The observed high discharge capacity and superior long-term cyclability of the nanograin WO3 anode are attributable to the synergetic effect of the excess-oxygen induced increased donor density and enhanced electrical conductivity.

AB The performance of lightweight composites are predominately determined by their cellular architectures as well as the properties of solid components. In this study, we employ a novel microlattice as the supportive architecture, which consists of a periodic array of hollow tubes connected at nodes, forming a diamond unit cell. Furthermore, diamond-structured microlattice polymer was fabricated via 3D printing technique, and conformal Ni-P thin films were subsequently coated on the polymeric substrate by electroless plating, in order to reinforce the composite strength. As a result, the strength of obtained composite is significantly enhanced with the addition of diamond particles from 1.37 MPa to 2.35 MPa. More importantly, whereas the strength of the reinforced composite is increased along with the content of diamond particles in the bath, the density of the resulting materials is decreased, leading to the significantly enhanced specific strength. We believe this work opens up an innovative way to the development of lightweight engineering materials with 3D printing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Relationship of processing with microstructure in Ti-6Al-4V single-layer and single-track wall samples was investigated under various thermal cycles of selective laser melting (SLM). The microstructure is controlled by peak temperature (T-P) and times of thermal cycles depending on SLM processing parameters. The refinement of alpha' occurs during vertical thermal cycles of T-P > liquid temperature (T-L) and is enhanced with thermal cycle times. No obvious microstructural evolution is exhibited during thermal cycles of T-P < T-L. A novel approach to in-situ fabricate Ti-6Al-4V alloy with graded microstructure and nanohardness is successfully developed by governing the process and parameters of SLM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ag/AgCl composite as an alternative visible-light photocatalyst has attracted extensive interests; however, the high charge carrier recombination rate and short-term photocatalytic durability limit their practical application. In the present work, TiO2 hollow nanofibers (ELTiO2) grafted Ag/AgCl is fabricated via electrospinning-precipitation method. Compared with Ag/AgCl and Ag/AgCl-SGTiO(2) (sol-gel synthetized TiO2), 2.89 and 1.59-fold enhancement in the photodegradation rate toward MO is observed over Ag/AgCl-ELTiO2 under visible light irradiation. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the higher content of the exposed AgCl {111} facet, which is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated carriers and accounts for more active sites. Moreover, Ag/AgCl-ELTiO2 shows better photostability than bare Ag/AgCl. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The preparation of scalable graphene films has attracted an enormous attention due to its industrial importance for graphene applications. Here we present a synthesis method of high-quality continuous monolayer graphene films with millimeter-sized domains on ordinary Cu substrates using oxygen-assisted chemical vapor deposition. This method demonstrates a significantly improvement to the resultant graphene such as a largely decreased nucleation density from similar to 10(6) to similar to 10(1) nuclei/cm(2), an increased average domain size from similar to 0.004 to similar to 1.5 mm and a film coverage from 64% to 100%. We attributed the success of this growth to the surface layer formed by bonded oxygen in Cu, which provides a higher priority for catalyzing the nucleation and growth of graphene domains.

The composites were produced by a three-stage method that included the preparation of highly filled elastomeric compounds, vulcanization, and low-temperature carbonization. Highly filled elastomeric compounds based on nitrile-butadiene rubber were obtained using a rubber-mixing mill. The vulcanization of elastomeric compounds was carried out at 170 degrees C for 10 min, the vulcanized composites were subjected to further carbonization at 360 degrees C; the carbonization cycle was 12 h. The microstructure, thermal properties and mechanical behavior of such materials, their thermal and deformation properties in the temperature range up to 300-320 degrees C are investigated.

AB Piroplasmosis is caused by several species of protozoa such as the Babesia microti-like piroplasm (Bml), an emerging blood protozoan also known as Theileria annae or Babesia vulpes. Infection by Bml was first reported in dogs in Spain where it is endemic today. Recently, a high prevalence of Bml has been increasingly detected in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in European countries. The objective of this study was to determine infection levels of this parasite in foxes from Galicia, NW Spain, and ticks species infestation in these carnivores, where they are so far unknown. Samples of blood, spleen and ticks (if present) were taken from 237 hunted red foxes in the Galicia region. Blood smears were prepared for direct parasite observation, and spleen and tick samples were examined by nested PCR. Prevalences of Bml infection in Galician red foxes were estimated at 72% (171/237) by PCR and 38.23% (26/68) by direct observation. Among 837 ticks collected, the main tick identified was Ixodes hexagonus (present in 82.4% of the foxes) followed by Ixodes ricinus (12.3%), Dermacentor reticulatus (12.3%) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (3.5%). From 34 foxes testing positive for Bml, 616 ticks were collected: positive Bml PCR results were obtained in 55.6% (227/408) of ticks collected from 9 foxes, while the 208 ticks from the remaining 25 infected foxes returned negative PCR results. Given that canine piroplasmosis is endemic in this area, our observations point to the red fox as the main reservoir for Bml infection and the high proportion of I. hexagonus among ticks collected from red foxes suggests its likely role as vectors of B. microti-like piroplasm in this region. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the link between the wild and domestic life cycles of this piroplasm.

AB Eimeria necatrix is one of the most pathogenic parasites causing high mortality in chicken older than 8 weeks. Eimeria spp. possess a coccidian lifecycle including both sexual and asexual stages. Sexual differentiation and development occupies a central place in the life cycle of the Eimeria parasite. However, our knowledge of the sexual differentiation and gametocyte development of Eimeria is very limited. Here using RNA sequencing, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis between third-generation merozoites (MZ-3) and gametocytes (GAM) of E. necatrix to identify genes with functions related to sexual differentiation and gametocyte development. Approximately 4267 genes were differentially expressed between MZ-3 and GAM. Compared with MZ-3, 2789 genes were upregulated and 1478 genes were downregulated in GAM. Approximately 329 genes in MZ-3 and 1289 genes in GAM were further analyzed in the evaluation of stage-specific genes. Gene Ontology (GO) classification and KEGG analysis revealed that 953 upregulated gametocyte genes were annotated with 170 GO assignments, and 405 upregulated genes were associated with 231 signaling pathways. We also predicted a further 83 upregulated gametocyte genes, of which 53 were involved in the biosynthesis of the oocyst wall, and 30 were involved in microgametocyte development. This information offers insights into the mechanisms governing the sexual development of E. necatrix and may potentially allow the identification of targets for blocking parasite transmission.

AB Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) cause considerable economic losses in grazing goat herds. At present, GIN control cannot rely on conventional anthelmintic (AH) drugs because parasites have developed resistance against such drugs. Thus, alternative control methods are being sought to reduce the dependence on AH. Many tannin-rich plants exhibit AH activity and may be used as alternatives for GIN control. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia is a tannin-rich shrub consumed by small ruminants in Brazil. This study evaluated the in vivo AH effect of M. caesalpiniifolia leaf powder supplementation on GIN egg fecal excretion and worm burden in goats. Plant leaves were harvested, dried and ground to obtain a powder. Twenty-four castrated male goats, aged six to eight months, with a mean body weight of 15.0 +/- 2.5 kg were used in the experiment. Animals were infected orally with 16,000 larvae comprising 50% Haemonchus spp., 41% Trichostrongylus spp. and 9% Oesophagostomum spp. Once the infection was patent, the goats were distributed into four groups of six animals. The control group received concentrate without condensed tannins (CTs) and did not receive any drench against GINs. The monepantel group received concentrate without CTs and were drenched once with monepantel. The other two groups received the M. caesalpiniifolia leaf powder in two periods of seven consecutive days (days 1-7 and 14-21), with one of the groups also receiving 10 g of polyethyleneglycol (PEG)/day. The animals were weighed weekly, and individual fecal eggs counts (FECs) were performed daily. After 28 days, the animals were humanly slaughtered, and the worm burden was estimated. Although live weight gain and FECs did not differ among the groups (P > 0.05), post-mortem worm counts showed a reduction in Haemonchus contortus adult worm burden (57.7%) in goats of the CT group compared to control goats (P < 0.05). The addition of PEG did not diminish AH activity in the CT + PEG group (66.9% reduction compared to the control). No AH effect against other GIN species was found. The result for the addition of PEG suggested that the observed AH activity was associated with plant secondary compounds, as opposed to CTs. As expected, no AH effect against Oesophagostomum columbianum was found for the monepantel group showed. Thus, feeding dry leaves of M. caesalpiniifolia represent a promising alternative for the control of GIN infections in goats.

ID FUTURE; ZOONOSES; DISEASES
AB China has made significant achievements in social-economic development in the last three decades, and the numbers of livestock and companion animals are rapidly increasing. Some advances have been made in the control and prevention of animal parasitic diseases, but there are still some significant challenges, particularly in relation to foodborne parasitic zoonoses and vector-borne diseases. In addition, new molecular (e.g., genomic and transcriptomic) technologies have been developed and are gradually being introduced into the veterinary parasitology field. Therefore, teaching of veterinary parasitology in Chinese universities has undergone significant changes over the years, in terms of topics, depth and breadth, and also in the ways in which courses are delivered. In this article, we describe the current status of veterinary parasitology teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels in Chinese universities, summarise changes and improvement in veterinary parasitology teaching, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for veterinary parasitology teaching in the 21st century, including the use of new teaching technologies and the integration of the "One Health" concept into veterinary parasitology courses.

AB Cardiopulmonary nematodes are life-threatening pet parasites increasingly reported throughout Europe, with overlapping endemic areas. Dirofilaria immitis is a mosquito-borne whilst Angiostrongylus vasorum is a snail-borne pathogen. Both adult nematodes reside in the pulmonary arteries and right cardiac ventricle of domestic and wild canids, causing a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from cough, dyspnoea and exercise intolerance to severe vascular and pulmonary disease with hearth failure that may lead to death. Information about the prevalence and distribution of cardiopulmonary parasites is essential for the control of animal diseases and, in the case of D. immitis, for the control of potentially associated illnesses in humans. However, in Portugal, heartworm studies are limited to few surveys and case reports, possibly underestimating the relevance of these nematodes. The present work reviews the data on cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis and angiostrongylosis in dogs in Portugal, providing a comprehensive update of the epidemiological situation during the past 20 years.

AB Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is responsible for reducing animal welfare, causing a drop in productive performance and transmitting hemoparasites. The main strategy of tick control is application of synthetic acaricides. However, parasite resistance to these compounds is a major concern. Therefore, the acaricidal and repellent in vitro effect of the Ocotea elegans essential oil on larvae and adult females of R. (B.) microplus were evaluated. The larval packet test (LPT), larval repellency test (RT) and adult immersion test (AIT) were performed. The essential oil was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC/FID) and the structure of the oil's major constituent (92.2% sesquirosefuran) was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance. In the AIT, efficacy higher than 90% was detected from the concentration 25 mg/mL upward. In both LPTs performed after 48 h, only the 100 mg/mL concentration resulted in mortalities above 70%. On the other hand, the essential oil caused an average of 95.8% repellency from 0.78 to 100 mg/mL. The LC50 in the two LPT (48 h) tests were 59.68 and 25.59 mg/mL, respectively. The LC50 and LC90 in the AIT were 4.96 and 17.37 mg/mL, and in the RT they were 0.04 and 1.24 mg/mL respectively. We conclude that the essential oil of O. elegans leaves has a significant acaricidal effect on engorged females and on larval repellency of R. (B.) microplus ticks, and can be a promising alternative for the control of this ectoparasite.

AB Ocular thelaziosis is caused by nematodes of the genus Thelazia (Spirurida, Thelaziidae), which inhabit the surface of the eyes and associated tissues. Thelazia callipaeda affects a range of mammal species, including humans, and in the last two decades has been reported in multiple European countries, being classified as an emergent vector-borne pathogen. In Portugal T. callipaeda is endemic in north-eastern areas, where it has been reported in domestic dogs, cats, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We report, for the first time, T. callipaeda in a beech marten (Martes foina) from Portugal and highlight the presence of haplotype 1 as the only one found in Europe, irrespective of the host species and geographical area of pro-venience.

AB Cryptosporidiosis in raptors and falcons is well-known to be caused by Cryptosporidium baileyi and associated mainly with respiratory pathology. This report presents the diagnosis of an atypical cryptosporidiosis event caused by Cryptosporidium parvum, that to the authors' knowledge, is a case observed for the first time in falcons. Two falcons (Gyrfalcon x Peregrine hybrids) were presented for annual check without any clinical signs. Hematology, biochemistry, fecal and crop parasitology, radiographic and endoscopic examinations were performed. Endoscopy revealed microcystic formation of the caudal lung field in the two falcons, adhesions and air sac alterations. Sampling and subsequent cytology revealed fungal spores and acid fast stain organisms (identified as Cryptosporidium spp.). Feces and affected lung tissue was further send for Cryptosporidium spp.-DNA detection. Fecal samples and lung tissue tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. gp60 gene by PCR. By sequence analysis of the gp60 gene locus, diagnosis of C. parvum was confirmed with 100% homology. Despite the fact that falcons didn't recover after 1 month of therapy, eight months after the initial examination they were clinically healthy and had satisfactory flying performance. No other falcons were observed with C. parvum infections in the facility so far. The possible source, infection route and implications are discussed.

AB Lactic acid is one of the emerging top biomass derived platform chemicals that can be fermented from organic wastes. This study evaluated the potential of Cathodic Electro-Fermentation (CEF) as a novel approach to enhance the yield of high optical activity (OA) of L-lactic acid from organic wastes using mixed microbial consortium. The fermentation process was stimulated through the cathode applied with -100 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which contributed to 4.73 times higher lactic acid productivity (0.6578 g L-1 h(-1)) compared to that in the open circuit control (0.1392 g L-1 h(-1)), and an improved OA of L-lactic acid was also observed (42.3% vs. 3.6% of the open circuit control). The study elucidated that the optimal voltage at -100 mV promoted the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate by 77.9% compared to the Blank, which triggered the generation of L-lactic acid to occur rapidly even at low concentration of pyruvate. The significant variation of microbial community in family- and genus-level distributions were observed in CEF system. Furthermore, the open-circuit operation test demonstrated that the cathode providing in-situ electron supply was essential to achieve high efficient bioconversion of organic wastes to lactic acid. Our work highlights the feasibility of CEF to steer high value-added fermentation products deriving from organic wastes by the mixed microbial consortium. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Taste & odor (T&O) problems in drinking water are always complained by customers. Recent studies have indicated biofilms in drinking water distribution system (DWDS) are always ignored as potential sources of T&O compounds. In this paper, the formation of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (2,4,6-TCA), one of the dominant T&O compounds, was investigated in a pilot-scale DWDS. The addition of precursor 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) of 0.2 mg/L induced the formation of 2,4,6-TCA with a maximum yield of similar to 400 ng/L, and the formation kinetics can be described by a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Effects of water distribution factors such as pipe material, temperature, flow velocity, and residual chlorine on the formation of 2,4,6-TCA were evaluated, and the pipe material was found to have the most remarkable effect. Ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more 2,4,6-TCA than polyethylene (PE) pipe. The biofilm microbial communities on the three types of pipe walls were then comprehensively analyzed by heterotrophic plate count and 16S rRNA/ITS1 genes high throughput sequencing. The links between the 2,4,6-TCA formation potential and the microbial activity in genus and enzymatic levels in DWDS have been revealed for the first time. According to the characteristics of microbial assemblages of producing 2,4,6-TCA, quorum-sensing (QS) bacterial signaling system and extracellular DNA (eDNA) may be two promising targets for biofilm treatment and 2,4,6-TCA control in DWDS.

AB Comprehensive monitoring of water pollution is challenging. With the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being released into water, there are rising concerns of undetected toxicity. This is especially true for municipal wastewater effluents that are discharged to surface waters. This study was designed to integrate zebrafish toxicogenomics, targeted gene expression, and morphological analyses, for toxicity evaluation of effluent discharged from two previously characterized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Pima County, Arizona, and their receiving surface water. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to organic extracts from the WWTP1 effluent that were reconstituted to represent 1x and 0.5x of the original concentration. Microarray analyses identified deregulated gene probes that mapped to 1666, 779, and 631 unique human homologs in the 1x, 0.5x, and the intersection of both groups, respectively. These were associated with 18 cellular and molecular functions ranging from cell cycle to metabolism and are involved in the development and function of 10 organ systems including nervous, cardiovascular, haematological, reproductive, and hepatic systems. Superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis, retinoic acid receptor activation, glucocorticoid receptor and prolactin signaling were among the top 11 perturbed canonical pathways. Real-time quantitative PCR validated the expression changes of 12 selected genes. These genes were then tested on zebrafish embryos exposed to the reconstituted extract of water sampled downstream of WWTP1 and another nearby WWTP2. The expression of several targeted genes were significantly affected by the WWTP effluents and some of the downstream receiving waters. Morphological analyses using four transgenic zebrafish lines revealed potential toxicity associated with nervous, hepatic, endothelial-vascular and myeloid systems. This study demonstrated how information can be obtained using adverse outcome pathway framework to derive biological effect-based monitoring tools. This integrated approach using zebrafish can supplement analytical chemistry to provide more comprehensive monitoring of discharged effluents and their receiving waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) can accomplish simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource recovery via interactions between microbes and electrodes. Often deemed as "energy efficient" technologies, BES have not been well evaluated for their energy performance, such as energy production and consumption. In this work, we have conducted a review and analysis of energy balance in BES with parameters like normalized energy recovery, specific energy consumption, and net energy production. Several BES representatives based on their functions were selected for analysis, including direct electricity generation in microbial fuel cells, hydrogen production in microbial electrolysis cells, nitrogen recovery in BES, chemical production in microbial electrosynthesis cells, and desalination in microbial desalination cells. Energy performance was normalized to water volume (kWh m(-3)), organic removal (kWh kg COD-1), nitrogen recovery (kWh kg N-1), chemical production (kWh kg(-1)), or removed salt during desalination (kWh kg(-1)). The key operating factors such as pumping system (recirculation/feeding pumps) and external power supply were discussed for their effects on energy performance. This is an in-depth analysis of energy performance of various BES and expected to encourage more thinking, analysis, and presentation of energy data towards appropriate research and development of BES technology for resource recovery from wastewater.

AB In this study, the desalination performance of Capacitive Deionization (CDI) and Membrane Capacitive Deionization (MCDI) was studied for a wide range of salt compositions. The comprehensive data collection for monovalent and divalent ions used in this work enabled us to understand better the competitive electrosorption of these ions both with and without ion-exchange membranes (IEMs). As expected, MCDI showed an enhanced salt adsorption and charge efficiency in comparison with CDI. However, the different electrosorption behavior of the former reveals that ion transport through the IEMs is a significant rate-controlling step in the desalination process. A sharper desorption peak is observed for divalent ions in MCDI, which can be attributed to a portion of these ions being temporarily stored within the IEMs, thus they are the first to leave the cell upon discharge. In addition to salt concentration, we monitored the pH of the effluent stream in CDI and MCDI and discuss the potential causes of these fluctuations. The dramatic pH change over one adsorption and desorption cycle in CDI (pH range of 3.5-10.5) can be problematic in a feed water containing components prone to scaling. The pH change, however, was much more limited in the case of MCDI for all salts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simultaneous removal of selenite and ammonium by aerobic granular sludge was investigated to develop an improved biological treatment process for selenium rich wastewaters. Aerobic granules not previously exposed to selenite were able to remove selenite by converting it to elemental selenium (Se(0)) and simultaneously remove ammonium under different conditions in batch experiments. To achieve sustainable selenite and ammonium removal, an aerobic granular sludge reactor was operated in fill-and draw mode with a cycle of anaerobic (8 h) and aeration (15 h) phases. Almost complete removal of different initial concentrations of selenite up to 100 mu M was achieved in the anaerobic phase. Ammonium removal was severely inhibited when the granules were initially exposed to 1.27 mg L-1 selenite, but ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies gradually improved to 100 and 98%, respectively, under selenite-reducing conditions. Selenite loading shifted ammonium removal occurring mainly during the anaerobic phase to both the anaerobic and aeration phases. Selenite was removed from the aqueous phase by converting it to nanoparticulate Se(0), which was entrapped in the granular sludge. Scanning electron microscop-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of Se(0) nanospheres and their retention in the granular sludge. The effluent Se ranged from 0.02 to 0.25 mg Se L-1, while treating up to 12.7 mg L-1 selenite, which is lower as compared to previous studies on selenite removal using activated sludge or anaerobic granular sludge. This study shows that aerobic granular sludge reactors are not only capable of removing toxic selenite, but offer improved treatment of Se-rich wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Feast-Famine (FF) process has been frequently used to select polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-accumulating mixed cultures (MCs), but there has been little insight into the ecophysiology of the microbial community during the selection process. In three FF systems with well-defined conditions, synchronized variations in higher-order properties of MCs and complicate microbial community succession mainly including enrichment and elimination of non-top competitors and unexpected turnover of top competitors, were observed. Quantification of PHA-accumulating function genes (phaC) revealed that the top competitors maintained the PHA synthesis by playing consecutive roles when the highly dynamic turnover occurred. Due to its specific physiological characteristics during the PHA-accumulating process, Thauera strain CYM 7 was found to be responsible for the fluctuating SVI, which threatened the robustness of the FF system. This trait was also responsible for its later competitive exclusion by the other PHA-producer, Paracoccus strain OTU 1. Deterministic processes dominated the entire FF system, resulting in the inevitable microbial community succession in the acclimation phase and maintenance of the stable PHA-accumulating function in the maturation phase. However, neutral processes, likely caused by predation from bacterial phages, also occurred, which led to the unpredictable temporal dynamics of the top competitors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Comprehensive insights into the sludge digestate dewaterability were gained through porous network structure of sludge. We measured the evolution of digestate dewaterability, represented by the solid content of centrifugally dewatered cake, in high-solids sequencing batch digesters with and without thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP). The results show that the dewaterability of the sludge after digestion was improved by 3.5% (+/- 0.5%) for unpretreated sludge and 5.1% (+/- 0.4%) for thermally hydrolyzed sludge. Compared to the unpretreated sludge digestate, thermal hydrolysis pretreatment eventually resulted in an improvement of dewaterability by 4.6% (+/- 0.5%). Smaller particle size and larger surface area of sludge were induced by thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion treatments. The structure strength and compactness of sludge, represented by elastic modulus and fractal dimension respectively, decreased with increase of digestion time. The porous network structure was broken up by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and was further weakened during anaerobic digestion, which correspondingly improved the dewaterability of digestates. The logarithm of elastic modulus increased linearly with fractal dimension regardless of the pretreatment. Both fractal dimension and elastic modulus showed linear relationship with dewaterability. The rheological characterization combined with the analysis of fractal dimension of sewage sludge porous network structure was found applicable in quantitative evaluation of sludge dewaterability, which depended positively on both thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion.

AB To achieve energy neutral wastewater treatment, mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. However, the relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration (> 10 mg N L-1) remains a significant barrier hindering its practical implementation. A novel technology integrating the anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) reactions in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was developed in this study to enhance the mainstream anammox process. With the hydraulic retention time (HRT) progressively decreased from 12 to 4 h, the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate increased stepwise from 0.09 to 0.28 kg N m(-3) d(-1), with an effluent TN concentration below 3.0 mg N L-1 achieved. Mass balance analysis showed that 30-60% of the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was reduced back to nitrite by DAMO archaea, and the anammox and DAMO bacteria were jointly responsible for nitrite removal with contributions of > 90% and < 10%, respectively. Additionally, the established MBfR was robust and achieved consistently high effluent quality with > 90% TN removal when the influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratio varied in the range of 1.17-1.55. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that anammox bacteria, DAMO bacteria and DAMO archaea jointly dominated the biofilm, and were likely the key contributors to nitrogen removal. This is the first study that a high nitrogen removal rate (> 0.2 kg N m(-3) d(-1)) and satisfactory effluent quality (similar to 3 mg TN L-1) were achieved simultaneously by integrating anammox and DAMO reactions in mainstream wastewater treatment.

AB Bisphenol S (BPS), as a main alternative of bisphenol A for the production of industrial and consumer products, is now frequently detected in aquatic environments. In this work, it was found that free chlorine could effectively degrade BPS over a wide pH range from 5 to 10 with apparent second-order rate constants of 7.6-435.3 M(-1)s(-1). A total of eleven products including chlorinated BPS (i.e., mono/di/tri/tetrachloro-BPS), 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (BSA), chlorinated BSA (mono/dichloro-BSA), 4-chlorophenol (4CP), and two polymeric products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Two parallel transformation pathways were tentatively proposed: (i) BPS was attacked by stepwise chlorine electrophilic substitution with the formation of chlorinated BPS. (ii) BPS was oxidized by chlorine via electron transfer leading to the formation of BSA, 4CP and polymeric products. Humic acid (HA) significantly suppressed the degradation rates of BPS even taking chlorine consumption into account, while negligibly affected the products species. The inhibitory effect of HA was reasonably explained by a two-channel kinetic model. It was proposed that HA negligibly influenced pathway i while appreciably inhibited the degradation of BPS through pathway ii, where HA reversed BPS phenoxyl radical (formed via pathway ii) back to parent BPS.

AB Stormwater constructed wetlands are not well characterised for their ability to remove pathogens which can pose public health risks during stormwater harvesting activities. This study investigated the behaviour of faecal indicator organism Escherichia coli (E. coli) and reference pathogen Campylobacter spp. in stormwater constructed wetlands, using a case study system located in Melbourne, Australia. Grab sampling and event-based monitoring revealed influent concentrations of E. coli were typical of other urban stormwater studies, yet Campylobacter concentrations were orders of magnitude above those urban stormwater studies used to develop the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling, reached levels typical of raw domestic wastewater. The wetland consistently removed E. coli from stormwater (mean log removal 0.96, range 0.19-1.79), while Campylobacter spp. concentrations were often higher in outflow than inflow (mean log removal 0.05, range -0.9-1.25). These results indicate that E. coli is a poor indicator for this reference pathogen. The log reductions of both organisms also failed to meet the criteria specified for any end-use, as listed in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling, suggesting further treatment is required prior to harvesting. Finally, this study proposed that direct faecal deposition by waterfowl faeces was a microbial source to stormwater wetlands and that this was partly responsible for the varied microbial removal rates observed. Overall, this work validates the need for further characterisation of pathogens in raw urban stormwater, and the ability for water sensitive urban design features, such as wetlands, to remove both indicator and pathogenic microorganisms.

AB Microbial degradation is an important pathway during the removal of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the effects of CW design, plant presence, and different plant species on the microbial community in CWs have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of L-arginine, L-phenyl-oalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations. These results provide useful information for optimizing the operational parameters of CWs to improve ibuprofen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, good reusability and low cost are highly demanded for adsorbents used in practical adsorption process. In this study, a porous double network Jute/Polyacrylic acid (Jute/PAA) gel was prepared using simple free-radical polymerization of acrylic acid in Jute aqueous solution. The high permeability of Jute/PAA hydrogel with about 80 wt% water made internal adsorption sites fully expose to metal ions. The Jute/PAA gel adsorbent could efficiently adsorb heavy metals in melting wastewater, especially Cd2+ and Pb2+. The adsorbent showed very high adsorption capacities of 401.7 mg/g for Cd2+ and 542.9 mg/g for Pb2+. Moreover, the adsorption equilibrium reached within only 10 min for 40 mg/L of Cd2+ and Pb2+ using 1 g/L adsorbent. Meanwhile, the removal efficiencies reached 81.0% for Pb (C-0 = 3.825 mg/L), 79.3% for Cd (C-0 = 6.075 mg/L), 83.4% for Cu (C-0 = 9.325 mg/L), 29.8% for Zn (C-0 = 188.6 mg/L), 22.3% for Mn (C-0 = 17.05 mg/L), 96.2% for Cr (C-0 = 0.25 mg/L) and 99.8% for Fe (C-0 = 9.75 mg/L) in melting wastewater using 1 g/L adsorbent in 2 h. In particular, the concentrations of Pb, Cd and Cr decreased below 0.001 mg/L using 4 g/L adsorbent. In the fixed-bed column experiments, the treatment volume of melting wastewater reached 2900 BV (32.8 L) only producing 50 BV (565 mL) eluent. This work develops a highly practical adsorption process based on hydrogel adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in actual wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.C

AB Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important optically active substance in aquatic environments and plays a key role in light attenuation and in the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles. Although the optical properties, abundance, sources, cycles, compositions and remote sensing estimations of CDOM have been widely reported in different aquatic environments, little is known about the optical properties and composition changes in CDOM along trophic gradients. Therefore, we collected 821 samples from 22 lakes along a trophic gradient (oligotrophic to eutrophic) in China from 2004 to 2015 and determined the CDOM spectral absorption and nutrient concentrations. The total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations and the Secchi disk depth (SDD) ranged from 0.02 to 24.75 mg/L, 0.002-3.471 mg/L, 0.03-882.66 mu g/L, and 0.05 -17.30 m, respectively. The trophic state index (TSI) ranged from 1.55 to 98.91 and covered different trophic states, from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic. The CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)) ranged from 1.68 to 92.65 m(-1). Additionally, the CDOM sources and composition parameters, including the spectral slope and relative molecular size value, exhibited a substantial variability from the oligotrophic level to other trophic levels. The natural logarithm value of the CDOM absorption, lna(254), is highly linearly correlated with the TSI (r(2) = 0.92, p < .001, n = 821). Oligotrophic lakes are distinguished by a(254)<4 m(-1), and mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes are classified as 4 <= a(254)<= 10 and a(254) >10 m(-1), respectively. The results suggested that the CDOM absorption coefficient a(254) might be a more sensitive single indicator of the trophic state than TN, TP, Chla and SDD. Therefore, we proposed a CDOM absorption coefficient and determined the threshold for defining the trophic state of a lake. Several advantages of measuring and estimating CDOM, including rapid experimental measurements, potential in situ optical sensor measurements and large-spatial-scale remote sensing estimations, make it superior to traditional TSI techniques for the rapid monitoring and assessment of lake trophic states.

AB Benzotriazoles (BTs) are considered as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs); however, information about their fate in aquifers continues to be absent. This was the focus of the present study, which provides the first evidence for relevant BTs' degradation products (BTTPs) in urban aquifers that may impact the groundwater quality. The mechanisms and biotransformation pathways of BTs were investigated in an oxic intergranular medium. The BTs and BTTPs were identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analytical techniques based on reference standards and internal materials. The major transformation products were identified as 2-methyl-2H-benzotriazole (2-MeBT) for the degradation of 1H-benzotriazole (BT) and as 2,4-dimethyl-2H-benzotriazole (2,4-dMeBT) and 1,4-dimethy1-1H-benzotriazole (1,4-dMeBT) for the degradation of 4-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (4-MeBT), and most probably also 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5-MeBT). The leakage of wastewater pipelines is most probably the source of BTs. Sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity give rise to perched aquifer conditions that lead to the temporal storage of leaking effluents and presumably the majority of BTs' transformation processes via methylation and tautomerization. The most stable BTTPs entered the saturated zone of the aquifer, where they prevailed. Concentrations up to 1500 ng L-1 were measured for the 2,4-dMeBT, which suggest a contamination risk for groundwater that is or may be used as a source for drinking water in the case of a constant input of pollutant loads from sewer systems.

AB The occurrence of several classes of emerging contaminants (ECs) was assessed in the River Lambro basin, one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas of Italy. The study aims were to identify the main sources of ECs, quantify their amounts circulating in the water cycle, and study their fate in the aquatic environment. More than 80 ECs were selected among pharmaceuticals (PHARM), personal care products (PCPs), disinfectants (DIS), illicit drugs (IDs), perfluorinated compounds (PERF), alkylphenols and bisphenol A (Alk-BPA), and anthropogenic markers (AM). Specific analytical methods were developed for quantitative analysis based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ECs were measured in rivers upstream and downstream of the main city (Milan), and in untreated and treated wastewater from Milan to assess the contribution to river contamination, and in superficial and deep groundwater in the city area to study the relationship between river and groundwater contamination. Samples were collected in a two-year monitoring campaign. Almost all ECs were ubiquitous in untreated wastewater, at concentrations up to the mu g/L range, and the most abundant classes were PHARM and AM. Removals during different wastewater treatment processes were studied and the most stable substances were PHARM, PCPs and PERF. The mass loads increased for all the classes of ECs along the River Lambro basin. A mass balance was done in the river basin and allowed to identify the main sources of contamination, which were domestic, from treated or untreated wastewater, for PHARM, PCPs and IDs, mainly industrial for PERF, and both industrial and domestic for Alk-BPA. The study of AM helped to identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater. A substantial contribution of surface water to groundwater contamination was observed. This study improves the knowledge on occurrence, sources and fate of multiple classes of ECs in a highly urbanized area providing useful information to help the establishment of EU regulations for ECs.

AB Plant-integrated and on-site gas emissions were quantified from a Swedish wastewater treatment plant by applying several optical analytical techniques and measurement methods. Plant-integrated CH4 emission rates, measured using mobile ground-based remote sensing methods, varied between 28.5 and 33.5 kg CH4 h(-1), corresponding to an average emission factor of 5.9% as kg CH4 (kg CH4 (production)) (-1), whereas N2O emissions varied between 4.0 and 6.4 kg h(-1), corresponding to an average emission factor of 1.5% as kg N2O-N (kg TN (influent)) (-1). Plant-integrated NH3 emissions were around 0.4 kg h(-1), corresponding to an average emission factor of 0.11% as kg NH3-N (kg TN (removed)) (-1). On-site emission measurements showed that the largest proportions of CH4 (70%) and NH3 (66%) were emitted from the sludge treatment line (mainly biosolid stockpiles and the thickening and dewatering units), while most of the N2O (82%) was emitted from nitrifying trickling filters. In addition to being the most important CH4 source, stockpiles of biosolids exhibited different emissions when the sludge digesters were operated in series compared to in parallel, thus slightly increasing substrate retention time in the digesters. Lower CH4 emissions and generally higher N2O and NH3 emissions were observed when the digesters were operated in series. Loading biosolids onto trucks for off-site treatment generally resulted in higher CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions from the biosolid stockpiles. On-site CH4 and N2O emission quantifications were approximately two-thirds of the plant-integrated emission quantifications, which may be explained by the different timeframes of the approaches and that not all emission sources were identified during on site investigation. Off-site gas emission quantifications, using ground-based remote sensing methods, thus seem to provide more comprehensive total plant emissions rates, whereas on-site measurements provide insights into emissions from individual sources.

AB Reactive Electrochemical Membrane (REM) prepared from carbothermal reduction of TiO2 is used for the mineralization of biorefractory pollutants during filtration operation. The mixture of Ti4O7 and Ti5O9 Magneli phases ensures the high reactivity of the membrane for organic compound oxidation through (OH)-O-center dot mediated oxidation and direct electron transfer. In cross-flow filtration mode, convection-enhanced mass transport of pollutants can be achieved from the high membrane permeability (3300 LMH bar(-1)). Mineralization efficiency of oxalic acid, paracetamol and phenol was assessed as regards to current density, transmembrane pressure and feed concentration. Unprecedented high removal rates of total organic carbon and mineralization current efficiency were achieved after a single passage through the REM, e.g. 47 g m(-2) h(-1) - 72% and 6.7 g m(-2) h(-1) - 47% for oxalic acid and paracetamol, respectively, at 15 mA cm(-2). However, two mechanisms have to be considered for optimization of the process. When the TOC flux is too high with respect to the current density, aromatic compounds polymerize in the REM layer where only direct electron transfer occurs. This phenomenon decreases the oxidation efficiency and/or increases REM fouling. Besides, O-2 bubbles sweeping at high permeate flux promotes O-2 gas generation, with adverse effect on oxidation efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microcystis aeruginosa, as the most common cyanobacteria, often grows uncontrollably in eutrophic lakes with the accumulation of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in water, which heavily pollutes water and hence imposes tremendous threat to aquatic animals and human beings. To remediate the harmful algae polluted water, here we synthesize a series of poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDDA) modified TiO2 floating photocatalysts, PDDA@NPT-EGC, and apply them as a visible light driven multifunctional material. The fabricated PDDA@NPT-EGC composites have a worm-like structure with PDDA particles distributed on their surfaces, and the concentration of PDDA can affect the agglomerative condition and distribution of PDDA particles and the photoelectric properties of catalysts. Among these catalysts, the PDDA@NPT-EGC with 0.2 wt% PDDA (0.2PDDA@NPT-EGC) shows the highest adsorption and photo catalytic activity. Compared with the NPT-EGC, the dark adsorption efficiency for the 0.2PDDA@NPT-EGC after 3 h increases from 70.4% to 88.9%, and the total removal efficiency after visible light irradiation for 2 h increases from 77.8% to 92.6%. In addition, the 0.2PDDA@NPT-EGC exhibits a removal efficiency of 96.55% for photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR after irradiation for 3 h. The Adda side chain of MC-LR molecule is found to degradate gradually in the photocatalytic degradation process, indicative of the elimination of biotoxicity for MC-LR molecule in the reaction. We demonstrate that the 0.2PDDA@NPT-EGC is remarkably competitive in both algae inactivation and MC-LR removal, which shall hold substantial promise in remediation of algae pollution in eutrophic waters.

AB Toxoplasma gondii has a complex life cycle and pathogenic mechanisms. Acute T. gondii infections in mice often result in death, whereas in chronic infections, the parasites may persist in the host tissues as intraneuronal or intramuscular cysts. However, the virulence of T. gondii strains in mice varies with its genetic background. The present study investigated the pathogenicity and pathological lesions of two T. gondii isolates from China: namely, TgCatCHn2 (ToxoDB#17) and TgCatCHn4 (ToxoDB#9). The virulent (ToxoDB#216) and avirulent (VEG) strains were employed as controls. Toxoplasmosis was induced by inoculating BALB/c mice with oocysts of the strains of T. gondii VEG, ToxoDB#216, TgCatCHn2 (ToxoDB#17), and TgCatCHn4 (ToxoDB#9), respectively. As a result, one oocyst of ToxoDB#216 could kill a mouse within 10 days post inoculation (DPI). The survival time of the mice for T. gondii TgCatCHn2 and TgCatCHn4 was > 60 DPI for 10(6)/mL oocysts, but this concentration (10(6)/mL oocysts) of VEG strain could kill mice within 11 DPI. Compared with the strains of T. gondii ToxoDB#216 and VEG, the lesions in the small intestines of the strains of TgCatCHn2- and TgCatCHn4-infected mice were significantly smaller (P < 0.01). The positive area of T. gondii antigen in the ileum of mice infected with the strains of T. gondii VEG, TgCatCHn2 and TgCatCHn4 were significantly lower than that T. gondii ToxoDB#216 at 8 DPI (P < 0.01). Paneth cells (PCs) in the small intestines was eliminated by ToxoDB#216 (5-6 DPI) (P < 0.05). The strains of T. gondii TgCatCHn2-, TgCatCHn4- and VEG-infected mice, the number of PCs and granules decreased in the intestines, compared to T. gondii free mice, but the difference was not significant (8 DPI, P > 0.05). However, the granules in the PCs showed negative lysozyme expression in the intestines of mice infected with T. gondii TgCatCHn2 and TgCatCHn4. Thus, T. gondii strains of TgCatCHn2 (ToxoDB#17) and TgCatCHn4 (ToxoDB#9) were avirulent strains, they triggered an inhibition of lysozyme expression in the granules of PCs of the mouse intestine. These effects may in turn lead to intestinal dysbiosis, which may be related to further parasitic invasion of the intestines. The findings of the present study further expand the spectrum of the pathogenic features of various Chinese isolates of T. gondii.

AB Cutaneous habronematidosis (CH) is a highly prevalent seasonally recurrent skin disease that affects donkeys as a result from the action of spirurid stomach worm larvae. Carrier flies mistakenly deposit these larvae on previous skin lesions or on the moisture of natural orifices, causing distress and inflicting relapsing wounds to the animals. First, we carried out a meta-analysis of the predisposing factors that could condition the development of CH in Andalusian donkeys. Second, basing on the empirical existence of an inter and intrafamilial variation previously addressed by owners, we isolated the genetic background behind the hypersensibility to this parasitological disease. To this aim, we designed a Bayesian linear model (BLM) to estimate the breeding values and genetic parameters for the hypersensibility to CH as a way to infer the potential selection suitability of this trait, seeking the improvement of donkey conservation programs. We studied the historical record of the cases of CH of 765 donkeys from 1984 to 2017. Fixed effects included birth year, birth season, sex, farm/owner, and husbandry system. Age was included as a linear and quadratic covariate. Although the effects of birth season and birth year were statistically non-significant (P > 0.05), their respective interactions with sex and farm/owner were statistically significant (P < 0.01), what translated into an increase of 40.5% in the specificity and of 0.6% of the sensibility of the model designed, when such interactions were included. Our BLM reported highly accurate genetic parameters as suggested by the low error of around 0.005, and the 95% credible interval for the heritability of +/- 0.0012. The CH hypersensibility heritability was 0.0346. The value of 0.1232 for additive genetic variance addresses a relatively low genetic variation in the Andalusian donkey breed. Our results suggest that farms managed under extensive husbandry conditions are the most protective ones against developing CH. Furthermore, these results provide evidence of the lack of repercussion of other factors such as age or sex. Potentially considering CH hypersensibility as a negative selection aimed goal in donkey breeding programs, may turn into a measure to improve animal welfare indirectly. However, the low heritability value makes it compulsory to control environmental factors to ensure the effectiveness of the breeding measures implemented to obtain individuals that may genetically be less prone to develop the condition.

AB There are no standard guidelines for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in reptiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two cryptosporidiosis therapies in captive green iguanas. Eight green iguanas aged 2-6 years, including 6 (1 male and 5 female) animals with chronic diarrhea, received treatment for cryptosporidiosis. The presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts was determined in 8 iguanas (100%), Isospora sp. oocysts were detected in 3 animals (37.5%), and Oxyuridae eggs were observed in 5 iguanas (62.5%). The animals were divided into two therapeutic groups (A and B). Group A iguanas were administered halofuginone (Halocur, 0,50 mg/ml Intervet Productions S.A., France) at a dose of 110 mg/kg body weight (BW) every 7 days for 5 weeks. Group B animals were administered sulfadiazine and trimethoprim (Norodine Vet Oral Paste sulfadiazine 288,3 mg/g, trimethoprim 58 mg/g, ScanVet Animal Health A/S, Denmark) at 75 mg/kg BW per os every 5 days for 5 weeks and spiramycin and metronidazole (Stomorgyl, spiramycin 1500000 IU, metronidazole 250 mg, Merial, France) at 200 mg/kg BW every 5 days for 5 weeks. Both groups received hyperimmune bovine colostrum and subcutaneous fluids. Before treatment, the average number of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts in 1 g of feces was determined at 1.71 * 10(5) (+/- 313,262.44) in group A and 1.56 * 10(5) (+/- 262,908.53) in group B; the average number of Iospora sp. oocysts was determined at 3.53 * 10(3) (+/- 1747.38), and the average number of Oxyuridae eggs was determined at 810 (+/- 496.74). Blood tests were performed once before treatment. The results of blood morphology and biochemistry tests before treatment revealed leukocytosis with a significant increase in heterophile and monocyte counts in all animals. Dehydration, elevated hematocrit values and low levels of Na+, Ca2+, PO4- and Cl- ions were observed in 6 iguanas. Two iguanas died during treatment. The gross necropsy revealed acute inflammation of gastric and duodenal mucosa, mucosal ecchymoses in the gastrointestinal tract, hepatomegaly and liver congestion, cholecystitis, enlarged kidneys and renal edema and congestion, cystitis, and an absence of fat bodies. Parasites were not detected in any developmental form after 40 days of therapy and during an monthly 18-month follow-up period. Effective treatment of cryptosporidiosis in reptiles minimizes the adverse consequences of disease, improves the animals' well-being and decreases euthanasia rates.

AB Three recombinant proteins of Echinococcus granulosus including two antigen B sub-units EgAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/2 and Echinococcus protoscolex calcium binding protein 1 (EPC1) were expressed in prokaryotic expression vectors. The diagnostic potential of these three recombinant proteins was evaluated in the detection of cystic echinococcosis in buffaloes in IgG-ELISA. The EgAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/2 recombinant proteins reacted fairly with the hydatid infected buffaloes with sensitivity of 75.0% and 78.6%, respectively and specificity of 75.8% while EPC1 recombinant protein showed higher sensitivity (89.3%) but lower specificity (51.5%). Cross-reactivity of these three antigens was assayed with buffalo sera naturally infected with Explanatum exptanatum, Paramphistomum epiclitum, Gastrothylax spp., Fasciola gigantica and Sarcocystis spp. EgAgB8/1 and EPC1 antigens cross-reacted with all these sera while EgAgB8/2 showed no cross-reaction with Sarcocystis spp. and reacted with some of the E. explanatum infected buffalo sera. This study explores the potential of three hydatid antigens viz. EgAgB8/1, EgAgB8/2 and EPC1 for their diagnostic potential in buffaloes positive for cystic echinococcosis.

AB The immunochromatographic test (ICT) is a convenient and low-cost method that can rapidly obtain results (10 min) under normal conditions. In this study, we established an ICT assay with two monoclonal antibodies: TgSAG3-3A7 and TgSAG3-4D5 based on the conserved protein of TgSAG3 that can be expressed in all the infective stages of T. gondii. 20 nm gold particles were prepared and conjugated with TgSAG3-3A7 MAb at the concentration of 12.5 mu g/mL. TgSAG3-4D5 MAb were used as the capture antibody because of its higher affinity tested by ELISA. The detection limit of the ICT assay was 100 ng with visual detection under optimal conditions of analysis. Positive porcine serum of Ctyptosporidiunt suis, Mycoplasma suis, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Cysticercus cellulosae, Isospora suis, and Trichinella spiralis were used to evaluate the specificity of this ICT and no cross-reactivity was observed. 310 porcine serum samples obtained from pig farms in Zhejiang Province, China were detected by this ICT and ELISA kit, 23 positive samples were found by the developed strip with the rate of 7.42% comparing with 22 positive samples detected by the commercially ELISA kit which the positive rate was 7.1%, the relative sensitivity and specificity of this ICT are 100% and 99.65%. Therefore, the ICT established in this study is proved effective, simple, specific and sensitive of T. gondii detection.

AB The teaching of veterinary parasitology to the large number of students at the Freie Universitat Berlin is mainly limited to conventional face-to-face lectures, supplemented by practical classes. Extensive parasite descriptions and diagnostic techniques are at the core of the practical classes, which are also intended to emphasise key biological and veterinary aspects covered in lectures. Further in-depth and specific learning is achieved within a detailed framework of elective courses, with defined learning outcomes for small groups of students, focusing on themes such as 'diagnosis and treatment of ectoparasites in companion animals' or 'zoonotic parasites'. Additionally, structured excursions are designed to offer experience through collaborative international investigations. Organ-based approaches are also an integral part of our veterinary parasitology teaching, done in collaboration with the clinical and para-clinical departments, either via face-to-face interactions or online. Wide-ranging themes, such as 'causes of colic in horses' or 'atopic dermatitis in dogs' are covered. Recently, diverse blended learning elements were introduced into the curriculum (e.g., QuerVet), which makes teaching and learning more flexible, in terms of time and space, and fosters self-directed learning and participation among the students. A new platform to provide online lectures for students, termed VET Talks, was launched in 2015 by the International Veterinary Student's Association (IVSA), and is as a publicly available educational support system for students. Provided free to veterinary students throughout the world, this platform offers students the opportunity to access lectures on interesting topics by outstanding speakers who are nominated by their students. Finally, continuing education (CE) opportunities are provided through specific Masters courses (Master of Equine Medicine, Master of Small Animal Sciences), classical seminars and recent webinars.

AB Finding a healthy balance between classical parasitology and clinical veterinary medicine remains a challenge. Veterinary parasitology, of vital interest in sub-Saharan Africa, has always featured prominently at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria (founded in 1920). The faculty was initially an integral part of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI), and parasitology was taught by specialist researchers from OVI - a cult of total coverage prevailed. Presenting three separate courses - ectoparasitology, helminthology and protozoology - continued for many decades. From 1949 to 1973 an attendance course in veterinary parasitology was presented in the final academic year. This was revived in 1995, with a "refresher" in parasitology for final-year students (during their clinic rotation), including diagnostic parasite identification and problem-solving group discussions (prepared and led by students). Student contact time (including practical classes and assessments), initially 80 h/discipline/year, was gradually reduced. A species-based approach (introduced in 1998) had a major impact - an introductory course in general parasitology was followed by fragmented lectures in the subsequent 2 years on key parasitic diseases in the species-based subjects. In 2013 the curriculum reverted to being discipline-based, i.e. all aspects of parasitology and parasitic diseases covered during one academic year. The 3 sub-disciplines are included in a 2-semester course, with a total contact time of 100 h, which barely meets the minimum recommended by the WAAVP. Various lessons learnt are discussed.

AB Cytauxzoon fells, and the resulting disease, cytauxzoonosis, is an emerging threat to domestic cats in the Midwest and Southeastern United States. Domestic cats that survive cytauxzoonosis (or are subclinically infected) are chronically infected with C. fells, yet to date, there is no information relative to chronic infections in bobcats, the natural reservoir. Over a period of 3.5 years (2014-2017), we captured and re-captured 5 bobcats in southern Illinois. One bobcat was captured each year of trapping, 1 was caught in the first and third year and 3 were recaptured approximately 1 year apart. We screened bobcats for the presence of C. fells using a nested PCR that amplified the nuclear small subunit (SSU) 18S rRNA. In addition, we amplified and sequenced the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) to detect if the strains of C. fells in each bobcat were consistent over time. All bobcats were positive for C. fells at the initial and subsequent capture(s). Bobcats that were PCR-positive for C. fells had blood smears screened for the presence of C. fells; all PCR-positive bobcats had detectable parasites in blood smears. The strains of C. fells present were consistent each year in 4 of 5 bobcats indicating these bobcats remained infected during this period. One bobcat appeared to be infected with a different strain based on a polymorphism at a nucleotide in ITS1. Our study provides important details of the epizootiology of C. fells: bobcats are chronically infected and are not immune to reinfection with new strains of C. fells.

AB One of the main goals in academia is, and has been, high quality education of students to provide theoretical and practical knowledge essential for professional life. Achieving this goal is highly dependent on teaching procedures and, consequently, on a constant adaptation of teaching styles to align to technical advances and cutting edge topics. Technical advances can strongly influence teaching and learning in the complex subject area of veterinary parasitology. Today's students are provided with extensive, digital lecture notes, and e-learning offers including virtual microscope technology to independently obtain intensified theoretical knowledge and understanding. As veterinary parasitology is also highly reliant on proficient practical skills, lectures with integrated diagnostic exercises are mandatory. Nowadays, such practical skills, such as carrying out faecal examination procedures, can be strengthened by having access to clinical skills labs. Advances such as digital lecture notes, e-learning and virtual microscopes do not only provide new, innovative opportunities, but can also comprise challenges. In this context, provision of sufficient relevant studying material may discourage students to take on responsibilities for autonomous gathering of information. Besides technical advances, 'Zeitgeist' changes are shaping teaching contents, which are progressively expanding as zoonoses are increasingly being focused on. With the aim of adopting the one-health concept, students today are expected not only to bear responsibilities for animals, but also for their owners and public health. This article will cast light on some key challenges and opportunities in modern veterinary parasitology teaching from the teachers' and the students' perspectives.

AB One of the allures of parasitology is its breadth of aspects spanning everything from molecules to ecosystems. Very few institutions have the capability to cover this breadth in educating parasitologists. As the national professional body, the Australian Society for Parasitology has developed a training course that aims to fill this gap. The course offers a comprehensive overview over the field, highlights the current research foci and introduces key methods. The program equips participants with an appreciation of parasites and with strategies to deal with the complexity of parasitological systems. The course provides an innovative model for training parasitological key concepts with a focus on professional development for early career researchers.

AB The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University has seen three major curriculum changes, in 1995, 2001 and 2007. The last change was made because of the European change to a Bachelor-Master system. Almost each time teaching hours tagged for veterinary parasitology have been reduced to currently a minimum of between 46 and 51.5 h, which is much less than the WAAVP-recommended minimum of 70-90 h. This results in a challenge to maintain a qualitatively adequate veterinary parasitology program in a curriculum. Following a brief historic account of previous curricula and implemented curriculum changes, experiences, limitations and opportunities are discussed, including the potential of introducing new teaching materials based, for example, on digital technologies and gaming.

AB While Sarcocystis parasites from the muscles of donkey and horse have been characterized as different species, similarities between the parasites in these host raises questions about this assignment (Levine and Tadros, 1980; Matuschka, 1983; Odening et al., 1995b). To resolve this, we examined the tissue cysts of Sarcocystis collected from donkeys and horses were studied by morphological and molecular methods. Morphological studies performed by light microscopy (LM) revealed that each of two types of cysts were present in samples from each host type. Under LM, villar protrusions (VP) were sometimes observed on the larger (Type I) and smaller (Type II) of these cyst types; when present, these were sometimes short and sometimes long. By electron microscopy (EM), VPs from both horse and donkey cysts were found to share similar structures, appearing to be typical of 'type 11a' VPs found on the Sarcocystis wall of Sarcocystis fayeri as described by Dubey et al., 1977. The VP of cysts in both horses and donkeys contained microtubules extending from the villar tips to the ground substance (GS). Ovoid, osmiophilic bodies (OB) were found along the length of the microtubules within the villi, but this feature was not found in all VP. To understand the phylogeny of the parasites, a portion of the taxi gene was sequenced from 22 isolated cysts (9 from donkeys and 13 from horses). Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed from these sequences and the closest homologues available in GenBank, revealing that all of the samples, regardless of host origin or morphological appearance under LM, grouped in one Glade. Ours is the first attempt to combine morphological measurements with coxI sequences in assessing such equine parasites; the results confirm a close relationship of the parasites from horse and donkey with S. fayeri. Further, the data suggest that the cysts in each host likely belong to the same species. As the first named species was Sarcocystis bertrami, we propose S. bertrami (syn. Sarcocystis fayeri) as the descriptor for this parasite of both horses and donkeys. Ultimately, this finding will only be validated by cross-transmission infection experiments that score the ability of parasite isolates from one Equus to infect the other.

AB Diagnosing the effects of helminth infections is an efficient way to manage the problem in ruminant production systems. Selection of animals in a flock that are infected with Haemonchus has traditionally involved differential packed cell volume measurements (PCV), and in recent years, the FAMACHA system has been used. However, few small analytical changes have been made. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of different diagnoses linked to packed cell volume (PCV) and FAMACHA system scores in native ewes, using a multivariate approach. Ewes were classified into three categories according to their score in the FAMACHA system (FS) and their packed cell volumes (PCV) as follows: Group AG (FS between 1 and 2 and PCV >= 30%); Group BG (FS score of 3 and PCV between 21 and 29%); Group CG (FS between 4 and 5 and PCV <= 20%). The animals were evaluated using performance characteristics, parasitological examinations, blood values and serum biochemistry. The data show that the use of a multivariate approach for different diagnoses using the FAMACHA system and PCV measurements gives similar results, although they have particular pathophysiological indicator patterns.

AB Parasitology is a relevant and integral part of veterinary medicine, and the WAAVP membership has skills ranging from morphological diagnostics and routine parasite control recommendations through the cutting edges of many disciplines, e.g., pharmacology, immunology, molecular biology and genomics. We regularly face a majority of students who want only the practical information useful the moment they enter the clinics. However, we are preparing them for careers lasting 30-50 years. Thus, we also must help them prepare for their futures. There is a constant squeeze on parasitology in the curricular footprint accompanying a mandatory need to cover the licensure basics. The basic material has stood the test of time, and until the agents are eradicated or the hosts extinct, they have value. But, a critical need is the interweaving of the marvels of modern science into the parasitology regularly presented. Often this has been done with boxes, highlights, or examples within classes or texts, but asides are mentally treated as such. Also, many of those teaching parasitology are unfamiliar with many of the concepts and details of this material, but these same folks remain a grand part of the profession. Also, it is hard to sneak this apparently unwarranted material past the clinically oriented veterinary student. Somehow, WAAVP needs to work with its membership to develop and assist faculty in the presentation of a curriculum that can meld the old and the avant guard into a fusion of tastes and flavours palatable to today's veterinary student and tomorrow's practitioner.

AB In a changing world with rapidly evolving new technologies, even in the "sheltered world" of teachers and lecturers at universities, we are challenged by new developments. As diversification is increasing in many aspects of our professional life, there is also a need to employ new ways of teaching, learning and assessments in veterinary curricula, taking into account the increasing numbers of students and limited teaching resources. The "classical" Austrian veterinary curriculum, with a series of consecutive lectures followed by practical courses in the different disciplines, separated from each other in the curricular time table and by annual examinations, has been a long-standing concept for teaching in the past. However, when veterinary practitioners and graduates where asked to judge the adequacy of undergraduate training for their professional skills and knowledge, several major shortcomings were revealed. The most commonly mentioned point was a lack of first-day competencies. As a consequence, the Vetmeduni Vienna developed a new veterinary curriculum implemented in 2014-2015. This curriculum covers 12 semesters and includes a "Diploma" (degree) thesis and several externships; graduates are eligible to practice in all branches of veterinary medicine. We abandoned the classical discipline-based teaching, established a modular, mostly organ-based system, and focus on student-centred and competency based learning and teaching with defined learning outcomes and first-day skills. We also include training of scientific, managerial and communication skills in the curriculum. What does this mean for parasitology? We do not teach this subject in a closed lecture, but rather in a modular style, starting in the first year with the taxonomy and basic morphology of the animal kingdom, proceeding to parasite biology of the major groups in the second year, to the diagnostic and clinical training in practicals in the third year as well as joint lectures, seminars and conversatories in the organ- and species-based clinical training in years 3-6. Examinations are organised in different test formats, aligned to a list of skills and diseases. Quality assurance is a formal process and implemented at different levels. The ultimate aim of undergraduate teaching is to provide students with defined professional competencies and promoting life-long learning.

AB The distribution of gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites across landscapes is closely related to the spatial distribution of hosts. In GI parasites with environmental life stages, the vitality of parasites is also affected by ecological and landscape-related components of the environment. This is particularly relevant for domestic livestock species that are often kept across habitats with varying degrees of degradation, exposing them to a wide range of environmentally robust parasite species. In our study, we examined the effect of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the prevalence and intensity of GI parasites across a free-ranging stock of Ankole cattle in the Mutara rangelands of northeastern Rwanda. Prevalence and intensity of each parasite type (i.e., strongyle-type nematodes, Strongyloides spp., Moniezia spp., and Eimeria spp.) were used as dependent variables. Two fixed factors related to season and conservation-political history, together with three principal components (condensed from nine ecological variables) were used as independent covariates in a univariate General Linear Model (GLM). Major effects on the prevalence and intensity of strongyle-type nematodes and on the intensity of Eimeria spp. were found in that vegetation-related effects such as above-ground grass biomass in conjunction with a high degree of soil compaction had a negative relationship with these parasite types. These unexpected findings suggest that strongyle-type and coccidian infections increase with increasing rangeland degradation. Strongyle-type nematode prevalence and intensity were also negatively related to goat/sheep density, indicating a 'dilution effect' of GI infections between domestic livestock species.

DE Veterinary parasitology; Education; Teaching; Learning; Denmark
AB Veterinary parasitology has always been considered to be relevant and interesting by the Danish veterinary students. Students have to acquaint themselves with many new, small creatures with complicated and varied life cycles and with intricate Latin names that are difficult to pronounce, as only a few parasites have Danish names. In our veterinary curriculum, zoology has disappeared as a discipline, and parasitology has gradually moved from the third year to the beginning of the second year, which implies that, for example, pathology and pharmacology are "unknown fields". The number of contact hours in veterinary parasitology has been gradually cut to 24 lectures (35 min each) and practical exercises (24 h), including 9 h on coprology. The course is taught and examined jointly with bacteriology and virology in a 8-week course. As a comprehensive course, it has become increasingly difficult to get students to acquire enough active knowledge of the most common parasites and an understanding of the basic principles in relation to, for example, transmission and control. Even though information is readily accessible through books and on-line resources, we still believe that a competent clinician should know a range of parasites by heart as an active resource for their work. The dilemma has been tackled (partly) by introducing a veterinary paraclinical refresher course of 18 h (half practicals and half lectures) in the fourth study year. The focus here is on host(herd)-oriented clinical and diagnostic parasitology. The students can also now select a One Health track for six months in which zoonotic parasites are obviously a relevant topic.

AB The tetra-primer ARMS-PCR is a rapid, simple and low cost method for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and has been used to detect SNPs associated with diseases and drug resistance. E198A in the isotype-1 beta-tubulin gene is one of the three SNPs associated with benzimidazole resistance in parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus. However, up to now, only PCR-RFLP method was used to test E198A in H. contortus. In the present study, we developed a tetra-primer ARMS-PCR to detect E198A in H. contortus and the accuracy of the results was compared with that of PCR-coupled sequencing. The results showed that optimization of PCR reaction system, especially the proportion of the amount of inner and outer primers, could achieve desirable amplification effect. Three different profiles displaying three distinct genotypes could be identified clearly and intuitively on the agarose gel where the samples with amplified PCR products containing two bands of 433 bp and 200 bp in size indicated susceptible homozygous (SS), those with PCR products containing two bands of 433 bp and 284 bp in length indicated resistant homozygous (RR) and the samples with amplified PCR products containing three bands of 433 bp, 284 bp and 200 bp in size indicated heterozygous (RS). The results showed that the established method can be successfully applied to the detection of E198A in H. contortus, which has high accuracy and is easy to perform.

AB The aims of this study were: 1) to assess the anthelmintic effect of Gliricidia sepium on the establishment of C. punctata third-stage larvae (L-3) in calves, and 2) to isolate and to elucidate an anti-exsheathment phytochemical from the plant offered during the trial. Twelve 3/4 Holstein x Zebu calves were divided in two experimental groups: control (T1) and treatment (T2) (n = 6). After adaptation, each calf was infected with an oral dose of 400 C. punctata L-3/Kg LW. Basal diet consisted of Digitaria decumbens hay (6.27% CP) and commercial concentrate (12% CP). In addition, during the experimental period T2 received fresh G. sepium leaves (26.88% CP) ad libitum. On day 9 post-infection, three calves per treatment were randomly selected for slaughter, and worm counts were performed. Larval establishment rates obtained were 13.44 +/- 0.13% and 3.1 +/- 1.42% for T1 and T2, respectively (P < .05). The reduction of larval establishment was 76.9%. The total length of worms recovered from the animals was also affected by the intake of G. sepium (P < .05). Phytochemicals present in G. sepium leaves offered to calves were isolated through silica gel columns and elucidated through Magnetic Nuclear Resonance (1H and 13C). Bio-guided isolation procedures lead to the elucidation of Oxytroside (Kaempferol 3-O-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside-7-O-rhamnopyranoside), which fully inhibited the C. punctata exsheathment process (2400 mu g Gliricidia sepium represents an alternative to prevent severe C. punctata infections by reducing larval establishment in cattle.

AB Babesiosis, theileriosis, and anaplasmosis are the most common tick-borne diseases in sheep. The majority of anaplasmosis and theileriosis are subclinical; however, babesiosis causes severe infections in small ruminants. Although there are many reports of co-infections with the agents of these diseases, their clinical severity compared with either of the infections alone is unknown. Within the host, interactions between co-infecting species may cause variations in clinical presentation and response to therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the tick-borne agents in sheep located at sites where fatal disease outbreaks caused by babesiosis have commonly been reported. Two hundred and nine sheep with clinical signs suggestive of ovine babesiosis were included in the study. The initial diagnosis of haemoparasites was based on clinical symptoms and microscopy and was confirmed using PCR assays. The blood samples were examined for the presence of Babesia ovis (B. ovis), Anaplasma ovis (A. ovis), A. phagocytophilum, and Theileria ovis (T. ovis). The results showed 86.12% of the animals were infected with one or more pathogens. B. ovis was the dominant pathogen. Overall, the infection rate of B. ovis, A. ovis, T. ovis, and A. phagocytophilum was 70.81%, 56.94%, 21.05%, and 2.39%, respectively. The infection rate of B. ovis alone (31.11%) was higher than A. ovis (9.44%) or T. ovis (1.67%) alone. Co infections were found at a higher percentage (57.78%) than single infections (42.22%). A. ovis was detected in the blood of a high percentage (98.07%) of co-infected animals. Coexistence of B. ovis and A. ovis (34.45%) was more common than other combinations of species. There was a noticeably low level of co-occurrence between B. ovis and T. ovis (1.11%). During the study, 11 sick animals did not survive despite treatment. Seven were infected with B. ovis alone, three had a dual infection with B. ovis and A. ovis, and one had B. ovis, A. ovis, and T. ovis.

DE Veterinary parasitology; Teaching; Vetsuisse; Switzerland
ID EXCELLENCE; WAAVP; PERSPECTIVE; PFIZER
AB Pursuant to the Joint Declaration by 29 European education ministers in June 1999 in the city of Bologna, Italy, the so-called 'Bologna Process' was officially introduced at the Vetsuisse Faculty (Universities of Zurich and Berne) in Switzerland in 2007. The long-term goal of restructuring the study programmes was to create a common European Higher Education Area (EHEA), with uniform and clearly defined standards for degrees ("diplomas"). Accordingly, the Vetsuisse curriculum was organised as a 3-year Bachelor and a 2-year Master study program. For the final Federal examination in veterinary medicine, both programs and a master thesis have to be completed. Parasitology, as a subject, is introduced with selected examples in the ecology course during the first academic year. The second and third years of the Bachelor program comprise non-organ-centred (NOC) and integrated organ-centred (OC) course modules, respectively. In the NOC modules, parasitology is taught in consecutive courses, focussing on topics including occurrence, biology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostics and the strategic principles of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions against major veterinary and zoonotic parasites. This syllabus is complemented with live demonstrations as well as practical laboratory exercises. Lecture notes, with defined learning objectives, are based on the textbook "Parasitology in Veterinary Medicine" which is available free of charge to students as an on-line edition in German. Furthermore, students review relevant parasitoses in the diagnostic context of OC case presentations. In another module, immunological aspects of parasitic diseases are elaborated on group sessions, supported through the use of specialist literature. The two-year Master program is divided into a core syllabus for all students, and elective subjects are chosen from six areas of specialisation (three each with clinical or non-clinical focus). Within the clinically focused specialisations, interactive teaching of control strategies against parasitoses of companion and farm animals is the focus. Students specialising in `Pathobiology' experience a deep immersion in parasitology. Learning objectives are verified in different test formats. E-learning tools, including a learning management online platform, allow interactive student training in coproscopic diagnostic techniques and in arachno-entomology and provide case-oriented teaching. Since an aptitude test limits the number of first-year students in veterinary medicine in Switzerland (80 in Zurich, 70 in Berne), the conditions for students and teachers are similar each year. The fragmentation of teaching in veterinary parasitology, the reduction of the number of diagnostic exercises and clinically oriented day-l-skills pertaining to the control of parasitoses are critically commented upon.

AB Typically, carnivores are the definitive and herbivores the intermediate hosts for protozoan Sarcocystis spp. In the definitive host, the parasite has sexual multiplication in the intestine. Asexual phases occur in the musculature of different intermediate hosts. Although intestinal sarcocystosis is common in dogs, muscular symptomatic sarcocystosis is rarely reported. Here we report a fatal dual Sarcocystis spp. infection in a dog. The dog had acute onset of non-ambulatory tetraparesis. While neurological findings suggested a generalized neuromuscular disease with peripheral neuropathy concordant with the neurological deficits, the highly elevated muscle enzymes were more suggestive of a myopathy. Despite supportive therapy, the dog died three days after the onset of clinical signs. Necropsy revealed severe monophasic multifocal myodegeneration with severe pyogranulomatous inflammation. Histology revealed multiple sarcocysts in skeletal muscles and a smaller number in the heart. In light microscopy, both thin-walled and very thin-walled sarcocysts were found in skeletal muscles. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of two types of mature sarcocysts. Morphologically, cysts were indistinguishable from Sarcocystis can Mum and Sarcocystis svanai, which were previously reported in a dog from USA. A region of the 18S rRNA gene sequence confirmed the presence of one species, S. arctica/caninum, without evidence for a dual infection. This is the first report of muscular sarcocystosis in a dog in Europe and, intriguingly, revealed morphologically similar species across the Atlantic.

AB In 2013, a 118-day study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of concurrent treatment at pasture turnout with an injectable macrocyclic lactone with activity up to 28 days and an oral benzimidazole, referred to as "conventional" anthelmintics, when compared to treatment with conventional macrocyclic lactone alone or an injectable macrocyclic lactone with extended activity of 100 days or longer. A group of 210 steers were obtained from a ranch in California and transported to Idaho, USA. A total of 176 steers with the highest fecal egg counts were blocked by pre-treatment body weights and pasture location. A total of 44 pasture paddocks were assigned with 4 steers per paddock with 12 paddocks per therapeutic treatment group and 8 paddocks per controls. The four treatments were injectable doramectin (Dectomax, Zoetis Inc., 0.2 mg kg(-1)BW, SC), injectable doramectin concurrently with oral albendazole (Valbazen, Zoetis Inc., 10 mg kg(-1) IBW, PO), extended release injectable eprinomectin (LongRange (TM), Merial Limited, 1 mg kg(-1)BW, SC) or saline. Cattle were individually weighed and sampled for fecal egg count on Days 0, 31/32, 61, 88, and 117/118 with an additional fecal sample on Day 14. At conclusion, one steer per paddock was euthanized for nematode recovery. The results from the first 32 days found evidence of macrocyclic lactone resistance against injectable doramectin and extended release eprinomectin. During this period the concurrent therapy provided nearly 100% efficacy based on fecal egg count reduction and a 19.98% improvement in total weight gain compared to controls (P = 0.039). At the conclusion of the 118-day study and past the approved efficacy for the conventional anthelmintics, the concurrent therapy with conventional anthelmintics provided a 22.98% improvement in total weight gain compared to controls (P = 0.004). The 118-day improvement in weight gain for the extended release eprinomectin group (29.06% compared to control) was not statistically different from the concurrent therapy with conventional anthelmintics. The results indicate that concurrent treatment with a conventional macrocyclic lactone and benzimidazole may provide production benefits early in the grazing period that continue throughout the entire period for cattle harboring macrocyclic lactone resistant nematodes. By using two different anthelmintic classes together, macrocyclic lactone resistant parasites were effectively controlled early in the period. Furthermore, the use of an effective conventional anthelmintic treatment regimen without an extended period of drug release may help to promote refugia and decrease the further selection for anthelmintic resistant parasites.

AB Toxocara canis is the helminth causing Toxocariasis, a parasitic disease with medical and veterinary implications. Their final host are members of the family Canidae and as paratenic hosts, most of the mammals are sensitive (man, rat, mouse, among others). It has been reported that a pituitary hormone, prolactin, it is responsible for reactivation and migration of larvae to the uterus and mammary gland during the last third of gestation in bitches. In addition, this hormone has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the immune response. Thus, the aim of this study, was to evaluate the effect of hypophysectomy in the rat model of Toxocariasis, on the immune response against this parasite during a chronic infection, for which parasite loads were analyzed in different organs (lung and brain). Furthermore, serum specific antibody titers, and percentages of different cells of the immune system were also determined. The results showed a decrease in the number of larvae recovered from lung and brain in the hypophysectomized animals. In this same group of animals, there was no production of specific antibodies against the parasite. As for the percentages of the cells of the immune system, there are differences in some subpopulations due to surgery and others due to infection. Our results demonstrated that the lack of pituitary hormones alters parasite loads and the immune response to the helminth parasite Toxocara canis.

AB Haemonchosis in camelids remains a challenging disease to treat, and prevention has become increasingly problematic due to widespread anthelmintic resistance. Barbervax (R) is an adjuvanted vaccine containing natural H-11, H-gal-GP antigens obtained from Haemonchus contortus adults via a proprietary process and solubilized in Quil A. This vaccine is approved for use in Australia, after demonstrating its safety and efficacy in sheep and goats. There are no published studies evaluating Barbervax in other ruminants/pseudoruminants such as camelids which can be parasitized with H. contortus. The vaccine utilizes a mixture of the parasite gut mucosal membrane enzymes including H-gal-GP and H11, involved in digesting a blood meal from the host. This study monitored the safety profile of the Barbervazx (R) vaccine in a group of adolescent alpacas. Although designed into the original study of vaccine efficacy, the experimental infection with viable H. contortus third stage larvae could not be completed due to lack of detectable significant variation of infection following experimental challenge. Twelve alpacas (158 + 15 days) were randomized to vaccination with Barbervax (R) or no treatment. Three doses of Barbervax (R) were administered at 3 week intervals and investigators involved in animal monitoring and sample collection were blinded to the groupings. Clinical pathologic parameters were evaluated 7 days before vaccination, and 1 and 2 months post-vaccination. Daily clinical observations were made and specific observations regarding the injection site and rectal temperatures were monitored in each alpaca twice daily for 1 week following vaccination. Fecal egg counts, packed cell volume, and total protein were monitored following challenge with 1500 H. contortus larvae on days 42, 46, and 50. An increase in rectal temperature for a duration of 2 days (range 2-4 days) was observed post-vaccination. Vaccinated alpacas were lethargic for 2-3 days following vaccination; however, they maintained an appetite and no visible or palpable injection site reactions were observed. Following the first vaccination, all animals maintained normal clinical pathologic parameters throughout the study period. The vaccinated animals did develop titers to the H. contortus antigen as measured by ELISA. In conclusion, the Barbervax (R) vaccine demonstrated safety in this small group of young, healthy alpacas, but additional studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine under field conditions in protecting alpacas against infection with H. contortus.

AB Multiple single-channel meso-scale combustors assembling into a multi-channel meso-scale planar combustor is a good solution for elevating the output power of the micro-thermophotovoltaic system. Consequently, how to assembly a multi-channel meso-scale planar combustor for achieving higher output power comes to be an interesting issue. In this work, four representative four-channel meso-scale planar combustors, namely, combustor A, combustor B, combustor C and combustor D are designed. Extensive numerical investigations are conducted to compare the wall temperature of the four combustors under various hydrogen mass flow rates, hydrogen/air equivalence ratios and solid materials. Two variables, namely, mean wall temperature and nonuniformity coefficient of wall temperature are defined for comparing the wall temperature of the four meso-scale cornbustors. It is found that the purely counterflow four-channel meso-scale planar combustor D has more uniform and higher wall temperature compared with other combustors. Furthermore, the detailed heat transfer mechanisms of four different four-channel meso-scale planar combustors are analyzed and presented. In addition, some critical values are proposed for keeping high and uniform wall temperature on the purely counterflow four channel meso-scale planar combustor. This work offers us great reference value for the design of multi-channel meso-scale planar combustor.

AB This study presents a sequential sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (Na3PO4 center dot 12H(2)O) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) pretreatment to enhance sugar release from corn cobs. The effects of Na3PO4 center dot 12H(2)O concentration, H2SO4 concentration and solid to liquid ratio on the reducing sugar yield were investigated. The developed model had a coefficient of determination value (R-2) of 0.98. Maximum reducing sugar yield of 0.99 +/- 0.01 g/g was obtained with 12.70% Na3PO4 center dot 12H(2)O, 1.04% H2SO4 and 14.49% solid to liquid ratio. A 9-fold increase in the sugar yield was observed compared to previous reports on corn cobs. An intelligent model was developed to determine functional relationships between the input and output parameters. Reducing sugar yield was majorly dependent on Na3PO4 center dot 12H(2)O concentration and fits a Weibull type of relationship. Sequential pretreatment of lignocellulosic material with alkalic salt and dilute acid significantly enhanced sugar recovery and demonstrated high efficiency for microbial production of biofuels and bioproducts.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system is drawing great attention due to its energy-saving, environmentally friendly and cost-saving characteristics. Conventionally, CCHP system uses the water-LiBr absorption chiller to meet the cooling demand. In this paper, comparison of exhaust-gas-and-hot-water-driven absorption chiller (AC) and another three cooling modes, including AC combined with electric chiller (EC), AC combined with gas-fired absorption chiller (GFC), and AC combined with ground source heat pump (GSHP), is made. Optimization models for the four CCHP systems following the electric load (FEL) and following the thermal load (FTL) are proposed. The evaluation criteria include primary fossil energy saving rate (PFESR), carbon dioxide emission reduction rate (CDERR) and annual total cost saving rate (ATCSR) compared with the separation production (SP) system. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to achieve the optimal solutions. A case analysis of a hypothetical commercial building in Shanghai is performed. Results show that the CCHP system with GSHP under FEL strategy has the best comprehensive performance, with PFESR of 0.2990, CDERR of 0.5278 and ATCSR of 0.1582. Finally, sensitivity analysis of climate, natural gas price and pool purchase price are performed.

AB Fuel-Cell System (FCS) is the primary energy supply of a Fuel-Cell Vehicle (FCV). Battery or Ultra-Capacitor (UC), as a secondary power source, is used along the FCS to improve the FCV's power response. Battery and UC composition, as a hybrid power source presenting the term of Fuel-Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV), provides the FCV with the advantages of high energy density and high dynamic response. The supervisory system of the FCHEV could be managed efficiently to exploit the benefits of battery and UC at the same time. As a matter of fact, in such a combination, the performance of the hybrid powertrain largely depends on how to distribute the requested power through different types of energy sources.
   In this paper, we design the powertrain elements of an FCHEV in advance, with FCS/Battery/UC considerations. The energy management strategy (EMS) is achieved by presenting a novel power sharing method and by implementing an intelligent control technique constructed based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The control parameters are accurately adjusted by the genetic algorithm (GA) while considering targets and restrictions within a multi-objective optimization function over a combined city/highway driving cycle. This optimized supervisory system is examined by Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) to evaluate the performance of the proposed EMS over 22 different driving cycles and some specific performance tests. The results of simulation show that the presented strategy progressively affects the vehicle characteristics. Fuel economy enhancement, vehicle performance improvement, battery charge-sustaining capability, and optimal energy distribution are some of the significant outcomes achieved by the optimized FLC-based EMS.

AB The electrodeposition technique for preparing direct methanol fuel cell electrodes has been developed to increase the Pt utilization and lower the Pt loading. The performance of the Pt/C electrode for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was optimized by adjusting the electrodeposition parameters such as applied electrical signal types, ratios of t(on)/t(off) deposition temperatures, and electrolyte concentrations, systematically. Furthermore, the effects of two kinds of additives, i.e. polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), on the catalytic performance and morphology of Pt catalyst were investigated for MOR by SEM, XRD, cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The results show that the optimal Pt catalyst has been prepared by the square wave current method with t(on)/t(off) of 1 s/5 s at 30 degrees C in a 1.0 mmol L-1 H2PtCl6 solution with a 10(-4) mmol L-1 PEG additive. Moreover, the effect of the additive type and amount on the formation mechanism of the Pt crystallite morphology has also been discussed. From the results, introducing additives into the deposition solution in the pulse electrodeposition process is useful for designing and fabricating electrocatalytic electrodes for direct methanol fuel cells.

AB In this study, the effects of ZnO/water nanofluid and pure water as working fluids on the electrical and thermal energy efficiencies of a photovoltaic thermal system (PVT) are numerically investigated. The governing equations are discretized and solved using the pressure-based finite volume method by the ANSYS Fluent 16.2 software. The 3D numerical model is validated by comparing the simulation results with those of the measurements. The experiments are performed on selected days in August and September at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. To investigate the reliability of the measurements, an uncertainty analysis is performed for the experiments. The effects of the important operating parameters on the electrical and thermal energy efficiencies of the PVT system with ZnO/water nanofluid are studied. Moreover, the Taguchi method is applied to determine the optimum performance of the nanofluid based PVT system. The considered parameters include: absorbed solar irradiation, wind speed, ambient temperature, coolant inlet temperature, coolant mass flow rate, and nanoparticles mass fraction in the ZnO/water nanofluid. Based on the results of this study, reducing the coolant inlet temperature from 40 degrees C to 20 degrees C enhances the thermal energy efficiency of the nanofluid based PVT system by 16.21%. Moreover, it is found that the considered parameters in this study have slight effects on the electrical energy efficiency of the PVT system. The Taguchi analysis shows that the coolant inlet temperature is the most effective parameter on the efficiency of the nanofluid based PVT system.

AB In this paper, the potential of using high frequency ultrasound for improving cooling performance of a PV module has been investigated experimentally. Atomized CuO nanofluid (0.01-0.8 (w/v)) as well as atomized pure water have been used as coolant fluids. The various parameters such as module surface temperature, maximum power increase and cooling efficiency of PV module using atomized nanofluid have been compared with those of pure water. It has been observed that atomizing the working fluid by ultrasound energy significantly enhance the cooling performance of the studied PV module. Results depict that cooling by atomized nanofluid was more efficient than cooling by atomized pure water. In addition, increasing the nanofluid concentration has positive effect on the cooling efficiency and maximum generated power of PV module. Results show that by atomizing 0.8 (w/v) nanofluid, module average surface temperature decreased up to 57.25% and increase in maximum power reached to 51.1% than the layout with no cooling system.

AB A flash breakup model was developed in this study, based on bubble dynamics. The Rayleigh-Plesset equation was used to predict bubble growth inside of a droplet. A single bubble for each droplet was assumed. When the void fraction exceeds critical value, breakup was assumed. The velocity component normal to the direction in which the droplet moved was predicted by the sum of the velocities predicted by energy conservation, the pressure difference between the inside and outside of droplet, and the bubble growth rate. The thermodynamic mechanical breakup model was formed using the flash breakup and Kelvin-Helmholtz Rayleigh-Taylor breakup models. Using the developed breakup module, the decrease in spray tip penetration, spray plume expansion, and change in spray target were predicted for single-component fuels and compared with experimental results. A gasoline flash boiling spray was modeled using various fuel vapor pressure for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. From the comparison between the analyses with and without the flash breakup model, it was concluded that the flash breakup model should be used to predict deformations in spray structure for flash boiling sprays.

AB Humidification dehumidification (HDH) processes have been proved to be efficient for producing freshwater from seawater or brackish water. In this paper, an HDH desalination system, in which the seawater is appointed to recover the waste heat, is suggested. Based on the principles of mass and energy conservation, mathematical models for all the contained components as well as the entire desalination system, are built, and then the relevant thermo-economic analysis is also accomplished. The simulation results show that peak values of water production with m(w) = 99.05 kg h(-1) and gained-output-ratio (GOR) with GOR = 1.51 are obtained when the balance condition of the dehumidifier appears at the design conditions, while a bottom value of unit cost of water production (UCWP) is found as UCWP = 37.68$ kg(-1) hat the case of m(da) = 0.14 kg s(-1). Hence, the great advantages at the aspect of cost for unit water production compared to the solar drive type is validated. It is also found that reducing the seawater spraying temperature and elevating the humidification effectiveness are beneficial to raise the relevant thermodynamic and economic performance of the desalination system. With respect to the variation for dehumidification effectiveness, the peak value of GOR rises from GOR = 1.28 at epsilon(d) = 0.8 to GOR = 1.85 at epsilon(d) = 0.9, while a peak value of UCWP is obtained as UCWP = 50.12$ kg(-1) h due to the substantial increase of the heat transfer area for the dehumidifier.

AB The aim of this study is evaluating the performance of a combined cooling, heating, and power generation system (a trigeneration), composed of a concentrating photovoltaic-thermal unit, coupled with a water-ammonia absorption chiller. In the presented design, an ammonia-water absorption refrigeration cycle with 5 kW of cooling capacity is considered as a part of the trigeneration system. Also, a concentrating photovoltaic-thermal device, equipped with a linear Fresnel collector, is employed as the heat source. The performance of the system is modeled and simulated using TRNSYS. Furthermore, in case of replacing the concentrating collector by a conventional one, the performance of the cycle is investigated. It is revealed that, with the conventional collector type, the system could not provide enough thermal energy for the refrigeration cycle. The annual average of the electrical efficiency of the designed collector and trigeneration system are 12.8% and 58.01%, respectively. By investigating the produced energy from the presented unit, it is concluded that this system could be employed as the heating and cooling source of a typical residential building. However, the electrical energy demand of the building cannot be fully supplied with the presented design, and 6030 kWh of the electrical energy must be provided from the grid.

AB The energy and exergy streams of a trigeneration system (combined generation of heat, cooling and power) consisting of a biogas steam reformer, a water gas shift reactor, a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) and a Li-Br absorption chiller are investigated in this work. Combined liquid and internal air cooling are applied to recover the heat from HT-PEMFCs. The effects of the temperature, pressure, anode stoichiometric ratio and cathode stoichiometric ratio on the efficiency, power production, net power consumption and cell performance are analyzed. The highest exergy efficiencies for electricity generation and also for combined generation of heat, cooling and power are achieved at elevated cell temperature, atmospheric pressure and at the anode stoichiometric ratio of 1.35 and the cathode stoichiometric ratio of four. The lowest exergy efficiency of all units in the HT-PEMFC based trigeneration system is obtained for the afterburner.

AB This study was aimed at exergetically investigating and optimizing a continuous reactor applied to valorize glycerol into solketal as a biodiesel additive with subcritical acetone in the presence of Purolite PD206. The effects of reaction temperature (20-100 degrees C), acetone to glycerol molar ratio (15), feed flow rate (0.10.5 mL/min), pressure (1120 bar), and catalyst mass (0.52.5 g) were evaluated on the exergetic performance parameters of the reactor. In order to optimize the operating conditions of the reactor, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was coupled with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The ANFIS was applied to develop objective functions on the basis of the process parameters. The developed objective functions were then fed into the NSGA-II to find the optimum operating conditions of the process by simultaneously maximizing universal and functional exergetic efficiencies and minimizing normalized exergy destruction. Overall, the process parameters significantly affected the exergetic performance of the reactor. The ANFIS approach successfully modeled the objective functions with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. The optimal ketalization conditions of glycerol were: reaction temperature = 40.66 degrees C, acetone to glycerol molar ratio = 4.97, feed flow rate = 0.49 mL/min, pressure = 42.31?bar, and catalyst mass = 0.50 g. These conditions could be applied in pilot- or industrial-scale reactors for converting glycerol into value-added solketal in a resource-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly manner.

AB Calcium ferrites (CaFe2O4 and Ca2Fe2O5) are adopted as oxygen carriers for microalgae chemical looping gasification (CLG), and their reactivity is tested through TG-FTIR and fixed-bed reactor. Thermodynamics data show the ideal temperature for calcium ferrites, at which they can react with carbon but not with CO/H-2. TG-FTIR tests indicate that calcium ferrites have lower oxidizability than Fe2O3, according to the higher reduction temperature, lower CO2 production and higher CO production. The great selectivity of calcium ferrites is also verified by fixed-bed tests. With steam, the efficiency can be elevated from 82.95% (with Fe(2)O3) to 92.49% (with Ca2Fe2O5) at 850 degrees C. In one typical cycle, the synthetic calcium ferrites can be oxidized into the initial state after air oxidation, and Ca2Fe2O5 keeps a better surface structure than CaFe2O4. In summary, calcium ferrites have great selectivity for synthesis gas production, and are suitable for microalgae CLG, especially for Ca2Fe2O5.

AB The free-piston diesel engine linear generator (FPDLG), as a novel energy conversion device, is investigated by many researcher groups. The injection characteristics are important for the FPDLG operation performance. Therefore, the effects of fuel injection characteristics on the FPDLG are researched by CDF simulation and experimental results in this paper. According to the results, it is found that the trends of the compression ratio and the peak in-cylinder pressure vs the injection timing are the identical with convex function curves. And the IMEP of the FPDLG also show the same trend. Although the heat-release rises in the rapid combustion period, the IMEP vs the injection timing various law present convex function curve on account of reduced heat-release in the normal combustion period. Four injection rate-profiles, i.e. rectangle, wedge, trapezium and triangle are simulated and compared. It is observed that the combustion process with the trapezium rate-profile curve is smoother. The peak in-cylinder pressure and the thermal efficiency can be kept high value while the center of heat-release curve near the TDC. Therefore the trapezium rate-profile is suggested is appropriate and can keep high efficiency of the FPDLG in order to get high engine efficiency.

AB A concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) plant is a complex system that integrates different technologies as single or multi-junction photovoltaic cells and optical devices. The CPV system performance analysis should take into account the malfunctions that can occur during the working, especially when the system operates with high values of sunlight concentration. A critical analysis of the solar cells is necessary to define the CPV system potential. In this paper a specific configuration of a CPV system is considered, and the experimental analysis of a system with a degraded triple-junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cell is investigated. In particular, the triple-junction solar cell is stressed in an accelerated aging process of about 500 operating hours with a concentration of 310 suns without using a cooling system. After this process, for another 100 working hours the system has been monitored in order to compare, corresponding to different light concentration factors, the solar cell electric characteristics, the energy production and the power conversion efficiency in the pristine and degraded states. The results show the effect of the overheating of the triple-junction solar cell caused by the excessive increase of the light intensity. Under the same irradiance of 930 W/m(2) the short circuit current, open circuit voltage and fill factor values of the aged solar cell, compared to the pristine device, result to be strongly reduced, while the extracted value of the series resistance increases and the values of the shunt resistances decrease. The increased value of the diode ideality factor m after the thermal stress indicates a non-negligible contribution of non radiative recombination within the solar cell. Similar findings are deduced comparing the electroluminescence spectra of the pristine and degraded solar cell. The thermal stress induces a marked drop of electroluminescence signal intensity in the whole investigated wavelength range. It should be note that high electroluminescence efficiency is a good indicator in solar cells for high power conversion efficiencies. In particular, the power conversion efficiency is reduced by 50% referring to a CPV system with a degraded cell, while the electric output power is decreased by 30%. Hence, it is clear that the triple-junction cell inefficiencies, principally caused by a strong thermal stress, lead to a drastic drop of the CPV system performances. Finally, an active cooling system is absolutely necessary when high values of light concentration are reached.

AB Distributed generation and, in particular, cogeneration and trigeneration are generally considered viable solutions to reduce energy consumption and mitigate the environmental impact of developed economies. Nonetheless, such systems need to be carefully designed and managed to effectively meet all the economic and environmental expectations. The design of a distributed generation plant and the choice of its proper management policy are complex tasks that require effective support methodologies and tools.
   In this paper, we develop a methodology to determine the optimal control strategy for a trigeneration plant. The model enforces mass end energy balances and accounts for the nonlinear and the basic dynamic behavior of each energy converter, for the time varying energy prices and environmental conditions, for maintenance and cold start costs, and for the possibility to store energy. We built on a methodology previously developed and we dramatically broaden its field of application to complex smart grids with a very high temporal detail, by cutting down its computational costs. To this aim, we implement an heuristic procedure that reduces the computational complexity of the non linear optimization problem. The total cash flow, the primary energy consumption, the plant efficiency, and the CO2 emissions, besides the instantaneous set-point of the plant, are among the most relevant results of the model.
   The model is first validated through 11 test-cases specifically designed to stress the possible weaknesses of the heuristic procedure. The validation evidences that the proposed procedure does not introduce further approximations to the mathematical model. The global optimum is retrieved for all the considered cases. Afterwards, we apply the proposed methodology to a realistic energy management scenario: the assessment of a fuel cell based trigeneration plant for a civil building for a whole year. The discussion highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for different applications including the optimization of the control strategy for existing plants, the design of new distributed generation systems, the assessment of innovative energy conversion technologies, and the evaluation of national energy policies.

AB Glycerol can be considered a waste product when the cost of processing is higher than the processed glycerol value. In these situations, conversion of glycerol to an energy vector may be more beneficial. The aim of this work was to design and assess the feasibility of a process for low temperature steam reforming of glycerol (GLTSR). GLT-SR is a novel form of direct methanation that produces a CH4 rich, renewable fuel gas (Bio-SNG) that could substitute the current natural gas consumption associated with biodiesel production.
   In this work, thermodynamic modelling to determine the conditions that suited CH4 production and minimised carbon below 600 K as well as the impact of molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C) and pressure on the biomass to fuel efficiency of a GLT-SR plant were carried out using Aspen Plus (R) (V8.8) chemical processing software. Operating at 8 atm provided the benefits of high conversion to CH4 whilst minimising the outlet reformer temperature and achieving the required inlet temperature for catalyst operation.
   The Bio-SNG produced had an LHV of 16.7 MJ kg(-1) and had properties like landfill gas and biogas. An energy balance of the process determined that the electricity demand was negligible due to the low energy use of pumps and fans without the need for compressors. Operating at 8 atm, the production of Bio-SNG in the GLT-SR plant has the potential to offset 30% of the natural gas embodied energy requirement or 8.9% of the total embodied energy requirement for soybean biodiesel production from farm to use.

AB This paper presents a multi-criteria assessment (including thermodynamics, economics and environment) study on 5 kW PEMFC based residential combined cooling, heating and power system (CCHP). The system is mainly composed of a 5 kW PEMFC stack, a heat recovery system, a small absorption chiller and auxiliary component (including gas compressor and humidifier), which can provide electric power, space heating/cooling and hot water for apartment simultaneously. The thermodynamic model of the CCHP system is partially validated. The system performances, including energy and exergy efficiencies, annual cost and pollutant emission reduction, are evaluated in a parametric analysis method. Moreover, aiming at improving the evaluation indexes, the system is optimized using evolution algorithm, and three dimensional (3D) Pareto solutions and optimal operating parameter set are obtained. The results indicate that low operating temperature, high relative humidity and pressure of inlet gases are helpful for improving system exergy efficiency and GHG emission reduction. The optimized system exergy efficiency, annual cost and GHG emission reduction at Final Optimal Point (FOP) are 39.9%, 29337.3$ and 1.82 x 10(7) g, respectively. Comparing with un-optimized system, the system working at optimal parameters shows better performances in both exergy efficiency and GHG emission reduction besides a sacrifice in economic cost.

AB A magnesium anode seawater battery system was built for recovering NH4-N (ammonium) and P (phosphorus) from mariculture wastewater for the first time. The Mg2+ needed for struvite formation was provided by the anode corrosion. The performances of the system were investigated by the struvite crystallization and electricity generation at different conditions. The results show that the pH value of the wastewater was rapidly increased to pH 9 and stable at about pH 10 by the seawater battery without adjusting pH. The pH range was suitable for struvite crystallization. Satisfied P recovery was achieved and it was about 99% at different conditions. The struvite formation was increased with increasing the P:N molar ratio and 1:1 was found to be suitable for enhancing the struvite crystallization. The recovery ratios of the NH4-N and P were 37.37% and 98.99%, and the residual concentrations of them were 14.09 and 0.55 mg/L, respectively. The optimum pH value was pH 9 and the NH4-N recovery was 48.07% at this pH condition. Increasing temperature could shorten the time needed for recoveries in the range from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Expanding the magnesium anode area was benefit for the recovery. Increasing temperature or expanding the anode area could improve the electricity generation. The seawater battery could supply relatively stable electricity, and it was 20 mW during the process treating 0.9 L mariculture wastewater. Our results suggest that the seawater battery system is a possible approach for simultaneous NH4-N and P recovery and electricity production from wastewater.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been shown to be the least cost-intensive option for decarbonisation of the power, heat, and industrial sectors. Importantly, negative-emission technologies, including direct air capture (DAC), may still be required after near-complete decarbonisation of the stationary emission sources. This study evaluates the feasibility of a novel polygeneration process for combined heat and power using a solid-oxide fuel cell, and lime production for DAC (CHP-DAC) that could contribute towards decarbonisation of the power, heat, and industrial sectors. Evaluation of the thermodynamic performance indicated that such process can achieve the total efficiency and effective electric efficiency of 65%(LHV) and 60(LHV), respectively, while removing CO2 from the air at a rate of 88.6 gCO(2)/kW(ch)h. With the total expenditure spread over a number of revenue streams, the product prices required for the CHP-DAC process to break even were found to be competitive compared to figures for the existing standalone technologies, even if there was no revenue from CO2 capture from the air. Moreover, the considered process was shown to be economically feasible, even under uncertainty. Hence, it can be considered as the carbon neutral polygeneration process for sustainable and affordable production of heat, power, and lime that is negative-emission ready.

AB In the present study, a novel solid carbon catalyst derived from pyrolytic pomelo peel was prepared for biodiesel synthesis. The composition, structure and texture of prepared catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), N-2 adsorption/desorption and the Hammett indicator method. The characterization results indicated that the surface area and pore volume of the biochar were increased significantly by chemical activation treatment with KOH. The best-performing catalyst was that loaded with 25 wt.% K2CO3 on the prepared biochar and calcined at 600 degrees C, due to it resulting in the highest conversion of the oil to FAME at 65 degrees C, reaction time of 2.5 h, 8:1 methanol/oil molar ratio and a catalyst amount of 6 wt.%. This extraordinary activity was identified owing to the strongest basic sites. Besides, after reusing for 8 cycles, the catalyst could exhibit a rather high biodiesel yield (above 82%). The deactivation of catalyst was mainly owing to K+ ions leaching to the product. These results indicated that the pomelo peel biochar supported catalyst demonstrated promise for biodiesel synthesis.

LT-PEMFC and HT-PEMFC short stacks were designed and analyzed for 480 W net power output. Liquid cooling method was choosing for the cooling the PEMFC stacks due for efficient mu CHP applications. The experimental studies were carried out by using 13 cells HT-PEMFC and 6 cells LT-PEMFC short stacks and design parameters were determined. 1.2 kW PEMFCs with mu CHP systems with different working temperature were designed based on electrochemical data obtained from short stack testing. The proposed PEMFC systems can supply electric and hot water. The highest mu CHP system efficiency was calculated with a value of 92% for HT-PEMFC based system. The corresponding electrical and thermal efficiencies are 48% and 44%, respectively. In this study, two important parameters have been analyzing: efficiency and simple payback time. By using mu CHP application, both natural gas and H-2 based PEMFC systems SPT values are reduced.

AB The complexity of finding solutions to reach energy sustainability in the built environment poses a significant challenge. Therefore, there is interest in adequate management of the generation, conversion, storage, use and exchange of heat and electricity. The novelty of this study exists in presenting and comparing multiobjective optimizations for operational CO2 emissions and lifecycle costs (LCC) of heat and electricity prosumers in the Netherlands and Finland, with and without net-metering. The premise relies on using surplus electricity to drive heat pumps for heat export instead of exporting surplus electricity. In the Netherlands, the calculated cost optimal solutions consist of using surplus electricity to drive an air source heat pump and export heat, with CO2 emissions and Delta LCC of -41.1 kgCO(2)eq/(m(2) a) and (sic) -69.7/m(2) (22% lower), respectively. In Finland, the heat export strategy allows a Delta LCC of (sic)-24.5/m(2) (8% lower), with CO2 emissions reduced by -32.5 kgCO(2)eq/(m(2) a). Without net-metering, the ALCC of the energy system rises to E-4/m2 in the Netherlands; with net metering, the ALCC lowers to (sic)-65.6/m(2) in Finland. The results indicate the potential for significant economic and emission reductions in heat and electricity prosumers.

AB The anaerobic acidogenic fermentation of wheat straw was studied, after various chemical and microbial pre treatments, namely (a) chemical delignification, (b) hydrolytic pretreatment with T. viride of the chemically delignified straw to enhance the organic acid (OAs) yields in the subsequent acidogenic fermentations, and (c) microbial delignification by P. chlysosporitun to enhance the biodegradability of the cellulosic material and avoid the chemical pretreatment. The subsequent anaerobic acidogenesis experiments of the wheat straw samples were carried out using a UASB culture free and immobilised on gamma-alumina. Hydrolysis with T. viride was limited and slightly improved the result of the acidogenesis. On the other hand, delignification by P. chrysosporium produced satisfactory results, comparable to those of the chemical delignification process. The optimum substrate moisture content for the microbial delignification was 85%. In all cases the immobilised cells increased the OAs yields during the acidogenic fermentations by about 2-fold. Lactic, acetic and butyric acid were the prevailing OAs produced. The OAs could be then used as structural components of ester-based biofuels similar to biodiesel, an approach that has been recently proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for 2nd generation biofuels production.

AB In this paper, we propose a new sixth-order WENO scheme for solving one dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. The new WENO reconstruction has three properties: (1) it is central in smooth region for low dissipation, and is upwind near discontinuities for numerical stability; (2) it is a convex combination of four linear reconstructions, in which one linear reconstruction is sixth order, and the others are third order; (3) its linear weights can be any positive numbers with requirement that their sum equals one. Furthermore, we propose a simple smoothness indicator for the sixth-order linear reconstruction, this smooth indicator not only can distinguish the smooth region and discontinuities exactly, but also can reduce the computational cost, thus it is more efficient than the classical one.

AB In diffusion controlled reversible bimolecular reactions in three dimensions, a dissociation step is typically followed by multiple, rapid re-association steps slowing down the simulations of such systems. In order to improve the efficiency, we first derive an exact Green's function describing the rate at which an isolated pair of particles undergoing reversible bimolecular reactions and unimolecular decay separates beyond an arbitrarily chosen distance. Then the Green's function is used in an algorithm for particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations for prediction of the dynamics of biochemical networks. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are evaluated using a reversible reaction and a push-pull chemical network. The computational work is independent of the rates of the re-associations.

AB In this work, we extend, to two-phase flow, the single-phase Darcy flow model proposed in [26], [12] in which the (d - 1)-dimensional flow in the fractures is coupled with the d-dimensional flow in the matrix. Three types of so called hybrid-dimensional two-phase Darcy flow models are proposed. They all account for fractures acting either as drains or as barriers, since they allow pressure jumps at the matrix-fracture interfaces. The models also permit to treat gravity dominated flow as well as discontinuous capillary pressure at the material interfaces. The three models differ by their transmission conditions at matrix fracture interfaces: while the first model accounts for the nonlinear two-phase Darcy flux conservations, the second and third ones are based on the linear single phase Darcy flux conservations combined with different approximations of the mobilities. We adapt the Vertex Approximate Gradient (VAG) scheme to this problem, in order to account for anisotropy and heterogeneity aspects as well as for applicability on general meshes. Several test cases are presented to compare our hybrid-dimensional models to the generic equi-dimensional model, in which fractures have the same dimension as the matrix, leading to deep insight about the quality of the proposed reduced models.

AB While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about "big data", useful data is usually "small" and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schrodinger, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.

AB A geometric multigrid algorithm is introduced for solving nonsymmetric linear systems resulting from the discretization of the variable density Navier-Stokes equations on nonuniform structured rectilinear grids and high-Reynolds number flows. The restriction operation is defined such that the resulting system on the coarser grids is symmetric, thereby allowing for the use of efficient smoother algorithms. To achieve an optimal rate of convergence, the sequence of interpolation and restriction operations are determined through a dynamic procedure. A parallel partitioning strategy is introduced to minimize communication while maintaining the load balance between all processors. To test the proposed algorithm, we consider two cases: 1) homogeneous isotropic turbulence discretized on uniform grids and 2) turbulent duct flow discretized on stretched grids. Testing the algorithm on systems with up to a billion unknowns shows that the cost varies linearly with the number of unknowns. This O(N) behavior confirms the robustness of the proposed multigrid method regarding ill-conditioning of large systems characteristic of multiscale high-Reynolds number turbulent flows. The robustness of our method to density variations is established by considering cases where density varies sharply in space by a factor of up to 104, showing its applicability to two-phase flow problems. Strong and weak scalability studies are carried out, employing up to 30,000 processors, to examine the parallel performance of our implementation. Excellent scalability of our solver is shown for a granularity as low as 10(4) to 10(5) unknowns per processor. At its tested peak throughput, it solves approximately 4 billion unknowns per second employing over 16,000 processors with a parallel efficiency higher than 50%. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study presents a simple and robust numerical scheme to model two-phase flow in porous media where capillary forces dominate over viscous effects. The volume-of-fluid method is employed to capture the fluid-fluid interface whose dynamics is explicitly described based on a finite volume discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Interfacial forces are calculated directly on reconstructed interface elements such that the total curvature is preserved. The computed interfacial forces are explicitly added to the Navier-Stokes equations using a sharp formulation which effectively eliminates spurious currents. The stability and accuracy of the implemented scheme is validated on several two-and three-dimensional test cases, which indicate the capability of the method to model two-phase flow processes at the micro-scale. In particular we show how the co-current flow of two viscous fluids leads to greatly enhanced flow conductance for the wetting phase in corners of the pore space, compared to a case where the non-wetting phase is an inviscid gas.

AB The Bloch mode synthesis (BMS) model-reduction method adapts component mode synthesis techniques to unit-cell problems in order to obtain a reduced-order model that quickly produces band-structure frequencies for any wave vector, or vice versa. Fundamental to BMS is a partitioning of the real-space model into interior and boundary components, and subsequent reduction of the interior via truncated normal mode expansion. In this paper, two enhancements are presented for the BMS method that reduce both computation time and error in band-structure calculations. The first enhancement improves the accuracy of the interior reduction by approximating the participation of the residual modes rather than simply truncating them. The original formulation of BMS includes a modal reduction of the boundary that must be recomputed for every wave vector. This limits computational benefits and prevents the reduced-order model from being useful for the inverse band-structure problem (i.e., the k(omega) calculation). The second enhancement is a local boundary reduction that is independent of wave vector and thus does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new algorithm to model resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in Z-pinches has been developed. Two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry with azimuthal magnetic field B-theta is considered. Discretization is carried out using unstructured meshes made up of arbitrarily connected polygons. The algorithm is fully conservative for mass, momentum, and energy. Matter energy and magnetic energy are managed separately. The diffusion of magnetic field is solved using a derivative of the Symmetric-Semi-Implicit scheme, Livne et al. (1985) [23], where unconditional stability is obtained without needing to solve large sparse systems of equations. This MHD package has been integrated into the radiation-hydrodynamics code MULTI-2D, Ramis et al. (2009) [20], that includes hydrodynamics, laser energy deposition, heat conduction, and radiation transport. This setup allows to simulate Z-pinch configurations relevant for Inertial Confinement Fusion. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A high-order adaptive Cartesian cut-cell method, developed in the past by the authors [1] for simulation of compressible viscous flow over static embedded boundaries, is now extended for reacting flow simulations over moving interfaces. The main difficulty related to simulation of moving boundary problems using immersed boundary techniques is the loss of conservation of mass, momentum and energy during the transition of numerical grid cells from solid to fluid and vice versa. Gas phase reactions near solid boundaries can produce huge source terms to the governing equations, which if not properly treated for moving boundaries, can result in inaccuracies in numerical predictions. The small cell clustering algorithm proposed in our previous work is now extended to handle moving boundaries enforcing strict conservation. In addition, the cell clustering algorithm also preserves the smoothness of solution near moving surfaces. A second order Runge-Kutta scheme where the boundaries are allowed to change during the sub-time steps is employed. This scheme improves the time accuracy of the calculations when the body motion is driven by hydrodynamic forces. Simple one dimensional reacting and non-reacting studies of moving piston are first performed in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Results are then reported for flow past moving cylinders at subsonic and supersonic velocities in a viscous compressible flow and are compared with theoretical and previously available experimental data. The ability of the scheme to handle deforming boundaries and interaction of hydrodynamic forces with rigid body motion is demonstrated using different test cases. Finally, the method is applied to investigate the detonation initiation and stabilization mechanisms on a cylinder and a sphere, when they are launched into a detonable mixture. The effect of the filling pressure on the detonation stabilization mechanisms over a hyper-velocity sphere launched into a hydrogen-oxygen-argon mixture is studied and a qualitative comparison of the results with the experimental data are made. Results indicate that the current method is able to correctly reproduce the different regimes of combustion observed in the experiments. Through the various examples it is demonstrated that our method is robust and accurate for simulation of compressible viscous reacting flow problems with moving/deforming boundaries.

   potential enstrophy conservation
ID POTENTIAL-ENSTROPHY; EXTERIOR CALCULUS; EQUATIONS; ENERGY;

AB A mixed mimetic spectral element method is applied to solve the rotating shallow water equations. The mixed method uses the recently developed spectral element histopolation functions, which exactly satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus with respect to the standard Lagrange basis functions in one dimension. These are used to construct tensor product solution spaces which satisfy the generalized Stokes theorem, as well as the annihilation of the gradient operator by the curl and the curl by the divergence. This allows for the exact conservation of first order moments (mass, vorticity), as well as higher moments (energy, potential enstrophy), subject to the truncation error of the time stepping scheme. The continuity equation is solved in the strong form, such that mass conservation holds point wise, while the momentum equation is solved in the weak form such that vorticity is globally conserved. While mass, vorticity and energy conservation hold for any quadrature rule, potential enstrophy conservation is dependent on exact spatial integration. The method possesses a weak form statement of geostrophic balance due to the compatible nature of the solution spaces and arbitrarily high order spatial error convergence. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Gao etal. [11](2014) introduced a numerical scheme to approximate the Caputo fractional derivative with the convergence rate O(k(3-alpha)), 0 < alpha < 1 by directly approximating the integer-order derivative with some finite difference quotients in the definition of the Caputo fractional derivative, see also Lv and Xu [20](2016), where k is the time step size. Under the assumption that the solution of the time fractional partial differential equation is sufficiently smooth, Lv and Xu [20](2016) proved by using energy method that the corresponding numerical method for solving time fractional partial differential equation has the convergence rate O(k(3-alpha)), 0 < alpha < 1 uniformly with respect to the time variablet. However, in general the solution of the time fractional partial differential equation has low regularity and in this case the numerical method fails to have the convergence rate O(k(3-alpha)), 0 < alpha < 1 uniformly with respect to the time variablet. In this paper, we first obtain a similar approximation scheme to the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative with the convergence rate O(k(3-alpha)), 0 < alpha < 1 as in Gao etal. [11](2014) by approximating the Hadamard finite-part integral with the piecewise quadratic interpolation polynomials. Based on this scheme, we introduce a time discretization scheme to approximate the time fractional partial differential equation and show by using Laplace transform methods that the time discretization scheme has the convergence rate O(k(3-alpha)), 0 < alpha < 1 for any fixed t(n) > 0 for smooth and nonsmooth data in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. Numerical examples are given to show that the theoretical results are consistent with the numerical results. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A novel finite element method with multiple meshes is proposed, which is applied to solve the phase-field models for photonic band structures optimization. In our approach, fine meshes are used for the phase field evolution, which allows fine resolution for shape representations. The coarse meshes are adopted for the finite element analysis of the state equation. Such a multi-mesh approach could save a considerable amount of computational costs. Numerical convergence is illustrated through comparisons between our computational results and benchmarks. The efficiency and robustness of the multi-mesh approach are also shown.

AB This paper presents a data-driven computational model for simulating unsteady turbulent flows, where sparse measurement data is available. The model uses the retrospective cost adaptation (RCA) algorithm to automatically adjust the closure coefficients of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) k-omega turbulence equations to improve agreement between the simulated flow and the measurements. The RCA-RANS k-omega model is verified for steady flow using a pipe-flow test case and for unsteady flow using a surface-mounted-cube test case. Measurements used for adaptation of the verification cases are obtained from baseline simulations with known closure coefficients. These verification test cases demonstrate that the RCA-RANS k-omega model can successfully adapt the closure coefficients to improve agreement between the simulated flow field and a set of sparse flow-field measurements. Furthermore, the RCA-RANS k-omega model improves agreement between the simulated flow and the baseline flow at locations at which measurements do not exist. The RCA-RANS k-omega model is also validated with experimental data from 2 test cases: steady pipe flow, and unsteady flow past a square cylinder. In both test cases, the adaptation improves agreement with experimental data in comparison to the results from a non-adaptive RANS k-omega model that uses the standard values of the k-omega closure coefficients. For the steady pipe flow, adaptation is driven by mean stream-wise velocity measurements at 24 locations along the pipe radius. The RCA-RANS k-omega model reduces the average velocity error at these locations by over 35%. For the unsteady flow over a square cylinder, adaptation is driven by time-varying surface pressure measurements at 2 locations on the square cylinder. The RCA-RANS k-omega model reduces the average surface-pressure error at these locations by 88.8%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A glass forming matrix consisting of SiO2 - Li2O - CaO was doped with 10% and 15% molar of Fe2O3 and investigated for changes in structural and bulk physical properties of the host when doped with the iron oxide. The vitreous nature of the samples decreases with increase of Fe2O3 from 10 mol% to 15 mol% which is confirmed by the increase in intensity of Bragg's peaks of the XRD patterns and a decrease in the temperature difference between glass transition (T-g) and glass crystallisation (T-c) as found by DTA. Devitrification in this system was achieved by over-doping with Fe rather than heat treatment near Tg. FTIR analysis also reveals that the introduction of Fe ions into the glass matrix causes the anti-symmetric Si-O-Si to shift to lower frequencies on account of the presence of the Fe ions in their modifying structural locations. The optical band gap for all the samples falls in the insulator region. Magnetisation studies of the glass samples show them to be paramagnetic throughout the temperature range of 300 K to 5 K, whereas the glass ceramic sample shows room temperature ferrimagnetism with paramagnetic behaviour at low temperatures attributed to anti-ferromagnetic interactions. Moreover, samples containing iron show a decrease in band gap to almost half of that without iron ions (from 4.05 eV to 2.60 eV) with a further decrease in band gap with increase of iron content. Thus, in principle an increase in Fe content or relative ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as would result from oxygen deficiencies around these ions can be used to achieve desired magnetic and optical properties.

AB Heat treating fluorochlorozirconate (FCZ) glasses precipitates nanocrystals in the glass matrix, resulting in glass ceramics that have storage phosphor properties suitable for use as a medical imaging plate. As the temperature of heat treatment rises, the resulting FCZ glass ceramic becomes more turbid as the size of the orthorhombic phase BaCl2 nanocrystals grow. This cloudiness results in scattering of the stimulating laser light, negatively affecting spatial resolution in computed radiography applications. The effect of Fe3+ on the valence state of zirconium and overall glass quality was investigated. The addition of small amounts of FeCl3 (1-2% on a molecular weight basis) to a ZBLAN glass composition allows for the precipitation of orthorhombic phase BaCl2 crystals while maintaining transparency of the glass ceramic.

AB The present study aims to determine the influence of aluminum and calcium availability from two different aluminosilicate sources (COx argillite and sediment), thermally treated at 750 degrees C, on the formation, the structure and the working properties of the resulting alkali-activated materials. Despite their similar chemical composition, some differences in terms of aluminum coordination, amorphous phase and calcium availability were detected between the two studied aluminosilicate sources. Indeed, sediment sample exhibits higher reactive aluminum and lower reactive calcium compared to argillite sample. Moreover, FTIR spectroscopy has revealed that available calcium interacts with free silicon and aluminum and alkali cation in excess (sodium or potassium) leading to the formation of several networks (Si-O-Al and Si-O-Ca bonds). For both altuninosilicates, the calcium content (0.33 < Ca/Si < 0.36) seems to be not sufficient to produce C-S-H hydrated phases. It was also demonstrated that the low availability of aluminum in addition to the high availability of calcium favor the precipitation of secondary reaction products in the detriment of the geopolymer network. These products fill the voids inducing a decrease of the porosity and the pore size but also lead to higher heterogeneity that decreases the mechanical properties of the final material. However, the higher availability of aluminum and the lower availability of calcium in presence of high alkaline conditions favor the polycondensation reaction.

AB In this work, we investigated a new procedure for preparation of purified As Se glass. After drawing the fibers, an unclad fiber with minimum loss of 2.2 dB/m and a fiber coated with polyether sulfone with minimum loss of 4.2 dB/m were obtained. By pumping the unclad glass fiber in the normal dispersion region at 3 mu m, the broadest supercontinuum generation spectrum, covering 1.6 mu m to 11 mu m with a 40 dB spectral flatness, was recorded from a 15 cm long fiber. The results showed that broadband SC covering nearly almost all transmittance of the material can be achieved with a pump laser in the normal dispersion region.

AB Effects of different strain rates on the shear band and serrated flow in Ti30.81CU48.83Ni7.44Zr12.92 bulk metallic glass compressed at the room temperature were investigated. With increasing strain rates, the plastic strain, maximum compressive strength, and numbers and densities of shear bands increases, and the serrated flow in the second stage translates from similar uniformity to heterogeneity. No uniformity serrated flow in the second stage was found to be the combination of the no uniformity serrated flow in the first stage and the uniformity serrated flow in the second stage. The range of the stress drop in the second stage of the serrated flow coming from the discontinuous slip of the primary shear plane, is from 22 +/- 1 MPa to 35 +/- 1 MPa at different strain rates; the corresponding maximum value of stress drop is 35 +/- 1 MPa. The range and maximum value of stress drop is crucial to further understand the mechanism of plastic strain in the metallic glass field.

AB The glass forming ability, magnetism and magneto-caloric effect have been investigated in Er60Ni30Co10 melt-spun alloy by using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and magnetization measurements. The amorphousized Er60Ni30Co10 exhibits a relatively wide supercooled liquid region of 40 K and a second-order ferromagnetic transition around Curie temperature of 11.5 K. Under Delta H (magnetic field change) of 0-5 T, the values of -Delta S-M(max) (maximum magnetic entropy change) and RCP (relative cooling power) are 12.1 J/kg K and 342 J/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change for Er60Ni30Co10 obeys the phenomenological universal curve and corresponds to a field independent exponent of n = 0.58 +/- 0.03.

AB The short range order in Ge30Ga5Sb10Se55 and Ge21Ga5Sb10Se64 glasses was investigated by X-ray (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND) as well as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements at the Ge, Ga, Sb and Se K-edges. Large scale structural models were obtained by fitting simultaneously the experimental data sets by reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulation technique. It was found that Ge, Sb and Se atoms follow the Mott-rule and have 4, 3 and 2 nearest neighbors, respectively. The average coordination number of the Ga atoms was around 4. The structure of these glasses can be described by the chemically ordered network model: the Ge-Se, Ga-Se and Sb-Se bonds are the most prominent while Ge-Ge and Ge-Sb bonds are formed only in Se-poor compositions. Models generated by RMC contained some long distances (0.3-0.4 angstrom higher than the usual covalent bond lengths) between Ge-Se and/or Ge-Ge pairs. Dedicated simulation runs confirm the existence of these bonds.

AB Structural properties and ionic conductivity have been correlated in the XLi2O-(100 - X)B2O3 vitreous system over a wide range of composition (X = 0-50 mol%). The structural evolution of the vitreous network as a function of the lithium oxide content was established at ambient temperature by B-11 and Li-7 high resolution solid state NMR, while electrical conductivity has been measured by complex impedance spectroscopy from room temperature up to the glass transition temperature T-g. The B-11 NMR spectra indicate that starting from pure boron trioxide glass, the addition of alkali leads to a gradual transformation of BO3 units into BO4-. From X approximate to 30, the increase of Li+ content is also accompanied by the formation of Non-Bridging Oxygen (NBO). These specific structural changes have been used to interpret the conductive behavior of vitreous lithium borates. Indeed, measured on a wide range of composition, the direct conductivity (sigma(dc)) increases with the Li2O content and exhibits a clear regime change at X approximate to 32, which can be correlated to the interaction of cations with BO4- units and NBO.

AB Based on an effective atomic radius instead of a nominal atomic radius in the efficient atomic packing cluster method, the best glass forming composition in the new Al-Co-Sm ternary system was forecasted. Thermodynamic description of the Al-rich corner of Al-Co-Sm system was performed using the CALPHAD approach. Results show that the effective atomic radii of Sm and Al are approximately equal to the nominal radii, but the effective atomic radius of Co atom is obviously smaller than its nominal radius. From thermodynamic calculation, the composition dependencies of glass forming ability (GFA) in the Al-rich corner of the system were forecasted by finding the relatively low driving forces for crystalline phases, and the forecast of GFA agrees well with the experimental data.

AB Raman spectra at 298 K of the SiO4 symmetric stretch region (800-1200 cm(-1)) for low alkali (M) silicate glasses (5 and 10 mol% M2O, for M = Cs, K) yield intense well-resolved Q(3) peaks at similar to 1100 cm(-1) with mostly Lorentzian character, in contrast to previous Gaussian fits for silicate glasses. The spectra of 5 mol% Na and Li glasses show an additional Q(3) peak. It results from close approach of alkalis (M) to bridging oxygen (BO) which splits the Q3 band into two peaks. All linewidths (FWHM) of fitted Q(1), Q(2) and Q(3) species peaks are similar (similar to 35-55 cm(-1)) at 298 K for all the above glasses. The Q(3) species FWHM of 5 and 10 mol% Cs2O silicate glasses show a T dependence similar to those of crystal silicate spectra: both increase by 35-45 cm(-1) from 298 K to 1200 K. The T dependence of the FWHM of these Lorentzian dominated peaks are consistent with theory. The more complex spectra of the 30 mol% K2O and 50 mol% Na2O glass spectra are then readily fit with two or three Q(2) or Q(3) peaks, constraining the % Lorentzian character of all peaks from the fit to the resolved peak in those spectra. The 50 mol% Na2O spectrum shows that Q(3) > Q(1), indicating similar to 4.5 mol% free oxygen in the glass, a value in good agreement with previous Si-29 NMR and O is XPS results. Lorentzian/Gaussian lineshapes now need to be considered for many more silicate glass/melt Raman spectra.

AB Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has proven to be a highly versatile technique for understanding the glass transition, relaxation, and crystallization behavior of inorganic glasses. However, the approach is challenging when probing glass samples that exhibit overlapping transitions or low sensitivity. To overcome these problems, temperature-modulated DSC (TM-DSC) can be utilized, in which a sinusoidal heating rate is superimposed on the linear heating rate known from standard linear DSC. Until recently, it has only been possible to perform TM-DSC measurements on commercial instruments at temperatures below 973 K, which is insufficient for many oxide glasses of industrial interest, particularly silicate glasses. However, recent commercially available software now enables TM-DSC measurements to be performed at temperatures far exceeding 973 K. To investigate the suitability of using TM-DSC to study glass transition and relaxation behavior in high-temperature silicate systems, we have performed systematic TM-DSC measurements on three different oxide glass systems with varying glass transition temperature and liquid fragility. We find that relatively large underlying heating rates (2-5 K/min) and modulation amplitudes (4-5 K) are needed in order to obtain data with high signal-to-noise ratios. For these combinations of experimental parameters, we also observe a linear response as found using Lissajous curves. Overall, this study suggests that TM-DSC is a promising technique for investigating the dynamics of high-temperature oxide glass systems with a wide range of liquid fragilities.

AB Formation of metallic glass largely depends on the composition of the alloy system and inherent glass forming ability (GFA). Among all the relevant GFA criteria, GFA parameter, P-Hss, gives better quantitative description to explain higher GFA in multicomponent systems. Present work shows a set of glass forming alloys designed with the help of some GFA parameters including PHss using a raw blast furnace (BF) grade metal, popularly known as pig iron, in the range of 75-100 wt% of the total alloy weight and addition combination of alloying elements (B, P, Nb, Cr, Mo). Good glass forming ability of the blast furnace hot metal (direct from blast furnace containing impurities) as determined by thermodynamic calculation has been experimentally validated by making its glassy ribbons by melt spinning in air as well 1 mm diameter partially glassy rod as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies.

AB A nanoporous silica glass is used as host for Eu3+-ions by immersion in Eu(NO3)(3) solution. After sintering of the immersed glass, a very intense red emission is observed under UV excitation. The analysis of the luminescence shows that the native porous glass also presents an inherent luminescence in the blue range, originated from SiO2 centers and oxygen-deficiency-related defects. The microstructure and elemental distribution of the glass was investigated by (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), respectively. Eu3+ ions are localized in round particles of hundreds of nanometers within the silica matrix.

AB Tb3+/Eu3+ co-doped phosphate glasses were successfully synthesized by conventional melt-quenching method. The transmittance spectra and down-conversion optical properties were investigated by using UV-visible spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrometer. All the glass samples show light transmittance of about 90%, and the color of luminescence could be tuned by altering the concentrations of Eu3+ ions. The decrease of the Tb3+ emission decay time in presence of Eu3+ ascertained that Tb3+ -> Eu3+ non-radiative energy transfer happened. The research of energy transfer between Tb-3 + and Eu3+ based on the Inokuti-Hirayama model revealed that an electric dipole-dipole interaction might be the predominant mechanism. Under the excitation of 378 mn, the temperature dependent luminescence of Tb3+/Eu3+ co-doped glasses was carefully investigated in the temperature range of 303-753 K. Impressively, a high absolute sensitivity Sa of 1.0%K-1 and a high relative sensitivity S-r of 11.67 x 10-3K(-1) at 753 K could be obtained. It is expected that the investigated glasses might be a promising candidate for solid-state lighting and optical thermometry.

AB After the introduction of the TRIP (transformation-induced plasticity) effect in bulk metallic glass matrix composites (BMGMCs), the high tensile ductility and marked work-hardening capability could be achieved. A simple micromechanical multi-phase model is developed to address their monotonic mechanical behaviors. The constitutive behaviors of the BMG matrix and particle phases are described by the free volume model and Ludwik flow equation, respectively. Weng's mean field method is adopted to establish the relation between the constituents and resulting composites. A strain-based Weibull probability distribution function is assumed to describe the evolution of phase transformation. The present model is performed under the stain-controlled loading, and the predictions are in good agreement with the measured results, which confirms that the present model can successfully characterize the composite properties, such as yield strength, phase transformation and work-hardening elongation.

AB Glasses with nominal molar compositions xZnO-(67-x)SnO-33P(2)O(5) were prepared and their thermal and optical properties are reported. Density, glass transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, viscosity, and refractive index change systematically when ZnO replaces SnO. Raman and infrared spectroscopies provide information about the phosphate anions that constitute the glass network. The compositional trends in glass properties are explained considering the linkages between Sn-and Zn-polyhedra and these different phosphate anions. Property trends fall into three compositional ranges defined by low ZnO concentration (0 <= x <= 20, region I), intermediate ZnO concentration (20 < x <= 40, II), and large ZnO concentrations (40 < x <= 50, III).

AB Environmentally-friendly packaging based on whey protein offers the potential to replace petroleum-based oxygen barrier materials. Effective crosslinking of the whey protein is a prerequisite for this application. To quantify the effect of storage time on the post-crosslinking of whey protein isolate based films, swelling tests were conducted in order to determine the degree of swelling (DoS). In addition, the degree of crosslinking (DoC) and the crosslinking density (CLD) were calculated using existing models with new data from water vapour sorption isotherm measurements. The results showed that increasing storage time led to decreased swelling of whey protein isolate based films (p < .05) and increased DoC and CLD (p < .05). Comparison of the films on day 1 and day 21 showed that the crosslinking increased by a factor of 3 while the DoS reduced by almost half. The results of this study demonstrate that the storage time of whey protein isolated based films is a crucial factor for crosslinking. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of the nitrogen-argon gas mixtures on the superconductivity
   properties of reactively sputtered molybdenum nitride thin films
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Nitrides; Sputtering; Superconductivity
ID STATE; XPS
AB We report on the superconducting properties of nanocrystalline molybdenum nitride thin films grown by reactive DC sputtering at room temperature with a N-2:Ar mixture. Thin films grown using 5% N-2 concentration display T-c = 8 K, which is gradually reduced to 5.8 K for 30% N-2 concentration, producing changes in nitrogen stoichiometry of the samples from Mo2N to Mo2N1+x (0 <= x < 0.4). The T-c is abruptly reduced and disappears for N-2 concentration between 30% and 40%, which can be attributed to an increment in the disorder due to phase coexistence between cubic gamma-Mo2N and non-superconducting amorphous MoN (dominant for N-2 concentration >40%).

AB In this work, the eta-Fe2O3 nanospheres/diatomite composites (FNDCs) are prepared for the first time by a one-pot hydrothermal method, using the K2FeO4 as iron source. Indeed, the eta-Fe2O3 can uniformly decorate the inner and outer surface of diatomite to form 3D porous structure. Such unique 3D structure and their high specific area are favorable to provide sufficient active sites for effective electrochemical reaction and enhance capacitive performances. In principle, these findings demonstrate that the low-cost eta-Fe2O3 modified diatomite structures are promising for energy storage and conversion application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In present research, Fe-doped brushite bone cements were synthesized. The setting time, microstructure and antibacterial property of samples were investigated. The results showed that the setting time of cements was retarded to about 20 min and 123 min, respectively, as iron doping content increasing from 1 mol% to 5 mol% in beta-TCP powder. Moreover, Fe-doped cements had much bigger crystal particles and calcium iron phosphate was identified in them. Furthermore, Fe-doped cements performed well in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and larger inhibition halo was obtained with more iron content. Nevertheless, the Fe-loaded cements were not so sensitive to Escherichia coli as to the other two bacteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID JOINING TECHNIQUE; JOINTS
AB Friction Riveting is an alternative joining technology to the conventional mechanical fastening suitable for woven-reinforced polymer composites. In this paper, the feasibility of Direct-Friction Riveting is demonstrated for Ti6Al4V rivet and carbon-fiber reinforced polyether-ether-ketone laminate single lap joints. Due to high shear rates, elevated process temperatures (500-900 degrees C) and fast cooling rates (38 +/- 2 degrees C/s) experienced by the rivet tip, alpha'-martensitic structures were identified in the rivet anchoring zone along with fiber and polymer entrapment at the rivet-composite interface. An average ultimate lap shear force of 7.4 +/- 0.6 kN similar to conventional lock-bolted single lap joints was achieved. These results indicate that Direct-Friction Riveting is a competitive method with potential for improvement and further application in aircraft structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The temperature triggered loading and release of hydrophobic model drug (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methox yphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) (curcumin) from polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films was demonstrated. Thin films built from the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) were dipped in curcumin and studied as patches that could be used in temperature controlled drug delivery applications. Three different solvents (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol) were mixed with different fractions of water (from 60:40% to 95:5% aqueous: organic solvent) and fixed amount of curcumin (100 ppm). The loading of curcumin in the PEM increased when the polarity of the solvent mixture was increased or when the temperature was decreased. Interestingly, curcumin could spontaneously be released in warm water and as an example, curcumin was loaded PEM film at 5 degrees C and release at 37 degrees C thus demonstrating the body temperature triggered release of a hydrophobic model drug. Using this method a new type of transdermal patch for the release of hydrophobic drugs from PEM membrane would be possible. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Homogeneous porous carbons were obtained from phenolic resin/ethylene glycol resin mixtures based on polymerization-induced phase separation and template method. The effect of FeCl2 content (omega(Fe)) on the pore structure of the porous carbons was systematically investigated. The addition of iron favors the formation of porous pores with large pore size, fine carbon skeleton and uniformly distributed pore structure. With omega(Fe) increasing from 0% to 1%, the average pore size and apparent porosity of the porous carbons increase from 14 to 190 nm and from 25.6% to 63.3%, respectively. Iron ions can be used as a template and catalyst to change the pore structure of porous carbons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quaternary Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) is regarded like the one of the semiconductors promoting as an effective photovoltaic absorber because of their earth-abundant and non-toxic elements. The thin films were elaborated by spray pyrolysis method deposited onto glass substrates at 370 degrees C for one hour with post-sulfurization treatment at 450 degrees C for 30 min. XRD spectra analysis showed that the CFTS thin films have tetragonal structure with a main peak corresponding to the direction (1 1 2). The Raman spectrum confirmed these results with an appearance of two main peaks corresponding to the CFTS situated at the positions 289 cm(-1) and 318 cm(-1). The CFTS films exhibit a homogeneous, rough and dense topography with a thickness of about 0.8 mu m. The films of CFTS present a high absorption coefficient (>= 10(5) cm(-1)) and the direct band gap energy is found to be 1.55 eV, which confirms their use as an absorber for solar cells.

AB Here, we report a high performance biomass-derived cathode material. Compared to traditional carbon materials, biomass-derived carbon, prepared through the pyrolysis of yeast followed by activation with KOH, shows a great improvement in both catalytic activity and stability. A lithium-oxygen battery that uses the yeast-derived carbon as its cathode presents a discharge capacity of 22,100 mAh g(-1) at 570 mA g(-1), and sustains more than 500 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1360 mAh g(-1). Moreover, the rate capability reaches as high as 3390 mA g(-1), a value which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of conventional lithium-oxygen batteries. This work will provide a new direction for choosing cathode material for energy conversion and storage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work provides a novel and green approach to synthesize 3C-SiC nanowires (NWs) by carbothermic reduction of coked rice husk and silicon powders without catalyst or extra protective atmosphere. Results show that the as-synthesized 3C-SiC NWs are well-crystallized and grow along the [1 1 1] direction, the diameters of them are in the range of 50-120 nm, and their lengths are up to dozens of micrometers. They own a face-centered cubic structure and are wrapped by a thin amorphous SiO2 layer (similar to 6 nm). Meanwhile, a few stacking faults perpendicular to the growth direction exist in their crystals. These 3C-SiC NWs exhibit three ultraviolet light emission peaks at wavelengths of 435 nm, 467 nm and 572 nm, respectively, showing they possess a wide range of emission wavelengths. This study is of great significance which extends the research of 3C-SiC NWs and will bring great benefits to their practical applications in optoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The core-shell structure was clearly shown by the HRTEM observation; With increasing the anodization potential and time, the thickness of gamma-Fe2O3 shell increased, which was proved by the measurements of XRD and magnetization. Compared with the naked Fe nanoparticles, the anodized Fe@gamma-Fe2O3 core-shell nanoparticles show the better magnetization stability and can be more easily functionalized by TiO2.

AB The pH-responsiveness has been one of the focuses in the controlled drug release, in which coordination complexes are used to store and release drugs through the formation and cleavage of coordination bonds, respectively. In this work, polylysine-modified TiO2 nanotubes and alendronate drug, which contain amino groups, were used to coordinate Cu2+ ions and form "amino-metal-drug" coordination system. The system showed pH-responsive release of the drug. At a low pH or acidic condition, these coordination bonds were unstable and could be easily disrupted. However, increase of pH caused the bonds to become more strengthen so that the drug could not be released easily. We demonstrated that this coordination system not only increased drug loading, but also reduced drug release rate, which was found to reduce by 52 wt% in a buffer of pH = 7.4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Al fiber-reinforced cordierite was prepared by solid state reaction of clay, talc and alumina sintered at 1370 degrees C in carbon embedded condition. The microstructures were observed via scanning electron microscope (SEM), three-point flexural strength was examined on a universal testing machine. The SEM microphotograph shows a weak-bonded interfacial phase AlN, which was attributed to the reaction between Al and N-2 at high temperature in carbon protection condition, was formed between cordierite matrix and Al fiber. It facilitates fiber debonding and fiber pullout during fracture test. Three-point flexural test indicates both fracture displacement and flexural strength of Al-reinforced cordierite are bigger than that of the monolithic cordierite. With increasing Al-fiber addition, the higher strength and longer displacement were found. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flame retardancy of flame retardant viscose (FRV) fiber can be significantly further improved by simple blending with alginate (A) fiber, even though with the content of 10 wt%. Cone calorimeter results showed that longer time to ignition (TTI), lower peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) can be achieved in FRV after mixing with A. For example, the TTI of FRV can be raised from 10 s to 41 s after blended with only 10 wt% A. The mechanism of the effective suppression of flammability mentioned above was put forward by thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared analysis (TG-FTIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). It was found that the content of released CO2 for FRV/A was higher than that of pure FRV, and the content of the flammable gases for FRV/A, such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ethers and alcohols, was lower than that of FRV. In this way, the flame retardancy of FRV was effectively enhanced after blending with A. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A one-way water transport (also called OWT) cotton fabric is prepared by depositing a thin layer of hydrophobic polymer microspheres/nanospheres formed during one-step electrospray on one side of the hydrophilic cotton fabric. Rough surface resulted from the deposited microspheres/nanospheres mainly contributes to the hydrophobicity of electrosprayed layer and the layer thickness plays an important role in determining the water transport ability. OWT ability is observed in the cotton fabric with the electrosprayed layer thickness between 11 mu m and 26 mu m; when the layer is thinner than 11 mu m or over 26 mu m, the fabric shows a two-way or blocked water transport ability. This novel OWT fabric can be used in "smart" textiles for various applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, porous Mn2TiO4/TiO2 composites were successfully fabricated via a facile sol-gel approach. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrated that Mn2TiO4/TiO2 composites have pore structure, which not only improves the surface area of the sample but also provide more surface reaction sites. The electrochemical measurements show that such composites electrode possesses a specific capacitance of 98.2 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Moreover, the capacity retention of the fabricated material is 92.3% after 10,000 cycles in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) at room temperature.

AB This paper describes direct-coating of earth-abundant Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS) thin films on glass from molecular ink synthesized easily by dissolving metal salts and thiourea in methanol. Films were prepared by dip-coating and drop-casting of precursor films and subsequent annealing at 160 degrees C in air. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) of films confirmed cubic CNTS. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) revealed that dip-coated films are continuous whereas drop-casted ones are granular with voids between the grains. The band gap of CNTS is about 1.6 eV with electrical conductivity of 1.7 x 10(-3) S/cm and hole mobility of 2.3 x 10 (-3) cm(2)/Vs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New composite materials were prepared by impregnating CaCl2 into FAPO(4)-5 to enhance the water adsorption capacity of the FAPO(4)-5 and limit the deliquescence of CaCl2. The structure of the FAPO(4)-5 was not changed after impregnation, as confirmed by the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The composite materials exhibited enhanced water adsorption capacity (up to 08 g/g-sorbent at 50.0 wt% loading) within the working relative pressure range of water vapor of adsorption heat pump (AHP) systems (0.1-0.3 of water vapor relative pressure). The composite material with CaCl2 loading up to 15.9 wt % can also minimizes deliquescence of the salt which is not preferable in AHP applications. Despite partial pore filling of CaCl2 in the matrix, the adsorption capacities of the composites were comparable to the sum of the adsorption capacities of CaCl2 and FAPO(4)-5 without significantly affecting that of the pristine FAPO(4)-5.

A conductivity as high as 200 Sm-1 in the composite containing 6 vol % SWCNT has been explained with the low hopping parameter and high metallic conduction in three dimensions due to the presence of large quantity of metallic SWCNTs in the composite.

It is found that the LaGaO3-TiO2 system has an extremely wide glass-forming region of 0.625 <= x <= 0.740; in this region, transparent amorphous spheres of diameter approximately 2-4 mm can be obtained. The maximum difference between T-g and T-x (Delta T = T-x - T-g) exceeds 80 degrees C. The as-prepared amorphous materials exhibit a high refractive index of 2.49 for x = 0.740 and a transmittance exceeding 70% in the visible light range. The refractive index can be tuned by adjusting the amount of TiO2. These findings show great promise for the application of LaGaO3-TiO2 systems as high refractive index materials and open up avenues for the exploration of novel potential optical components.

AB For the interactions at the interfaces of cold sprayed particles/substrates, the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) of cold-sprayed Cu particles on a Sn substrate was investigated. Under room-temperature spray conditions, intermetallic layers (Cu6Sn5) were formed at the interfaces because of the high velocity collisions of the Cu particles. For the chemical interaction and activation phenomena, including intermixing at the interfaces, the bonding mechanism of the cold-sprayed coatings involved interlocking of the sprayed particles on the blasted substrates, as well as interactions between the particles and the substrate due to the high-velocity collisions (intermixing -> particles' interaction).

AB In this investigation, we have extracted biological hydroxyapatite (HA) containing magnesium, sodium, aluminium, zirconium and silicon ions from the chicken beaks. Raw chicken beaks were calcined at different temperatures after washing with boiled water and organic solvents. The calcined biological HA was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR), Field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The viability of Saos-2 cells treated with extracts of biological HA was higher than cells on tissue culture plates (TCPs) and synthetic HA, suggesting a good cytocompatibility of biological HA. Our research has successfully shown that the chicken beaks are a cheap source of biological HA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the formation of a MnS layer on the surface of ZnO films was investigated for improving the power conversion efficiency of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized quantum dot solar cells. The results showed that the MnS layer had a remarkable effect on the light-absorption characteristics and short-circuit current density of the solar cells by ensuring that a greater number of quantum dots were adsorbed and by reducing the charge-recombination rate. As a result, the CdS/CdSe/ZnS electrode based on the ZnO film modified with the MnS layer exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.45%, which was much higher than for the solar cells without a MnS layer (2.27%).

AB Solid-state nanopores are promising for applications in molecular biology and treatment of water pollution. Many techniques represented cannot fabricate nanopores array. In this work, we demonstrated a novel, cost-efficient and convenient technique to control the hole size of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). It was based on the insufficient step coverage of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Nanopores around 8 nm were obtained after depositing SiO2 for 150 s. The distributions of the hole sizes were fitted with Gaussian function and mean sizes were extracted. The relation between hole size and deposition time was fitted. Generally, the hole size decreased linearly with the increasing deposition time. ESI-CFD was used to simulate this deposition process. The simulation agreed well with the experimental results. The result shows that this technique is promising for getting a large uniform nanopore array under 10 nm. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A gradient-structured layer with initially nanoscale grain size increased gradually to original coarse microscale (similar to 50 mu m) was fabricated on the surface of austenitic (gamma) stainless steel SS304 via ultrasonic nanocrystallization surface modification (UNSM) peening. Modified cross-sectional and depth-specific plan-view (DSPV) sample preparation methods were explored with the analysis scales from macro to atom by synchrotron radiation XRD, EBSD, and TEM to determine the depth (strain) dependent deformation microstructures and grain refinement mechanism. The depth-dependent deformation microstructures were ascribed to strain-induced martensitic-transformed (SIMT) alpha'- and epsilon-martensite, deformation nanotwins (NT), and dislocation grids. The grain nanocrystallization mechanism was suggested as the formation of alpha' and epsilon grain boundaries that divided the original coarse grains (CG) to the nanoscale. The strains also appeared to play a key role in the crystallographic orientation relationship (OR) of the gamma/alpha': Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) and Pitsch in low strain region and Nishiyama-Wassermann (N-W) in the high strain region.

AB To the best of our knowledge, the solution-processed fabrication of perfectly (2 0 0)-oriented lead selenide (PbSe) films on various substrates, including glass, transparent conducting glass, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, has been achieved for the first time. Herein, the effects of orientation parameters, including the acetate anion effect, crystallization temperature, and chemical composition, on solution-processed PbSe thin films were examined. Particularly, the presence of acetate anions in the precursor solution strongly affected the degree of orientation. X-ray diffraction analysis was employed, and X-ray diffraction pole-figure polar distance was scanned by rotating the sample about the incident beam direction. The experimental results confirmed the formation of perfectly (2 0 0)-oriented PbSe films. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The cylindrical tubular parts of a high-strength magnesium alloy were processed by a novel severe plastic deformation method (rotary extrusion: RE) at the same strain rate and deformed temperature under various revolutions. The effects of this process on the grain refinement and microhardness of the Mg-12Gd4.5Y-2Zn-0.4Zr alloys were investigated. The results demonstrated that the tube microhardness decreased as the rotary revolutions increased, whereas the matrix and the second phases became significantly homogeneous. The dynamic recrystallization occurred in the RE process. When the temperature and the strain rate were constant, the grains increased in size as the revolutions increased, whereas the dynamic recrystallization refinement and the grain growth were in dynamic competitive relationships.

AB The effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles during polyol synthesis are described. The addition of PVP during synthesis changes the particle morphology from compact to porous with chains of small iron oxide nanocrystals at the surface of the particles due to the steric repulsion of PVP ligands. The addition of PVP also reduces average particle size from 857 nm to 225 nm by preventing agglomeration. In addition, the presence of PVP restricts crystal growth of iron oxide and limits oxidation. The high-surface areas achieved for the powders can be useful for catalytic applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new catalyst comprising Pd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a microporous covalent triazine-based polymer (Pd/MCTP-1) was synthesized and applied for H-2 production via formic acid decomposition under ambient conditions without additives. The catalytic activity of Pd/MCTP-1 was found to be superior to those of the recently reported highly active Pd/MOF catalysts, Pd/C, and Pd/SBA-15, which may be attributed to two factors: i) the formation of monodisperse and smaller Pd NPs on MCTP-1 and ii) the neutral pH of the reaction medium attained in the presence of Pd/MCTP-1. Pd/MCTP-1 is highly stable and its catalytic activity was maintained without losses for three recycle runs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, additive manufacturing of ceramics by stereolithography (SLA) is limited to single materials and by a poor thickness resolution that strongly depends on the ceramic particles-UV light interaction. Combining selective laser curing with inkjet printing represents a novel strategy to overcome these constrains. Nonetheless, this approach requires UV-curable inks that allow hardening of the printed material and sintering to high density. In this work, we report how to design an ink for inkjet printing of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which can be impressed by addition of UV-curable monomers. We especially show how the formulation of the inks and particularly the UV-monomer concentration impacts the printability and the UV-curing. This leads to prints that are resistant to solvent washing first and densify to 96% dense YSZ layers after sintering. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Acidic microenvironment caused by osteoclast was the main reason for bone mineral resorption. It was very meaningful for understanding the dissolving process of bone mineral in such acidic microenvironment. The dissolving mechanisms of nanosized hydroxyapatite (HA, the main component of bone mineral) were investigated in this study. The results showed that the specific surface area of HA increased whereas the crystallinity decreased with increasing the reaction time in all acidic solutions. In addition, HA exhibited different absorption behaviors in different acidic solutions. Citric acid mainly absorbed on the c-plane by forming numerous defects, whereas lactic acid mainly absorbed on the a-plane of HA. The mixed acidic solution could accelerate the HA absorption.

ID DOUBLE-BETA DECAY; SCINTILLATING BOLOMETER; SEARCH; ZNMOO4
AB Large-size Li2MoO4 (LMO) single crystal was grown by vertical Bridgman method. The transmittance spectra, scatterance spectra, and laser-stimulated luminescence spectra as well as luminescence decay time of LMO crystal were investigated systematically. The polished LMO sample has a rather high transmissivity (85%) and a rather low scatterance in 400-800 nm wavelength range. Deliquescence property of LMO has great effects on the transmission and scatterance properties of crystal. LMO crystal has a wide luminescence peak around 551 nm as a result of intrinsic luminescence emission of tetrahedral MoO42. Luminescence intensity under a 355 nm laser beam is very weak at 300 K. As ambient temperatures cool down, the luminescence intensity increases rapidly and reaches a maximum at 20 K, which is equal to approximately 20 times in contrast with the intensity at 300 K. The luminescence decay times decrease monotonically with the temperature increasing from 20 K to 200 K. The decay times at 20 K, 75 K, 150 K correspond to 11.5 mu s, 1.5 mu s and 0.25 mu s, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Living microbes can accumulate and exhibit distinct responses to different metal ions by strong coordination between bio-macromolecules and metal ions. Thus carefully selected bio-macromolecules could possibly serve as sensitive biologic probes to discriminate toxic metal ions. C-Phycocyanin (C-PC), a water-soluble phycobiliprotein widespread in algae, was selected as a unique biologic probe. Heavy-metal ions coordinated with C-PC, altered greatly secondary structures and fluorescence of C-PC, and also induced supramolecular fibrillation, in contrast to inert response of other metal ions.

AB Microalloying of an Al-15%Mg2Si alloy (wt%) with Ni and Cu produced an enhanced strengthening response, increasing hardness whilst also improving tensile strength due to the formation and evolution of intermetallic phases. With the increase of Cu/Ni ratios, intermetallic phases translate from Al3Ni or Al3CuNi to Al7Cu4Ni, and the total volume fraction of Al3CuNi and Al7Cu4Ni increases to 3.51% (1% Ni and 5% Cu, Cu/Ni ratio = 5). The thermally stable Al3CuNi and Al7Cu4Ni phases are connected to each other forming chains and tend to build up a network. As a result, the ultimate tensile strength (at 350 degrees C) of the alloy (Cu/Ni ratio = 5) reached up to 132 MPa, 131.6% higher than that of Al-15%Mg2Si alloy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A sonochemical method was used for simultaneous synthesis and loading of lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles into mesoporous SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous). In this study, the effect of different loading ratios (30, 45, 60, 75%) on morphology, crystalline structure and physicochemical characteristics of PbS-SBA-15_samples was investigated. TEM images showed that the PbS nanoparticles were highly dispersed inside the SBA-15 pores for all tested loadings, however especially 60 and 75%-PbS-SBA15_samples exhibited significant surface aggregation of PbS on SBA-15 surface. Also, PbS-SBA15_samples showed a strong UV light absorption at about 290-310 nm with increasing band gap energies, which is indicative of quantization effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Efficient continuous clean-up of large-scale oil spills is a global challenge. Herein, we present a simple method for fabrication of a gradient-wettability hydrophilic tilted mesh for fast spilled oil crossflow collection. After one-step femtosecond laser irradiation, the gradient-wettability mesh is tightly assembled and consists of four different pore size meshes, which possesses nanoripple structures. Meanwhile, the gradient-wettability mesh has a higher oil collection rate than single wettability meshes. This femtosecond-laser-induced gradient-wettability mesh design will have practical applications for efficient crossflow collection of large-area oil spills. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this study was to synthesis and evaluates the capability of modified polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber membrane for bilirubin separation from patients' blood. Cyclodextrin (CD) was grafted on the membrane surface via ester bond between hydroxyl groups in CD and sulfonate functional groups on the membrane surface. Surface modification not only improved the membrane hydrophilicity, but also inhibited bovine serum albumin (BSA) and platelets adhesion on the surface. Moreover, the modified membrane could adsorb bilirubin up to 51 mg/g membrane. In conclusion, the proposed system could be a promising candidate to be used instead of resins in hemoperfusion column.

AB A new fluorapatite-glass-ceramic was processed from sol-gel by controlling the heat treatment. The obtained results seemed to confirm the nucleation and growth of fluorapatite nano-phase in the glass. In addition, some mechanical properties of the new fluorapatite-glass-ceramic such as rupture strength and elastic modulus and shear modulus were measured and their obtained values were sigma(r) = 27 +/- 2 MPa, E = 20 +/- 0.3 GPa and G = 7.7 +/- 0.1 GPa, respectively. This glass-ceramic can have promising applications in dental prostheses because it would release fluoride ions, which can be an effective protector against dental caries.

AB The optimal gypsum-lime content of high water material was determined by the compressive strength and hydration heat test. The compressive strength test shows the optimal gypsum-lime content in B material of high water material varies from 80-20% to 85-15%. The analysis of the hydration process of high water material with different components indicates that the peak hydration exothermic rate can reach the maximum, at optimal gypsum-lime content. The hydration products of high water material with the optimal gypsum-lime content were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM analysis manifests that the main hydration products of high water material under optimal gypsum-lime content are needle-like and prismatic ettringite, amorphous C-A-S-H gel.

AB Hard ceramic and ductile metal materials combined in multilayered structures provide superior wear and oxidation resistance to the single layer, which has been applied extensively to components subjected to high-temperature oxidation and wear. In this paper, the oxidation and wear properties of Cr/CrC multilayer coating obtained on c-TiAl alloy by an emerging technology, that is double glow plasma surface alloying technology, were reported. Sliding wear and oxidation tests were performed on Cr/CrC multilayer as well as on chromising reference coating. The friction coefficients of Cr/CrC multilayer at room and high temperature were 0.2 and 0.175 respectively, about only 22.2% and 35% of the c-TiAl substrate. The Cr/CrC multilayer oxidized approximately parabolically, with lower oxidation rate than the chromising coating. The oxidation mechanism of the Cr/CrC multilayer was mainly dominated by carbide oxidation and dense Cr2O3 scale oxide development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Powder technology; Composite magnetic abrasives
AB This paper describes the production of Al2O3 magnetic abrasives via a double-stage atomization method. The matched pressures of atomization were simulated via Ansys-Fluent commercial software. The structure, phase composition and properties of the abrasives were examined. The analysis indicates that the magnetic abrasives have ideal spherical shape, and the Al2O3 hard particles are uniformly embedded into the surface of the iron matrix. The Al2O3 magnetic abrasives have good soft magnetic properties, with a saturation magnetization of 119 emu/g and a coercivity of 2.287 Oe. In addition, a series of plane magnetic abrasive finishing experiments were conducted using magnetic abrasives. The result of the Inconel718 plate shows that the developed abrasives have excellent processing performance, high grinding efficiency and long service life. Moreover, the atomization method described here could be promising for large-scale industrial preparation technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biocompatibility of magnesium alloy WE43 was investigated under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The biodegradation of WE43 samples in vitro was found to occur very rapidly. The evolution of a significant amount of hydrogen as a product of biodegradation prevented the attachment of cells to the sample surface and caused their likely damage. A tendency to the lysis of red blood cells and a drop in the index of survival of mesenchymal stromal cells were observed. By contrast, in vivo, after subcutaneous implantation to mice, the biodegradation rate of WE43 was significantly lower and no sizeable hydrogen generation occurred. An intimate contact between the sample surface and the surrounding tissue was formed without damage to the tissue, with the occurrence of neoangiogenesis in the contact area. Importantly, morphological studies showed that no major detrimental systemic effects were associated with the implantation of WE43 in mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocrystalline TiO2 particles were prepared to study the calcination temperature dependent phase transformation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed the strong Bragg peaks correspond to anatase (101) and rutile (110) phases with their crystallite size 12 and 49 nm for the samples T1 and T2 calcined at 450 and 700 degrees C respectively. Raman spectroscopy investigation showed the phase transformation with the dominating rutile peaks from the pure-anatase phase. By UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, the strong ultraviolet-light absorption below 400 nm was observed. Using Kubelka-Munk function, the estimated band gap values were found to be 3.38 and 3.03 eV. The transmission scanning microscopy (TEM) images exhibited the slightly agglomerated nanoparticles while the selected area diffraction (SAED) patterns endorsed the polycrystalline nature.

AB A theoretical study of the influence of proton radiation on the electrocaloric effect (ECE) in BaTiO3 thin film has been present in this work. The radiation induced oxygen vacancy density has been obtained using a computer program Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter, and a phenomenological model based on Landau phase transition theory has been established to study the ECE. It shows that the radiation induced oxygen vacancy density is linear with the proton fluence. The ECE of the BaTiO3 thin film is roughly unaffected by the irradiation up to the proton fluence of 5 x 10(16) cm(-2), and then decreases with increase of proton fluence and energy of the incident proton.

AB The growing medical and personal needs of human populations have escalated release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into our natural environment. This work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular PPCP, ibuprofen, in the presence of a major mineral component of soil (kaolinite clay), as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products. Results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation. In the absence of solar radiation, the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role. In contrast, under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles, ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions. The decay rates were at least 6-fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions. Toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms: Bacillus megaterium, Pseudoaltermonas atlantica; and algae from the Chlorella genus. The results from the biological assays show that primary PPCP is more toxic than the mixture of secondary products. Overall, however, biological assays carried out using only 4-acetylbenzoic acid, the most abundant secondary product, show a higher toxic effect on algae compared to its parent compound.

AB Direct potable reuse is becoming a feasible option to cope with water shortages. It requires more stringent water quality assurance than indirect potable reuse. Thus, the development of a high-rejection reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for the removal of one of the most challenging chemicals in potable reuse - N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) - ensures further system confidence in reclaimed water quality. This study aimed to achieve over 90% removal of NDMA by modifying three commercial and one prototype RO membrane using heat treatment. Application of heat treatment to a prototype membrane resulted in a record high removal of 92% (1.1-log) of NDMA. Heat treatment reduced conductivity rejection and permeability, while secondary amines, selected as N-nitrosamine precursors, were still well rejected (>98%) regardless of RO membrane type. This study also demonstrated the highly stable separation performance of the heat-treated prototype membrane under conditions of varying feed temperature and permeate flux. Fouling propensity of the prototype membrane was lower than a commercial RO membrane. This study identified a need to develop highly selective RO membranes with high permeability to ensure the feasibility of using these membranes at full scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of nitrogen (N) retention and loss from fertilized urban turfgrass is critical to develop practices that mitigate N transport and protect water quality in urban ecosystems. We investigated the fate of N in lysimeters sodded with St. Augustine turfgrass and amended with labeled N-15 from either ammonium sulfate or urea. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FTICR-MS) was employed to identify various biomolecular classes in the leached dissolved organic N (DON) from one lysimeter for each treatment and the control. Mean DON concentrations, over 92 days, were 88, 94, and 94% of total N in the leachate from the control, urea, and ammonium sulfate treatments, respectively. Isotopic analysis showed that <3% of N in the leachate originated from newly applied N fertilizer, suggesting that the remainder of the N in the leachate was derived from the lysimeter soil or sod biomass pools. The N-15 fertilizer recovery was greatest in soil (44-48%), followed by sod+thatch (18-33%), grass clippings (10-13%), and leachate (<3%). Despite isotopic evidence of little contribution of N from fertilizers in the leachate, a fraction of ammonium sulfate fertilizer was recovered as DON in the leachate, likely after uptake and conversion of inorganic fertilizer to organic plant exudates and/or microbial byproducts. FTICR-MS identified N-bearing organic molecular formulas in the leachate from urea and ammonium sulfate treatments, providing evidence of N leaching from newly established turfgrass of DON compounds in a range of biomolecular compositions such as lipid-, protein-, carbohydrate-, and lignin-like molecules.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high-influent-concentration suspended solids (SS) on the cultivation, structure and long-term stability of aerobic granular sludge (AGS). Cultivation and long-term stability of AGS were monitored in two pilot-scale sequencing batch reactors fed with raw (R1) and settled (R2) domestic wastewater, representing high and medium SS content, respectively. The real domestic wastewater had high chemical oxygen demand (COD) content (1100 +/- 270 mg COD L-1). Aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in 44 days (R1) and 25 days (R2) under the conditions of high settling velocity (18 m h(-1)) and high organic loading rate (OLR) (2.1-2.4 kg COD m(3) day). The AGS in both reactors had similar structural properties during long-term operation and remained structurally and functionally stable during the last five months of operation. Comparative evaluation of the results indicated that the high influent SS content of the real domestic wastewater had a positive influence on maintaining significantly lower SVI30 and relatively lower effluent SS concentration. Moreover, a higher influent SS content resulted in smaller mature granules during the stable period. Microbial community analyses helped to understand the aerobic granular sludge structure and showed that the sludge retention time and OLR affected the granular sludge population. The high influent SS increased biomass detachment from the granular sludge surface and caused wash-out of some bacteria colonizing the exterior of the granular sludge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Current sanitation systems are inherently limited in their ability to address the new challenges for (waste)water management that arise from the rising demand to restore resource cycles. These challenges include removal of micropollutants, water (re)use, and nutrient recovery. New opportunities to address these challenges arise from new sanitation, a system innovation that combines elements of source separation, local treatment and reuse, and less use of water. New sanitation is applied, but not yet widespread, in several residential areas in Europe. Implementation is hindered by the lack of insight into the general public's willingness to engage in new sanitation, and the resulting uncertainty about this among decision makers and other stakeholders in wastewater management. Using value-belief-norm theory as a conceptual lens, this paper addresses the individual motivations (pro-environmental personal norms) and personal drivers (benefits) and barriers (risks) for acceptance of new sanitation by the Dutch general public. The results of an online survey (N = 338) indicated that both pro-environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions predict consumers' willingness to accept new sanitation. More specifically, they showed that consumer acceptance is driven by perceived risks relating to the housing market and the need to change behavior, but also by environmental benefits. Overall, new sanitation was favorably evaluated by respondents: 64% indicated that they would likely use new sanitation if they were owner-occupiers. The results of this explorative study are discussed in light of the development of novel sanitation systems that are sensitive to perceptions of end-users and other key stakeholders.

AB Differential UV spectroscopy, defined as the difference in UV absorbance spectra before and after chlorination, has shown great potential to predict disinfection by-product (DBP) concentrations at laboratory scale. However, so far, no results have been reported on the full scale application of differential UV spectroscopy in drinking water treatment facilities. The objectives of this study are to determine if relationships can be developed between differential UV absorbance and DBP concentrations, for both regulated and unregulated DBPs, in a full-scale facility and to determine if these relationships vary throughout the year with variations in raw water quality and treatment conditions. The results show that linear and power relationships between differential UV absorbance and DBP concentrations can be developed (0.62 <= R-2 <= 0.99), although differences between relationships obtained in lab- and full-scale conditions need further investigation. Finally, the relationships obtained are different from one sampling campaign to another, which raises the question of whether it is possible to determine relationships that are stable enough to be used as adequate feedback on DBP concentrations.

AB Harmful algal blooms in source water are a worldwide issue for drinking water production and safety. UV/H2O2, a pre-oxidation process, was firstly applied to enhance Fe(II) coagulation for the removal of Microcystis aeruginosa [M. aeruginosa, 2.0 (+/- 0.5) x 10(6) cell/mL] in bench scale. It significantly improved both algae cells removal and algal organic matter (AOM) control, compared with UV irradiation alone (254 nm UVC, 5.4 mJ/cm(2)). About 94.7% of algae cells were removed after 5 min UV/H2O2 pre-treatment with H2O2 dose 375 mu mol/L, FeSO4 coagulation (dose 125 mu mol/L). It was also certified that low residue Fe level and AOM control was simultaneously achieved due to low dose of Fe(II) to settle down the cells as well as the AOM. The result of L-9(3)(4) orthogonal experiment demonstrated that H2O2 and FeSO4 dose was significantly influenced the algae removal. UV/H2O2 induced an increase of intracellular reactive oxidant species (ROS) and a decrease in zeta potential, which might contribute to the algae removal. The total microcystins (MCs) concentration was 1.5 mu g/L after UV/H2O2 pre-oxidation, however, it could be removed simultaneously with the algae cells and AOM. This study suggested a novel application of UV/H2O2-Fe(II) process to promote algae removal and simultaneously control AOM release in source waters, which is a green and promising technology without secondary pollution.

AB CrAssphage are recently-discovered DNA bacteriophages that are prevalent and abundant in human feces and sewage. We assessed the performance characteristics of a crAssphage quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for quantifying sewage impacts in stormwater and surface water in subtropical Tampa, Florida. The mean concentrations of crAssphage in untreated sewage ranged from 9.08 to 9.98 log(10) gene copies/L. Specificity was 0.927 against 83 non-human fecal reference samples and the sensitivity was 1.0. Cross reactivity was observed in DNA extracted from soiled poultry litter but the concentrations were substantially lower than untreated sewage. The presence of the crAssphage marker was monitored in water samples from storm drain outfalls during dry and wet weather conditions in Tampa, Florida. In dry weather conditions, 41.6% of storm drain outfalls samples were positive for the crAssphage marker and the concentrations ranged from 3.60 to 4.65 log(10) gene copies/L of water. After a significant rain event, 66.6% of stormwater outlet samples were positive for the crAssphage marker and the concentration ranged from 3.62 to 4.91 log(10) gene copies/L of water. The presence of the most commonly used Bacteroides HF183 marker in storm drain outfalls was also tested along with the crAssphage. Thirteen samples (55%) were either positive (i.e., both markers were present) or negative (i.e., both markers were absent) for both the markers. Due to the observed cross-reactivity of this marker with DNA extracted from poultry litter samples, it is recommended that this marker should be used in conjunction with additional markers such as HF183. Our data indicate that the crAssphage marker is highly sensitive to sewage, is adequately specific, and will be a valuable addition to the MST toolbox.

AB The potential for resource recovery from wastewater can be evaluated based on a detailed characterisation of wastewater. In this paper, results from fractionation and characterisation of two distinct wastewaters are reported. Using tangential flow filtration, the wastewater was fractionated into 10 size fractions ranging from 1 kDa to 1 mm, wherein the chemical composition and biodegradability were determined. Carbohydrates were dominant in particulate size fractions larger than 100 gm, indicating a potential of cellulose recovery from these fractions. While the particulate size fractions between 0.65 and 100 gm show a potential as a source for biofuel production due to an abundance of saturated C16 and C18 lipids. Both wastewaters were dominated by particulate (> 0.65 mu m), and oligo- and monomeric (< 1 kDa) COD. Polymeric (1-1000 kDa) and colloidal (1000 kDa-0.65 mu m) fractions had a low COD content, expected due to degradation in the sewer system upstream of the wastewater treatment plant. Biodegradation rates of particulate fractions increase with decreasing size. However, this was not seen in polymeric fractions where degradation rate was governed by chemical composition. Analytical validation of molecular weight and particle size distribution showed below filter cut-off retention of particles and polymers close to nominal cut-off, shifting the actual size distribution.

AB Rivers drive large amounts of terrestrial and riverine organic matter into oceans. These organic materials may alter the self-assembly of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) polymers into microgels and can even affect the behavior of existing natural microgels. We used Suwannee River humic acid, fulvic acid, and natural organic matter as a model of riverine organic matter (ROM) to investigate the impacts of ROM input on DOM polymer and microgel conversion. Our results indicated that the release of extra ROM, even at low concentrations (0.1-10 mg L-1), into the marine organic matter pool decreased the size of self-assembled DOM polymers (from 4-51 mu m to < 1 mu m) and dispersed the existing natural microgels into smaller particles (from 4-5 mu m to 2-3 mu m). The particle size of the microgel phase was also less sensitive than that of the DOM polymers to external changes (addition of ROM). This size reduction in DOM aggregation and existing microgels may be closely tied to the surface chemistry of the organic matter, such as negative surface charge stabilization and Ca2+ cross-linking bridges. These findings reveal that ROM inputs may therefore impede the self-assembly of DOM polymers into particulate organic matter and reduce the sedimentation flux of organic carbon and other elements from surface water to the deep ocean, thereby disturbing the biological pump, the downward transportation of nutrients, and the marine organic carbon cycle.

AB Human fecal contamination of water is a public health risk. However, inadequate testing solutions frustrate timely, actionable monitoring. Bacterial culture-based methods are simple but typically cannot distinguish fecal host source. PCR assays can identify host sources but require expertise and infrastructure. To bridge this gap we have developed a field-ready nucleic acid diagnostic platform and rapid sample preparation methods that enable on-site identification of human fecal contamination within 80 min of sampling. Our platform relies on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of human-associated Bacteroides HF183 genetic markers from crude samples. Oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes reduce false positives by sequence specifically transducing LAMP amplicons into visible fluorescence that can be photographed by unmodified smartphones. Our assay can detect as few as 17 copies/ml of human associated HF183 targets in sewage-contaminated water without cross-reaction with canine or feline feces. It performs robustly with a variety of environmental water sources and with raw sewage. We have also developed lyophilized assays and inexpensive 3D-printed devices to minimize cost and facilitate field application. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Realizing high-rate sulfur reduction under sulfate-rich conditions in a
   biological sulfide production system to treat metal-laden wastewater

AB Biological sulfur reduction can theoretically produce sufficient sulfide to effectively remove and recover heavy metals in the treatment of organics-deficient sulfate-rich metal-laden wastewater such as acid mine drainage and metallurgic wastewater, using 75% less organics than biological sulfate reduction. However, it is still unknown whether sulfur reduction can indeed compete with sulfate reduction, particularly under high-strength sulfate conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term feasibility of biological sulfur reduction under high sulfate conditions in a lab-scale sulfur reducing biological sulfide production (BSP) system with sublimed sulfur added. In the 169-day trial, an average sulfide production rate (SPR) as high as 47 +/- 9 mg S/L-h was achieved in the absence of sulfate, and the average SPR under sulfate-rich conditions was similar (53 +/- 10 mg S/L-h) when 1300 mg S/L sulfate were fed with the influent. Interestingly, sulfate was barely reduced even at such a high strength and contributed to only 1.5% of total sulfide production. Desulfomicrobium was identified as the pre-dominant sulfidogenic bacterium in the bioreactor. Batch tests further revealed that this sulfidogenic bacteria used elemental sulfur as the electron acceptor instead of the highly bioavailable sulfate, during which polysulfide acted as an intermediate, leading to an even higher bioavailability of sulfur than sulfate. The pathway of sulfur to sulfide conversion via polysulfide in the presence of both sulfur and sulfate was discussed. Collectively, when conditions favor polysulfide formation, sulfur reduction can be a promising and attractive technology to realize a high-rate and low-cost BSP process for treating sulfate rich metal-laden wastewater.

AB Shower hoses offer an excellent bacterial growth environment in close proximity to a critical end-user exposure route within building drinking water plumbing. However, the health risks associated with and processes underlying the development of biofilms in shower hoses are poorly studied. In a global survey, biofilms from 78 shower hoses from 11 countries were characterized in terms of cell concentration (4.1 x 10(4)-5.8 x 10(8) cells/cm(2)), metal accumulation (including iron, lead, and copper), and microbiome composition (including presence of potential opportunistic pathogens). In countries using disinfectant, biofilms had on average lower cell concentrations and diversity. Metal accumulation (up to 5 mu g-Fe/cm(2), 75 ng-Pb/cm(2), and 460 ng-Cu/cm(2)) seemed to be partially responsible for discoloration in biofilms, and likely originated from other pipes upstream in the building. While some genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens (Legionella, detected in 21/78 shower hoses) were positively correlated with biofilm cell concentration, others (Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas) had surprisingly non-existent or negative correlations with biofilm cell concentrations. In a controlled study, 15 identical shower hoses were installed for the same time period in the same country, and both stagnant and flowing water samples were collected. Ecological theory of dispersal and selection helped to explain microbiome composition and diversity of different sample types. Shower hose age was related to metal accumulation but not biofilm cell concentration, while frequency of use appeared to influence biofilm cell concentration. This study shows that shower hose biofilms are clearly a critical element of building drinking water plumbing, and a potential target for building drinking water plumbing monitoring.

AB The co-precipitation of arsenate (As(V)) with Fe(III)-precipitates is of great importance in water treatment and critically affects the fate of As in environmental systems. We studied the effects of dissolved phosphate (P; 0-1 mM), silicate (Si; 0 or 0.5 mM) and Ca (0, 0.5 and 4 mM) on the sequestration of 7 mu M As(V) by Fe(III)-precipitates formed by the oxidation of 0.5 mM Fe(II) in aerated bicarbonate-buffered solutions with an initial pH of 7.0 as well as the retention or release of As(V) after precipitate aging for 30 d at 40 degrees C. Dissolved As(V) concentrations in fresh precipitate suspensions greatly varied as a function of the initial dissolved P/Fe ratio ((P/Fe)(init)) and the concentrations of Ca and Si. Limited As(V) removal was observed at (P/Fe)(init) that exceeded the critical ratio (P/Fe)(crit) above which exclusively (Ca-) Fe(III)-phosphate forms. Effective As(V) removal was observed at (P/Fe)(init) < (P/Fe)(crit), where initial formation of (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate is followed by the formation of Si-ferrihydrite in Si-containing electrolytes and of poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite and hydrous ferric oxide in the Si-free electrolytes. The retention of As(V) and P by fresh Fe(III)-precipitates was most effective in systems containing both Ca and Si. In the Si- and Ca-free electrolytes at (P/Fe)(init) of similar to 0.2-0.6, the rapid onset of precipitate aging with conversion of Fe(III)-phosphate to ferrihydrite resulted in a substantial remobilization of As(V) (up to 55% of initially precipitated As(V)). Ca reduced As remobilization during aging by stabilizing Ca-Fe(III)phosphate and promoting Ca-phosphate formation, and Si by stabilizing Si-ferrihydrite against transformation. Consequently, also after aging, the lowest dissolved As(V) and P fractions were observed in precipitate suspensions containing both Ca and Si. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aeration is the largest energy consumer in most water and resource recovery facilities, which is why oxygen transfer optimization is fundamental to improve energy efficiency. Although oxygen transfer is strongly influenced by the bubble size distribution dynamics, most aeration efficiency models currently do not include this influence explicitly. In few cases, they assume a single average bubble size. The motivation of this work is to investigate this knowledge gap, i.e. a more accurate calculation of the impact of bubble size distribution dynamics on oxygen transfer. Experiments were performed to study bubble size distribution dynamics along the height of a bubble column at different air flow rates for both tap water and solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at different sludge concentrations. Results show that bubble size is highly dynamic in space and time since it is affected by hydrodrynamics and the viscosity of the liquid. Consequently, oxygen transfer also has a dynamic character. The concept of a constant overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, K(L)a, can thus be improved. A new modeling approach to determine the K(L)a locally based on bubble size distribution dynamics is introduced as an alternative. This way, the K(L)a for the entire column is calculated and compared to the one measured by a traditional method. Results are in good agreement for tap water. The modeled K(L)a based on the new approach slightly overestimates the experimental K(L)a for solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge. The difference appears to be lower when the air flow rate increases.

AB The huge volume of variability in real-world medical images such as on dimensionality, modality and shape, makes necessary efficient medical image retrieval systems for assisting physicians to perform more accurate diagnoses. However, the major limitation of these systems is the semantic gap, which is the difference between low-level features of images and their high-level semantics in a given situation. This paper deals with this problem and proposes a content-based image retrieval method based on med-level descriptors. These descriptors are automatically generated from low-level image features by exploiting the semantic concepts based on the clinician medical-knowledge. In fact, the proposed method is based on three main steps: (1) low-level feature extraction, (2) med-level model extraction and (3) online retrieval based on med-level feature vectors. The main contributions reside firstly in the integration of clinician medical-knowledge in terms of med-level features without needing radiologists interaction. Secondly, the determination of the query high-level features can be performed through the predicted query med-level descriptors, in addition to retrieve the most relevant images to the query one. Proposed method was validated in the context of mammogram retrieval, on the MIAS dataset, and the results prove its effectiveness and its superiority to the compared methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, two hybrid models are used for timing of the stock markets on the basis of the technical analysis of Japanese Candlestick by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Heuristic Algorithms of Imperialist Competition and Genetic. In the first model, SVM and Imperialist Competition Algorithm (ICA) are developed for stock market timing in which ICA is used to optimize the SVM parameters. In the second model, SVM is used with Genetic Algorithm (GA) where GA is used for feature selection in addition to SVM parameters optimization. Here the two approaches, Raw-based and Signal-based are devised on the basis of the literature to generate the input data of the model. For a comparison, the Hit Rate is considered as the percentage of correct predictions for periods of 1-6 day. The results show that SVM-ICA performance is better than SVM-GA and most importantly the feed-forward static neural network of the literature as the standard one. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A large number of geo-tagged photos become available online due to the advances in geo-tagging services and Web technologies. These geo-tagged photos are indicative of photo-takers' trails and movements, and have been used for mining people movements and trajectory patterns. These geo-tagged photos are inherently spatio-temporal, sequential and implicitly containing aspatial semantics. and recommender systems are collaborative filtering based. There have been some studies to build itinerary recommender systems from these geo-tagged photos, but they fail to consider these dimensions and share some common drawbacks, especially lacking aspatial semantics or temporal information. This paper proposes an itinerary recommender system with semantic trajectory pattern mining from geo-tagged photos by discovering sequential points-of-interest with temporal information from other users' visiting sequences and preferences. Our system considers spatio-temporal, sequential, and aspatial semantics dimensions, and also takes into account user-specified preferences and constraints to customise their requests. It generates a set of customised and targeted semantic-level itineraries meeting the user specified constraints. The proposed method generates these semantic itineraries from historic people's movements by mining frequent travel patterns from geo-tagged photos. Experimental results demonstrate the informativeness, efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method over traditional approaches. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Graph edit distance (GED) has emerged as a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. GED is an error tolerant graph matching problem which consists in minimizing the cost of the sequence that transforms a graph into another by means of edit operations. Edit operations are deletion, insertion and substitution of vertices and edges. Each vertex/edge operation has its associated cost defined in the vertex/edge cost function. Unfortunately, Unfortunately, the GED problem is NP-hard. The question of elaborating fast and precise algorithms is of first interest. In this paper, a parallel algorithm for exact GED computation is proposed. Our proposal is based on a branch-and-bound algorithm coupled with a load balancing strategy. Parallel threads run a branch-and-bound algorithm to explore the solution space and to discard misleading partial solutions. In the mean time, the load balancing scheme ensures that no thread remains idle. Experiments on 4 publicly available datasets empirically demonstrated that under time constraints our proposal can drastically improve a sequential approach and a naive parallel approach. Our proposal was compared to 6 other methods and provided more precise solutions while requiring a low memory usage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Revealing the densest communities of social networks efficiently through

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Densest subgraph; Graph; Space reduction; Sampling; Heuristics
AB The inherent structure and connectivity of a group are important features of social networks. Finding the densest subgraphs of a graph directly maps to revealing the densest communities of a social network. Various techniques, e.g., edge density, k-core, near-cliques and k-cliques, have been developed to characterize graphs and extract the densest subgraphs of the graphs. However, as extraction of subgraphs with constraints is NP-hard, these techniques face a major difficulty of processing big and/or streaming data sets from social networks. This demands new methods from the expert and intelligent systems perspective for computation of the densest subgraph problem (DSP) with big and/or streaming data. The most recent method for this purpose is the "Sampling" method. It samples the big data sets, thus reducing the data space and consequently speeding up the DSP computation. But the sampled data inevitably miss out many useful data items. A new approach is presented in this paper for accelerated DSP computation with big and/or steaming data through data space reduction without loss of useful information. It uses a sliding window of small graphs with a fixed number of edges. Then, it filters out the least connected edges for each small graph. While the small graphs are processed, subgraphs are incrementally put together to reveal the densest subgraphs. Finally, the data space previously filtered out is checked for recovery of globally important edges. The approach is incorporated with existing subgraph extraction techniques for scalable and efficient DSP computation with improved accuracy. It is demonstrated for four subgraph extraction techniques over four Twitter data sets, and is shown to outperform the "sampling" method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of the material from which an object is made is of significant value for effective robotic grasping and manipulation. Characteristics of the material can be retrieved using different sensory modalities: vision based, tactile based or sound based. Compressibility, surface texture and thermal properties can each be retrieved from physical contact with an object using tactile sensors. This paper presents a method for collecting data using a biomimetic fingertip in contact with various materials and then using these data to classify the materials both individually and into groups of their type. Following acquisition of data, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract features. These features are used to train seven different classifiers and hybrid structures of these classifiers for comparison. For all materials, the artificial systems were evaluated against each other, compared with human performance and were all found to outperform human participants' average performance. These results highlighted the sensitive nature of the BioTAC sensors and pave the way for research that requires a sensitive and accurate approach such as vital signs monitoring using robotic systems.

AB Diabetes, one of the most serious and fast growing chronic health conditions, often leads to other serious complications such as neurological, renal, ophthalmic, and heart diseases. Research has shown that more than 85% of diabetic patients develop at least one of these complications. Therefore, studying co morbidities among diabetic patients using association analysis is a worthy research endeavor. Association analysis is a well-known data mining method that aims to reveal the association/affinity patterns/rules among various items (objects or events) that occur together. One of the most critical problems in association analysis is the difficulty with the identification of rare items/patterns. In ordinary association analysis, specifying a large minimum-support leads to not discovering rare rules, while setting a small minimum-support leads to over-generating rules that may not be strong and beneficial. In this study, we propose a new assessment metric, called adjusted_support, to address this problem. Applying this new metric can retrieve rare patterns without over-generating association rules. To test the proposed metric, we extracted data from a large and feature-rich electronic medical records data warehouse and performed association analysis on the resultant data set that included 492,025 unique patients diagnosed with diabetes and related complications. By applying adjusted_support, we discovered interesting associations among diabetes complications such as neurological manifestations with diabetic arthropathy and gastroparesis; renal manifestations with retinopathy; gastroparesis with ketoacidosis and retinopathy; and skin complications with hyperglycemia, peripheral circulatory disorder, heart disease, and neurological manifestations. We also performed association analysis in various demographic groups at more granular levels. Besides association analysis, we also analyzed the comorbidity situation among different demographic groups of diabetics. Finally, we studied and compared the prevalence of diabetes complications in every demographic group of patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores advances in the data mining field to solve the fundamental Document Information Retrieval problem. In the proposed approach, useful knowledge is first discovered by using data mining techniques, then swarms use this knowledge to explore the whole space of documents intelligently. We have investigated two data mining techniques in the preprocessing step. The first one aims to split the collection of documents into similar clusters by using the k-means algorithm, while the second one extracts the most closed frequent terms on each cluster already created using the DCI_Closed algorithm. For the solving step, BSO (Bees Swarm Optimization) is used to explore the cluster of documents deeply. The proposed approach has been evaluated on well-known collections such as CACM (Collection of ACM), TREC (Text REtrieval Conference), Webdocs, and Wikilinks, and it has been compared to state-of-the-art data mining, bio-inspired and other documents information retrieval based approaches. The results show that the proposed approach improves the quality of returned documents considerably, with a competitive computational time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The prediction of online user behavior (next clicks, repeat visits, purchases, etc.) is a well-studied subject in research. Prediction models typically rely on clickstream data that is captured during the visit of a website and embodies user agent-, path-, time- and basket-related information. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative approach to extract auxiliary information from the website navigation graph of individual users and to test the predictive power of this information. Using two real-world large datasets of online retailers, we develop an approach to construct within-session graphs from clickstream data and demonstrate the relevance of corresponding graph metrics to predict purchases.

AB Process monitoring has been widely recognized as an important and critical tool in system monitoring for detection of abnormal behavior and quality improvement. In manufacturing processes or industrial systems, several sources of out-of-control variation, such as tool wear, gradual equipment deterioration, vibration, inconsistent material etc., often result in dynamic changes in the process parameter, or result in special residual signals of the systems. Detecting such weak or decaying signals is a challenging task. Although the window-limited generalized likelihood ratio (wl-GLR) scheme is widely used in changepoint detection and has some advantages, it may perform poorly when it is used to detect weak or decaying signals. This paper proposes a new change-detection scheme, the window-limited weighted likelihood ratio (wl-WLR) scheme, to improve the wl-GLR scheme. To do this, a new statistical distance measure called the GLR divergence is first defined and then its properties are analyzed. The wl-WLR scheme is designed to monitor the weighted average of the GLR divergences in a moving window, and the wl-GLR scheme can be viewed as a special case of the wl-WLR scheme. Two types of weight functionals are introduced and investigated for the wl-WLR scheme. Numerical algorithms to select the optimal weight parameters are provided based on a calibration sample. Extensive simulation study favors the proposed wl-WLR scheme for detecting weak or decaying signals, and its performance is robust even if the weight parameters are not accurately estimated.

AB Portfolio selection is a critical factor in investment. Having considered a number of risky assets, fund managers must choose the optimum portfolio. Stock values can be affected by different types of events such as governmental crises, economic turmoil and industrial improvements. Due to the vague nature of these events, it is difficult to estimate the future value of stocks. However, Markowitz's Modern portfolio theory, which is principally focused on portfolio risk, has introduced a novel model for stock diversification. According to this approach, an investor can decrease portfolio risk basically by holding mixtures of assets that are not highly positively correlated. Meanwhile, an efficient portfolio can only be obtained by focusing on return and risk simultaneously. When the normality assumption of return series of assets are not valid, higher moments can also be added to ensure the efficiency of the Markowitz model. In this study, a new approach for polynomial goal programming which is based on a mean-variance-skewness kurtosis-entropy model is proposed. Two real data sets were used in experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Based on a variety of portfolio optimization model, the out-of-sample performance of two entropy measures-Shannon entropy and Gini-Simpson entropy-were compared in the portfolio selection. The results indicate that the proposed approach is well-suited especially for portfolio models with higher moments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced pattern recognition algorithms have been historically designed in order to mitigate the problem of subjectivity that characterises technical analysis (also known as 'charting'). However, although such methods allow to approach technical analysis scientifically, they mainly focus on automating the identification of specific technical patterns. In this paper, we approach the assessment of charting from a more generic point of view, by proposing an algorithmic approach using mainly the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and two of its modifications; subsequence DTW and derivative DTW. Our method captures common characteristics of the entire family of technical patterns and is free of technical descriptions and/or guidelines for the identification of specific technical patterns. The algorithm assigns bullish and bearish classes to a set of query patterns by looking the price behaviour that follows the realisation of similar, in terms of price and volume, historical subsequences to these queries. A large number of stocks listed on NYSE from 2006 to 2015 is considered to statistically evaluate the ability of the algorithm to predict classes and resulting maximum potential profits within a test period that spans from 2010 to 2015. We find statistically significant bearish class predictions that generate on average significant maximum potential profits. However, bullish performance measures are not significant.

AB The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) figures among the state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) algorithms due to its robustness to support data shift, scale variations, and its capability of extracting relevant information from large-scale input data. However, setting appropriate parameters to define CNN architectures is still a challenging issue, mainly to tackle real-world problems. A typical approach consists in empirically assessing different CNN settings in order to select the most appropriate one. This procedure has clear limitations, including the choice of suitable predefined configurations as well as the high computational cost involved in evaluating each of them. This work presents a novel methodology to tackle the previously mentioned issues, providing mechanisms to estimate effective CNN configurations, including the size of convolutional masks (convolutional kernels) and the number of convolutional units (CNN neurons) per layer. Based on the False Nearest Neighbors (FNN), a well-known tool from the area of Dynamical Systems, the proposed method helps estimating CNN architectures that are less complex and produce good results. Our experiments confirm that architectures estimated through the proposed approach are as effective as the complex ones defined by empirical and computationally intensive strategies.

AB Testing is the most expensive and time consuming phase in the development of complex systems. Model based testing is an approach that can be used to automate the generation of high quality test suites, which is the most challenging part of testing. Formal models, such as finite state machines or automata, have been used as specifications from which the test suites can be automatically generated. The tests are applied after the system is synchronized to a particular state, which can be accomplished by using a synchronizing word. Computing a shortest synchronizing word is of interest for practical purposes, e.g. for a shorter testing time. However, computing a shortest synchronizing word is an NP hard problem. Therefore, heuristics are used to compute short synchronizing words. GREEDY and CYCLE are the fastest synchronizing heuristics currently known. In this paper, without sacrificing the quality of the synchronizing words, we improve the time performance of GREEDY and CYCLE, by restructuring the algorithms and applying some optimizations. Our experimental results show that depending on the automata size, CYCLE and GREEDY can be made 25 x and 95 x faster, respectively. The suggested improvements become more effective as the size of the automaton increases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GRAPH
AB Cluster analysis is often regarded as a pretreatment step in many data mining applications. It is an unsupervised learning method that tries to find some distributions and patterns in unlabeled data sets. Clustering algorithms have been studied for decades, but we think that none of them is all purpose. This paper presents three fast synchronization clustering algorithms based on spatial index structures, which are three improved versions of SynC algorithm in time complexity. In order to clearly describe these algorithms, it lists or introduces several concepts. After the theoretic analysis of the three FSynC algorithms, we find the time complexity can be decreased by using an R-tree index structure or by combining a multi-dimensional grid cell partitioning method with a Red-Black tree structure to construct the near neighbor point sets of all points. In the simulations, SynC algorithm is used as the comparative algorithm of three FSynC algorithms. From the simulated experiments of some artificial data sets, seven UCI data sets, and three picture data sets, we observe that the three FSynC algorithms need less time cost than SynC algorithm in many kinds of data sets. So we can say our three fast synchronization clustering algorithms can replace SynC algorithm with less time cost in many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives several solid and insightful future research suggestions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the adverse effect of food additives on humans, thorough research of their physiological effects at the molecular level is important. The interactions of cinnamaldehyde (CNMA), a food perfume, and its major metabolite cinnamic acid (CA) with human serum albumin (HSA) were examined by multiple-spectroscopies. NMR analysis revealed CNMA and CA both bound to HSA, and STD-NMR experiments established CNMA and CA primarily interacted with site I and site II of HSA, respectively. The ligands caused strong quenching of HSA fluorescence through a static quenching mechanism, with hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction between CNMA/CA and HSA, respectively. UV-vis absorption and CD results showed ligands induced secondary structure changes of HSA. Binding configurations were proved by docking method. Furthermore, binding constants of CNMA/CA-HSA systems were influenced by the addition of four other food additives. These studies have increased our knowledge regarding the safety and biological action of CNMA and CA.

AB The aim of the present study was to develop a real-time PCR assay for the identification and quantification of fallow deer (Dama dama) in food to detect food adulteration. Despite high sequence homology among different deer species, a fallow deer-specific primer/probe system targeting a fragment of the nuclear MC1-R gene was designed. This primer/probe system did not amplify DNA from 19 other animals and 50 edible plant species. Moderate cross-reactivity was observed for sika deer, red deer, roe deer, reindeer and wild boar. The LOD and LOQ of the real-time PCR assay were 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. To validate the assay, DNA mixtures, meat extract mixtures, meat mixtures and model game sausages were analyzed. Satisfactory quantitative results were obtained when the calibration mixture was similar to the analyzed sample in both the composition and concentration of the animal species of interest.

AB The production of furfuryl alcohol from green coffee during roasting and the effect of multiple parameters on its formation were studied employing HPLC-DAD. Results show that coffee produces furfuryl alcohol in larger quantities (418 mu g/g) compared to other beans or seeds (up to 132 mu g/g) roasted under the same conditions. The kinetics of furfuryl alcohol production resemble those of other process contaminants (e. g., HMF, acrylamide) produced in coffee roasting, with temperature and time of roasting playing significant roles in quantities formed. Different coffee species yielded different amounts of furfuryl alcohol. The data point out that the amounts of furfuryl alcohol found in roasted coffee do not reflect the total amounts produced during roasting because great amounts of furfuryl alcohol (up to 57%) are evaporating and released to the atmosphere during roasting. Finally the effect of the moisture content on furfuryl alcohol formation was found to be of little impact.

AB For the first time, the influence of different vine management was evaluated in relation to volatile profile and sensory perception through GC xGC/TOFMS, QDA, GC-FID, GC/MS, and GC-O. GC xGC/TOFMS analyses and QDA have shown that a larger spacing between vine rows (2 rather than 1 m), attachment of shoots upwards, and irrigation did not result in wine improvement. Conversely, wines elaborated with grapes from a vine with a lower bud load (20 per plant; sample M1) stood out among the other procedures, rendering the most promising wine aroma. GC xGC/TOFMS allowed identification of 220 compounds including 26 aroma active compounds also distinguished by GC-O. Among them, eight volatiles were important to differentiate M1 from other wines, and five out of those eight compounds could only be correctly identified and quantified after separation in second dimension. Higher levels of three volatiles may explain the relation of M1 wine with red and dry fruits.

AB The aim of this study has been to investigate if wine matrix composition might influence the interaction between odorants and oral mucosa in the oral cavity during a "wine intake-like" situation. Aroma released after exposing the oral cavity of three individuals to different wines (n = 12) previously spiked with six target aromas was followed by an -in vivo intra-oral SPME approach. Results showed a significant effect of wine matrix composition on the intra-oral aroma release of certain odorants. Among the wine matrix parameters, phenolic compounds showed the largest impact. This effect was dependent on their chemical structure. Some phenolic acids (e.g. hippuric, caffeic) were associated to an increase in the intra-oral release of certain odorants (e. g. linalool, beta-ionone), while flavonoids showed the opposite effect, decreasing the intra-oral release of aliphatic esters (ethyl hexanoate). This work shows for the first time, the impact of wine composition on oral-mucosa interactions under physiological conditions.

AB This research aims to clarify the interactions that occur in a food model system consisting of glucose, asparagine and chitosans. Low molecular weight chitosan exerted a potent inhibitory effect (46.8%) on acrylamide and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) (> 52.6%), respectively. Compared to a previous study conducted using the fructose system, the novel findings of this research demonstrate that the formation of acrylamide and Maillard reaction products was lower with glucose than with fructose when they were used as reducing sugars in food model systems.
