AB Antioxidant activity of anthocyanidins is greatly affected by the 3-hydroxyl group and/or a catecholic moiety. The two-hydrogen atom donation process is frequently used to explain the high antioxidant activity of polyphenolic compounds leading to the formation of stable diketones e. g. 1,2-quinones. Thermodynamic parameters, HOMO and spin density were computed to identify the favoured path, either through the 3-hydroxyl group or through the catecholic moiety in a series of catecholic and non-catecholic 3-oxy-(and deoxy)-anthocyanidins. DFT calculations showed that the donation process in non-catecholic anthocyanidins depended on the substituents on ring B. Anthocyanidins with 3', 5'-diOMe groups showed donation through 3,4'-OH or, otherwise, through 3,5-OH groups. Catecholic 3-oxyanthocyanidins, on the other hand, showed donation through the 3,4'OH path rather than the catecholic path (4', 3'-path). The 3,4'-path was favoured by the formation of planar 3-radicals in the first step and the stabilization of 4'-radicals in the second step by H-bonding with the 3'-OH group.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of addition of basil elicited with jasmonic acid (JA) on the biological properties, oxidative stability, and sensory quality of cakes. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion was used for determination of bioavailability. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic potential of fortified cakes were significantly higher than those of the control cakes. The antioxidant activity of the tested cakes was increased after addition of basil, proportionally to the amount of the additive. Additionally, in some cases, better results were obtained using JA-elicited basil instead of the control basil. Basil addition inhibited fat peroxidation in the cakes, measured as the malondialdehyde content. Cakes supplemented with the control and elicited basil were characterized by satisfactory consumer acceptability. Based on the data obtained in the present study, it can be concluded that JA-elicited basil (especially elicited with 100 mu M jasmonic acid) can be recommended for food technologists.

AB The present study aims to assess the effect of different nitrogen (N) rates on the chemical composition and antioxidant properties of stevia frozen fresh and dried leaves, and to define the best growing conditions to maximize the levels of bioactive compounds. In general, processing affects more significantly the tocopherol and sugar contents than N fertilization. The most abundant sugars were xylose, arabinose + fructose and sucrose, presenting dried samples with higher contents than frozen fresh ones, while the latter better retained tocopherols than dry samples. Regarding phenolic compounds, greater levels were found in dried samples and in those fertilized with 25 kg N ha(-1). Leaves from plants fertilized with 25 and 50 kg N ha(-1) also evidenced higher antioxidant activity, which seemed to be influenced by the phenolic composition. In general, N fertilization provides an improvement in the chemical composition and bioactive potential of stevia leaves.

AB Model wine solutions containing organic acids, individually or combined, and iron( III), were exposed to light from fluorescent lamps or stored in darkness for four hours. (-)-Epicatechin was then added, and the solutions incubated in darkness for 10 days. Browning was monitored by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry and UHPLC-DAD. The pre-irradiated solutions containing tartaric acid exhibited increased yellow/brown coloration compared to the dark controls mainly due to reaction of the tartaric acid photodegradation product glyoxylic acid with (-)-epicatechin to form xanthylium cation pigments. In these solutions, browning decreased as the concentrations of organic acids other than tartaric acid increased. Xanthylium cations were also detected in the pre-irradiated malic acid solution. However, in the malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and lactic acid solutions, any coloration was mainly due to the production of dehydrodiepicatechin A, which was largely independent of prior light exposure, but strongly affected by the organic acid present.

AB Decision makers responsible for quality management along the food chain need to reflect on their analytical tools that should ensure quality of food and especially superfood. The "4ables" in target analysis (stable, extractable, separable, detectable) focusing on marker compounds do not cover all relevant information about the sample. On the example of ginger, a streamlined quantitative bioprofiling was developed for effect-directed analysis of 17 commercially available ginger and ginger-containing products via high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-bioassay). The samples were investigated concerning their active profile as radical scavengers, antimicrobials, estrogen-like activators and acetylcholinesterase/tyrosinase inhibitors. The [ 6]gingerol and [6]-shogaol content of the different products ranged 0.2-7.4 mg/g and 0.2-3.0 mg/g, respectively. Further, multipotent compounds were discovered, characterized, and for example, assigned as [8]- and [10]gingerol via HPTLC-ESI-HRMS. The developed bioprofiling is a step forward to new analytical methods needed to inform on the true product quality influenced by cultivation, processing, and storage.

AB Oleocellosis is a serious physiological disorder in citrus fruit that mainly results in appearance and quality deterioration. It has been well established that the occurrence of oleocellosis is highly correlated with the release of peel oil from citrus fruit, while there is little information on the dynamic changes in the content of the volatile constituents and the expression of genes involved in terpenoid metabolism during oleocellosis development. In the present research, large changes in the volatile profiles and gene expression in terpenoid metabolism were observed in oleocellosis peels compared to healthy ones. Among volatiles, the decreased contents of alpha-pinene, D-limonene, beta-myrcene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-terpineol, nonanal, neryl acetate and (-)-carvone played a major role in these changes. For gene expressions in terpenoid metabolism, the up-regulated genes aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) (ALDH) and the down-regulated genes beta-caryophyllene synthase 1 (BCS1), alpha-terpineol synthase 2 (TES2) and myrcene synthase (MS) were the main differences in oleocellosis peels.

AB Multispectral imaging with object-wise multivariate image analysis was evaluated for its potential to grade whole white maize kernels. The types of defective materials regarded in grading legislation were divided into 13 classes, and were imaged with a multispectral imaging instrument spanning the UV, visible and NIR regions (19 wavelengths ranging from 375 to 970 nm). Object-wise partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were developed and validated with an independent data set. Results demonstrated good performance in distinguishing between sound maize and undesirable materials, with cross-validated coefficients of determination (Q(2)) and classification accuracies ranging from 0.35 to 0.99 and 83 to 100%, respectively. Wavelengths related to absorbance of green, yellow and orange colour indicated the presence of lycopene and anthocyanin (505, 525, 570 and 590 nm). NIR wavelengths 890, 940 nm (associated with fat) and 970 nm (associated with water) were generally identified as important features throughout the study.

The lipids contained high levels of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) (20.44-58.81% of total FAs) and PL (54.99-78.26% of total lipids). Among PL, phosphatidylcholine (41.39-51.86 mol%) was dominant. More than 230 GP species belonging to glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoserine, glycerophosphoinositol, lysoglycerophosphocholine, lysoglycerophosphoethanolamine and lysoglycerophosphoinositol were characterized. Individual GP molecular species in different body parts of scallops were also partially quantified. Most of the dominant GP species contained PUFA, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). Considering the high level of PUFA enriched GP, edible parts and by-products (gonads and mantles) of scallops Patinopecten yessoensis and Chlamys farreri provide great potential as health-promoting food for human consumption.

AB Direct steam injection (DSI) processing with pH adjustment was investigated to enhance the functionality of pearice protein isolate blends (PR). Protein slurries at concentration of 5% (w/w) of commercial pea and rice protein isolates in the ratio of 2:1 (w/w) across a range of steam temperatures (66-107 degrees C) and pH values (2-11) were studied. After DSI treatment, the PR were freeze-dried to obtain the final dry protein powder. Based on protein solubility profiles, the optimal DSI processing conditions were 107 degrees C and pH 11. Available lysine was not reduced (P > 0.05) in the blend. Solubility (from 3 to 41%, at pH 7), emulsifying activity index (from 5.9 to 52.5 m(2)/g), foam stability (from 68.2 to 82.8%), and oil holding capacity (from 1.8 to 4.9 g/g) values increased (P < 0.05) compared to the untreated PR. DSI can modify the functionality of PR without affecting the essential amino acid composition.

AB The importance of postprandial hyperglycemia in the treatment of diabetes has been recognized recently. Tea products, such as tea polyphenols (TP), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), matcha, and instant tea, were chosen as constituents of tea-flour food, aimed at regulating the release of glucose from starchy foods in the postprandial period. Six starches were chosen for internal composition analysis and hydrolysis studies in vitro. Corn starch, wheat starch, and lily root flour appeared to have higher resistant starch content, slower digestion profiles, and lower kinetic constants, implying sustained release of glucose in the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of tea products on starch digestion was determined in order to get a desired formulation of dietary product for patients with hyperglycemia. Compared with macha and instant tea, TP and EGCG exerted greater inhibition of amylase and amyloglucosidase, especially for corn starch with 0.5% TP or 0.5% EGCG.

AB Molecularly imprinted porous polymer microspheres selective to Alternaria mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), were synthesized and applied to the extraction of both mycotoxins in food samples. The polymer was prepared using 4-vinylpiridine (VIPY) and methacrylamide (MAM) as functional monomers, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as cross-linker and 3,8,9-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d] pyran-6- one (S2) as AOH surrogate template. A molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) method has been optimized for the selective isolation of the mycotoxins from aqueous samples coupled to HPLC with fluorescence (lambda(ex)= 258 nm;lambda(em) = 440 nm) or MS/MS analysis. The MISPE method was validated by UPLC-MS/MS for the determination of AOH and AME in tomato juice and sesame oil based on the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Method performance was satisfactory with recoveries from 92.5% to 106.2% and limits of quantification within the 1.1-2.8 mu g kg(-1) range in both samples.

AB This study evaluates the reliability of a handheld NIR device in distinguishing fillets and patties of Atlantic cod (n = 80) from those of haddock (n = 90), in comparison with a FT-NIR benchtop spectrometer. The authentication issue was faced by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), pre-treating spectral data with different algorithms, and validating models both internally and externally. The best LDA models gave 100% correct classification in prediction. Sensitivity > 65% and specificity > 74% in prediction were calculated for the best SIMCA models. No significant differences (P > .05) were found between the two instruments by McNemar test. Thus, the work demonstrated that a handheld NIR device can be a simple, cost-effective, and reliable alternative to benchtop spectrometers in fish fillet and patty authentication. These important findings can help in improving commercial fraud fight, extending the possibility to authenticate fish species also in processed products.

AB For the first time, the cis/trans isomer content of menaquinone-7 in food products has been identified and marked. A novel method of marking isomers of vitamin K2MK-7 in dietary supplements was developed and validated. Five different isomers of cis/trans vitamin K2MK-7 were identified. Identification of cis/trans isomers was performed by HRMS-QTOF, whereas their quantities were determined by using CAD and DAD detectors. In the majority of cases, the content of biologically active all trans vitamin K2MK-7 was below its declared content. The content of all trans K2MK-7 was in the range between 5.5 and 49 mu g in pills. In one of the studied supplements, this vitamin was not found, regardless of the claim on the product label. The content of cis/trans isomers in certain dietary supplements exceeded the content of all trans K2MK-7 by up to 3.7 times.

AB In protected vegetable fields, plant growth regulators are often used to improve cucumber fruit growth. However, the effects of plant growth regulators on the appearance and nutritional quality of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) remain largely unknown. In the present study, 100 mg/L N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU), naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or gibberellin A4+A7 (GA(4+7)) was applied to the female cucumber flowers 1 day before anthesis and at anthesis. The CPPU, NAA and GA(4+7) treatments resulted in parthenocarpic fruits with similar weights, sizes and shapes as the pollinated fruits. NAA treatment did not affect the appearance and nutritional characteristics of cucumber at harvest and after storage. CPPU treatment increased the flesh firmness at harvest but decreased phenolic acid and vitamin C contents after storage. GA(4+7) treatment decreased the flesh firmness but increased total flavonoids and protein content after storage.

AB This study aimed to develop an analytical method for the determination of tryptophan and its derivatives in kynurenine pathway using tandem mass spectrometry in various fermented food products (bread, beer, red wine, white cheese, yoghurt, kefir and cocoa powder). The method entails an aqueous extraction and reversed phase chromatographic separation using pentafluorophenyl (PFP) column. It allowed quantitation of low ppb levels of tryptophan and its derivatives in different fermented food matrices. It was found that beer samples were found to contain kynurenine within the range of 28.7 +/- 0.7 mu g/L and 86.3 +/- 0.5 mu g/L. Moreover, dairy products (yoghurt, white cheese and kefir) contained kynurenine ranging from 30.3 to 763.8 +/- g/kg d.w. Though bread samples analyzed did not contain kynurenic acid, beer and red wine samples as yeast-fermented foods were found to contain kynurenic acid. Among foods analyzed, cacao powder had the highest amounts of kynurenic acid (4486.2 +/- 165.6 mu g/kg d.w), which is a neuroprotective compound.

Experimental studies were carried out in aqueous ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical medium. Trolox and macromolecule-bound antioxidants were added to radical separately and together in different concentrations. Antioxidant capacities were determined using QUENCHER procedure. pH of radical media was altered for DF and protein-bound antioxidant studies to examine its effect. Chemometric tools were used for experimental design and multivariate data analysis. Results revealed antagonistic interactions for Trolox with all macromolecule-bound antioxidants. The reason behind this antagonism was investigated through oxidation reactions of Trolox via mass spectrometry analysis. Consequently, a proof was obtained for inhibitory effect of bound-antioxidants on auto-regeneration reactions of Trolox.

AB The present study aimed to optimize ozone (O-3) treatments, as gas and dissolved in water, to remove difenoconazole and linuron in carrots. We employed a central composite design to study three variables governing the efficacy of treatments: O-3 concentration, temperature and treatment time. The temperature did not influence the efficacy of treatments. The removal percentage of pesticides increases with increases in ozone concentration and the time of treatment. O-3 application promoted the removal of more than 80% of pesticides when the roots were exposed for approximately 120 min at 5 and 10 mg L-1, respectively, in treatments with O-3 as gas and dissolved in water. After storage, pesticide removal was higher than 98% for difenoconazole and 95% for linuron. The degradation products from the pesticides resulting from treatment were monitored, but none were found. This is the first report demonstrating the removal of difenoconazole and linuron from carrots by ozone.

AB Post-processing evolution of the functional properties of soybean protein concentrate (SPC) films, plasticized with varying levels of glycerol and processed by compression molding, was examined over a period of 90 days. Films stored in the glassy state (25 +/- 2 degrees C and 65 +/- 2% relative humidity) lost glycerol and water over time, as determined by gas chromatography and the decline in moisture content. SPC films plasticized with 40-50% glycerol showed a time-dependent increment of the elastic modulus and the tensile strength. In turn, the elongation, barrier properties, soluble mass and opacity of these films varied marginally with time. By contrast, films with 30% glycerol lost the most moisture and their elongation was reduced significantly, while water vapor permeability slightly increased with aging. The performance of aged films resulted from the balance between plasticizer and water loss, and the progressive replacement of unordered structures by intermolecular hydrogen bonded beta-sheets and aggregates.

AB Collagen is the most abundant protein family in mammals. Commercial edible gelatins are often produced from bovine and porcine skin and bone and consist mainly of partially hydrolyzed collagen type 1. The gelatin industry would benefit from a sensitive and reliable species detection method to unambiguously demonstrate species authenticity of their products. PCR and ELISA could in principle be used for this purpose. However, for gelatin, problems associated with false-positive and false-negative results, inconsistencies and low reactivity of commercially available kits have been observed with regard to ELISA and PCR methods. Therefore we developed a selective bottom-up LC-MS methodology for quantitative gelatin species determination with a lower limit of quantification of 0.05%. The present article describes the validation of this method, which was performed according to Good Laboratory Practice, and the theoretical justification for bovine and porcine target selection. The validated method can be used to determine the purity of gelatin batches with regard to bovine and porcine constituents.

AB Background: An adjuvanted herpes zoster (HZ) subunit vaccine, HZ/su, demonstrated high efficacy against HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults aged >= 50 and >= 70 years (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, respectively).
   Methods: Data from ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 trials were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of HZ/su against mortality, hospitalizations, and non-PHN complications of HZ including HZ-associated vasculitis, stroke, and disseminated, ophthalmic, neurologic, and visceral diseases.
   Results: In the pooled ZOE-50/ZOE-70 analysis, 1 of 32 HZ/su recipients (3.1%) and 16 of 477 placebo recipients (3.4%) with a confirmed HZ episode had complications other than PHN. Efficacy against HZ-related complications was 93.7% (95% confidence interval, 59.5-99.9%) in adults aged >= 50 years and 91.6% (43.3-99.8%) in adults >= 70 years. Five HZ-related hospitalizations, all in placebo recipients, and no HZ-related deaths were reported.
   Conclusions: HZ/su reduces the risk of HZ-associated complications in older adults (NCT01165177; NCT01165229). (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

ID SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY; IMMUNIZATION; REFUSAL; RISK; COMPLEMENTARY;
   MEDICINE
AB To address the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy and rejection, researchers increasingly recognise the need to engage with the social context of parents' decision-making. This study examines how vaccine rejecting parents socially construct the vaccinating mainstream in opposition to themselves. We analyse qualitative data from interviews with parents in Adelaide, South Australia. Applying insights from Social Identity Theory (SIT), we show how these parents bolster their own sense of identity and self-belief by employing a discourse that casts vaccinators as an Unhealthy Other. We demonstrate how the parents identify vaccination as a marker of parental conformity to the 'toxic practices of mass industrial society', linking it to other ways in which membership of the consumerist mainstream requires individuals to 'neglect their health.' This is explored through themes of appearance, diet, (over) consumption of pharmaceuticals, inadequate parenting values and wilful or misguided ignorance. This construction of the Unhealthy Other elevates the self-concept of vaccine hesitant and rejecting parents, who see themselves as part of an enlightened, but constantly besieged, group of healthy and virtuous parents. It is common for the vaccinating mainstream to present vaccine hesitant and rejecting parents as a group subject to epistemic closure, groupthink, confirmation bias and over-confidence in their own expertise. However, vaccine hesitant and rejecting parents also see mainstream society as a group-a much larger one-subject to the same problems. We suggest the need to mitigate the 'groupness' of vaccination and non vaccination by extending the practice of vaccination to recognisable practitioners of holistic health. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following smallpox vaccination in adults suggested a need to assess inflammatory cardiac disease risk among adults who receive live viral vaccinations. From 1996 through 2007, among 416,629 vaccinated adults in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, we identified one probable pericarditis case and no cases of myocarditis in the 42 days following a live viral vaccination. Our self-controlled risk interval analysis found that, based on one case identified during the risk interval and 10 cases during the control interval, there is no increased risk of myopericarditis in the 42 days following vaccination (IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.07, 4.51). Our study suggests that the occurrence of myopericarditis following live viral vaccination is rare with an estimated incidence of 0.24 per 100,000 vaccinated, which is not higher than the background rate and is much lower than the incidence rates reported following smallpox vaccination.

AB Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines have drastically reduced disease incidence worldwide. Protection against Hib infection has relied on the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of antibodies to the Hib capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate). However, licensure usually relies on measuring induction of antibodies to PRP as a surrogate for SBA. In a phase III clinical trial we compared a PRP-conjugate vaccine using the nontoxic diphtheria toxin mutant, CRM197, as carrier protein with the licensed tetanus toxoid conjugate when administered subcutaneously as a three dose primary series in Japanese infants. As an addition to the phase III study, we have now evaluated SBA and show PRP-CRM197 induces higher levels of SBA than PRP-T four weeks after the primary series, with a statistically significant correlation with anti-PRP titers. This data confirms the superior immunogenicity of PRP-CRM197 compared with PRP-T assessed as SBA following a three-dose primary series by subcutaneous administration. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended for all HIV-positive individuals but the standard schedule is not satisfactory. High or more doses have also been studied with variable results. We compared a vaccination schedule with a higher dose but fewer shots to the standard scheme (HBVaxPro 40 mu g versus Engerix 20 mu g at 0, 1, and 6 months). Of the 63 patients vaccinated with HBVaxPro 79%, 65% and 47% seroconverted at month 1, 12 and 24 after vaccination, respectively. A total of 137 patients received Engerix and showed lower response rates (68%, 53% and 38%, respectively). AntiHBs titers in the Engerix group were also lower with a statistically significant difference.
   In patients younger than 55 years HBVaxPro was 3 times more likely to provoke a response compared with Engerix (OR = 3, p = 0.006). In conclusion, HBVaxPro 40 g at 3 doses could be proposed as a more robust and acceptable alternative. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The human complement system is the most effective defense mechanism of the human innate immune system. One major negative regulator of the alternative pathway in human blood is complement factor H (FH). It binds to autologous cells and thus, prevents complement attack against body-cells or tissues. Various pathogens are known to escape complement recognition by recruiting FH to provide protection against the host's immune system. This immune evasion mechanism was recently qualitatively reported for asexual malaria blood stages. To indirectly evaluate the stage-specific potential of FH-receptor proteins as vaccine candidates, we quantified the FH molecules bound to the surface of different malaria blood stage parasites by Western blot and a commercially available FH-ELISA, which was originally designed to measure the FH concentration in human serum. Host-cell-free merozoites and intracellular mature schizont (here called segmenter) stages bind significantly more FH molecules than earlier parasite stages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The anti-hepatitis B immunization campaigns launched in the early 1990s were a major public health breakthrough and targeted various populations (at-risk adults, newborns, adolescents). However, debate is still active about a possible link between this vaccine and central demyelination. This study provides a pooled estimate of this risk based on a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of all available epidemiologic studies.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted in Medline, Embase, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from database inception to 10 May 2017. Grey literature was searched and snowballing was also undertaken. Only observational studies including a control group were retained. Primary outcome was multiple sclerosis diagnosed by recognized criteria. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers with disagreements solved through discussion. This meta-analysis based on crude, adjusted estimates, or risks limited to the 3 months following immunization was performed using a generic inverse variance random-effect model. Heterogeneity was investigated; sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed when necessary. This study followed the PRISMA statement and the MOOSE reporting guideline (Study protocol registered in PROSPERO: CRD42015020808).
   Findings: Of the 2804 references reviewed, 13 studies with a control group were analysed. None of the pooled risk estimates for either multiple sclerosis or central demyelination following HB immunization reached statistical significance. When considering adjusted risk ratios, the following non-significant figures were obtained: 1.19 (95%Cl: 0.93-1.52) and 1.25 (95%Cl: 0.97-1.62), for multiple sclerosis and central demyelination, respectively.
   Conclusions: No evidence of an association between hepatitis B vaccination and central demyelination was found. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: During 2013, isolation of a wild type 1 poliovirus from routine sewage sample in Israel, led to a national OPV campaign: During this period, there was a constant cover of the outbreak by the mass media. Aims: To investigate the association of media exposure and OPV and non-OPV vaccines uptake during the,2013 silent polio outbreak in Israel.
   Methods: We received data on daily immunization rates during the outbreak period from the Ministry of Health (MoH). We conducted a multivariable time trend analysis to assess the association between daily media exposure and vaccines uptake. Analysis was stratified by ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES).
   Results: During the MoH supplemental immunization activity, 138,799 OPV vaccines were given. There r was a significant association between media exposure and OPV uptake, most prominent in a lag of 3-5 days from the exposUre among Jews (R.R 1.79C.195% 1.32-2.41) and high SES subgroups (R.R 1.71C.I 95% 1.27:2.30). These subgroups also showed increased non-OPV uptake in a lag of 3-5 days from the media exposure, in all vaccines except for MMR. Lower SES and non-Jewish subgroups did not demonstrate the same association.
   Conclusion: Our findings expand the understanding of public behaviour during outbreaks. The public response shows high variability within specific subgroups. These findings highlight the importance of tailored communication strategies for each subgroup. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and the elderly. In spite of the great need for a vaccine against RSV, currently there is no licensed product on the market. A very early vaccine candidate developed in the 1960s based on formaldehyde inactivation (FI) turned out to instead enhance the disease. Our novel inactivation method applied low-energy electron irradiation (LEEI) to produce a killed RSV vaccine. LEEI yielded inactivated virus particles with a reproducible virus antigen conservation above 70%, while Fl resulted in highly variable antigen conservation. Immunization of mice with LEEI-RSV elicited a strong immune response, resulting in a drastic reduction in viral load upon challenge in two independent studies. These results have implications for the development of an RSV vaccine and should be validated in further preclinical and clinical studies. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 2010 serotype O foot-and-mouth disease virus of the Mya98 lineage/SEA topotype spread into most East Asian countries. During 2010-2011 it was responsible for major outbreaks in the Republic of Korea where a monovalent O/Manisa vaccine (belonging to the ME-SA topotype) was applied to help control the outbreaks. Subsequently, all susceptible animals were vaccinated every 6 months with a vaccine containing the O/Manisa antigen. Despite vaccination, the disease re-occurred in 2014 and afterwards almost annually. This study focuses on the in vivo efficacy in pigs of a high quality monovalent commercial O-1/Campos vaccine against heterologous challenge with a representative 2015 isolate from the Jincheon Province of the Republic of Korea. Initially, viral characterizations and r(1) determinations were performed on six viruses recovered in that region during 2014-2015, centering on their relationship with the well characterized and widely available O-1/Campos vaccine strain. Genetic and antigenic analysis indicated a close similarity among 2014-2015 Korean isolates and with the previous 2010 virus, with distinct differences with the O-1/Campos strain. Virus neutralisation tests using O-1/Campos cattle and pig post vaccination sera and recent Korean outbreak viruses predicted acceptable cross-protection after a single vaccination, as indicated by r(1) values, and in pigs, by expectancy of protection. In agreement with the in vitro estimates, in vivo challenge with a selected field isolate indicated that O-1/Campos primo vaccinated pigs were protected, resulting in a PD50 value of nearly 10. The results indicated that good quality oil vaccines containing the O-1/Campos strain can successfully be used against isolates belonging to the O Mya98/SEA topotype. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reporting of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) is a key component for functional vaccine safety monitoring system. The aim of our study is to document trends in the AEFI reporting ratio globally and across the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We describe the number of AEFI reports communicated each year through the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Reporting Form on Immunization from 2000 to 2015. The AEFI reporting ratios (annual AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants) were calculated to identify WHO countries (n = 191 in 2000 and n = 194 by 2015) that met a minimal reporting ratio of 10, a target set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan for vaccine safety monitoring as a proxy measure for a functional AEFI reporting system. The number of countries reporting any AEFI fluctuated over time but with progress from 32 (17%) in 2000 to 124 (64%) in 2015. In 2015, the global average AEFI reporting ratio was 549 AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants. The number of countries with AEFI reporting ratios greater than 10 increased from 8 (4%) in 2000 to 81 (42%) in 2015. In 2015, 60% of countries in the WHO Region of the Americas reported at least 10 AEFI per 100,000 surviving infants, followed by 55% in European Region, 43% in Eastern Mediterranean Region, 33% in Western Pacific Region, 27% in South-East Asia Region and 21% in African Region. Overall, AEFI reporting has increased over the past sixteen years worldwide, but requires strengthening in a majority of low- and middle-income countries. The AEFI reporting ratio is useful for benchmarking and following trends over time; but does not provide information on the quality of the reporting system and does not guarantee capacity to detect and manage a vaccine safety problem at a national level. Additional efforts are required to ensure and improve data quality, AEFI reporting and surveillance of immunization safety in every country. (C) 2018 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier Ltd.

TI High resolution age-structured mapping of childhood vaccination coverage
   in low and middle income countries
SO VACCINE

   Coverage heterogeneities
ID MEASLES; AFRICA; RISK
AB Background :The expansion of childhood vaccination programs in low and middle income countries has been a substantial public health success story. Indicators of the performance of intervention programmes such as coverage levels and numbers covered are typically measured through national statistics or at the scale of large regions due to survey design, administrative convenience or operational limitations. These mask heterogeneities and 'coldspots' of low coverage that may allow diseases to persist, even if overall coverage is high. Hence, to decrease inequities and accelerate progress towards disease elimination goals, fine-scale variation in coverage should be better characterized.
   Methods: Using measles as an example, cluster-level Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data were used to map vaccination coverage at 1 km spatial resolution in Cambodia, Mozambique and Nigeria for varying age-group categories of children under five years, using Bayesian geostatistical techniques built on a suite of publicly available geospatial covariates and implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
   Results: Measles vaccination coverage was found to be strongly predicted by just 4-5 covariates in geostatistical models, with remoteness consistently selected as a key variable. The output 1 x 1 km maps revealed significant heterogeneities within the three countries that were not captured using province-level summaries. Integration with population data showed that at the time of the surveys, few districts attained the 80% coverage, that is one component of the WHO Global Vaccine Action Plan 2020 targets.
   Conclusion: The elimination of vaccine-preventable diseases requires a strong evidence base to guide strategies and inform efficient use of limited resources. The approaches outlined here provide a route to moving beyond large area summaries of vaccination coverage that mask epidemiologically-important heterogeneities to detailed maps that capture subnational vulnerabilities. The output datasets are built on open data and methods, and in flexible format that can be aggregated to more operationally-relevant administrative unit levels. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB H3N8 influenza virus strains have been associated with infectious disease in equine populations throughout the world. Although current vaccines for equine influenza stimulate a protective humoral immune response against the surface glycoproteins, disease in vaccinated horses has been frequently reported, probably due to poor induction of cross-reactive antibodies against non-matching strains. This work describes the performance of a recombinant protein vaccine expressed in prokaryotic cells (Delta HAp) and of a genetic vaccine (Delta HAe), both based on the conserved stem region of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) derived from A/equine/Argentina/1/93 (H3N8) virus.
   Sera from mice inoculated with these immunogens in different combinations and regimes presented reactivity in vitro against highly divergent influenza virus strains belonging to phylogenetic groups 1 and 2 (H1 and H3 subtypes, respectively), and conferred robust protection against a lethal challenge with both the homologous equine strain (100%) and the homosubtypic human strain A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) (70-100%). Animals vaccinated with the same antigens but challenged with the human strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), belonging to the phylogenetic group 1, were not protected (0-33%). Combination of protein and DNA immunogens showed higher reactivity to non-homologous strains than protein alone, although all vaccines were permissive for lung infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination against influenza is widely used to protect against seasonal flu epidemic although its effectiveness is debated. Here we performed deep quantitative T cell receptor repertoire profiling in peripheral blood of a healthy volunteer in response to trivalent subunit influenza vaccine. We did not observe significant rebuilding of peripheral blood T cell receptors composition in response to vaccination. However, we found several clonotypes in memory T cell fraction that were undetectable before the vaccination and had a maximum concentration at day 45 after vaccine administration. These cells were found in lower concentration in the course of repertoire monitoring for two years period. Our observation suggests a potential for recruitment of only a limited number of new T cells after each seasonal influenza vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Swine influenza virus is endemic worldwide and it is responsible for significant economic losses to the swine industry. A vaccine that stimulates a rapid and long-lasting protective immune response to prevent this infection is highly sought. Poly[di(sodium carboxylatoethylphenoxy)-phosphazene (PCEP) has demonstrated adjuvant activity when formulated as part of multiple vaccines in mice and pigs. In this study we examined the magnitude and type of immune response induced in pigs vaccinated via the intramuscular or intradermal routes with inactivated swine influenza virus (SIV) H1N1 vaccine formulated with PCEP. Intradermal administration of PCEP-adjuvanted inactivated Sly vaccine stimulated significant anti-SIV antibody titres, increased neutralizing antibodies, and significantly reduced lung virus load with limited reduction of gross lung lesions after challenge with virulent H1N1 relative to control animals. These results indicate that PCEP may be effective as a vaccine adjuvant against swine influenza viruses in pigs and should be considered a potential candidate adjuvant for future swine intradermal influenza vaccines.

AB There is debate regarding the value of vaccinating adults with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13). This analysis was conducted to investigate the risk of PCV-13 serotype community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised adults with co-morbid disease and risk factors for pneumocciccal disease in the UK.
   Consecutive adults hospitalised (2008-2013) with a primary diagnosis of CAP, were recruited. Pneumococcal aetiology disease was identified by use of pneumococcal urinary antigen detection and serotype identification using a validated multiplex immunoassay or serum latex agglutination.'Adults with PCV-13 serotype CAP were compared to those with non-PCV-13 serotype CAP.
   Of 2224 patients, PCV-13 serotype CAP was identified in 337 (15.2%) and non-PCV-13 serotype CAP in 250 (11.2%) individuals. Adults aged >= 65 years with one or more clinical risk factors had a significantly lower risk of PCV-13 serotype CAP compared to those aged 16-64 years without clinical risk factors (aOR 0.61, 95%Cl 0.41-0.92, p = .018). In a stacked-risk analysis, the presence of incremental clinical risk factors was associated with lower odds of PCV-13 disease (p for trend = .029) Adults with underlying chronic respiratory disease (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.85, p = .007) and chronic kidney disease (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.92, p = .028) had significantly lower adjusted odds of PCV-13 compared to non-PCV-13 serotype CAP.
   This analysis suggests that in the UK, the burden of PCV13 disease is greater in adults outside the traditional 'at-risk' groups compared to adults in 'at-risk' groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using HIV-1 envelope protein (Env)-based immunogens that closely mimic the conformation of functional HIV-1 Envs and represent the isolates prevalent in relevant geographical region is considered a rational approach towards developing HIV vaccine. We recently reported that like clade B Env, JRFL, membrane bound Indian Glade C Env, 4-2.J41 is also efficiently cleaved and displays desirable antigenic properties for plasmid DNA immunization. Here, we evaluated the immune response in rabbit by injecting the animals with plasmid expressing membrane bound efficiently cleaved 4-2.J41 Env followed by its gp140-foldon (gp140-fd) protein boost. The purified 4-2.J41-gp140-fd protein is recognized by a wide panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) including the quaternary conformation-dependent antibody, PGT145 with high affinity. We have also evaluated and compared the quality of antibody response elicited in rabbits after immunizing with plasmid DNA expressing the membrane bound efficiently cleaved Env followed by gp140-fd proteins boost with either of Glade C Env, 4-2.J41 or Glade B Env, JRFL or in combination. In comparison to JRFL group, 4-2.J41 group elicited autologous as welt as limited low level cross Glade neutralizing antibody response. Preliminary epitope-mapping of sera from animals show that in contrast to JRFL group, no reactivity to either linear peptides or V3-loop is detected in 4-2.J41 group. Furthermore, the presence of conformation-specific antibody in sera from animals immunized with 4-2.J41 Env is observed. However, unlike JRFL group, in 4-2.J41 group of animals, CD4-binding site directed antibodies cannot be detected. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the quality of antibody response in combination group is guided by JRFL Env -based immunogen suggesting that the selection and the quality of Envs in multicade candidate vaccine are important factors to elicit desirable response.

AB Although RTS,S remains the most advanced malaria vaccine, the factors influencing differences in vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy between individuals or populations are still poorly characterised. The analyses of genetic determinants of immunogenicity have previously been restricted by relatively small sample sizes from individual trials. Here we combine data from six Phase 11 RTS,S trials and evaluate the relationship between HLA allele groups and RTS,S-mediated protection in controlled human malaria infections (CHMI), using multivariate logistic or linear regression. We observed significant associations between three allele groups (HLA-A*01, HLA-B*08, and HLA-DRB1*15/*16) and protection, while another three allele groups (HLA-A*03, HLA-B*53, and HLA-DRB1*07) were significantly associated with lack of protection. It is noteworthy that these 'protective' allele groups are thought to be at a lower prevalence in sub-Saharan African populations than in the UK or USA where these Phase II trials occurred. Taken together, the analyses presented here give an indication that HLA genotype may influence RTS,S-mediated protective efficacy against malaria infection. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Introduction: Pertussis is a communicable disease that primarily affects infants. Vaccination has led to an important reduction in the incidence of the disease, however, resurgence of the disease has been observed. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of pertussis and assess the vaccination effectiveness (VE) of different schedules of acellular pertussis vaccination in the community of Madrid.
   Methods: Pertussis cases notified to the Mandatory Disease Reporting System from 1998 to 2015 were analyzed. Five comparison periods were created: 1998-2001 (reference), 2002-2005, 2006-2009, 2010-2012 and 2013-2015. The incidence ratio (IR) between inter-epidemic periods was analyzed using a Poisson regression. VE was calculated using the screening method. Vaccine status data were collected from the vaccine registry.
   Results: In total, 3855 cases were notified. Inter-epidemic periods were observed every 3-4 years. The incidence increased (IR: 5.99, p < 0.05) in the 2013-2015 period, particularly among infants younger than 1 month (IR: 32.41, p < 0.05). Vaccination data were available in 89% of cases. For those receiving the last dose at <= 6-month VE was 89.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 87.3-92.0) after one year of follow-up, and 85.5% (95% CI: 82.4-88.1) after 11 years of follow-up. For those receiving the last dose at 18-months VE decreased from 98.8% (95% CI: 983-99.1) to 85.1% (95% CI: 81.9-87.7) in the same period, and for those receiving the last dose at 4-year VE decreased from 99.6% (95% CI: 99.3-99.7) to 79.3% (95% CI: 74.683.1).
   Conclusions: B. pertussis is circulating in our population, as shown by the epidemic peaks and increased incidence of pertussis in recent years. VE increased with the number of doses and decreased with the follow-up period. The effect of this and other vaccination strategies must be monitored to control the disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) incrementally from 1996 to 1999. In 2006, HepA vaccine was recommended (1) universally for children aged 12-23 months, (2) for persons who are at increased risk for infection, or (3) for any person wishing to obtain immunity. Catch-up vaccination can be considered. Objective: To assess HepA vaccine coverage among adolescents and factors independently associated with vaccination administration in the US.
   Methods: The 2008-2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen was utilized to determine 1 and >= 2 dose HepA vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years. Factors associated with HepA vaccine series initiation (1 dose) were determined by bivariate and multivariable analyses. Data were stratified by state groups based on ACIP recommendation: universal child vaccination recommended since 1999 (group 1); child vaccination considered since 1999 (group 2); universal child vaccination recommendation since 2006 (group 3).
   Results: In 2016, national vaccination coverage for 1 and >= 2 doses of HepA vaccine among adolescents was 73.9% and 64.4%, respectively. Nationally, a 40 percentage point increase in vaccination coverage occurred among adolescents born in 1995 compared to adolescents born in 2003. Nationally, the independent factors associated with increased vaccine initiation was race/ethnicity (Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian), military payment source and provider recommendation for HepA vaccination (2008-2013). Living in a suburban or rural region, living in poverty (level <1.33-5.03), and absence of state daycare or school HepA requirement were common factors associated with decreased likelihood of vaccine initiation.
   Conclusions: Efforts to increase HepA vaccine coverage in adolescents in all regions of the country would strengthen population protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Susceptibility of the homecare patient to vaccine preventable infections and their complications is high. Hospitalization of this patient group increases costs to the healthcare system. Therefore vaccination services are of great importance for protecting these patients from complications and hospitalization. We. aimed to determine vaccination status of the patients receiving home care services from a tertiary hospital in Turkey and to reveal their vaccination needs.
   This cross sectional study was carried out in the Division of Home Care Services of Diskapi Ytldtrtm Beyazit Training and Research Hospital in Ankara Turkey. A questionnaire Comprised of 15 questions were administered through face to face with 336 patients and their care givers. The data obtained was analyzed with descriptive statistical methods and chi-squared test was used for comparison of proportions.
   A total of 86.3% of the patients and 22.6% of the caregivers were older than age 65. Approximately 45% of the patients were receiving home care due to primary neurological diagnosis such as Dementia, Parkinson's disease and Cerebroviscular Accident. In addition, 78% of the patients had at least 1 additional diagnosis other than their primary diagnosis.
   Although immunization indications were present among all patients included in the study and at least 22% of the care providers, only 15.2% of patients and 11.3% of care providers had been recommended to receive vaccination. Among those who had been recommended to get vaccinated, 74% of patients and 77% of care givers had been administered the recommended vaccine. This finding implied that both groups were responsive to the advice for vaccination. Moreover, since the patients receiving home care are already followed-up by a healthcare team, thus these patients can be vaccinated with very little additional logistic support.

AB Asylum seekers are a vulnerable population for contracting infectious diseases. Outbreaks occur among children and adults. In the Netherlands, asylum seeker children are offered vaccination according to the National Immunization Program. Little is known about protection against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) in adult asylum seekers. In this 2016 study, we assessed the immunity of adult asylum seekers against nine VPD to identify groups that might benefit from additional vaccinations. We invited asylum seekers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Ethiopia to participate in a serosurvey. Participants provided informed consent and a blood sample, and completed a questionnaire. We measured prevalence of protective antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio type 1-3 and hepatitis A and B, stratified them by country of origin and age groups. The median age of the 622 participants was 28 years (interquartile range: 23-35), 81% were male and 48% originated from Syria. Overall, seroprotection was 88% for measles (range between countries: 83-93%), 91% for mumps (81-95%), 94% for rubella (84-98%), 96% for varicella (92-98%), 82% for diphtheria (65-88%), 98% for tetanus (86-100%), 91% (88-94%) for polio type 1, 95% (90-98%) for polio type 2, 82% (76-86%) for polio type 3, 84% (54-100%) for hepatitis A and 27% for hepatitis B (anti-HBs; 8-42%). Our results indicate insufficient protection against certain VPD in some subgroups. For all countries except Eritrea, measles seroprotection was below the 95% threshold required for elimination. Measles seroprevalence was lowest among adults younger than 25 years. In comparison, seroprevalence in the Dutch general population was 96% in 2006/07. The results of this study can help prioritizing vaccination of susceptible subgroups of adult asylum seekers, in general and in outbreak situations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The post-fusion form of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein has been used recently in clinical trials as a potential vaccine antigen with the objective of eliciting protective immune response against RSV. In this paper, in vitro antigenicity and in vivo immunogenicity of recombinant, soluble F protein of RSV (RSVsF) were evaluated by several assays. In Vitro Relative Potency (IVRP) of RSVsF was measured in a sandwich ELISA using two antibodies, each specific for epitope site A or C. Therefore, IVRP reflected the integrity of the antigen in terms of changes in antibody binding affinity of either or both of these sites. RSVsF samples with a wide range of IVRP values were generated by applying UV irradiation (photo) and high temperature (heat) induced stress for varying lengths of time. These samples were characterized in terms of stress induced modifications in primary and secondary structures as well as aggregation of RSVsF. Immunogenicity, also referred to as In vivo potency, was measured by induction of total F-protein specific IgG and RSV-neutralizing antibodies in mice dosed with these RSVsF samples. Comparison of results between IVRP and these immunogenicity assays revealed that IVRP provided a sensitive read-out of the integrity of epitope sites A and C, and a conservative and reliable evaluation of the potency of RSVsF as a vaccine antigen. This high throughput and fast turn-around assay allowed us to efficiently screen many different RSVsF antigen lots, thereby acting as an effective filter for ensuring high quality antigen that delivered in vivo potency. In vitro and in vivo potencies were further probed at the level of individual epitope sites, A and C. Results of these experiments indicated that site A was relatively resistant to stress induced loss of potency, in vitro or in vivo, compared to site C. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The preceding decade has witnessed the emergence of severe community-acquired acute infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae serotype a (Hia), with alarming incidence rates in North America, particularly among indigenous populations. The remarkable success of Hib conjugate vaccine over the past 20 years signify the development of an Hia vaccine candidate as a prevention measure to reduce the incidence of invasive Hia disease. However, quantifications of the long-term epidemiologic and economic impacts of vaccination are needed to inform decision on investment in Hia vaccine development and immunization programs. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an Hia vaccine with a similar routine infant immunization schedules currently in practice for Hib in Canada. We developed and parameterized an agent-based simulation model using age-specific incidence rates reported for Nunavut, a Canadian territory with predominantly aboriginal populations. Our results, based on statistical analyses of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, show that an Hia conjugate vaccine is highly cost-effective. Sustaining an immunization program with vaccine coverages of 77% for primary series and 93% for booster dose over a 10-year period reduces the incidence of invasive disease by 63.8% on average from 9.97 to 3.61 cases, per 100,000 population. The overall costs of disease management in year 10 are reduced by 53.4% from CDN $1.863 million (95% CI: $1.229-$2.519 M) to CDN $0.868 million (95% Cl: $0.627-$1.1 20 M). The findings suggest an important role for a conjugate vaccine in managing Hia disease as a growing public health threat. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine that is effective at preventing congenital infection and reducing CMV disease in transplant patients remains a high priority as no approved vaccines exist. While the precise correlates of protection are unknown, neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells have been implicated in controlling infection. We demonstrate that the immunization of mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) encapsulating modified mRNA encoding CMV glycoproteins gB and pentameric complex (PC) elicit potent and durable neutralizing antibody titers. Since the protective correlates in pregnant women and transplant recipients may differ, we developed an additional mRNA vaccine expressing the immunodominant CMV T cell antigen pp65. Administration of pp65 vaccine with PC and gB elicited robust multi-antigenic T cell responses in mice. Our data demonstrate that mRNA/LNP is a versatile platform that enables the development of vaccination strategies that could prevent CMV infection and consequent disease in different target populations.

AB Despite limitations of glass packaging for vaccines, the industry has been slow to implement alternative formats. Polymer containers may address many of these limitations, such as breakage and delamination. However, the ability of polymer containers to achieve cost of goods sold (COGS) and total cost of delivery (TCOD) competitive with that of glass containers is unclear, especially for cost-sensitive low- and lower middle-income countries.
   COGS and TCOD models for oral and parenteral vaccine packaging formats were developed based on information from subject matter experts, published literature, and Kenya's comprehensive multiyear plan for immunization. Rotavirus and inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) were used as representative examples of oral and parenteral vaccines, respectively. Packaging technologies evaluated included glass vials, blow-fill-seal (BFS) containers, preformed polymer containers, and compact prefilled auto-disable (CPAD) devices in both BFS and preformed formats.
   For oral vaccine packaging, BFS multi-monodose (MMD) ampoules were the least expensive format, with a COGS of $0.12 per dose. In comparison, oral single-dose glass vials had a COGS of $0.40. BFS MMD ampoules had the lowest TCOD of oral vaccine containers at $1.19 per dose delivered, and ten dose glass vials had a TCOD of $1.61 per dose delivered. For parenteral vaccines, the lowest COGS was achieved with ten-dose glass vials at $0.22 per dose. In contrast, preformed CPAD devices had the highest COGS at $0.60 per dose. Ten-dose glass vials achieved the lowest TCOD of the parenteral vaccine formats at $1.56 per dose delivered. Of the polymer containers for parenteral vaccines, BFS MMD ampoules achieved the lowest TCOD at $1.89 per dose delivered, whereas preformed CPAD devices remained the most expensive format, at $2.25 per dose delivered.
   Given their potential to address the limitations of glass and reduce COGS and TCOD, polymer containers deserve further consideration as alternative approaches for vaccine packaging. (C) 2018 PATH. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: miRNAs can play vital role in migration, invasion and proliferation in Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). In our study, we attempted to validate the expression and function of miR-1275 in SCCHN, and we also identified the mechanism by which miR-1275 affects migration, invasion and proliferation of SCCHN.
   Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to evaluate the expression of miR-1275 in both SCCHN tissues and cell lines. The role of miR-1275 in SCCHN cells was verified by cell function experiments upon transfection with miR-1275 mimics and inhibitor. Western blot analysis was employed to test the target gene expression of miR-1275. Survival analysis was made with the information of SCCHN patients expressed miR-1275 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
   Results: miR-1275 expression was up-regulated in SCCHN tissues and advanced metastatic SCCHN cells. Increasing miR-1275 expression in SCCHN could promote cell migration, invasion and proliferation probably by upregulating Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and C-C chemokine receptor type 7(CCR7) protein levels, whereas inhibition of miR-1275 could lead the opposite effects, although others have already demonstrated that IGF-1R is a direct target of miR-1275. Survival analysis suggested that patients with lower miR-1275 expression may have a better outcome.
   Conclusions: Herein we report for the first time that miR-1275 could act as a tumor-promoter in SCCHN possibly by regulating its target gene via novel miRNA mechanisms. MiR-1275 plays an important role in promoting SCCHN progression. The miR-1275 may be a potential therapeutic target for SCCHN treatment in the future.

AB nutritional value of goat milk largely depends on its fatty acid content and composition. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules 18-25 nt in length that regulate gene expression and play crucial roles in several biological processes, including fatty acid metabolism. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between differentially expressed miRNAs in goat mammary tissue and the fatty acid composition of goat milk by using Pearson correlations. Results revealed that levels of miR-183 were highly and positively correlated with the fatty acid content in the milk. In addition, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-183 inhibits milk fat metabolism and inhibition of miR-183 promotes milk fat metabolism. Using Western blot, we demonstrate that MST1, one of the major elements of the Hippo signaling pathway, is a target of miR-183. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that miR-183 targets MST1 in the cytoplasm. In summary, data indicate that miR-183 inhibits the metabolism of milk fat by targeting the MST1 gene in the cytoplasm in goat mammary epithelial cells.

AB Yorkie (Yki), the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate yes-associated protein (YAP), is a key effector of the Hippo pathway, which modulates organ size via the transcriptional regulation of downstream targets involved in cell proliferation and survival. YAP has been shown to be expressed as multiple splicing isoforms in mammals, but thus far, no evidence of alternatively spliced Yki isoforms has been reported in insects. Here, we confirmed that the Yki protein of the silkworm Bombyx mari, BmYki, is transcribed in the silk gland into at least four splicing isoforms, named BmY1329, BmY1314, BmY1188, and BmY1173. Further analysis revealed that BmY1329 and BmY1314 each contain two WW domains, whereas BmY1188 and BmY1173 each contain only one WW domain. Each BmYki isoform functions in regulating expression of Yki target genes in cultured B. mori embryonic cells, and exhibits a few different effects on the expression of Yki targets. Interestingly, the expression of silk fibroin protein genes could also be influenced by each of the BmYki isoforms, suggesting that BmYki is involved in the regulation of silk protein-coding genes. This study provides novel insights into the role of BmYki. The contribution of each BmYki isoform to the modulation of gene expression will be of great interest for further study.

AB Background: We conducted this study to identify genetic variants in cancer-related pathway genes which can predict prognosis of NSCLC patients after surgery, using a comprehensive list of regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) prioritized by RegulomeDB.
   Method: A total of 509 potentially functional SNPs in cancer-related pathway genes selected from RegulomeDB were evaluated. These SNPs were analyzed in a discovery set (n = 354), and a replication study was performed in an independent set (n = 772). The association of the SNPs with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed.
   Results: In the discovery set, 76 SNPs were significantly associated with OS or DFS. Among the 76 SNPs, the association was consistently observed for 5 SNPs (ERCC1 rs2298881C > A, BRCA2 rs3092989G > A, NELFE rs440454C > T, PPP2R4 rs2541164G > A, and LTBP4 rs3786527G > A) in the validation set. In combined analysis, ERCC1 rs2298881C > A, BRCA2 rs3092989, NELFE rs440454C > T, and PPP2R4 rs2541164G > A were significantly associated with OS and DFS (adjusted HR aHR: for OS = 1.46, 0.62, 078, and 0.76, respectively; P = 0.003, 0.002, 0.007, and 0.003 respectively; and aHR for DFS = 1.27, 0.69, 0.86, and 0.82, respectively; P = 0.02, 0.002, 0.03, and 0.008, respectively). The LTBP4 rs3786527G > A was significantly associated with better OS (aHR = 0.75; P = 0.003).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that five SNPs in the cancer-related pathway genes may be useful for the prediction of the prognosis in patients with surgically resected NSCLC.

AB Recent studies have highlighted important roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) during the complex process of carcinogenesis. H19 is an example of an lncRNA that can function either as a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor. Here, we investigated the role of H19 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). First, we assessed H19 expression levels in human PTC tissues and PTC cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. We also established H19-overexpressed PTC cell lines with lentiviral vectors to investigate the effects of H19 on the proliferation and migration of PTC cells. Our results suggest that H19 is downregulated in PTC tissues and in PTC cell lines compared to controls. Decreased H19 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis. H19 over expression reduced PTC cell proliferation and migration. It also inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2. These results suggest that H19 inhibits tumorigenesis in PTC and may be utilized as a potential diagnostic tool for PTC.

ID GENES; IDENTIFICATION; DROUGHT; PLANTS; FAMILY
AB Background: Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins were initially discovered about 35 years ago as accumulating late in embryogenesis of cotton seeds. Although abundant in seeds and pollens, these proteins have been found to protect cells against desiccation, cold, high temperature, and high salinity.
   Objective: Here, we present the first comprehensive survey of LEA proteins and their encoding genes in Gastrodia elata, a well-known medicinal orchid in China. Moreover, we researched on LEA family evolutionary relationships and functional characteristics.
   Methods: The LEA gene family in G. elata (GeLEAs) was cloned based on RNA-Seq data. In addition, all of GeLEA genes were introduced into Escherichia coli to assess the function of GeLEAs under low temperature stress.
   Results: Based on the phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis and Oryza LEA proteins, we identified 8 LEA protein encoding genes in G. elata that could be classified into 6 distinct subgroups. The motif composition of these proteins was an important feature specific to LEA groups. Compared with control, the expressions of 5 GeLEAs in E. Coli exhibited enhanced cold resistance and viability, indicating that GeLEAs protein could play a protective role in cells under low temperature stress.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that LEAs from G. data play an important role in responses to abiotic stress.

AB The APOBEC3 family is a series antiviral factors that inhibit the replication of many viruses, such as HIV-1 and HBV. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) possess great potential as an animal model for human diseases and therapeutic responses. However, the APOBEC3 family is unknown in tree shrews. Recent work has showed the presence of the APOBEC3 family in tree shrews. In this work, the cDNA sequences of five APOBEC3 members were identified in tree shrews, namely, tsAPOBEC3A, -3C, -3F, -3G and -3H. The results showed that their sequences encoded a zinc (Z)-coordinating-domain as a characteristic of APOBEC3 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the tree shrew APOBEC3 (tsAPOBEC3) genes have occurred independently and that they are clustered with other mammalian APOBEC3 members. Transcript expression analysis indicated that tsAPOBEC3 genes are constitutively expressed, and high in immune-related tissues. tsAPOBEC3 gene expression was up regulated in hepatocytes and PBMCs by IFN-alpha stimulation. Finally, tsAPOBEC3 proteins could edit both sides of DNA by inserting G -> A and C -> T hypermutations. Overall, the results suggest that the tsAPOBEC3 family could play a key role in defense immunity through distinct editing mechanisms. Our results provided insights into the genetic basis for the development of a tree shrew model for studying viral infection. Future studies will focus on deepening our understanding on the antiviral functions of these editing enzymes in tree shrew.

AB Gonad development is a highly regulated, coordinated biological process and increasing evidences have indicated that microRNA (miRNA) may be involved in this dynamic program. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a good model for reproductive research as it has distinct sex determining genes, however, research in gonadal miRNAs is lacked. In this study, two small RNA libraries from the ovaries and testes were constructed and sequenced. A total of 285 conserved and 388 novel miRNAs were obtained, among which 142 mature miRNAs were significantly (>two-fold change) up or down regulated in the testis compared to the ovary. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that miR-430c, miR-26a and miR-202-5p were expressed in a gonad-specific or sex-biased pattern. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that miR-202-5p was present throughout spermatogenesis and was only detected at the early stages of oogenesis, this sex biased expression pattern suggested that miR-202-5p might be a crucial candidate in male differentiation and development. Our study provides the repertoire, a comprehensive annotation of miRNAs from gonads and a reference for functional studies of miRNAs in medaka.

AB In recent years, substantial credibility in employing Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) technique has been witnessed owing to its numerous advantages over submerged fermentation (SmF). In spite of enormous advantages, true potential of SSF technology has not been fully realized at industrial scale. The lack of rational and scalable bioreactor designs backed by mathematical models and automated control system that could successfully address heterogeneity with respect to heat and mass, and also operate aseptically, remains the prime reason for it. As a result, there still exists vast scope in SSF bioreactor research and development to facilitate broad spectrum of biotechnological applications. The present article reviews state-of-the-art in SSF technology with focus on bioreactors that have been employed for bioprocess applications, in particular, enzyme production. Based on the mode of operation, bioreactors are divided into four categories with emphasis on design features, effect of operating conditions on productivity, applications and limitations. Selected modeling studies developed over the years, have been revised and presented in problem specific manner in order to address the limitations. Some interesting designs including few recent ones that have been proposed and/or employed at pilot and industrial levels are discussed in more detail.

AB Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, which have been emerging as recognition elements in disease diagnostics and food control, including the detection of bacterial toxins. In this study, we employed the semi-automated just in time-selection to identify aptamers that bind to cholera toxin (CT) with high affinity and specificity. CT is the main virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae and the causative agent of the eponymous disease. For the selected aptamers, dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range (23-56 nM) were determined by fluorescence-based affinity chromatography and cross-reactivity against related proteins was evaluated by direct enzyme-linked aptamer assay (ELAA). Aptamer CT916 has a dissociation constant of 48.5 +/- 0.5 nM and shows negligible binding to Shiga-like toxin 1B, protein A and BSA. This aptamer was chosen to develop a sandwich ELAA for the detection of CT from binding buffer and local tap water. Amine-C6- or biotin-modified CT916 was coupled to magnetic beads to serve as the capture element. Using an anti-CT polyclonal antibody as the reporter, detection limits of 2.1 ng/ml in buffer and 2.4 ng/ml in tap water, with a wide log-linear dynamic range from 1 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml, respectively, were achieved.

AB We sought to investigate whether the polymorphisms rs243865 (- 1306C > T); rs243866 (- 1575G > A) and rs2285053 (- 735C > T) in metalloproteinases 2 - MMP-2 gene and rs17576 (Q279R), rs17577 (Q668R) and rs3918242 (- 1562C > T) in MMP-9 gene are associated with clinical outcomes in obese resistant hypertensive (RH) subjects. One hundred and twenty RH were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and divided into obese (n = 63) and non-obese (n = 57) according to body mass index. Genotypes were determined by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. We determined pulse wave velocity (PWV), microalbuminuria and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) to assess TODs. Obese and non-obese RH had similar allele, genotype and haplotype distributions for all polymorphisms assessed but obese RH subjects carrying the low frequency allele for SNPs in MMP-2 gene had higher ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. Also, PWV and LVMI were higher in subjects carrying the low frequency allele for SNPs in MMP-2 gene. Regarding MMP-9 gene, office diastolic BP levels were higher in the AA genotype individuals compared to the G allele group for rs17576 polymorphism, while the opposite was found regarding the microalbuminuria level. Independent multiple linear regression analyses revealed that both A allele for rs243865 and T allele for rs243866 in MMP-2 gene were associated with ambulatory diastolic levels in obese RH subjects, apart from potential confounders. Our study suggests that rs243866/rs243865 in the MMP2 gene are related to BP levels in obese RH subjects, although TODs present in this population seem to be dependent of a combination of other factors besides the genetic polymorphisms.

AB Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) and Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) are several major viral pathogens of apple trees, responsible for substantial damage to the world's apple industry. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation technique to eradicate these viral pathogens from in vitro shoot tips excised from 'Marubakaido' apple rootstock cultures. Axillary shoot tips were excised from in vitro cultures, encapsulated in alginate beads, precultured in MS salts, dehydrated in a laminar flow hood, immersed in liquid nitrogen, then warmed and recovered on medium. After LN exposure, in vitro rooting and acclimatization, recovered 'Marubakaido' plants exhibited 52% survival and 35% regrowth without callus formation. After 8 months of regrowth, PCR analyses revealed that all the plants were free of ACLSV and ASPV, but 2 out of 20 recovered plants were still infected with ASGV. This is the first report in Brazil of the application of cryotherapy to eradicate viral complexes in Malus. Cryotherapy can facilitate the production of virus-free plants by producing high quality plant material.

AB An effective method to functionalize chitosan with 4-hexyloxyphenol (HP) under homogeneous reaction conditions was developed using laccase as the catalyst. The resulting copolymer was characterized for chemical structure, grafted-HP content, surface morphology, thermal stability, antioxidant capacity, hydrophobic properties and tensile strength. Solid-state C-13 NMR spectrum confirmed the incorporation of HP onto chitosan. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed a decrease in the degree of crystallinity for laccase/HP treated chitosan compared to pure chitosan. The grafted-HP content in laccase/HP-treated chitosan first increased and then declined with increase of the initial HP/chitosan ratio. A heterogeneous surface with spherical particles on the laccase/HP treated chitosan was observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). The laccase/HP treatment of chitosan improved the thermal stability of copolymer. More significantly, the HP functionalized chitosan showed greatly improved ABTS(center dot+) and DPPH radicals scavenging capacity, compared with pure chitosan. The hydrophobicity property of the HP functionalized chitosan also significantly increased although its tensile strength decreased. This new type of composite with double functionalities (i.e., antioxidant and hydrophobic) could potentially be used as food packaging materials or coating agents.

AB To explore the association between five polymorphisms in endoplasmic reticulum associated aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) gene and risk of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a Chinese population. A case-control study enrolled 250 AS patients and 250 healthy controls was carried out. The genotypes of involved polymorphisms (rs27037, rs27038, rs469876, rs27044 and rs27980) in ERAP1 were detected by Sequenom Mass-Array platform. There were significant differences of the level of WBC (white blood cell), Platelets, CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) between AS patients and controls (P-all < 0.05). There was statistically association between ERAP1 rs27044 polymorphism and risk of AS, and the carriers with rs27044 CG genotype have an increased the risk for AS (CG versus GG, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.10-2.62, P = 0.015). However, we found no evidence for the association of rs27037, rs469876, and rs27980 polymorphisms in ERAP1 with AS risk. Our findings indicated that ERAP1 rs27044 polymorphism was associated with the susceptibility of AS.

AB Embryonic implantation in sows is a coordinated interaction between the implantation-competent blastocyst and receptive uterus. In addition, microRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs which are involved in post transcriptional gene regulation of several biological processes including embryonic implantation. However, the mechanisms of miRNAs involved in embryonic implantation of sows remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed miRNAome of endometrium on day 9, 12 and 15 of pregnancy and on day 12 of non-pregnancy in Meishan and Yorkshire pigs by Illumina sequencing. From 24 libraries, we identified 312 known microRNAs and 211 potential novel miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis showed that differentially expressed microRNAs on day 12 of pregnancy between the two breeds may play critical roles by involving "p53 signaling pathway" and "Wnt signaling pathway". Furthermore, our results demonstrated that ssc-miR-21, ssc-miR-451, ssc-miR-204, ssc-miR-199a-5p and ssc-miR-199b-5p would play crucial roles for implantation. The data generated in this study were expected to elucidate the influence of microRNAs during pre-implantation in pigs.

AB The cellulose synthase gene superfamily, which includes the cellulose synthase (Ces) and cellulose synthase-like (CsI) families, is involved in the synthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose. This superfamily is critical for cotton fiber development in Gossypium species. Applying a series of bioinformatic methods, we identified 228 Ces/Csl genes from four Gossypium species (G. hirsutum, G. barbadense, G. arboreum, and G. raimondii). These genes were then grouped into 11 subfamilies based on phylogenetic relationships. A subsequent analysis of gene evolution revealed sites in CSLG and CSLJ genes that were under long-term positive selection pressure, with a posterior probability > 0.95. Moreover, the d(N):d(S) value for the CSLJ Glade was 1.305, suggesting this subfamily was under positive selection pressure. Our data indicated that the d(N):d(S) value ranged from 0.0084 to 0.9693 among the homologous Ces/Csl genes, implying they were under purifying selection pressure. Our transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that CesA genes were more highly expressed in tetraploids than in diploids. However, the Csl expression levels exhibited the opposite trend. Furthermore, changes to promoter sequences may have influenced the expression of homologous Ces/Csl genes. Our findings may provide novel insights into the evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of the Ces/Csl genes in Gossypium species.

AB Porcine butyrophilin-like 5 (Btnl5) is a novel member of the butyrophilin family, which consists of immune regulators. The expression pattern and the function of this gene remain unclear. In this study, Btnl5 is identified as a negative regulator of the NF-kappa B pathway. Our study indicates that Btnl5 is mainly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and expressed in membrane systems. Btnl5 inhibits MyD88-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B pathway. Btnl5 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and transcription factor p65. Besides, Btnl5 inhibits p65-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B pathway and inhibits nuclear translocation of p65. These results suggest that Btnl5 may inhibit NF-kappa B pathway through binding and interfere nuclear translocation of p65.

AB Aquaporins (AQPs) constitute a highly diverse family of water channel proteins that play crucial biological functions in plant growth and development and stress physiology. In Arabidopsis, 35 AQPs are classified into four subfamilies (PIPs, TIPs, NIPs and SIPs). However, knowledge about the roles of different subfamily AQPs remains limited. Here, we explored the chromosomal location, gene structure and expression patterns of all AQPs in different tissues or under different abiotic stresses based on available microarray data. Tissue expression analysis showed that different AQPs had various expression patterns in tissues (root, leaf, flower and seed). Expression profiles under stress conditions revealed that most AQPs were responsive to osmotic, salt and drought stresses. Phenotypic and physiological identification showed that Tip2;2 loss-of-function mutant exhibited less sensitive to abiotic stresses (mannitol, NaCl and PEG) compared with wild-type, as evident by analysis of germination rate, root growth, survival rate, ion leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline contents. Mutant of TIP2;2 modulated the transcript levels of SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, DREB1A, DREB2A and P5CS1, under abiotic stress conditions. This study provides a basis for further functional identification of stress-related candidate AQPs in Arabidopsis.

AB It is known that the male hypogonadism plays an important role in regulating adipose metabolism. In the present study, fifteen pairs of full male sibs were divided into a castrated group and an intact group with a paired experiment design. The pigs were slaughtered at an age of 175 days. The carcass characteristics and fat deposit of the studied animal were measured, and the hormone and serum lipid levels of the peripheral blood samples were determined, and the differentially expressed genes of the back fat between the two groups were screened with porcine genome array. Our results showed that the absence of male gonadal steroids attributed to castration significantly raised the serum lipid levels and increased fat accumulation in the pigs. A total of 225 differentially expressed genes were identified between the boars and barrows and 135 of them were upregulated. The analysis of Gene Ontology categories and KEGG pathway indicated that these differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in metabolism of lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, xenobiotics biodegradation, and immune diseases pathways. Our results indicated that there were higher capacity of fatty acid of synthesis, enhanced uptaking capacity of fatty acids and cholesterol, inhibited lipolysis, and enhanced carbohydrate metabolism in the adipose tissue of barrows compared to boars. The findings of the present study provide new insight into the mechanisms of adipose metabolism induced by hormone deficiency.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are well-known as mediators of neuroinflammation in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Increased levels of MMP-8 have been observed in the HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of MMP-8 gene polymorphisms with modulation of HAND severity and its prevalence in HIV-infected and healthy individuals. We enrolled a total of 150 HIV-infected individuals, 50 HAND patients, 100 HIV-infected and 150 healthy individuals. MMP-8 (-799C/T, + 17C/G) polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. MMP-8 - 799TT genotype and + 17G allele showed the higher risk for modulation of HAND severity (OR = 2.20, P = 0.19; OR = 1.97, P = 0.23). MMP-8 - 799TT genotype differed significantly in HIV-infected individuals compared to healthy controls (20.0% vs. 11.3%, OR = 2.36, P = 0.048). Haplotype TG increased the risk for modulation of HAND severity (OR = 2.29, P = 0.29). MMP-8 - 799TT and + 17CG genotypes were overrepresented in the intermediate HIV disease stage compared with healthy controls (25.9% vs. 11.3%, OR = 4.34, P = 0.021, 14.8% vs. 9.3%, OR = 2.88, P = 0.11). MMP-8 + 17CG genotype enhanced the risk for modulation of HAND severity in tobacco using HAND patients (OR = 5.01, P = 0.17). MMP-8 - 799TT genotype was more frequent in tobacco using HIV-infected individuals compared with nonusers (26.3% vs. 16.7%, OR = 2.08, P = 0.32). MMP-8 + 17CG genotype increased the risk for modulation of HAND severity in alcohol using HAND patients (OR = 4.99, P = 0.18). In conclusion, MMP-8 polymorphisms independently and with alcohol and tobacco usage revealed a trend of higher risk for the modulation of HAND severity. MMP-8 - 799TT genotype was associated with the advancement of HIV disease.

AB Epigenetic studies have identified DNA methylation in coronary artery disease (CAD). How the critical genes interact at the cellular level to cause CAD is still unknown. The discovery of DNA methylation inspired researchers to explore relationships in genomic coding and disease phenotype. In the past two decades, there have been many findings regarding the relationship between DNA methylation and CAD development, and the DNA methylation of critical genes have been found to be significantly changed during CAD, including DNA methylation at homocysteine, Alu and long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements. Here, we provide a brief overview of the biology and mechanisms of DNA methylation and its roles in CAD. We also discuss recent findings regarding DNA methylation of homocysteine, Alu and LINE-1 and some genes on CAD in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we provide some perspectives on DNA methylation in CAD.

AB Spermatogenesis involves a series of process including exiting from the mitotic cell cycle, entry into meiosis, completion of complex differentiation programs, and producing spermatozoa. Expression of various genes in an ordered manner, and interactions between various genes and their protein products, primarily controlled at the post-transcriptional level with DEAD-box RNA helicases playing a crucial role in germ cell development, are required for production of fertile sperm. Many members of this family have been deeply studied in spermatogenesis, such as DDX3X, DDX25 and DDX4, but few data are available on DDX52. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of Es-DDX52, Es-DDX6, Es-Vasa and Es-XRN1 both at mRNA and protein levels in different tissues and during gonadal development. It showed that Es-vasa, Es-DDX6 and Es-Xrn1, components of cytoplasmic foci P-bodies, have the similar transcriptional expression pattern, while Es-DDX52 has the reverse tendency. Furthermore, Es-DDX6 and Es-XRN1 proteins have the same localization in testicular tissues. Es-DDX52 mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, only localized in the nucleus of early and middle spermatid and shifted to pre-acrosome vesicle (later developed into apical cap and acrosome tube) at both mRNA and protein levels. These results indicated that Es-DDX52 may participate in regulation of P-bodies and microtubules by Es-XRN1, and involved in the mitosis of spermatonia and spermatid differentiation.

AB P21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is known to be involved in a plethora of functions including cell growth, survival and can lead to cell transformation and tumor progression especially in breast tissue. Multiple studies have shown Pak1 dysregulation as a change in DNA copy number as well as gene expression levels, suggesting many regulatory mechanisms at transcriptional and translational level. However, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the human Pak1 promoter. Here, we focus on Pak1 promoter regulation by steroid hormones along with their respective receptors that are also crucial players in breast tissue function and tumorigenesis. Our results show high Pak1 expression in breast cancer cell lines and in breast tumor tissue. It also suggests that Pak1 is hormone responsive, whose expression can be modulated by steroid hormones namely, estrogen in the form of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). Sequence analysis of a 3.2 kb Pak1 proximal promoter region shows the presence of PRE (progesterone response element) and ERE (estrogen response element) half sites, that were further cloned and characterized. Results from promoter analysis showed that Pak1 promoter activity is mediated by PR via its binding to PRE present on the Pak1 promoter that was further reaffirmed in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). Our results together suggest that it is the PR isoform B regulates Pak1 promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the detailed characterization and transcriptional regulation of the human Pak1 promoter by steroid hormones.

AB One cluster of 5S rDNA per haploid genome is the most common pattern among Heteroptera. However, in Chariesterus armatus, highly scattered signals were noticed. We isolated and characterized the entire 5S rDNA unit of C. armatus aiming to a deeper knowledge of molecular organization of the 5S rDNA among Heteroptera and to understand possible causes and consequences of 5S rDNA chromosomal spreading. For a comparative analysis, we performed the same approach in Holymenia histrio with 5S rDNA restricted to one bivalent. Multiple 5S rDNA variants were observed in both species, though they were more variable in C. armatus, with some of variants corresponding to pseudogenes. These pseudogenes suggest birth-and-death mechanism, though homogenization was also observed (concerted evolution), indicating evolution through mixed model. Association between transposable elements and 5S rDNA was not observed, suggesting spreading of 5S rDNA through other mechanisms, like ectopic recombination. Scattered organization is a rare example for 5S rDNA, and such organization in C. armatus genome could have led to the high diversification of sequences favoring their pseudogenization.

AB Although Halogeton glomeratus (H. glomeratus) has been confirmed to have a unique mechanism to regulate Na+ efflux from the cytoplasm and compartmentalize Na+ into leaf vacuoles, little is known about the salt tolerance mechanisms of roots under salinity stress. In the present study, transcripts were sequenced using the BGISEQ-500 sequencing platform (BGI, Wuhan, China). After quality control, approximately 24.08 million clean reads were obtained and the average mapping ratio to the reference gene was 70.00%. When comparing salt-treated samples with the control, a total of 550, 590, 1411 and 2063 DEIs were identified at 2, 6, 24 and 72 h, respectively. Numerous differentially-expressed isoforms that play important roles in response and adaptation to salt condition are related to metabolic processes, cellular processes, single-organism processes, localization, biological regulation, responses to stimulus, binding, catalytic activity and transporter activity. Fifty-eight salt-induced isoforms were common to different stages of salt stress; most of these DEIs were related to signal transduction and transporters, which maybe the core isoforms regulating Na+ uptake and transport in the roots of H. glomeratus. The expression patterns of 18 DEIs that were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were consistent with their respective changes in transcript abundance as identified by RNA-Seq technology. The present study thoroughly explored potential isoforms involved in salt tolerance on H. glomeratus roots at five time points. Our results may serve as an important resource for the H. glomeratus research community, improving our understanding of salt tolerance in halophyte survival under high salinity stress.

AB Topping is an important agronomic practice that significantly impacts the yield of various crop plants. Topping and the regulation of axillary shoot outgrowth are common agronomic practices in tobacco. However, the effects of topping on gene expression in tobacco remain unknown. We applied the Illumina HiSeq (TM) 2000 platform and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from untopped and topped plants to study the global changes in gene expression in response to topping. We found that the number of DEGs varied from 7609 to 18,770 based on the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) values. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the cellular carbohydrate metabolic process and the disaccharide metabolic process, which may contribute to starch accumulation and stress/defense, were overrepresented terms for the DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that many DEGs were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, among other processes. The knowledge gained will improve our understanding of the processes of axillary shoot formation and enlargement at the transcriptional level. This study lays a solid foundation for future studies on molecular mechanisms underlying the growth of axillary shoots.

AB We aimed to clarify the regulation of cuticular protein (CP) gene expression and the resulting insect cuticular layers by comparing the expression pattern of CP genes and related ecdysone-responsive transcription factor (ERTF) genes, the coding amino acid sequences of CP genes, and histological observation. The expression of CP and ERTF genes during pupal and adult stages was examined via qPCR. The number of CP genes expressed during pupal and adult stages decreased as compared to that during prepupal to pupation stages, particularly in CPRs. The peaks of transcripts were observed at P5, P6, P9, A0, and A1. The order of the ERTF and CP genes expression resembled that at prepupal and pupation stages, suggesting the relatedness of ERTFs with the same CP genes at both stages. Moreover, the order of expression of CP genes resembled that in prepupal to pupation stages, by which we presumed the spaces of CPs in the epicuticle, outer-exocuticle, inner-exocuticle, endocuticle layer.

AB Peroxidasin (PXDN), an ECM protein with peroxidase activity, is integral to basement membrane consolidation through catalysis of sulfilimine bonds in collagen IV. PXDN is also involved in processes where epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) takes place, namely fibrosis, development and cancer. We therefore investigated whether PXDN is regulated by the EMT-master-regulator, Snail. During TGF-beta 1-induced EMT, PXDN expression decreased by up to 47% in two cervical-carcinoma cell lines, with concomitant increases in Snail and vimentin, and decrease in E-cadherin. TGF-beta 1 induced Snail binding to the PXDN promoter (as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR) and significantly repressed luciferase reporter gene expression, as did Snail over expression. In summary, our findings show that Snail mediates repression of PXDN and consolidate a role for this ECM-modifier during EMT.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and is mainly characterized by degradation of the articular cartilage. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), novel noncoding RNAs with different biological functions and pathological implications, have been reported to be closely associated with various diseases. Growing evidence indicates that circRNAs act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that bind with microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulate their downstream functions. Here, we identified a new circRNA, circRNA_Atp9b, and further investigated its function in OA using a well-established mouse chondrocyte model. We demonstrated that circRNA_Atp9b expression was significantly up-regulated in mouse chondrocytes after stimulation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and that knockdown of circRNA_Atp9b promoted the expression of type II collagen while inhibiting the generation of MMP13, COX-2 and IL-6. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the expression levels of circRNA_Atp9b and microRNA (miR)-138-5p, indicating that miR-138-5p also played a role in IL-1 beta-induced chondrocytes. Bioinformatics analysis predicted circRNA_Atp9b directly target miR-138-5p, which was validated by dual-luciferase assay. Further functional experiments revealed that down-regulation of miR-138-5p partly reversed the effects of circRNA_Atp9b on extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism and inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest that circRNA_Atp9b regulates OA progression by modulating ECM catabolism and inflammation in chondrocytes via sponging miR-138-5p. Our findings provide novel insight into the regulatory mechanism of circRNA_Atp9b in OA and may contribute to establishing potential therapeutic strategies.

AB In the present study, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of Huananpotamon lichuanense (Decapoda: Brachyura) for the first time. The genome is 15,380 bp in length and typically consists of 37 genes. When the gene order was compared to the ancestral crustacean type, two tRNA genes (tRNA(His) and tRNA(Gin)) were rearranged in H. lichuanense, and the translocation of tRNAGin appeared only in Potamoidea crabs, such as Geothelphusa dehaani and Sinopotamon xiushuiense, supporting the monophyly of the Potamoidea superfamily. Thirteen protein-coding genes and 2 rRNA genes were divided into five complexes to perform the phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the trees constructed by complex I (ND1-ND6 and ND4L), complex IV (COX1-COX3) and rRNA genes better accord with the morphological classification system, suggesting that molecular markers of higher-level phylogeny can be developed in these three complexes in the future. The estimated divergence time for freshwater crabs is approximately 133.58 Ma, and G. dehaani from Japan diverged from the freshwater crabs of mainland China approximately 60.66 Ma. A selective pressure analysis based on current data revealed obviously increasing dN/dS ratios (except for ATP6 and ND4L) of freshwater crabs, and the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations suggests that terrestrial habitats provide a relatively relaxed selective pressure environment for this group.

AB Aim: To screen and validate the gastric cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
   Methods: Based on case-control design, we select the differentially expressed IncRNAs by bioinformation tools and validate SNPs in lncRNAs genes in population. Attributable risk percentage (ARP) and population attributable risk percentage (PARP) were used to assess the effect of epidemiology.
   Results: Four lncRNAs with SNPs (Inc-EVX1-3:3 (rs1859168), lnc-MACC1-1:7 (rs3815254), lnc-AMFR-1:1 (rs4784659) and lnc-ZNF33B-2:1 (rs579501)) were selected to be validated in population. The unconditional multiple logistic regression based on the dominant (odds ratio, OR = 0.64, 95%confidence interval, 95%CI: 0.47-0.86) and recessive genetic model (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.34-2.35) showed rs1859168 was significantly associated with lower risk of gastric cancer. The dominant (OR = 0.42, 95%CI:0.31-0.57) and additive (OR = 0.52, 95%CI:0.40-0.67) genetic model revealed that rs4784659 decreased the risk of gastric cancer. Similarly, the dominant (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.52-0.98) and additive (OR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.56-0.97) genetic model showed the individuals with rs579501 had reduced risk of gastric cancer. Whereas no statistical association between rs3815254 and gastric cancer. ARP and PARP for gastric cancer associated with rs1859168 in dominant model (56.25%, 33.05%), and in recessive model (43.50% and 29.37%). For rs4784659, ARP and PARP were 138.09% and 10.39% in dominant model, 92.31% and 8.76% in additive model. For rs579501, ARP and PARP were 38.89% and 4.03% in dominant model, 36.99% and 3.88% in additive model.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed rs4784659, rs579501 and rs1859168 reduced the susceptibility of gastric cancer. From epidemiological perspective, the lncRNAs with SNPs attenuate the development of gastric cancer.

TI Construction and evaluation of Bordetella pertussis live attenuated

AB Pertussis or whooping cough is currently the most prevalent vaccine-preventable childhood disease despite >85% global vaccination coverage. In recent years incidence has greatly increased in several high-income countries that have switched from the first-generation, whole-cell vaccine to the newer acellular vaccines, calling for improved vaccination strategies with better vaccines. We have developed a live attenuated pertussis vaccine candidate, called BPZE1, which is currently in clinical development. Unlike other pertussis vaccines, BPZE1 has been shown to provide strong protection against infection by the causative agent of pertussis, Bordetella pertussis, in non-human primates. BPZE1 is a derivative of the B. pertussis strain Tohama 1, which produces serotype 2 (Fim2) but not serotype 3 fimbriae (Fim3). As immune responses to fimbriae are likely to contribute to protection, we constructed a BPZE1 derivative, called BPZE1 f3, that produces both serotypes of fimbriae. Whereas nasal vaccination of mice with BPZE1 induced antibodies to Fim2 but not to Fim3, vaccination with BPZE1f3 elicited antibodies to both Fim2 and Fim3 at approximately the same level. In mice, both BPZE1 and BPZE1f3 provided equal levels of protection against clinical isolates that either produce Fim2 alone, both Fim2 and Fim3, or no fimbriae. However, vaccination with BPZE1 f3 provided significantly stronger protection against Fim3-only producing B. pertussis than vaccination with BPZE1, indicating that immune responses to fimbriae contribute to serotype-specific protection against B. pertussis infection.

AB East Coast fever (ECF) is a lymphoproliferative disease caused by the tick-transmitted protozoan parasite Theileria parva. ECF is one of the most serious cattle tick-borne diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. We have previously demonstrated that three doses of the C-terminal part of the sporozoite protein p67 (p67C) adjuvanted with ISA206VG confers partial protection against ECF at a herd level. We have tested the efficacy of two doses of this experimental vaccine, as reducing the vaccination regimen would facilitate its deployment in the field. We reconfirm that three antigen doses gave a significant level of protection to severe disease (46%, ECF score < 6) when compared with the control group, while two doses did not (23%). Animals receiving three doses of p67C developed higher antibody titers and CD4* T-cell proliferation indices, than those which received two doses. A new panel of immune parameters were tested in order to identify factors correlating with protection: CD4(+) proliferation index, total IgG, IgG1, IgG2 and IgM half maximal titers and neutralization capacity of the sera with and without complement. We show that some of the cellular and humoral immune responses provide preliminary correlates of protection. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: This study was performed with the aim of determining the long-term immunogenicity of an inactivated, Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine (JE-VC) and an inactivated, mouse brain-derived JE vaccine (JE-MB) after the 1st booster dose at 2 years of age, as well as the safety and immunogenicity of the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC at 6 years of age, in children primed and given a 1st booster dose of either JE-VC or JE-MB.
   Method: In this multicenter, open-label clinical trial, the study population consisted of healthy Korean children (aged 6 years) who participated in the previous JE vaccine trial. All subjects were subcutaneously vaccinated once for the booster immunization with Boryung Cell Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine (R) (JE-VC).
   Result: Approximately 4 years after the 1st booster dose of JE-VC, the seroprotection rate (SPR) and geometric mean titer (GMT) of the neutralizing antibody were 100% and 1113.8, respectively. In children primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-MB, the SPR and GMT were 88.5% and 56.3, respectively. After the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC, all participants primed and given a 1st booster dose of either JE-MB or JE-VC were seroprotective against JE virus. The GMT of the neutralizing antibody was higher in children primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-VC (8144.1) than in those primed and given a 1st booster dose of JE-MB (942.5) after the vaccination (p < 0.001). In addition, the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC showed a good safety profile with no serious vaccine-related adverse events.
   Conclusion: The 1st booster dose of JE-VC and JE-MB showed long-term immunogenicity of at least 4 years, and the 2nd booster dose of JE-VC showed a good safety and immunogenicity profile in children primed and given a 1st booster dose of either JE-VC or JE-MB.

AB DNA vaccines composed of heterologous human HER2 and rat neu sequences induce stronger antibody response and protective antitumor immunity than either HER2 or neu DNA vaccines in transgenic mice. We previously developed HER2-specific exosome-targeted T-cell vaccine HER2-T-EXO capable of stimulating HER2-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, but only leading to partial protective immunity in double-transgenic HLA-A2/HER2 mice with self-immune tolerance to HER2. Here, we constructed an adenoviral vector AdV(HuRt) expressing HuRt fusion protein composed of NH2-HER2(1-407) (Hu) and COOH-neu(408-690) (Rt) fragments, and developed a heterologous human/rat HER2-specific exosome-targeted T-cell vaccine HuRt-T-EXO using polyclonal CD4(+) T-cells uptaking exosomes released by AdV(HuRt)-transfected dendritic cells. We found that the HuRt-T-EXO vaccine stimulates enhanced CD4+ T-cell responses leading to increased induction of HER2-specific antibody (similar to 70 g/ml) compared to that (similar to 40 mu g/ml) triggered by the homologous HER2-T-EXO vaccine. By using PE-H-2K(d)/HER2(23-71) tetramer, we determined that HuRt-T-EXO stimulates stronger HER2-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses eradicating 90% of HER2-specific target cells, while HER2-T-EXO-induced CD8(+) T-cell responses only eliminating 53% targets. Furthermore, HuRt-T-EXO but not HER2-T-EXO vaccination, is capable of suppressing early stage-established HER2-expressing 4T1(HER2) breast cancer in its lung metastasis or subcutaneous form in BALB/c mice, and of completely protecting transgenic HLA-A2/HER2 mice from growth of HLA-A2/HER2-expressing BL6-10(A2/HEx2) melanoma. HuRt-T-EXO-stimulated HER2-specific CD8(+) T-cells not only are cytolytic to trastuzumab-resistant HLA-A2/HER2-expressing BT474/A2 breast tumor cells in vitro but also eradicates pre-established BT474/A2 tumors in athymic nude mice. Therefore, our novel heterologous human/rat HER2-specific T-cell vaccine HuRt-T-EXO, circumventing HER2 tolerance, may provide a new therapeutic alternative for patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2(+) breast tumor.

AB Tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes) is becoming an economic promising aquaculture species in China. However, the development of Tiger puffer breeding industry is restricted by some serious aquatic disease such as vibriosis. An effective live attenuated vaccine MVAV6203 was developed in our previous studies by curing the virulence plasmid pEIB1 and unmarked inframe-deletion of the aroC gene from the virulent V. anguillarum. Here, we evaluated whether this live vaccine was suitable for Tiger puffer against disease caused by Vibrio genus. The live vaccine show virulence attenuation in both juvenile and adult fish vaccinated with either a single or high dose (50-fold single dose). In addition, administration of the live vaccine shew limited growth in fish and did not affect fish body weight significantly, with no adverse impact on growth between vaccinated and saline control fish. Furthermore, increased expression of cytokines involved in pro-inflammatory (1L-1 beta, TNF alpha and IL-6), cell-mediated immunity inducing (IL-12p35, IL-12p40 and IL-18), antiviral/intracellular pathogen killing (1-IFN-1, IFN-gamma and Mx), peripheral T cell expansion and survival controlling (IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15) and antigen processing maker and anti-inflammatory (MHC I and IL-10) were elicited significantly after the vaccination. These cellular responses correlate with protection against virulent strain challenge and high RPS of 90.67% and 80.31% in juvenile and adult fish were obtained, respectively. These data indicated for the first time that the live attenuated V. anguillarum vaccine is suitably applied for the development of an effective and safe vaccine for prevention of vibriosis in Tiger puffer aquaculture industry.

ID VIRUS; INFECTION
AB Influenza infections are the leading cause of respiratory viral infections worldwide, and are mostly common in the winter season. The seasonal influenza vaccine is currently the most effective preventive modality against influenza infection. Immediately following each winter season the World Health Organization (WHO) announces the vaccine composition for the following winter. Unexpectedly, during the summer of 2017, in Israel, we observed in hospitalized patients, an exceptionally high numbers of Influenza positive cases. The majority of the influenza B infections were caused by influenza B/Yamagata lineage, which did not circulate in Israel in the previous winter, and most of the influenza A infections were caused by influenza A/H3N2, a strain similar to the strain that circulated in Israel in the previous winter. We therefore predict that these two viruses will circulate in the coming winter of 2017/18 and that the trivalent vaccine, which includes antigenically different viruses will be inefficient.

AB Thirty years after passage of legislation that created the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) "to achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines," this review reflects NVAC's role and impact on the U.S. vaccine and immunization enterprise as an external advisor to the Department of Health and Human Services. We reviewed the history of NVAC in the context of the principles of its establishment, with a focus on its reports and recommendations. We performed a systematic literature review to identify NVAC reports published in widely-accessible public health journals, and we reviewed the available archives to identify other reports and resolutions approved by the committee not published in journals. We characterized key issues considered by NVAC according to the five goals of the 2010 National Vaccine Plan. The predominance of NVAC activities to date related to the implementation of immunization across the lifespan and the many aspects of the system needed to foster the goal of full immunization. Reflecting on the impacts of NVAC to date, this review identified 30 NVAC approved reports published in journals, 22 stand-alone resolutions, and 26 unique unpublished reports. The development of new and improved vaccines continues to represent a significant priority for NVAC, and we identified several challenges related to future vaccine innovation. Given the many factors that impact on policy changes in the vaccine and immunization enterprise, we encountered challenges associated with demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes to NVAC recommendations. Although difficult to quantify, this review suggests that NVAC played an important role in the improvements in the U.S. immunization enterprise over the past 30 years and that NVAC can and will continue to play an important role supporting U.S. immunization going forward.

AB Background: Timely administration of recommended vaccines requires children to have multiple vaccines co-administered in the first year of life. The objectives of this study were to estimate the proportion of timely vaccinations and the proportion of co-administered vaccines, and to assess the relationship between vaccine co-administration and vaccine timeliness in Kenyan children.
   Methods: Using the 2014 Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we calculated the proportion of children who received co-administered and timely vaccine doses. Co-administration was defined as doses administered on the same day with dates recorded on vaccination cards. Vaccines were considered timely if given within four days before to four weeks after the recommended interval for administration.
   Results: 10,385 children aged 1-4 years in the Kenyan 2014 DHS dataset had vaccination cards which comprised the study sample. Analysis revealed wide a range for receipt of timely doses, from 90.2% for OPVO to 56.0% for Measles. Co-administration of the 6-week dose was associated with 2.81 times higher odds of a timely Penta dose 1 (95% CI: 2.28, 3.46) and birth-dose co-administration was associated with a substantial increase in timely BCG vaccination: AOR 7.43 (95% CI: 6.31, 8.75).
   Conclusions: Though vaccine coverage in Kenya was high, timely vaccination was markedly low, with resultant implications for population immunity and potential spread of communicable diseases in unvaccinated infants. Co-administration of vaccines, place of residence, wealth index, and child age were consistently related to the odds of timely vaccine receipt. These relationships reinforce the importance of dedicating resources to programs that educate low socio-economic groups about the importance of vaccine co-administration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: The four objectives of this study were to (1) educate military healthcare providers on HPV disease and vaccine, (2) assess short term recall of information presented at educational sessions, (3) assess provider comfort level with the vaccine, and (4) assess improvement in HPV vaccination rates.
   Methods: Standardized interactive educational sessions were conducted at military primary care clinics with pre- and post-educational quizzes administered before and immediately following the sessions. Provider attitudes were assessed using Likert scale questionnaires. Vaccination rates in children and young adolescents ages 11-18 at one of the participating regions that had a champion and started a Quality Improvement (QI) project were assessed at baseline, at 3-months and at 6-months post sessions.
   Results: 200 providers were reached at 48 primary care clinics during May 2014 through October 2015 with 200 quizzes and Likert scale questionnaires returned. There was increase in knowledge following the educational sessions as revealed in the pre- and post- test scores [t(57) = -5.04, p < 0.001]. There was a significant overall increase in comfort in answering patients' and parents' questions about HPV vaccine [p = 0.003]. There was a significant increase in the number of vaccines given at all the clinics 3-months after the educational sessions at the region who had a champion dedicated to monitoring vaccine rates and ensuring implementation efforts [p = 0.01] and started a QI project. This increase was not sustained at 6-months [p = 0.324].
   Conclusions: Improvement in provider short term knowledge recall and comfort level in answering parents' questions was seen. We found that educational sessions can improve HPV vaccination rates in military clinics that have a vaccine champion for up to 3-months. Further research into the effects of having clinic vaccine champions is critical. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This was an extension study of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled immunogenicity and safety study of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine conducted in Chinese female subjects aged 9-45 years and male subjects aged 9-15 years. To investigate the persistence of anti-HPV 6,-11,-16, and -18 responses among Chinese subjects, subjects enrolled in the base study were followed up at around month 42 (approximately 3.5 years after vaccination).
   Methods: Among 600 subjects enrolled in the base study, a total of 468 subjects consented for participation in the extension study. Anti-HPV 6,-11,-16, and-18 antibodies were detected by the competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and total IgG Luminex immunoassay (IgG LIA).
   Results: Among the female subjects who received the qHPV vaccine, the proportions of subjects remained seropositive were high with both the cLIA and IgG LIA for HPV type 6, 11, and 16 through approximately 42 months following the first dose vaccination. For HPV 18, the seropositivity rate remained high as 82.0% with the IgG LIA, while it decreased to 53.6% with the cLIA, which was similar to the findings observed in other studies. The seropositivity rates remained high at month 42 for all qHPV types with both the cLIA and IgG LIA among the male subjects.
   Conclusions: Administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine induces durable anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 responses among Chinese subjects for at least 3.5 years after vaccination. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Whooping cough continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants younger than 1 year. In 2012, Argentina introduced Tdap in pregnancy to prevent infant mortality. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of maternal immunization on the hospitalization and mortality rates of confirmed Bordetella pertussis (Bp) cases by comparing pre- and post-Tdap vaccine recommendation periods.
   Material and Methods: All PCR-confirmed Bp cases from "R. Gutierrez" Children's Hospital identified between December 2003 and December 2016 were included in. Analysis was performed comparing hospitalization rates (per 10,000 discharges) between pre-vaccination (Prey) 2003-2011 and post vaccination (PostV) 2013-2016 time periods, excluding the intervention year (2012).
   Results: During the study time frame, there were 1046 suspected Bp cases, of which 337 (32.2%) were confirmed. Three-hundred eight cases were analyzed (excluding year 2012): 237 in PreV and 71 in PostV. In comparison with PreV, PostV cases were older (3 vs 9 months; p < 0.001), and required less hospitalization (86.9% vs 67.6%; p < 0.001). Bp hospitalization rate (HR) decreased (22.3 vs 11.6; p < 0.001). The mortality rate in PreV 5.9% (14 cases); there were not deaths during PostV (p = 0.036).
   Conclusions: Confirmed cases were among infants younger than 1 year In PostV, Bp cases were older and there was a significant decrease in the hospitalization rate. There were no fatal cases in our center after the pregnancy Tdap recommendation was implemented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an important re-emergent infectious disease and inflicts huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. To meet the pressing need of developing a safe and cost-efficient PED maternal vaccine, we generated three PED subunit vaccine candidates, using recombined Salmonella flagellin (rSF) as a mucosal molecular adjuvant. Domain D3 in rSF was replaced with COE domain of PEDV to generate rSF-COE-3D. COE fused to the flanking C'/N' terminal of rSF yielded rSF-COE-C and rSF-COE-N. As a result, rSF-COE-3D could significantly improve COE specific antibody production including serum IgG, serum IgA, mucosal IgA and PEDV neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, rSF-COE-3D elicited more CD3(+)CD8*T cell and cytokine production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in mouse splenocytes. In summary, our data showed that rSF-COE-3D could improve specific humoral and mucosal immunity in mice, thus suggesting that rSF-COE-3D could be applied as a novel efficient maternal PED vaccine.

AB Most traditional vaccines are administered via the intramuscular route. Other routes of administration however, can induce equal or improved protective memory responses and might provide practical advantages such as needle-free immunization, dose sparing and induction of tissue-specific (mucosal) immunity. Here we explored the differences in immunological outcome after immunization with model antigens via two promising immunization routes (intradermal and intranasal) with or without the experimental adjuvant and TLR7/8-agonist R848. Because the adaptive immune response is largely determined by the local innate cells at the site of immunization, the effect of R848-adjuvation on local cellular recruitment, antigenic uptake by antigen-presenting cells and the initiation of the adaptive response were analyzed for the two routes of administration. We show a general immune-stimulating effect of R848 irrespective of the route of administration. This includes influx of neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells to the respective draining lymph nodes and an increase in antigen-positive antigen presenting cells which leads for both intradermal and intranasal immunization to a mainly T(H)1 response. Furthermore, both intranasal and intradermal R848-adjuvated immunization induces a local shift in DC subsets; frequencies of CD11b*DC increase whereas CD103*DC decrease in relative abundance in the draining lymph node. In spite of these similarities, the outcome of immune responses differs for the respective immunization routes in both magnitude and cytokine profile. Via the intradermal route, the induced T-cell response is higher compared to that after intranasal immunization, which corresponds with the local higher uptake of antigen by antigen-presenting cells after intradermal immunization. Furthermore, R848-adjuvation enhances ex vivo IL-10 and IL-17 production after intranasal, but not intradermal, T-cell activation. Quite the opposite, intradermal immunization leads to a decrease in IL-10 production by the vaccine induced T-cells. This knowledge may lead to a more rational development of novel adjuvanted vaccines administered via non-traditional routes. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Following the significant reduction of Neisseria meningitidis A (NmA) in most parts of northern Nigeria, a new strain of Neisseria meningitidis C (NmC) emerged in 2013 causing outbreaks in the north and recently spreading to southern parts of the Nigeria. This study provides detailed epidemiological investigation in the last four years.
   Methods: Analysis of confirmed and suspected cases of meningitis in Kebbi, Nigeria from 2014 to June 2017 detected through Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response.
   Results: Of the 2776 cases, 1568 were males, and 1208 females. The median age of males and females was 10 and 11 years (Interquartile range of ages is 9 years) respectively. The attack rate (AR) per 100,000 in the state between 2014 and 2017 was 13.2, 46.7, 2.2 and 3.2 respectively. Case fatality rate (CFR) in 2014 was highest in the 4 years analysed at 13.8%. Binary logistic regression analysis suggests that the odds of confirmation of meningitis was 3.6 (Odds ratio, OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.58-8.2; p = 0.002) times as high in the age group 6-10 years and 2.4 times in the age group 11-19 years compared to the age group 0-5 years (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.09-5.48; p = 0.03). An epidemic of NmC in 2015, led to a reactive vaccination campaign in selected wards in Aliero and Jega targeting age groups 1-29 years old, with a coverage of 72% and 51% respectively. In 2016-2017 Aliero and Jega local government areas (LGA) had no recorded deaths due to meningitis, a significant improvement over 2015 mortality rates (MR) per 100,000 of 33.4 and 12.2 respectively.
   Conclusion: The CFR in the state is still very high, suggesting the need for a more coordinated approach aimed at improving disease notification and early treatment. Vaccination in Aliero and Jega LGAs have demonstrated the usefulness of meningococcal C vaccine in reduction of morbidity and mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current serological diagnosis of pertussis is usually done by ELISA. However, the ELISAs are often central laboratory based, require trained staff and have long turnaround times. A rapid point-of-care (POC) assay for pertussis serology would aid in both diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. While lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) are simple to use and ideal for point-of-care diagnostics, they were limited to qualitative assays until recently. In this study, we developed a quantitative LFIA with fluorescent Eu-nanoparticle reporters for the detection of anti-pertussis toxin (PT) IgG. The assay was evaluated by testing 198 serum samples with varying anti-PT IgG levels and the result was compared to those obtained with standardized anti-PT IgG ELISA. At the diagnostic cutoff of 100 IU/mL in ELISA, the LFIA had a concordance of 92% with the ELISA, with a specificity of 96% [95% confidence interval (CI): 89-99%] and a sensitivity of 88% [0: 77-94%]. The developed LFIA has a turnaround time of one hour and requires only a simple manipulation by the user and an instrument for the quantitative detection of the signal. We conclude that the LFIA is specific and sensitive for serological diagnosis of pertussis and is suitable for a POC test. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vaccination has determined a dramatic decline in morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases over the last century. However, low perceived risk of the infectious threat and increased concern about vaccines' safety led to a reduction in vaccine coverage, with increased risk of disease outbreaks.
   Methods: Annual surveillance data of nationally communicable infectious diseases in Italy between 1900 and 2015 were used to derive trends in morbidity and mortality rates before and after vaccine introduction, focusing particularly on the effect of vaccination programs. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were applied to ten vaccine-preventable diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and invasive meningococcal disease. Results of these models referring to data before the immunization programs were projected on the vaccination period to estimate expected cases. The difference between observed and projected cases provided estimates of cases avoided by vaccination.
   Results: The temporal trend for each disease started with high incidence rates, followed by a period of persisting reduction. After vaccine introduction, and particularly after the recommendation for universal use among children, the current rates were much lower than those forecasted without vaccination, both in the whole population and among the 0-to-4 year olds, which is, generally, the most susceptible age class. Assuming that the difference between incidence rates before and after vaccination programs was attributable only to vaccine, more than 4 million cases were prevented, and nearly 35% of them among children in the early years of life. Diphtheria was the disease with the highest number of prevented cases, followed by mumps, chickenpox and measles.
   Conclusions: Universal vaccination programs represent the most effective prevention tool against infectious diseases, having a major impact on human health. Health authorities should make any effort to strengthen public confidence in vaccines, highlighting scientific evidence of vaccination benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB NAb are defined as antigen binding antibodies present without a known previous exposure to this antigen. NAb are suggested to enhance specific antibody (SpAb) responses, but consequences of different NAb levels on immunization are largely unknown. Layer chickens were divergently selected and bred for keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-binding NAb titers, resulting in a High line and a Low line. In this study, we investigated: (1) the relation of NAb levels with SpAb titers; and (2) the effect of immunization on NAb titers. The 50 highest females of the High line and the 50 lowest females of the Low line of generation 2 were intramuscularly immunized at 33 weeks of age with 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing one of four treatments: (1) negative control (no antigen), (2) 500 mu g KLH, (3) 100 mu g avian tuberculin purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium avium (PPD), or (4) 250 mu g human serum albumin (HuSA). IgM and IgG titers of NAb and SpAb in plasma were determined prior to immunization and weekly for 5 weeks post immunization by indirect ELISA. In addition, antibody affinity was investigated. No differences in SpAb and NAb response against KLH and PPD were observed as a consequence of different NAb titers, but increased and prolonged SpAb and NAb titer responses against HuSA were observed for the High line compared to the Low line. Different natural antibody titers did not impair SpAb dynamics and SpAb affinity. NAb titers were not, or for only short-term, affected by immunization. We show here that NAb may enhance SpAb responses, but that this effect is antigen-dependent. We hypothesize that NAb play a role in general disease resistance through enhancement of the humoral adaptive immune response.

AB Introduction: Pregnant Thai women have low antibody titers against B. pertussis antigens, which coincide with an increasing incidence of pertussis among Thai infants. Thus, there exists a potential benefit of a booster dose of tetanus- diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine administered during pregnancy. Here, we report the vaccine reactogenicity profile and birth outcomes in Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women who have or have not had prior immunization with tetanus vaccine, and the IgG levels to B. pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera at delivery.
   Materials and methods: Pregnant women (N = 370) aged 18-40 years were administered the Tdap vaccine (Boostrixe (R), GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) at 26-36 weeks gestation. Adverse events following vaccination were identified by follow-up telephone call and medical record review. IgG against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA) and pertactin (anti-PRN) in both maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery were quantitatively evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN (R), Lubeck, Germany).
   Results: There was no reported increase in the severity or duration of adverse events associated with the administration of an extra tetanus-containing vaccine within the previous five years (N = 181) or multiple doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during the current pregnancy (N = 98). Vaccination at least eight weeks prior to delivery resulted in high antibody titers to all B. pertussis antigens studied.
   Conclusions: The reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy was not affected by prior tetanus toxoid immunization. High transplacental antibody against B. pertussis antigens in the cord blood provides evidence of antibody transfer and should thus help to protect newborns from pertussis during early life.

AB Objectives: To improve information for patients and to facilitate a vaccination coverage that is in line with the EU and World Health Organization goals, we aimed to quantify how vaccination and patient characteristics impact on influenza vaccination uptake of elderly people.
   Methods: An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among 1261 representatives of the Dutch general population aged 60 years or older. In the DCE, we used influenza vaccination scenarios based on five vaccination characteristics: effectiveness, risk of severe side effects, risk of mild side effects, protection duration, and absorption time. A heteroscedastic multinomial logit model was used, taking scale and preference heterogeneity (based on 19 patient characteristics) into account.
   Results: Vaccination and patient characteristics both contributed to explain influenza vaccination uptake. Assuming a base case respondent and a realistic vaccination scenario, the predicted uptake was 58%. One-way changes in vaccination characteristics and patient characteristics changed this uptake from 46% up to 61% and from 37% up to 95%, respectively. The strongest impact on vaccination uptake was whether the patient had been vaccinated last year, whether s/he had experienced vaccination side effects, and the patient's general attitude towards vaccination.
   Conclusions: Although vaccination characteristics proved to influence influenza vaccination uptake, certain patient characteristics had an even higher impact on influenza vaccination uptake. Policy makers and general practitioners can use these insights to improve their communication plans and information regarding influenza vaccination for individuals aged 60 years or older. For instance, physicians should focus more on patients who had experienced side effects due to vaccination in the past, and policy makers should tailor the standard information folder to patients who had been vaccinated last year and to patient who had not.

AB Background: Individuals with certain chronic medical conditions are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and pneumococcal disease than those without. Using data from the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA), this post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in adults aged >= 65 years with at-risk conditions.
   Methods: The Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled study in the Netherlands in which adults aged >= 65 years received either PCV13 or placebo. Outcomes of interest were identified using prespecified clinical criteria, radiographic confirmation, routine microbiologic testing, and a serotype-specific urinary antigen detection assay.
   Methods: In this post hoc analysis, participants were classified by at-risk status based on self-reporting of any of the following chronic medical conditions: heart disease, lung disease, asthma, diabetes, liver disease, and smoking. The objective of this analysis was to assess PCV13 vaccine efficacy (VE) against a first episode of vaccine-serotype community-acquired pneumonia (VT-CAP) in at-risk participants.
   Results: Of the 84,496 adults enrolled in the study, 41,385 (49.2%) were considered at risk owing to chronic medical conditions. Of the 139 VT-CAP cases, 115 (82.7%) occurred in these participants. VE of PCV13 against a first episode of VT-CAP among participants with at-risk conditions was 40.3% (95.2% CI: 11.4%, 60.2%). Average duration of follow-up since vaccination was 3.95 years for at-risk participants; protection did not wane over the study period.
   Conclusions: This post hoc analysis of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) showed significant and persistent efficacy of PCV13 against VT-CAP in at-risk older adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The host-restricted pathogen Streptococcus equi causes strangles in the horse, which is characterised by abscessation of the lymph nodes of the head and neck. The disease is endemic throughout the world causing considerable welfare and economic cost to the horse industry. Here we report the results of three studies where ponies were vaccinated with combinations of recombinant fusion proteins to optimise vaccine production and the level of protection conferred. Optimal protection was conferred by a prototype multicomponent subunit vaccine, Strangvac 4, which contained eight proteins CNE, ScIC, ScIF, Scll, EAG (fused as CCE), SEQ_402, SEQ_0256 (fused as Eq85) and IdeE. Across the three experiments only three of 16 ponies vaccinated with Strangvac 4 became pyretic compared to all 16 placebo-vaccinated control ponies (P < .001). S. equi was recovered from the lymph nodes of eight Strangvac 4-vaccinated and 15 control ponies (P = .016). None of the ponies vaccinated with Strangvac 4, or the other prototype vaccines developed adverse reactions following vaccination. Our data provide evidence in support of the further clinical development of the Strangvac 4 vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Delayed completion of human papillomavirus vaccination (4vHPV) series is common. We sought to identify factors associated with delay.
   Methods: This substudy was part of a large prospective, multi-site study recruiting 9-17 year old girls at the time of their third 4vHPV dose to assess immunogenicity associated with prolonged dosing intervals. At participating sites, parents/legal guardians (caregivers) of all enrolled girls (9-17 years old) and enrolled girls aged 14-17 years were approached for participation. Caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring adolescent and caregiver sociodemographic characteristics, caregiver attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination and HPV vaccine safety, adolescent's health behaviors, barriers to accessing health care, provider office vaccination practices and a Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Participating girls completed a separate questionnaire measuring their attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination and HPV vaccine safety. Delay was defined as receiving the third 4vHPV dose >12 months after the first. Bivariate, multinomial logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predicting delayed completion.
   Results: Questionnaires were completed by 482 caregivers and 386 adolescents; 422 caregivers completed a REALM. Delayed 4vHPV dosing occurred in most adolescents (67%). In multivariate analyses, predictors of delayed completion included caregiver demographic factors (self-reported black vs. white race and high school or less education vs. college or more) and an interaction between caregiver's inability to get an immunization appointment as soon as needed and adolescent's type of insurance.
   Conclusions: Caregiver's race and educational level, accessibility of immunization appointments, and adolescent's insurance type were found to be related to delays in completion of 4vHPV, but caregiver or adolescent attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination or HPV vaccine safety were not. Therefore, interventions to improve adherence to recommended vaccination schedules could benefit from a focus on improving access to immunizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Porcine proliferative ileitis is a major economic burden for the swine industry, affecting growing pigs and young adult pigs. In this study, the protective efficacy of an inactivated, injectable whole-cell bacteria vaccine against L. intracellularis - Porcilis (R) Ileitis was evaluated under field conditions.
   Eighty-five, three-week-old pigs on a commercial farrow-to-finish farm were vaccinated by the intramuscular route, either with a dose of injectable vaccine, or with saline. A subset of vaccinates and control pigs were necropsied at 21 days post-challenge. Incidence and severity of ileitis were evaluated by gross and microscopic observation of ileal tissues. Colonization of the gut after challenge was examined by L. intracellularis-specific immunohistochemistry, and qPCR of ileal scrapings. Integrity of the intestinal barrier was evaluated to quantify a range of intestinal markers including secreted mucin and intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and innate immune markers including Caspase-3 and Calprotectin. A second subset of pigs was monitored for fecal shedding of L. intracellularis, until resolution of shedding.
   Our investigation indicated that Porcilis Ileitis provided robust protection against ileitis, reduced bacterial shedding 15-fold (p < .05) and preserved normal gut barrier function in the face of an experimental challenge with virulent L. intracellularis.

AB Introduction: The WHO Regional Office for Europe developed the Guide to tailoring immunization programmes (TIP), offering countries a process through which to diagnose barriers and motivators to vaccination in susceptible low vaccination coverage and design tailored interventions. A review of TIP implementation was conducted in the European Region.
   Material and methods: The review was conducted during June to December 2016 by an external review committee and was based on visits in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Sweden and the United Kingdom that had conducted a TIP project; review of national and regional TIP documents and an online survey of the Member States in the WHO European Region that had not conducted a TIP project. A review committee workshop was held to formulate conclusions and recommendations.
   Results: The review found the most commonly cited strengths of the TIP approach to be the social science research as well as the interdisciplinary approach and community engagement, enhancing the ability of programmes to "listen" and learn, to gain an understanding of community and individual perspectives. National immunization managers in the Region are generally aware that TIP exists and that there is strong demand for the type of research it addresses. Further work is needed to assist countries move towards implementable strategies based on the TIP findings, supported by an emphasis on enhanced local ownership; integrated diagnostic and intervention design; and follow-up meetings, advocacy and incentives for decision-makers to implement and invest in strategies.
   Conclusions: Understanding the perspectives of susceptible and low-coverage populations is crucial to improving immunization programmes. TIP provides a framework that facilitated this in four countries. In the future, the purpose of TIP should go beyond identification of susceptible groups and diagnosis of challenges and ensure a stronger focus on the design of strategies and appropriate and effective interventions to ensure long-term change.

AB Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coordinates the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program, which provides free vaccines to qualified children in the US. In 2009, the CDC issued Vaccine Storage Requirements, which were later replaced (2012) with an interim guidance and toolkit for vaccine storage and handling. The guidance called for use of Digital Data Loggers (DDL) to monitor vaccine storage temperatures. We describe a change in frequency of Incorrect Product Storage Reports (IPSRs) following issuance of the 2009 CDC guidance.
   Methods: Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, systematically evaluates vaccine safety concerns for all products. The safety database was queried (01-Jan-2004 through 31-December-2016) to identify all IPSRs associated with 10 vaccines. We compared IPSRs received prior to and following the 2009 CDC guidance, comparing reports received from the US with those received from international sources during the same period.
   Results: Following the release of the DDL guidance, a progressive increase in IPSRs was identified in the US (1 report received in 2004, 12,993 reports in 2016). In contrast, non-US IPSRs - have not had a similar increase: no reports received in 2004, 216 reports received in 2016. US reports of IPSRs 2004 through 2016 account for 96% of reports worldwide. There were no serious reports found in the database in conjunction with IPSRs, nor were there any additional safety findings in any of the reports with additional events reported.
   Conclusion: VFC DDL guidance was followed by an increase in IPSRs. No similar trend was seen outside the US (where no broad change in DDL guidance occurred). Despite the increase in IPSRs, there have been few associated adverse events (AEs) reported; no new safety concerns were identified. These findings suggest that the increase in IPSRs was associated with the introduction of use of DDLs, and suggests the need for further impact assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the co-digestion of source separated municipal organic waste (SSMOW), pretreated using a biopulper, and cattle manure both in batch and continuous stirred tank reactors. The optimum co-digestion feeding mixture was consisted of 90% SSMOW and 10% cattle manure on organic matter basis, yielding 443 mLCH(4)/gVS. The high performance of the co-digestion was explained by the fact that the efficient pulping pretreatment boosted the methane production from SSMOW and that the added livestock slurry provided the buffer capacity to avoid inhibition occurred by intermediates' accumulation. Moreover, batch assays focused on the effect of inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR) were performed. Results showed that the reduction of ISR had slight impact on extending the lag phase, without affecting the rest kinetic parameters. The efficiency of the co-digestion process in continuously fed reactor was comparable with the results obtained from the batch assay (i.e. < 95% of the maximum expected value). Finally, the outputs from an applied mathematical model were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from the continuous reactor operation, demonstrating that the BioModel can serve as a reliable tool to predict the process performance under real-scale conditions.

AB The present work examines the direct synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from CO2 hydrogenation over novel hybrid catalysts containing a Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst admixed with WOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The effect of pore sizes (6.6, 33 and 51 nm) of Al2O3 support and W loading contents (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) on the physicochemical properties of WOx/Al2O3 catalysts as well as their catalytic performance is also investigated. Characterization results from XRD, XPS and UV-vis reveal that the structure of WO species on the surface of Al2O3 is mainly related to W surface density, i.e. W loading content, which can be classified into three regions: a mixture of monotungstate species and polytungstate species at W surface density < 5.1 W nm(-2), a monolayer coverage of WO species over the surface of Al2O3 at W surface density similar to 5.1 W nm(-2) and a co-existence of polytungstate species and WO3 nanoparticles at W surface density > 5.1W nm(-2). The space-time yield (STY) of DME exhibits a volcanic trend as a function of W surface density with the maximum values at nearly monolayer coverage (similar to 4.7 W nm(-2)) for large pores (33 and 51 nm), and above monolayer coverage (8.0 W nm(-2)) for small pore (6.6 nm). The hybrid catalyst with optimum Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 and WOx/Al2O3 weight ratio of 1:5 achieves the highest STY of DME of 165.6 g(DME)kg(cat)(-1) h(-1). The long-term stability test shows a gradual decrease in activity of the hybrid catalyst which is attributed a combination of coke deposition, sintering of Cu-based catalyst and WOx/Al2O3 catalyst and strongly adsorbed water molecules.

AB In the present paper hydrogen production from biomass gasification using various agents is investigated and compared theoretically, from the viewpoints of the first and second thermodynamics laws. Gasification of wood and paper, as two types of common biomass feedstocks, is assessed using four gasification agents namely: air, oxygen-enriched air, oxygen and steam. Thermodynamic equilibrium model is employed to simulate the gasification process, the results of which are validated using available theoretical and experimental data in literature. The NOx and SOx emissions from the biomass gasification are also considered in the model and a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the accuracy of the results regarding to the uncertainties of the input data. A parametric study is conducted to assess the effects of key operating parameters on the hydrogen concentration and calorific value of producer gas, energy and exergy efficiencies of the process and exergy destruction rate at different operating conditions. The results indicate that the higher values of hydrogen production is associated respectively with using steam, oxygen, oxygen-enriched air and air as the gasification agents. Also, it is concluded that for the gasification process the highest value of sensible energy efficiency is obtained for air gasification, while the highest exergy efficiency, as a rational criterion, is obtained for steam gasification for which the calorific value of the producer gas can reach to higher than 11 MJ/Nm(3).

AB The purpose of this work is to develop a magnetically recyclable immobilized lipase for biodiesel production to meet the need of green and clean production. To achieve this, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were encapsulated in graphene oxides (GO), and then employed as a magnetic carrier for the immobilization of lipase from Candida rugosa via the interfacial activation of enzyme on hydrophobic surfaces. By using this immobilization strategy, the activity recovery of 64.9% and enzyme immobilization efficiency of 85.5% could be achieved. The as prepared graphene oxide Fe3O4 nanocomposite (MGO) and immobilized lipase microsphere were fully characterized by means of enzyme activity assays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. It was shown that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successfully encapsulated into the GO, and moreover the lipase was tethered on the magnetic support. The immobilized lipase could efficiently catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol for the production of biodiesel. With this magnetic biocatalyst, the biodiesel yield of 92.8% could be obtained at a temperature of 40 degrees C by three-step addition of methanol in a shaking water bath. The immobilized lipase could be easily recovered by using an external magnetic field, allowing for recycling of the biocatalyst five times without significant loss of its activity.

AB Accurate and robust wind speed forecasting is essential for the planning, scheduling and maintenance of wind power. In this study, a novel wind speed multistep prediction model is proposed by combing the VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition), SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network and ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), in which, the VMD is employed to decompose the original wind speed data into a series of sub-layers; the SSA is adopted to further extract the trend information of all the sub layers; the LSTM network is used to complete the forecasting for the low-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA; and the ELM is used to complete the forecasting for the high-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA. To investigate the multistep prediction performance of the proposed models, eight models are included in the comparisons. The four experiments results show that: (a) among all the involved models, the proposed model has the best multistep prediction performance; (b) compared to the other involved models, the proposed model is more effective and robust in extracting the trend information.

AB In the course of energy conversion, steam turbine is one of the most important equipment, but the wet steam at the low-pressure stage will cause losses. The losses caused by condensing flow not only reduce the efficiency of steam turbine but also influence reliability. This paper firstly numerically investigated the Dykas cascade using the modified model, and compared with the experimental data. The results showed that the modified model had an enormous advantage in predicting the condensing flow. Besides, the advantage was obvious in calculating the pressure distribution of the blade and shock angle emerged in the blade trailing edge. Secondly, a novel dehumidification structure was proposed and the effect was calculated and discussed. The result showed that the novel structure had a positive effect on reducing the nucleation zone and the liquid mass fraction. Besides, the influence of different passage diameters was investigated, the conclusion can be drawn: both the liquid mass fraction of the outlet and the nucleation zone decrease with the increment of the passage diameter. Finally, an improved dehumidification structure which can be easily manufactured was presented and the structure with different phi, was calculated. The results showed that when phi = 0, the dehumidification efficiency was remarkable, and the structure can be easily manufactured. However, the decrement of the liquid mass fraction was inconspicuous with the further increment of phi.

AB Obtaining energy from brown coal is an everlasting pursuit. This study detailed the oil production from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of a low rank American brown coal. The effects of feedstock load (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 g), pyrolysis temperature (550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 degrees C) and heating time (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min) on the oil yields and compounds were also investigated. The results showed that the oil yields obtained were 13.17-22.97 wt% of the brown coal on ash free basis, and it increased initially and then decreased with increasing feedstock load, pyrolysis temperature, and heating time. Light oil and heavy oil accounted for 33.49-65.08 wt% and 34.92-61.94 wt% of the oil yields, and the compound weights were 1.21-5.41 wt% and 90.75-98.14 wt%, respectively. The highest oil yield was achieved at the feedstock load of 50 g, pyrolysis temperature of 700 degrees C and heating time of 20 min, and it was very close to the oil yield at high heating rates of 2000-10,000 degrees C/s for the electrical heating pyrolysis. The results obtained from this study not only detailed the oil yields and compounds obtained from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of a brown coal but also demonstrated the effects of feedstock load, pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the oil production. The results also indicated that microwave-assisted pyrolysis may be a more suitable technology for obtaining oil from brown coals than electrical heating pyrolysis.

AB Numerous studies have indicated that when neither the rate of heat input nor the power output in a thermal power plant is treated as a fixed parameter, minimizing the entropy generation does not lead to an improved thermal efficiency. This article presents a unified approach to resolve this issue by introducing specific entropy generation defined as the total entropy generation rate per unit flowrate of the fuel. A regenerative gas turbine and a combined cycle power plants are chosen for the purpose of discussion. It is found that the thermal efficiency inversely correlates with specific entropy generation, and minimization of specific entropy generation is identical to maximization of thermal efficiency. An illustrative example is presented to show how specific entropy generation can be applied to improve the efficiency of an integrated cycle. The results reveal that 85% of the inefficiencies of the combined cycle studied takes place in the gas turbine cycle. Recovering the thermal energy of the flue gases for both preheating the air and producing the steam within heat recovery steam generator yields 3.5 percentage points more efficiency than the case in which the heat of flue gases is only recovered for producing steam. With this modification, minimum specific entropy generation is dropped from 1489 to 1391 (J/K mole fuel).

AB During the anaerobic digestion (AD) of cellulosic substrate, an economical and environmental friendly pretreatment method should be selected to improve the AD performance. In this study, five pretreatment methods include four traditional pretreatment methods (alkali hydrogen peroxide pretreatment, NaOH pretreatment, HCl pretreatment and hot water pretreatment) and one new developed pretreatment (microaerobic pretreatment) method were selected to study the effects of pretreatment on the AD of Miscanthus floridulus. In addition, preliminary economic analysis of different pretreatment methods was also conducted. Results showed pretreatment could significantly improve the AD performance of Miscanthus. After alkali hydrogen peroxide pretreatment, microaerobic pretreatment, NaOH pretreatment, HCl pretreatment and hot water pretreatment the methane yields of Miscanthus were 41.1%, 25.5%, 18.7%, 15.7% and 10.2% higher than that of untreated sample. Though all these five pretreatment methods could improve the methane yield significantly, their action sites were different. 11202 pretreatment and NaOH pretreatment were efficient in removal lignin from Miscanthus floridulus. Hemicellulose structure was also partly destroyed during H2O2 pretreatment and NaOH pretreatment. HCl pretreatment was efficient in destruction of hemicelluloses structure and partly destroyed the cellulose structure. Microaerobic pretreatment and hot water pretreatment were mainly acted in partly destruction of hemicelluloses and cellulose components. Preliminary economic analysis showed compared with un-pretreated group only microaerobic pretreatment was economically feasible. In addition, compared with other pretreatment methods, microaerobic pretreatment Just needs limited amount of oxygen, which is more environmental friendly.

AB Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery charging is a crucial issue in energy management of electric vehicles. Developing suitable charging patterns, while taking into account of various contradictory objectives and constraints is a key but challenging topic in battery management. This paper develops a model based strategy that optimizes the charging patterns while considers various key parameters such as the charging speed, energy conversion efficiency as well as temperature variations. To achieve this, a battery model coupling both the electric and thermal characteristics is first introduced. Three key but conflicting objectives, including the charging time, energy loss and temperature rise especially for internal temperature, are formulated. Then, multi-objective biogeography based optimization (M-BBO) approaches are employed to search the optimal charging patterns and to balance various objectives with different combinations. Optimization results of four M-BBO approaches are compared, and the Pareto fronts for battery charging with various dual-objectives and triple-objectives are analysed in detail. Experimental results confirm that the developed strategy can offer feasible charging patterns and achieve a desirable trade-off among charging speed, energy conversion efficiency and temperature variations. The Pareto fronts obtained by this strategy can be adopted as references to adjust charging pattern to further satisfy various requirements in different charging applications.

AB Due to the harmful pollution releasing from fossil fuels burning, a growing trend to use renewable energies has been emerged. Nevertheless, using only one renewable energy resource fails to meet electrical power demands on account of its intermittent nature. To overcome this problem, hybrid power plants are developed. The present paper makes an attempt to determine the suitable locations to establish hybrid power plants which can guarantee the feasibility of these systems. Thanks to the availability in the most regions and complementary characteristics, hybrid wind and photovoltaic (PV) systems are taken into account. Geographical and sustainability criteria including economic, social, and environmental aspects are defined to assess the efficiency of candidate locations for hybrid power plant establishment. A novel algorithm utilizing double frontier network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) has been proposed in which both single-period and multi-period programming models are considered. This algorithm sets out to determine the suitable location for hybrid power plant establishment by calculating the efficiency of each candidate locations. Subsequently, the presented approach can rank the candidate locations' priority to establish hybrid power plant. To evaluate the performance of the presented approach, a real case study in Iran is investigated. The results reveal that selected locations are closely nearby cardinal points. On the other hand, selected locations are in neighborhood by the provinces with highest electricity consumptions. Based on these findings, the proposed approach manages to meet decision-makers' expectations.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of renewable microalgae is a potential promising technology for liquid biofuel production. This paper investigated the effect of ultrasonic pre-treatment of microalgae (Spirulina platensis) on HTL products distribution and oil quality. Cell disruption was enhanced with increasing of ultrasonic power and time. Liquefaction was promoted by larger ultrasonic power, but restrained by prolonged pre-processing time. Such promotion was found more pronounced at relatively lower liquefaction temperature. Combined with FT-IR, GC-MS and TG analysis, the ultrasonic pre-treatment increased the compounds at lower boiling point within the biocrude oil. The distillation characters of the hydrothermal oils were more near to the heavy Iraqi crude, with only 22 wt% in distillation zone of diesel.

AB Synthetic manganese-iron mixed oxides are considered promising materials to be used as oxygen carriers for Chemical Looping Combustion of coal with carbon dioxide capture at low cost. The aim of this work was to evaluate a manganese-iron mixed oxide material with a manganese to iron molar ratio of 0.77:0.23 as oxygen carrier for coal combustion by means of chemical looping processes, including both ex-situ and in-situ gasification of coal. The preparation method-spray drying followed by calcination was optimized in order to produce particles with high reactivity and mechanical strength. The material was studied in two continuously operated facilities designed to burn either gaseous or solid fuels. While full combustion was achieved burning syngas, showing the feasibility of the use of this material considering the ex-situ gasification process. Coal combustion efficiency by in-situ gasification process was improved in comparison with other previously tested low-cost materials such as ilmenite and iron ore. Moreover, the oxygen carrier particles showed an interesting magnetic behavior that was able to facilitate oxygen carrier recovery from the purge ash stream. In view of these results, the manganese-iron mixed oxide as oxygen carrier is proposed as a promising candidate for use coal combustion by the chemical looping process.

AB Many plate fin and tube heat exchangers operate under low loads when the flow rate of air and water is low. The flow regime in tubes can change from laminar through transitional to turbulent. In this paper, much attention was paid to determine a semi-empirical correlation for the Nusselt number on the water-side in the transitional and turbulent range when the Reynolds number Re-w is higher than 2300. A new relationship for the friction factor in the transitional flow regime was proposed. The friction factor in the transitional flow range 2300 <= Re-w <= 3000 was obtained by linear interpolation of the friction factor for Re-w = 2300, and Re-w = 3000. The influence of the formula for determining the water-side friction factor in the transitional flow regime on the Nusselt number was shown. Based on experimental data, heat transfer correlations were determined for the air and water-side Nusselt numbers for the low velocity of air and water. The semi-empirical correlation for the Nusselt number on the water-side derived by integrating the Reynolds averaged energy conservation equation for turbulent flow agrees well with the empirical correlation for the Nusselt number. The heat flow rate from hot water to cold air was calculated as a function of the water flow rate using a numerical model of the heat exchanger with the correlation for the water-side Nusselt number developed in the paper to compare it with the results of the measurements. The results of the numerical simulation agree very well with the results of the measurements.

AB In this study, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was employed for thermochemical conversion of energy crop Miscanthus x gigcuiteus GREEF et DEU. The effect of process temperatures, in the range between 180 and 220 degrees C, on the relevant characteristics of the obtained products, hydrochars and process waters, was investigated. The obtained results showed that the HTC promotes fuel properties and energy density of the solids regarding the feedstock. Furthermore, temperature governs the lowering of the volatiles, ash, and moisture in hydrochars, making its potential use as solid fuels more beneficial than the miscanthus. FT-IR spectroscopy and thermal analysis confirmed degradation of hemicellulose at temperatures above 200 degrees C, and an increase of the total content of cellulose and lignin in the hydrochars. In general, hydrochar obtained at 220 degrees C exhibited the best combustion characteristics and is, therefore, the most suitable for use as a solid biofuel. However, in the residual liquids, some amounts of fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were detected. The polluting potential, visible through the growth of TOC, COD and BOD values, of the analyzed process waters, increases with the rise in carbonization temperature. The TOC values (5.8-9.9 gC L-1) were on average lower than those reported for organic wastewaters (> 10 gC L-1). The proportion of hydrocarbons in the process water increases with the increase in the carbonization temperature from 2.92 to 20.9%. Consequently, bioassays with Vibrio fischeri showed a relatively high toxicity of the liquid phase, where a concentration of about 1% was causing bacteria inhibition of 50%.

AB Photo-induced CO2 reforming of CH4 in the presence of H2O over La-modified TiO2 nanoparticles in a continuous flow photoreactor has been investigated. The structure and properties of the catalyst samples, synthesized by a sol-gel method, were systematically characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, CO2-TPD, TGA, N-2-sorption, XPS, UV-Vis DRS and PL spectroscopy. The crystallite size was reduced while, BET surface area and basicity were increased due to the presence of La2O3. The La-modified TiO2 nanocatalysts were tested under different catalyst loading, irradiation time, reaction temperature and type of reductants. The main products detected over La/TiO2 catalysts during photo-induced CO2-CH4 reaction system were CO, H-2 and C2H6. The amount of CO produced over 5 wt.% La/TiO2 was 9.6 fold more the amount of CO produced by pure TiO2. When H2O was added to the CO2-CH4 reaction system, the yield of CO increased 37 fold higher over 5 wt.% La/TiO2 compared to TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic performances can be attributed to the synergistic effect of La2O3 for CO2 adsorption with hindered charge recombination rate by La3+ and appropriate redox potentials. The photocatalytic turnover productivity (PTOP), calculated for the first time, presented amounts of products evolved with the photon energy consumption. The highest PTOP number achieved for CO production using the CO2-CH4-H2O reaction system was 3.83 fold higher than PTOP achieved in CO2-CH4 reaction system. However, PTOP for the production of H-2 and C2H6 in CO2-CH4 system was 1.2 and 2.1 fold higher than the CO2-CH4-H2O reaction system, respectively. The stability test revealed prolonged life time of La/TiO2 in cyclic runs for dynamic CO2-CH4 conversion to fuels in the presence of H2O than using only CO2-CH4 reaction system. Therefore, CO2-CH4 could efficiently be converted to fuels over a La/TiO2 catalyst while the addition of H2O could promote both photoactivity and stability.

AB The combined cooling and power (CCP) system integrating the organic Rankine cycle with the ejector refrigeration cycle is a modern solution for low-grade geothermal water. This paper conducts a quantitative analysis of the off-design performance of a CCP system based on a specially designed combination of a radial inflow turbine, an ejector and plate heat exchangers. The CCP system operating at a vapor split ratio of 0.5 is studied, and a novel preliminary design and off-design simulation process are presented. The sliding pressure operation strategy is used to achieve good off-design performance. The results indicate that the CCP system produces 153.76 kW cooling and has a cooling to net power ratio of 1.58 at the design point. The increasing geothermal water mass flow rate ratio could lower thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and cooling to net power ratio. Higher geothermal water inlet temperature results in lower thermal efficiency. Among the geothermal water inlet temperature, the saturated condensing temperature and the evaporator saturated temperature, the net power is affected mostly by the saturated condensing temperature while the cooling and thermal efficiency are mostly influenced by the evaporator saturated temperature.

AB The present study focuses on the energetic optimization of regenerative Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) configurations. More specifically, three regenerative ORCs are examined. The first includes an open preheater, in which the bleed stream is mixed with the working fluid exiting the pump of the cycle (O-ORC). The other two configurations include a closed preheater. In the second configuration, the bleed stream is throttled and conveyed to the condenser (CB-ORC), while in the third one, it is repressurized via a secondary pump and re circulates into the evaporator of the cycle (CF-ORC). The systems are optimized for different working fluids, and their energetic efficiencies are estimated and compared to that of a standard ORC (S-ORC). In all cases, the inclusion of a recuperator has also been investigated. In principle, recuperative and regenerative ORCs are mostly suitable for dry fluids, while the critical temperature can also have a positive influence on the performance improvement. Furthermore, it is estimated that while the recuperative S-ORC has a higher efficiency than the non-recuperative regenerative cycles, recuperative O-ORC and CF-ORC exhibit a relative efficiency gain ranging from 4.98% to 8.05% and 6.22% to 9.29%, respectively. The highest efficiency improvement achieved by the CB-ORC, however, is minimal.

AB The Reversible Solid Oxide Cell (ReSOC), operating under electrolysis and fuel cell modes, is a promising technology that, thanks to high efficiency and fuel flexibility, can be applied in the development of Electric Energy Storage (EES) systems.
   Several critical issues are required to be addressed, which are specific to ReSOC, such as oxidant electrode performance and reversibility, set of materials, cell/stack design and operating parameters suitable for reversible operation. Moreover, the optimal system design, to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology as well as the Balance of Plant (BoP) components at high operating temperatures, are also challenging factors.
   Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an HEES (Hydrogen-based Electric Energy Storage) system for distributed scale energy storage applications (100-200 kW) by taking into account some of these challenging issues. The proposed system consists of (i) the BoP section needed for the energy storage, (ii) the ReSOC module operating in reversible mode, (iii) the BoP section needed for the energy production.
   In order to guarantee a competitive roundtrip efficiency, the design of the solid oxide cell unit and of the supporting auxiliary systems (BoP components) has been performed without external heat sources for the heating of feeding streams and for the thermal requirements of the ReSOC during its operation in the electrolysis mode.
   The study has been carried out by developing a steady-state thermo-electrochemical model that has been built with a modular architecture. The model, validated by means of experimental data, has been used to assist the system designing and the thermal management optimization to ensure high performances from electric and thermal points of view.
   Results highlight that the proposed system is able to store and use the renewable energy with a roundtrip efficiency of 60%. Moreover, thanks to the optimized thermal integration, additional heat is available for cogeneration purpose, with a cogeneration efficiency of 91%.

AB The Conferences on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) at the beginning of the 21st century have become a significant venue for researchers to meet, and initiate, discuss, share, and disseminate new ideas in various disciplines of sustainable development. In 2002, the first conference was organised in Dubrovnik, Croatia and since then, 10 more successful conferences were realised. Following the success of international conferences in Dubrovnik, the organizing committees decided to organize the main conference and regional conferences all over the world in even years. In 2016, the second regional SDEWES conference, namely the 2nd South East European Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems, was held June 15-18 in Piran/Portorose, Slovenia while the 11th SDEWES conference was organised in Lisbon, Portugal on September 4-8. There were 10 special sessions dedicated to various sustain ability topics organised in both conferences.
   This special issue is based primarily upon a collection of 35 papers selected from among 538 scientific contributions presented at the 2nd SEE and 11th SDEWES Conferences. Moreover, this editorial summarises SDEWES published articles that have addressed and identified problems or provided the background for the research that is reported in the current special issue. The main topics of the selected papers address sustainable combustion technologies, renewable energy sources and sector integration, including the integration of renewable technologies in the urban environment, the integration of heat, cold, electricity and fuel production in buildings and industrial applications, heat exchangers and heat exchanger networks, the development and integration of energy storage for concentrated solar power plants, and sectorial integration of bioenergy resources and biorefineries with a particular focus on system integration for efficient and low-carbon systems.

AB Efficient mining of association rules on a transaction dataset is an interesting and a challenging problem. The state-of-the-art MASP algorithm is dependent on the order of items in the transaction. We propose OOIMASP algorithm, which has two novel properties- 1) order independence and 2) it takes into consideration the origin of items to calculate unbiased support and unbiased confidence values. Order dependence is one of the drawbacks of MASP. OOIMASP addresses this issue by rearranging the items in transactions using a greedy frequency based approach. We compare the performance of our system with MASP on five synthetic data sets and three public data sets. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms the MASP in both the comparison metrics, i.e., the number of association rules generated and the length of the longest association rule. Both these metrics are important to evaluate the performance of an algorithm. On an average, OOIMASP algorithm generates 632% longer rules and 457% more association rules than MASP algorithm. The disadvantage of the proposed algorithm is, it requires more computational resources in terms of time, approximately 5 times more than MASP. We claim that the extra information extracted using our method compensates for the increase in time complexity as compared to MASP, The proposed method produces multiple trees which can be very useful in the visual analysis of data.

ID MODEL
AB Due to the continuous growth of social networks the textual information available has increased exponentially. Data warehouses (DW) and online analytical processing (OLAP) are some of the established technologies to process and analyze structured data. However, one of their main limitations is the lack of automatic processing and analysis of unstructured data (specifically, textual data), and its integration with structured data. This paper proposes the creation, integration and implementation of a new dimension called Contextual Dimension from texts obtained from social networks into a multidimensional model. Such a dimension is automatically created after applying hierarchical clustering algorithms and is fully independent from the language of the texts. This dimension allows the inclusion of multidimensional analysis of texts using contexts and topics integrated with conventional dimensions into business decisions. The experiments were carried out by means of a freeware OLAP system (Wonder 3.0) using real data from social networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose the usage of a hybrid of techniques as complementary tools in decision analysis for learning from failures and the reason behind systems failure. We demonstrate the applicability of these tools through an aviation case study, where an accident investigation report was obtained from the Directorate of Accident Investigation in the Ministry of Transport and Communications in Botswana to provide as a basis for the application of the model. The report included all the factual information required to carry out the investigation using the hybrid of FTA, RBD, AHP, HoQ and the DMG tools.
   We discuss the steps followed in applying the tools in the process of learning from failure. It also shows the importance of such tools in accident investigations by showing the importance of prioritising the available options in order of their importance to the accident under investigation.
   Most of the available research in learning from failure focuses mostly on the direct causal factors of the failure event. Here we provide a holistic approach to learning from failure by focusing on both direct and indirect causes of a failure event through the use of Reliability Engineering tools, Multi Criteria Decision Making tools and House of Quality.

DE Group recommendation; Aggregation method; Upward leveling; Deviation;
   Average; Approval voting
AB The goal of a group recommendation involves providing appropriate information for all members in a group. Most extant studies use aggregation methods to determine group preferences. An aggregation method is an approach that aggregates individual preferences of group members to recommend items to a group. Previous studies on aggregation methods only consider high averages, counts, and rankings to provide recommendations. However, the most important component of a group recommendation involves ensuring that majority of the members in a group are satisfied with the recommended results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the deviation as an important element in aggregation methods. The present study involves proposing an upward leveling (UL) aggregation method that considers deviations for group recommendations. The UL recommends items with low deviations and high averages in conjunction with frequency of positive rating counts for group members. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the UL is validated to perform a comparative evaluation with existing aggregation methods by using the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and diversity. The results indicate that the UL outperforms all the baselines and that the deviation plays an important role in the aggregation method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Facility layout problems (FLPs) are design problems that involve determining the most favorable arrangement of facilities in a given space. The closed loop layout problem (CLLP) is an FLP that employs a closed loop guided configuration. This type of layout is commonly discussed when designing a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The CLLP is concerned with determining the efficient arrangement of manufacturing cells on a central loop based material handling system. Because the material flow between cells must pass through the loop path, distance is not measured in the conventional manner (i.e. the rectilinear or Euclidean distance). The problem is more complicated than a generic FLP because there are additional constraints that restrict cell shape and orientation as well as the positions of the pick-up and drop-off points. In this study, we propose a random-key and cuckoo search (CS) based approach to solve the CLLP. CS is a rather recently developed algorithm, and it has not yet been applied to FLPs in the literature. To evaluate the present algorithm, computational experiments are conducted using benchmark problems from a previous study. The obtained results show the remarkable performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; DEPENDENCY
AB Feature selection based on information theory, which is used to select a group of the most informative features, has extensive application fields such as machine learning, data mining and natural language processing. However, numerous previous methods suffer from two common defects. (1) Feature relevancy is defined without distinguishing candidate feature relevancy and selected feature relevancy. (2) Some interdependent features may be misinterpreted as redundant features. In this study, we propose a feature selection method named Dynamic Relevance and Joint Mutual Information Maximization (DRJMIM) to address these two defects. DRJMIM includes four stages. First, the relevancy is divided into two categories: candidate feature relevancy and selected feature relevancy. Second, according to candidate feature relevancy that is joint mutual information, some redundant features are selected. Third, the redundant features are combined with a dynamic weight to reduce the selection possibility of true redundant features while increasing the false ones. Finally, the most informative and interdependent features are selected and true redundant features are eliminated simultaneously. Furthermore, our method is compared with five competitive feature selection methods on 12 publicly available data sets. The classification results show that DRJMIM performs better than other five methods. Its statistical significance is verified by a paired two-tailed t-test. Meanwhile, DRJMIM obtains few number of selected features when it achieves the highest classification accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lycium ruthenicum Murr. (LR) is a functional food that plays an important role in anti-oxidation due to its high level of phenolic compounds. This study aims to optimize ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of obtained extracts from LR using response surface methodology (RSM). A four-factor-three-level Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed to discuss the following extracting parameters: extraction time (X-1), ultrasonic power (X-2), solvent to sample ratio (X-3) and solvent concentration (X-4). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results revealed that the solvent to sample ratio had a significant influence on all responses, while the extraction time had no statistically significant effect on phenolic compounds. The optimum values of the combination of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities were obtained for X-1 = 30 min, X-2 = 100 W, X-3 = 40 mL/g, and X-4 = 33% (v/v). Five phenolic acids, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, were analyzed by HPLC. Our results indicated that optimization extraction is vital for the quantification of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in LR, which may be contributed to large-scale industrial applications and future pharmacological activities research.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of rosemary essential oil fractions obtained by molecular distillation (MD) and investigate their effect on the oxidative stability of sunflower oil. MD fractions were prepared in a series of low-pressure stages where rosemary essential oil was the first feed. Subsequently, a distillate (D1) and residue (R1) were obtained and the residue fraction from the previous stage used as the feed for the next. The residue fractions had the largest capacity to capture free radicals, and the lowest peroxide values, conjugated dienes and conjugated trienes. The antioxidant activity of the fractions was due to oxygenated monoterpenes, specifically a-terpineol and cis-sabinene hydrate. Oxidative stability results showed the residues (R1 and R4) and butylated hydroxytoluene had greater antioxidant activity than either the distillate fractions or original rosemary essential oil. The residue fractions obtained by short path MD of rosemary essential oil could be used as a natural antioxidants by the food industry.

AB Method development for monitoring economically motivated food adulteration is pivotal for preventing health problems caused by illegal food additives. In this work, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied for the detection and mapping of adulterated prawns injected with different hydrocolloids including gelatin, carrageenan, agar, amorophophallus konjac and xanthan gum. The characteristic T-2 fitting curves were obtained which can be used to tell apart adulterated prawns from normal ones. Furthermore, the benefit from high quality LF-MRI images showed the major accumulation site of the hydrocolloids injected in prawn. The location of these injections was mainly confined to well resolved accumulation in brain region and three following subtle sites: back, tail and claws. Different hydrocolloids can be successfully distinguished in adulterated prawns with principal component analysis. Therefore, rapid, non-invasive and low-cost LF-NMR technique offers a powerful tool for the identification of hydrocolloids adulteration in real-time.

AB The sn-2 fatty acid composition of 180 commercial infant, follow-on and growing-up formulas with three fat sources (plant oil, cows' milk and goats' milk) was investigated and compared with mature human milk (MHM). Sn-2 fatty acids in formulas were mostly dependent on fat source and stage. Compared with MHM, all types of formulas contained lower levels of palmitic acid (PA), saturated fatty acid and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), and higher levels of oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (LNA) at the sn-2 position. Even some formulas were supplemented with 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoylglycerol, the proportions of relative PA at the sn-2 position in formulas were much lower than that in MHM. Moreover, formulas had higher proportions of relative OA, LA and LNA, and lower LC-PUFAs at the sn-2 position. This study indicated that there were significant differences in the positional distribution of fatty acids between formulas and MHM.

AB Cereal-associated Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are well known for homopolymeric exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. Herein, the structure of an EPS isolated from sourdough isolate Lactobacillus brevis E25 was determined. A modified BHI medium was used for production of EPS-E25 in order to eliminate potential contaminants. Analysis of sugar monomers in EPS revealed that glucose was the only sugar present. Structural characterisation of EPS by NMR and methylation analysis revealed that E25 produced a highly branched a-glucan with (alpha 1 -> 3) and (alpha 1 -> 6) glycosidic linkages, and was similar in structure to a previously reported EPS from Lactobacillus reuteri 180. The H-1 and C-13 NMR data were contrasted with newly recorded data for known polysaccharides (alternan, commercial dextran) which also contain alpha-(1,3,6) Glc branch points. It was found in both E25 EPS and alternan that NMR parameters could be used to distinguish glucose residues that had the same substitution pattern but occupied different positions in the structure.

AB The concentrations of 10 minerals were investigated in the grain of 12 durum wheat genotypes grown under free air CO2 enrichment conditions, and in four of their derived pasta samples, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared to ambient CO2 (400 ppm; AMB), under elevated CO2 (570 ppm; ELE), the microelement and macro-element contents showed strong and significant decreases in the grain: Mn, - 28.3%; Fe, - 26.7%; Zn, - 21.9%; Mg, -22.7%; Mo, - 40.4%; K, - 22.4%; and Ca, - 19.5%. These variations defined the 12 genotypes as sensitive or non-sensitive to ELE. The pasta samples under AMB and ELE showed decreased mineral contents compared to the grain. Nevertheless, the contributions of the pasta to the recommended daily allowances remained relevant, also for the micro-elements under ELE conditions (range, from 18% of the recommended daily allowance for Zn, to 70% for Mn and Mo).

ID HRM ANALYSIS
AB Sea buckthorn (Hippophae), an ancient crop with modern virtues, is increasingly consumed in source of foods and nutraceuticals. The growing demand leads to the adulteration of commercial sea buckthorn products, which is a common form of food fraud. Herein, a high resolution melting assay, targeting a DNA barcoding region of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) (Bar-HRM) was developed to identify the seven native Chinese Hippophae species, and to authenticate commercial sea buckthorn products. Melting data from the HRM assay demonstrated that all Hippophae species could be clearly distinguished. Then, application to commercial sea buckthorn products indicated the existence of adulterants or contamination, further confirmed using Sanger sequencing results for PCR products from HRM. The Bar-HRM technique proposed in this work could provide a method for regulatory agencies, promoting consumers trust, and raise the quality and safety of sea buckthorn products.

Whole digest and fractions > 10, 5-10, and < 5 kDa caused cytotoxicity to Caco-2, HT-29, HCT-116 human colon cancer cells, and reduced inflammatory response caused by lipopolysaccharide in macrophages RAW 264.7. Antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects were generally higher in 5-10 kDa fractions. This fraction was further purified by semi-preparative chromatography and characterised by HPLC-MS/MS. The most potent fraction was mainly composed of beta-conglycinin and glycinin fragments rich in glutamine. This is the first report on the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects of newly isolated and identified peptides from germinated soybean released during gastrointestinal digestion. These findings highlight the potential of germination as a process to obtain functional foods or nutraceuticals for colon cancer prevention.

AB In the present study, a targeted regulation of hygroscopicity of soybean antioxidant pentapeptide (SAP) powder was explored by zinc ions binding to its moisture absorption sites. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope were used to confirm the formation of the SAP-zinc complex. The results showed that morphology of SAP-zinc complex belonged to crystalline nanoparticles. The moisture sorption/desorption kinetics of the SAP-zinc complex changed compared to that of the SAP. In particular, the moisture sorption capacity of the SAP decreased and the distribution of adsorbed water changed after zinc chelation. Based on the binding of zinc ions to the moisture absorption sites, the hygroscopicity of SAP powder could be target regulated. Thus, this study could provide a new method to regulate the hygroscopicity of peptide powder.

AB Ostwald ripening is a major destabilization mechanism for emulsions containing flavor oils with relatively high water solubilities. Emulsions with different oil phase compositions were prepared that were stabilized by polyoxyethylene alkyl ether-type emulsifiers with differently sized hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Emulsions prepared using only orange oil were highly unstable to Ostwlad ripening during storage. When emulsifier concentration was increased, Ostawald ripening in emulsions containing emulsifiers with small hydrophilic groups was inhibited, while size increment of droplets in emulsions containing emulsifiers with large hydrophilic groups was not. Droplet enlargement was effectively inhibited by incorporating corn oil into the oil phase prior to homogenization. However, the concentration of corn oil required to inhibit Ostwald ripening varied depending on the structural characteristics and concentrations of the emulsifiers present. These results could have important implications for the selection of emulsifiers to improve the physical stability of orange oil emulsions for use in the food and beverage industries.

AB This study attempts at uniting the analysis of four different classes of contaminants for both liquid and solid tea samples. A total of 32 compounds, classified as pesticides, mycotoxins, process-induced toxicants or packaging contaminants, were carefully chosen for their diversity of structures and physicochemical properties. The proposed method combines a sample treatment strategy coming from metabolomics with liquid chromatography analysis using a silica bonded C18-pentafluorophenyl column coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. For tea brew, dilute and shoot method provides good quantification (70-120% recoveries and < 20% RSD) for more than 80% of compounds. For tea leaves, strong matrix effects are observed, thus, matrix-matched calibration is required to reach good performances, i.e. 63% of compounds quantified and 81% detected at 10 mu g/kg. Finally, method performances were evaluated against existing regulations, and it appears that 69% of contaminants are quantified and 91% detected at levels lower than their respective European regulation limits.

AB Coacervation and phase separation were first reported in salt-free catanionic surfactant aqueous systems based on lauric acid (LA) and dodecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (DTAOH), using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a coacervate-inducing agent. The liquid-liquid two-phase separation occurs over a wide of LA/DTAOH molar ratios (78:22-0:100 mol/mol) and total surfactant concentrations (5-200 mmol L-1) upon adding a small amount of HFIP (< 10%, v/v). HFIP-induced salt-free LA/DTAOH catanionic surfactant system has much wider two-phase region than HFIP-induced salt-containing sodium laurate/dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide system. A HFIP-induced LA/DTAOH coacervate extraction method was established and coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV) for determination of fluoroquinolones (rufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin) in milk. Detection limits are from 0.3 ng mL(-1) to 1.4 ng mL(-1). Intra-and inter-day precisions (n = 6) are in range of 4.5-8.3% and 5.8-10.7%, respectively. Recoveries are from 87.8% to 109.0%. The method, HFIP-induced salt-free coacervate extraction with HPLC-UV, is suitable for detecting trace fluoroquinolones in milk.

AB Channel catfish skin is a by-product from catfish fillet production. Collagens were extracted from catfish skins by: (1) acid; (2) homogenization-aided; and (3) pepsin-aided extraction methods. Kinetic analysis of extraction was performed. SDS-PAGE was carried out for all collagens extracted under different conditions. Protein solubility, zeta potential, circular dichroism and gel strength of the collagen extracted by three methods were studied to determine optimal extraction conditions. Protein recovery rate from minced skins extracted with pH 2.4 HCl containing 23.6 KU/g pepsin was the highest (64.19%). SDS-PAGE showed that collagens extracted with different methods had different proteins ratio patterns, even though the molecular mass of collagen subunits were similar, 123 and 113 KDa for alpha(1) and alpha(2) chains, 226 KDa for beta chain and 338.5 KDa for gamma chain, respectively. Channel catfish skin collagens were typical type I collagens and could have applications in food, medical and cosmetic industries.

AB Seafood provides a range of health benefits due to its high-protein level. In this study, the osteogenic effect of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) protein hydrolysates (BMPH) on osteoblast differentiation were examined using mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). A preparation we called BMPH < 1 kDa which showed the highest osteogenic effect in MSCs, was prepared by peptic hydrolysis. BMPH < 1 kDa treatment stimulated osteoblast differentiation with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) induction, osteocalcin and type I collagen activity as well as calcium deposition. Osteoblast differentiation stimulated by BMPH < 1 kDa treatment was achieved by expression of osteogenic lineage markers, such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and downstream signal and transcription factors, including p-Smad1/5/8, Dlx5, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osterix. BMPH < 1 kDa activated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Adding noggin, a BMP antagonist, inhibited BMPH < 1 kDa-induced ALP activity in MSCs. Taken together, our results show that BMPH < 1 kDa promoted osteoblast differentiation by activating BMP-2.

AB Thermal stability and gel quality of myofibrillar protein were evaluated with regard to the addition of native soy protein isolates (SPI) and SPI subjected to acidic pH and mild heating (modified SPI). Compared with the control, the addition of modified SPI increased the compression force of the protein gel and decreased water loss (P < 0.05). Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that an addition of 0.75% native SPI decreased the first transition temperature (P < 0.05), and addition of 0.5% and 0.75% modified SPI exhibited no appreciable changes on it (P > 0.05), indicating that a higher concentration of modified SPI would not damage the protein thermal stability. Moreover, the addition of modified SPI enhanced hydrogen bonding and disulphide linkages. Atomic force microscopy analysis revealed that the addition of modified SPI decreased the roughness of the mixed myofibrillar protein gels. Overall, modified SPI has the potential to improve myofibrillar protein gel texture and water holding capacity.

AB Determining amylose content in rice with near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, associated with a suitable multivariate regression method, is both feasible and relevant for the rice business to enable Process Analytical Technology applications for this critical factor, but it has not been fully exploited. Due to it being time-consuming and prone to experimental errors, it is urgent to develop a low-cost, nondestructive and ` on-line' method able to provide high accuracy and reproducibility. Different rice varieties and specific chemometrics tools, such as partial least squares (PLS), interval-PLS, synergy interval-PLS and moving windows-PLS, were applied to develop an optimal regression model for rice amylose determination. The model performance was evaluated by the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the correlation coefficient (R). The high performance of the siPLS method (R = 0.94; RMSEP = 1.938; 8941-8194 cm(-1); 5592-5045 cm(-1); and 4683-4335 cm-1) shows the feasibility of NIR technology for determination of the amylose with high accuracy.

AB The determination of iron in fortified foods is mandatory by many global regulatory agencies. However, the spectroscopic techniques require elevated investments limiting their applicability especially in developing countries. Therefore, simple, viable and analytical methods with sufficient sensitivity can become an alternative. In this work, a sensitive, simple and viable spectrophotometry method to determine iron in wheat and maize flours was developed following a cloud point extraction (CPE) procedure. The analyte was first complexed with 2-(5-Bromine-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol (Br-PADAP) in the presence of the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114). For the CPE optimization the variables: pH of the medium, stoichiometry of the complex, surfactant, and salt concentrations were evaluated. Linearity in the analytical blank was obtained by using the square root of absorbance (Abs) in order to adjust the residues of the curve. The precision was lower than 5% and the accuracy ranged from 97 to 101%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.004 mu g mL(-1) and 0.01 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The method was applied to investigate the content of iron in 14 brands of fortified flours. The concentrations of iron varied from 0.435 to 3.62 mg/100 g and 0.570 to 3.15 mg/100 g in wheat and maize flour, respectively. The content of iron in all brands investigated in this study was approximately 10-fold lower than the value required by (ANVISA). The amount of iron in fortified foods was satisfactorily determined by using a simple, sensitive, and low cost spectrophotometric method.

AB Okra is a widely accepted vegetable in subtropical and tropical regions due to the good palatability. However, the polysaccharide compositions remain unclear. In this work, the water extract of okra pod was prepared and the leading polysaccharide fraction was purified. The precise structural characteristics were identified. It was a polysaccharide "rhamnogalacturonan" as shown below, and the structure was different to previously reported rhamnogalacturonans. The hypoglycemic effect of rhamnogalacturonan was determined in vivo. By comparing with streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice group, the high-dose group showed decreased blood glucose level and glucose tolerance. The body weight of all groups were not significantly different. The results indicated that the rhamnogalacturonan was responsible for the hypoglycemic effect of okra.

AB The chemical and biological properties of carotenoids in the freshwater alga Oedogonium intermedium were investigated in this study. Carotenoids were extracted from the alga by dichloromethane and purified by saponification. The carotenoid content was determined both spectrometrically and by HPLC, the carotenoids identified by HPLC-PDA-APCI-IT-TOF-MS and the extracts analysed for several health-related bioactivities. The crude and saponified extracts contained 3,411.2 +/- 20.7 and 2,929.6 +/- 5.9 mu g carotenoids/g dry algal biomass, respectively. Seven major carotenoids were identified, namely neoxanthin, 9 '-cis-neoxanthin, loroxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, which were present in similar amounts in the alga. Both the crude and saponified carotenoid extracts exhibited significant antioxidant activities as well as potent inhibitory effects against several metabolically important enzymes including alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase and hyaluronidase, but they were poor inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Oedogonium could be an important new source of carotenoids, specifically loroxanthin, which is lacking in terrestrial plants.

AB Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) have attracted much research interest recently due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, practical utilization of SNPs is generally restricted due to their weak colloid stability and reduced functionality. In this work, SNPs were functionally modified by sodium hypochlorite (1-5% active chlorine based on dry SNPs weight). The degree of modification, particle size, stability, and adsorption characteristics of the SNPs were systematically investigated. The results showed that as the active chlorine concentration increased, the carbonyl and carboxyl contents increased to 0.150% and 0.855%, respectively. Compared with SNPs, the zeta potential value of SNPs modified with 5% active chlorine increased significantly (p < 0.05) from -13 to -31 mV and the dispersion stability of modified SNPs was remarkably improved. Moreover, modified SNPs exhibited high adsorption capacities for Pb2+ and Cu2+, suggesting that they could be employed as a novel absorbent for removal of heavy metal ions.

AB An integrated membrane process for the recovery and concentration of phytotherapeutics in broccoli juice was investigated to develop a natural product that could be of interest for food and/or pharmaceutical industry. Following a pretreatment step to remove suspended solids, the juice was ultrafiltered through a 50 kDa MWCO polyethersulfone membrane. The permeate stream was further concentrated by osmotic distillation up to 42.6 degrees Brix. During ultrafiltration, a complete recovery of sulforaphane, malic acid and citric acid was achieved, where total phenolic content and ascorbic acid were recovered at a ratio of 94.5 and 92.4%, respectively. All the bioactive compounds identified in broccoli juice was well preserved during subsequent 6-fold concentration by osmotic distillation. No significant difference was observed in total antioxidant activity of the juice throughout the operation. The proposed integrated membrane process has shown promising potential to produce a natural concentrate enriched in phytotherapeutics of the broccoli juice.

AB In the current study, we introduce magnetic solid phase microextraction coupled with electrochemical detection of caffeine. A commercially available disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with poly Alizarin Red S are employed as electrochemical sensors in the detection stage. However, the suitability of magnetic solid phase microextraction for electroanalytical methods such as square wave voltammetry has not been declared. With our optimised conditions in hand, the system response was linearly proportional to the concentration of caffeine in the range of 0.5-20 mu M with a correlation coefficient of about 0.9987. The detection limit of the sensing system was found to be 0.05 mu M (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3). At the end of the study, the suitability of this new procedure for the analysis of energy drink, soft drink, and chocolate milk samples was demonstrated.

AB Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and chemometrics were employed to detect the adulteration of camellia oil (CAO) with 3 different cheap vegetable oils. With the intensity of 15 selected H-1 NMR signals as input variables, principal component analysis (PCA) showed good group clustering results for pure and nonpure CAO, but unsatisfied identification accuracy for the adulterated oil types, indicating relatively small difference among those oils. Whereas these difference could be revealed by orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), with identification accuracy higher than 90%. Partial least squares (PLS) was further applied for the prediction of adulteration level in CAO. With less than 6 variables screened out by variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores as potential key markers, the developed PLS models showed better accuracy. The prediction results for 10 hold-out samples also confirmed that this method was accurate and fast for the detection of CAO adulteration.

AB The digestibility and structural changes of rice starch induced by heat-moisture treatment (HMT) were investigated, and the relationships among the moisture content-starch structure-starch digestibility were revealed. HMT could simultaneously disorder and reassemble the rice starch molecules across multi-scale lengths and convert some fractions of rapidly-digestible starch (RDS) into slowly-digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). In particular, the HMT rice starch with less than 30% moisture content showed a higher SDS+ RS content (25.0%). During HMT, SDS and RS were preferably formed by the degraded starch molecules with M-w between 4 x 10(5) and 4 x10(6) g/mol, single helices and amylose-lipids complexes that were formed by degraded starch chains with higher thermal stability and crystalline lamellae with greater thicknesses. Thus, our research suggests a potential approach using HMT to control the digestion of starch products with desired digestibility.

AB Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was applied in a vineyard on leaves and grape clusters of cv Sangiovese to test its ability to stimulate the production of aromas and identify the main genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways switched on by the elicitor.
   MeJA application led to a delay in grape technological maturity and a significant increase in the concentration of several berry aroma classes (about twice the total aroma: from around 3 to 6 mu g/g of berry). Of these, monoterpenes showed the most significant increase. An analysis of the expression of terpenoid bio-synthesis genes confirmed that the MeJA application activated the related biosynthetic pathway. The expression of all the TPS genes analyzedwas higher in samples treated with MeJA. Also the wines produced by microvinification of Sangiovese treated and untreated grapes showed a rise in the aroma concentration as in berries, with an important impact on longevity and sensorial characters of wines.

AB This work deals with the study of the release kinetics of some natural antioxidants (ferulic acid, caffeic acid and tyrosol) from chitosan-fish gelatin edible films immersed ethanol at 96%, as well as the kinetics of their antioxidant activity using the DPPH assay. The aim was to determine how film functional properties influence the release kinetic and antioxidant activity. The addition of antioxidants to chitosan-fish gelatin matrix decreased the water vapour permeability by more than 30%. The tensile strength (TS) increased up to 50% after the incorporation of antioxidants. Some molecular interactions between polymer chains and antioxidants were confirmed by FTIR where spectra displayed a shift of the amide-III peak. Films containing caffeic acid or a caffeic-ferulic acid mixture exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity, leading to a 90% antioxidant activity at equilibrium but the release rate controlled the efficacy of the system.

AB The thermal and oxidative stability of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) in aqueous dispersions containing beta-cyclodextrin (CD), native high amylose (HA) and octenylsuccinylated high amylose (OS) starches (0.1% ALA and 1.0% CD or starch solids) were compared. Both native and modified starches increased the stability of ALA against thermal degradation and oxidation at higher degrees than CD. The OS was more effective in stabilizing ALA than HA. The ALA loss in the dispersions occurred mainly in the supernatant, suggesting that the complex formation of ALA with amylose played a key role in the stabilization. In an in vitro digestion test, the release of ALA from OS dispersion was less than that of HA dispersion, indicating that ALA complexed with OS amylose was most stable against digestion. The octenylsuccinylated high amylose starch was an effective protecting agent for ALA in aqueous media, as well as a delivery carrier for ALA in digestive tract.

AB The impact of emulsifier type (quillaja saponin, Tween 80, whey protein and casein) and antioxidant type (EDTA, ascorbic acid, catechin, alpha tocopherol, ascorbic acid palmitate) on the physical and chemical stability of lutein-fortified emulsions was investigated. Quillaja saponin produced emulsions with the best overall stability to droplet aggregation, creaming, and colour fading during storage at 45 degrees C for ten days. The impact of antioxidant type on the stability of lutein-fortified emulsions prepared using quillaja saponin was therefore investigated further. The extent of droplet aggregation and creaming was largely independent of antioxidant type. Surprisingly, most of the antioxidants promoted lutein degradation. Only ascorbic acid showed some ability to inhibit colour fading during storage, although EDTA had some inhibitory effects in the early stages of storage. This study suggests that lutein-enriched emulsions prepared using quillaja saponin as an emulsifier and ascorbic acid as an antioxidant may be the most suitable as delivery systems.

AB A total of 105 yeast isolates was obtained from 15 sourdough samples collected from different regions in China and subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) analysis. Six species were identified including Pichia membranifaciens, which has not previously been reported in Chinese sourdoughs. Different species of yeast were used in single-culture fermentation to make Chinese steamed bread (CSB). The volatiles of the CSB were captured by solid-phase microextraction method, separated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In total, 41 volatile compounds were found in all the steamed breads. All CSBs showed a similar volatile profile; however, significant differences in the quantity of some volatile compounds were seen among the CSB fermented by different yeast species. A partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that the CSBs could be separated by their characteristic volatile profiles. The study suggested that the aromatic properties of CSB are determined by the yeast used.

AB The digestibility and molecular structure of corn starch mixed with amino acid modified by low-pressure treatment (LPT) was investigated. Amino acid induced a significant increase in the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and decrease in the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) after LPT. The reason is the formation of ester bond between the molecular chains of amino acid and starch. Low pressure treatment altered greatly the morphology of corn starch mixed with or without amino acid. After LPT, less ordered Maltese and more granule fragments were observed for starch-amino acid complex. An increase in size distribution was obvious after LPT and the size distribution curves provided from a new variety. We found that higher enthalpy and relative crystallinity of the starch-amino acid complex were associated with a higher SDS content. It can be inferred that LPT had a greater impact on the digestion and structural characterization of corn starch mixed with amino acids.

AB The changes in cooking quality and phenolic composition of whole black and red rice grains stored during six months at different temperatures were evaluated. Brown rice with known cooking quality properties and low phenolic levels was used for purposes comparison. All rice genotypes were stored at 13% moisture content at temperatures of 16, 24, 32, and 40 degrees C. Cooking time, hardness, free and bound phenolics, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and free radical scavenging capacity were analysed. The traditional rice with brown pericarp exhibited an increase in cooking time and free phenolics content, while rice with black pericarp exhibited a reduction in cooking time after six months of storage at the highest studied temperature of 40 degrees C. There as increases in ferulic acid levels occurred as a function of storage temperature. Red pericarp rice grains showed decreased antioxidant capacity against ABTS radical for the soluble phenolic fraction with increased time and storage temperature.

AB The effects of CaSO4-induced pre-aggregation on the rheological and structural properties of soy protein isolate (SPI) emulsion gels were investigated. As the Ca2+ concentration during pre-aggregation increased (from 0 mM to 7.5 mM), the elastic modulus of the gels showed substantial increase, indicating stiffer gel structures. Largedeformation rheology suggested stronger but more brittle networks formed at higher Ca2+ concentration during pre-aggregation. However, when the pre-aggregated Ca2+ concentration reached 10 mM, the corresponding gel became weaker. Water-holding capacity (WHC) of the gels were significantly improved via the pre-aggregation process. The differences in rheological properties and WHC among the gels were consistent with the variation in their microstructures. Pre-aggregation helped to form denser and more uniform structures with thicker strands, whereas over aggregation made the gel network coarser.

AB The impact of co-fermenting white grape pomace (WP) and red grape pomace (RP) on the composition of interspecific hybrid wine was studied using the Vitis sp. 'Frontenac' and 'Vidal'. The proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin content of the resulting wines were analysed by HPLC-fluorescence and UPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The CIELAB parameters and volatile compounds were analysed using spectrophotometry-UV and GC-MS-SPME, respectively. The WP addition increased the concentration of monomeric and oligomeric flavan-3-ols, and terpenes in the wines. The manipulation of the WP/RP ratio efficiently modulated the anthocyanin profile of the wines, resulting in faded red colour, a desirable achievement in hybrid red wine, which is usually perceived as too dark. An appropriate ratio (30% RP/6% WP) improved the colour stability of the wines without a significant impact on wine colour. Addition of WP proved to be a suitable tool to modulate the colour, the phenolic and volatile composition of interspecific hybrid wine.

AB Bovine serum albumin (BSA)/curcumin binding and dye photodegradation stability were evaluated. BSA/curcumin complex showed 1:1 stoichiometry, but the thermodynamic binding parameters depended on the technique used and BSA conformation. The binding constant was of the order of 10(5)L.mol(-1) by fluorescence and microcalorimetric, and 10(3) and 10(4) L.mol(-1) by surface plasmon resonance (steady-state equilibrium and kinetic experiments, respectively). For native BSA/curcumin, fluorescence indicated an enthalpic and entropic driven process based on the standard enthalpy change (Delta H-F(Omicron) = -8.67 kJ.mol(-1)), while microcalorimetry showed an entropic driven binding process (Delta H-cal(Omicron) = 29.11 kJ.mol(-1)). For the unfolded BSA/curcumin complex, it was found thatp Delta H-F(Omicron) = -16.12 kJ.mol(-1) and Delta H-cal(Omicron) = -42.63 kJ.mol(-1). BSA (mainly native) increased the curcumin photodegradation stability. This work proved the importance of using different techniques to characterize the protein-ligand binding.

AB 'Friar' plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) fruit were stored at low (0 degrees C), intermediate (5 and 15 degrees C) and ambient temperature (25 degrees C). Flesh translucency was evidenced as the main chilling injury (CI) symptom and the CI developed rapidly at 5 and 15 degrees C but suppressed at 0 degrees C. Modifications of cell wall pectin in 'Friar' plums were investigated during storage. Sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (SSP) was found to be predominant in the fruit but it decreased more rapidly at 5 and 15 degrees C than 0 degrees C. Nevertheless, SSP possessed abundant galactose, arabinose and rhamnose at 5 and 15 degrees C. Nanostructural observations indicated that the detachment and degradation of linear backbone chains in SSP molecules were enhanced at 5 and 15 degrees C. Therefore, the development of CI of ` Friar' plums at intermediate temperatures was associated with the modifications of SSP in the cell wall pectin of the fruit subjected to chilling stress.

AB An instant coffee fraction, rich in arabinogalactans, obtained by ultrafiltration, using 1 and 5 kDa membranes, has previously shown in vitro stimulatory activity on BALB/c mice spleen B lymphocytes. The compounds inducing lymphocytic activation were shown to elute, mainly near the void volume by size-exclusion chromatography, using Bio-Gel P6 (1-6 kDa). Treatment of the compounds with chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, did not affect the induced B lymphocyte activation. On the contrary, hydrolysis with an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, removing single terminally-linked arabinose residues, decreased the extent of B cell activation. The immunostimulatory activity of these compounds was also observed by in vitro experiments, using bone marrowderived macrophages and dendritic cells as responders. Altogether, these results show the relevance of single arabinose residues, present at the non-reducing end of polymeric compounds, to the coffee stimulatory activity in cells mediating innate and acquired immunity.

AB Collagen and collagen hydrolysate (CH) was recovered from the bone and skin containing sediment residue emerging during pH-n(shift-n(based protein isolation from silver carp. Hydrolysis resulted in higher yield (15.1-15.4%) compared to collagen isolation by acid or pepsin (3.1-5.9%) (p< 0.05). Isolated collagens were characterized as type I and maintained their triple-n(helical structure, confirmed by SDS-n(PAGE and FTIR. Pepsinhydrolysis and sequential hydrolysis by pepsin and trypsin hydrolyzed all heavy molecular weight chains of collagen but sequential hydrolysis yielded higher degree of hydrolysis. When CH was added to a silver carp protein isolate prior to gelation, the gel behavior was dependent on molecular weight of the added CH. More hydrolyzed collagen emerging from sequential hydrolysis improved water holding capacity of the gel while reducing its breaking force. Thus, residue from pH-n(shift processing of fish can be used for isolation of high quality collagen/CH and provides a promising basis for a multiple-product fish biorefinery.

AB 'Afourer' mandarins were stored in air containing ethylene at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mu L L-1 at 20, 10, 5 and 0 degrees C and changes in a range of external and internal quality parameters were examined for up to 10 weeks in storage. At all storage temperatures, reducing ethylene concentration in the storage environment decreased the rate of respiration, visible deterioration of the calyx region, ethanol accumulation in the juice, loss of eating quality, and at chilling temperatures reduced rind pitting. The quality attributes limiting mandarin storage life differed between the different storage temperatures but retention of mandarin quality was always optimised by maintaining the lowest possible ethylene atmosphere around fruit. Thus, the primary target should be to ensure the ethylene levels are = 0.01 mu L L-1, as loss of quality was accelerated above this concentration.

AB "Brett character" is a negative sensory attribute acquired by red wines when contaminating Dekkera/ Brettanomyces yeasts produce 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol, known as volatile phenols (VPs), from cinnamic acid precursors. In this study, chitins and chitosans with different structural features, namely deacetylation degree (5-91%) and molecular weight (24-466 kDa) were used for the reduction of this sensory defect. Chitins and chitosans decreased 7-26% of the headspace abundance of VPs without changing their amounts in wines. The efficiency of reduction increased with the deacetylation degree and applied dose. Reduction of headspace abundance of VPs by chitosans enabled significant decreases in the negative phenolic and bitterness attributes and increased positive fruity and floral attributes. Results show that chitosan with high deacetylation degrees, including fungal chitosan, which is already approved for use in wines, is an efficient approach for reducing the negative sensory impact of VPs in red wines.

AB L-theanine (L-Th), a non-protein amino acid present in tea, is a valuable nutraceutical product with unique health benefits and used as an additive in food industry. L-Th enhances the umami taste but its use is limited due to its inadequate production. Different extraction approaches from tea shoots, chemical synthesis to microbial transformation have been tried to meet its demand. In vitro, in vivo as well as clinical studies have shown its positive effect in regulating CNS disorders. L-Th has become choice ingredient in CNS active products due to its anti-stress and neuroprotective role in dementias particularly in retrogression of Alzheimer's. L-Th biochemically modulates various anti-neoplastic agents by increasing their bioavailability in tumour cells. The review, is an effort to condense the recent research on L-Th highlighting its biological resource, plausible role in tea plant, production approaches, its physiological role on human health and future prospects.

AB Ferule gummosa is a well-known medicinal and industrial plant for its oleo-gum-resin named galbanum. So far, there is no information about the role of miRNAs on the production of terpenes as the major secondary metabolite of galbanum. In the present study, RNA-seq data on the root and flower of the plant were used to predict miRNAs and their targets using computational approaches. Additionally, biological network analyses were used to unravel the direct or indirect regulatory effects of miRNAs on the targets involved in terpene biosynthesis. For the first time, 220 miRNAs from 94 families have been reported in F. gummosa. miR5658, miR1533, miR5021, miR414, and miR1436 are the top five miRNAs with high abundance. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the identified targets showed that in the biological process category, the miRNA-regulated genes were highly involved in transcription. According to the KEGG and PlantCyc results, six miRNAs from five miRNA families including miR2919, miR5251, miR838, miR5021, and miR5658 were found to be related to the pathway of terpene biosynthesis. Moreover, network analysis showed that three terpene-regulating TFs namely SPL7, SPL11, and ATHB13 are putatively regulated by three miRNAs including miR1533, miR5021, and miR5658 respectively. Differential gene expression results showed that the expression levels of these miRNAs are negatively correlated to the expression levels of both TFs and their co-expressed terpene biosynthesis genes.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB SOX2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot), a long noncoding RNA (IncRNA), was initially found a close concomitant expression pattern of SOX2 gene. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the relatively upregulated Sox2ot could be observed in different types of cancer tissues and effectively promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vitro. In the present study, we aimed to detect the crucial prognostic role of Sox2ot in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients' clinicopathologic features and evaluated the correlation between Sox2ot expression and CCA patients overall survival. 58 CCA patients who underwent surgical treatment were recruited for the investigation. Sox2ot expression levels estimated by the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that both clinical tissues and cell lines possessed the overexpressed states and the upregulation of Sox2ot significantly associated with lymph node invasion (p = 0.0308), TNM stage (p = 0.0072) and postoperative recurrence (p = 0.0019). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed a strong association between Sox2ot and overall survival (OS) and multivariate analysis confirmed this finding. Furthermore, the proliferation, migration and invasion assays were carried out with RBE and QBC939 cell lines and the knockdown of Sox2ot in all experiments could remarkably decrease malignant biological behaviors. Taken together, IncRNA Sox2ot indicates an unfavorable prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutics target for CCA patients.

AB Poor water solubility and poor bioavailability are problems with many pharmaceuticals. Increasing surface area by micronization is an effective strategy to overcome these problems, but conventional techniques often utilize solvents and harsh processing, which restricts their use. Newer, green technologies, such as supercritical fluid (SCF)-assisted particle formation, can produce solvent-free products under relatively mild conditions, offering many advantages over conventional methods. The antisolvent properties of the SCFs used for microparticle and nanoparticle formation have generated great interest in recent years, because the kinetics of the precipitation process and morphologies of the particles can be accurately controlled. The characteristics of the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technique make it an ideal tool for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of poorly watersoluble drugs. This review article focuses on SCFs and their properties, as well as the fundamentals of overcoming poorly water-soluble drug properties by micronization, crystal morphology control, and formation of composite solid dispersion nanoparticles with polymers and/or surfactants. This article also presents an overview of the main aspects of the SAS-assisted particle precipitation process, its mechanism, and parameters, as well as our own experiences, recent advances, and trends in development.

AB Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was previously recognized for its intestinal anti-inflammatory activities and it has been shown less abundant in patients with chronic intestinal diseases. However, the main problems encountered in the use of this interesting anaerobic microorganism are firstly its high sensitivity to the oxygen and secondly, its ability to reach the large intestine alive as targeted site. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of direct compression on the viability of this probiotic strain after different compression pressure and storage using three different excipients (MCC, HPMC and HPMCP). The effect of compression process on cell viability was studied and a strategy was proposed to improve probiotic viability. Results showed that cell viability decreased almost linearly with compression pressure. MCC and HPMC seemed the most favorable carriers and after storage, each tablet exhibited a survival above 10(8) CFU. Storage stability was obtained with a pressure of 201 MPa after 28 days at 25 degrees C, in anaerobic condition and with 11% relative humidity. Compression after a pre-consolidated stage improved clearly the survival rate due to lower temperature increase and lower shearing force. Thus, direct compression seems to be suitable in producing probiotics tablets with extremely oxygen-sensitive strains, and could provide sufficient protection during storage to expect therapeutic efficiency.

AB The present investigation reports the development of PEG-modified liposomes for the delivery of naturally occurring resveratrol. PEG-modified liposomes were prepared by direct sonication of the phospholipid aqueous dispersion, in the presence of two PEG-surfactants. Small, spherical, unilamellar vesicles were produced, as demonstrated by light scattering, cryo-TEM, and SAXS. The aging of the vesicles was assessed by using the Turbiscan (R) technology, and their physical stability was evaluated in vitro in simulated body fluids, results showing that the key features of the liposomes were preserved. The biocompatibility of the formulations was demonstrated in an ex vivo model of hemolysis in human erythrocytes. Further, the incorporation of resveratrol in PEG-modified liposomes did not affect its intrinsic antioxidant activity, as DPPH radical was almost completely inhibited, and the vesicles were also able to ensure an optimal protection against oxidative stress in an ex vivo human erythrocytes-based model. Therefore, the proposed PEG-modified liposomes, which were prepared by a simple and reliable method, represent an interesting approach to safely deliver resveratrol, ensuring the preservation of the carrier structural integrity in the biological fluids, and the antioxidant efficacy of the polyphenol to be exploited against oxidative stress associated with cancer.

AB Local, long-acting release fenretinide (4HPR) millicylindrical implants were prepared and evaluated for their release kinetics in vivo and their ability to suppress oral cancer tumor explant growth. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA) implants were prepared as a function of drug loading and the presence of various excipients (poreformers, solubilizers, crystallization inhibitors) to enhance release of the insoluble 4HPR. Release kinetics and bioerosion of PLGA were monitored both in vitro in a PBS/Tween 80 buffer and in vivo by recovery of the drug remaining at the injection site. 4HPR was released from PLGA implants much slower in vivo than in the drug solubilizing media in vitro, with a 3-week lag phase and continuous release of > 2 months, but showed some release enhancement by addition of solubilizers. Water-soluble PVA/sucrose implants for release of 4HPR served to determine if drug dissolution provided suitable controlled release without the PLGA, and this formulation showed continuous drug release over 6 weeks in vivo. Placement of PLGA-4HPR implants adjacent to oral cancer tumor murine xenografts showed inhibition of tumor growth relative to sham implants, indicating the potential for the local 4HPR delivery approach to be useful for oral cancer chemoprevention.

AB In this work, the effect of saccharin (SAC) addition on the dissolution and supersaturation level of phenytoin (PHT)/Eudragit (R) E (EUD-E) solid dispersion (SD) at neutral pH was examined. The PHT/EUD-E SD showed a much slower dissolution of PHT compared to the PHT/EUD-E/SAC SD. EUD-E formed a gel layer after the dispersion of the PHT/EUD-E SD into an aqueous medium, resulting in a slow dissolution of PHT. Pre-dissolving SAC in the aqueous medium significantly improved the dissolution of the PHT/EUD-E SD. Solid-state C-13 NMR measurements showed an ionic interaction between the tertiary amino group of EUD-E and the amide group of SAC in the EUD-E gel layer. Consequently, the ionized EUD-E could easily dissolve from the gel layer, promoting PHT dissolution. Solution-state H-1 NMR measurements revealed the presence of ionic interactions between SAC and the amino group of EUD-E in the PHT/EUD-E/SAC solution. In contrast, interactions between PHT and the hydrophobic group of EUD-E strongly inhibited the crystallization of the former from its supersaturated solution. The PHT supersaturated solution was formed from the PHT/EUD-E/SAC SD by the fast dissolution of PHT and the strong crystallization inhibition effect of EUD-E after aqueous dissolution.

AB Numerous studies have been focused on hydrophobic compounds encapsulation as oils. In fact, oils can provide numerous health benefits as synergic ingredient combined with other hydrophobic active ingredients. However, stable microparticles for pharmaceutical purposes are difficult to achieve when commonly techniques are used. In this work, sunflower oil was encapsulated in calcium-alginate capsules by prilling technique in co-axial configuration. Core-shell beads were produced by inverse gelation directly at the nozzle using a w/o emulsion containing aqueous calcium chloride solution in sunflower oil pumped through the inner nozzle while an aqueous alginate solution, coming out from the annular nozzle, produced the beads shell. To optimize process parameters artificial intelligence tools were proposed to optimize the numerous prilling process variables. Homogeneous and spherical microcapsules with narrow size distribution and a thin alginate shell were obtained when the parameters as w/o constituents, polymer concentrations, flow rates and frequency of vibration were optimized by two commercial software, FormRules (R) and INForm (R), which implement neurofuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Networks together with genetic algorithms, respectively. This technique constitutes an innovative approach for hydrophobic compounds microencapsulation.

AB Nanoparticulated vesicles were widely used for carriers of drugs and imaging probes. To improve the targeting delivery efficiency of these vesicles, ligands were often functionalized onto their surfaces. However, the interaction between vesicles and plasma proteins may cover the ligands and hinder the targeting delivery. It is important to address the potential influence of ligands modification on plasma protein adsorption and the following targeting delivery. In this study, two common used ligands were chosen as the model: transferrin and RGD peptide. Gold nanoparticles were utilized as model particles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis data demonstrated that higher PEG modification and smaller particle size could reduce the plasma protein adsorption, while ligand modification could increase. The cellular uptake results showed that the targeting ability of smaller ligand RGD peptide would be more easily influenced by the proteins corona.

AB Semifluorinated alkanes (SFAs) are amphiphilic liquids that can dissolve hydrophobic drugs to form clear solutions. This study evaluated the potential of two SFAs to act as vehicle for topical ocular drug delivery. After confirming ocular safety, an ex vivo corneal penetration model was developed to determine drug distribution and corneal bioavailability. Hydrophobic dye distribution in the different corneal layers was visualised under a confocal microscope. Corneal bioavailability of cyclosporine A (CsA) dissolved in perfluorobutylpentane (F4H5) or perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) was compared to commercially available CsA ophthalmic emulsions, Restasis (R) and Ikervis (R). Precorneal residence of the four test vehicles containing the hydrophobic dye was also compared using an ex vivo corneal tissue model. Preferential accumulation of the hydrophobic dye in the corneal epithelium was observed with higher amounts detectable when delivered via the SFAs compared to Restasis or Ikervis. A significant improvement in corneal CsA penetration was observed after application of a single dose of 0.05% CsA in F4H5 and F6H8 when compared to Restasis with the area under curve over 4 h (AUC((0-4h))) being at least 8-fold greater for both SFAs (p <.0001). Moreover, the AUC((0-4h)) of 0.1% CsA in F4H5 was almost 5-fold greater than Ikervis (p <.0001). Finally, the precorneal residence time of both SFA solutions was significantly longer than that of the commercial emulsions with the AUC((0-60min)) being 2- to 11-fold greater. This study demonstrated that SFAs can significantly improve the local bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs by increasing corneal penetration as well as prolonging precorneal residence. They therefore offer a promising new platform for topical drug delivery to the eye.

AB Hydrogels based on poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic acid) and Tween 85 were prepared for hydrophobic drug delivery. The hydrogels were synthesized following a simple procedure carried out in solid state. The process did not require the use of any solvent and, as it is based on an esterification reaction, no toxic by-products were obtained. The resulting hydrogels contained Tween 85 inside the structure and due to the amphiphilic nature of this compound, hydrophobic domains within the hydrogel structure were formed. The obtained hydrogels showed good swelling capacities ranging from 100% to 600%. The esterification reaction that took place between poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic acid) and Tween 85 was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Hydrogels were loaded with a hydrophobic drug model, Curcumin (CUR), showing that the hydrogels were able to retain up to 36 mg of CUR per g of hydrogel. Additionally, the synthesized hydrogels provided in vitro sustained CUR release over periods of up to 30 days. Finally, and due to the mucoadhesive nature of the prepared materials, one of the hydrogels was tested in vitro as an oral drug delivery system. For this purpose, the selected material was milled into microparticles (45-90 mu m diameter). The release of CUR from the microparticles was evaluated under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. The microparticles were able to release their cargos in 7 h. However, further work is required to optimize this system for oral drug delivery applications.

AB Aim: It was the aim of this study to evaluate the mucus permeating properties of self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) exhibiting different size and zeta potential.
   Methods: Various SEDDS were prepared and characterized regarding droplet size, zeta potential and stability. Desmopressin was incorporated as model peptide drug and log P (SEDDS/water) was determined. Thereafter, mucus permeation studies with freshly isolated porcine mucus via Transwell method were performed. Moreover, the impact of water movement on mucus permeation of SEDDS was investigated. Different types of nanocarriers including nanoparticles and liposomes served as references.
   Results: SEDDS exhibited an initial droplet size of 25.0 +/- 2.2, 49.5 +/- 4.6, 123.5 +/- 12.1, 226.2 +/- 93.4 and 502.9 +/- 93.7 nm and a zeta potential of + 24.4 +/- 4.6, + 10.6 +/- 2.0, 0.2 +/- 3.8, -8.2 +/- 3.4 and -35.1 +/- 2.7 mV. Log P was in the range of 1.29-2.09 and mucus permeation studies with these SEDDS revealed a clear correlation between droplet size and permeation rate. The smaller SEDDS were, the higher their mucus permeating properties were. Negatively charged SEDDS demonstrated a higher permeation rate than positively charged SEDDS. In comparison to liposomes and solid nanocarriers SEDDS exhibited up to 5-fold higher mucus permeating properties.
   Conclusion: Small droplet size and negative zeta potential of SEDDS could be identified as key parameters for their mucus permeating properties.

AB The implementation of process analytical technology and continuous manufacturing at an FDA approved commercial manufacturing site is described. In this direct compaction process the blends produced were monitored with a Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopic calibration model developed with partial least squares (PLS) regression. The authors understand that this is the first study where the continuous manufacturing (CM) equipment was used as a gravimetric reference method for the calibration model. A principal component analysis (PCA) model was also developed to identify the powder blend, and determine whether it was similar to the calibration blends. An air diagnostic test was developed to assure that powder was present within the interface when the NIR spectra were obtained. The air diagnostic test as well the PCA and PLS calibration model were integrated into an industrial software platform that collects the real time NIR spectra and applies the calibration models. The PCA test successfully detected an equipment malfunction. Variographic analysis was also performed to estimate the sampling analytical errors that affect the results from the NIR spectroscopic method during commercial production. The system was used to monitor and control a 28 h continuous manufacturing run, where the average drug concentration determined by the NIR method was 101.17% of label claim with a standard deviation of 2.17%, based on 12,633 spectra collected. The average drug concentration for the tablets produced from these blends was 100.86% of label claim with a standard deviation of 0.4%, for 500 tablets analyzed by Fourier Transform Near Infrared (FT-NIR) transmission spectroscopy. The excellent agreement between the mean drug concentration values in the blends and tablets produced provides further evidence of the suitability of the validation strategy that was followed.

AB Because of their ability to translocate different cargos into cells, arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising vehicles for drug and gene delivery. The use of CPP-based carriers, however, is hampered by the lack of specificity and by interactions with negative serum components. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to decrease such non-specific interactions, albeit its use is associated with reduced transfection efficiency. In this study, we describe the development of PEGylated CPP-based gene carrier with an improved targeting and a high transfection activity. The system was prepared by condensing DNA with a polycation followed by coating with a lipid envelope containing the octaarginine (R8) peptide as a model CPP. R8-modified nanoparticles produced high transfection activities, but the efficiency was reduced by PEG shielding. The reduced activity could be fully restored by the addition of a targeting ligand and a pH-sensitive fusogenic peptide. The efficiency of the proposed system is quite high, even in the presence of serum, and shows improved targeting and selectivity. Surprisingly, the effect of the fusogenic peptide was dramatically reduced in the absence of R8. Although shielded, R8 augmented the activity of the fusogenic peptide, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two peptides at the intracellular level.

AB Traditionally, the development of a new solid dosage form is formulation-driven and less focus is put on the design of a specific microstructure for the drug delivery system. However, the compaction process particularly impacts the microstructure, or more precisely, the pore architecture in a pharmaceutical tablet. Besides the formulation, the pore structure is a major contributor to the overall performance of oral solid dosage forms as it directly affects the liquid uptake rate, which is the very first step of the dissolution process. In future, additive manufacturing is a potential game changer to design the inner structures and realise a tailor-made pore structure. In pharmaceutical development the pore structure is most commonly only described by the total porosity of the tablet matrix. Yet it is of great importance to consider other parameters to fully resolve the interplay between microstructure and dosage form performance. Specifically, tortuosity, connectivity, as well as pore shape, size and orientation all impact the flow paths and play an important role in describing the fluid flow in a pharmaceutical tablet. This review presents the key properties of the pore structures in solid dosage forms and it discusses how to measure these properties. In particular, the principles, advantages and limitations of helium pycnometry, mercury porosimetry, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray computed microtomography are discussed.

AB The aim of the present work was the synthesis and study the kinetics and profiles of camptothecin (CPT) release form block co- and ter-polymer conjugates comprising polylactide (PLA) segments and CPT moieties, structurally diverse by degrees of branching, content of D-PLA units and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). Six PLA, non-toxic macroinitiators (MIs), terminated with alpha-bromoester were synthesized. MIs were subjected to polymerization of CPT methacrylic derivative (CPTMA) with PEGMA at various ratios. The average contents of CPT from elemental analysis, NMR and UV-GPC were approximate to each other. The number of CPT molecules and PEGMA units was in the range of 9-195 and 0-280 per conjugate, respectively. PEGMA units plasticized PLA causing increase of its crystallinity, whereas 7% and more of D-PLA caused material amorphous. PEGMA units decreased thermal stability of conjugates, however it compatibillized the separated phases of PLA and PCPTMA, based on AFM. In vitro release rate of CPT from linear PLA conjugates deposited on injection-molded PLA bars increased by introduction of PEGMA units with zero-order kinetics and Korsmeyer-Peppas model indicating the super case II transport. Branched conjugates revealed some burst release and then the release was rather of first-order-kinetics with respect to CPT with non-Fickian transport.

   PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; FORMULATIONS
AB The use of an enabling formulation technique, such as amorphization of a poorly water-soluble crystalline drug, can result in supersaturation with respect to the crystalline form of the drug and thus potentially in a higher degree of absorption after oral administration. The ease with which such drugs can be amorphized is known as their glass forming ability (GFA). In this study, a potential correlation between GFA and supersaturation propensity is investigated. The GFA of 23 different drugs was determined by melt quenching or milling the crystalline drugs to obtain their respective amorphous forms. The inherent propensity of the drug to supersaturate, i.e. the maximal apparent degree of supersaturation (aDS), and the time until precipitation at a given aDS were determined. Supersaturation was induced via a solvent shift method where the drug was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then added to a biorelevant medium (fasted state simulated intestinal fluid). The study showed that drugs which are good glass formers also have the potential to supersaturate to a high degree (high maximal aDS) whereas drugs that are modest glass formers supersaturate only to a low degree. This correlation was confirmed by principal component analysis, which also indicated that melt enthalpy inversely correlated with both GFA and maximal aDS. However, no correlation between GFA of a drug and the time until precipitation at a given aDS was found.

AB The most effective and safe contraceptive method, intrauterine devices (IUDs), is still underutilized due to the pain barrier during IUD insertion. Lidocaine, a well-known local anesthetic, can be used to relieve IUD insertion pain. This study aimed at formulation, in vitro, in vivo and clinical evaluation of a novel lidocaine dual-responsive in situ gel. Pluronic and Gelrite (R) were used as thermosenstive and ion-activated polymers, respectively. In situ gels containing 2% lidocaine, pluronics and/or Gelrite (R) were prepared. The optimized dual-responsive formula (F-5) was clear, with 95% drug content, free flowing at room temperature and gel at vaginal temperature (T-gel of 28 degrees C). This optimized dual-responsive in situ gel was found to be superior to single-responsive one due to presence of Gelrite (R), imparting resistance to dilution effect of simulated vaginal fluids. DSC thermograms revealed no interaction between formulation components. Biocompatibility study showed no degeneration, necrosis or inflammation. Optimized dual-responsive in situ gel was further evaluated for pain reduction efficiency via a pilot randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial showing ease of self-administeration by patients and significant pain reduction induced at all steps of IUD insertion. In conclusion, lidocaine dual-responsive in situ gel can be effectively used in prevention of pain during IUD insertion.

AB The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) was the result of long-lived multi-stage tectonic evolution, including Proterozoic to Paleozoic accretion and collision, Mesozoic intracontinental modification, and Cenozoic rapid deformation and uplift. The accretionary and collisional orogenesis of its early history generated a huge orogenic collage consisting of diverse tectonic units including island arcs, ophiolites, accretionary prisms, seamounts, oceanic plateaus and micro-continents. These incorporated orogenic components preserved valuable detailed information on orogenic process and continental crust growth, which make the CAOB a key region to understanding of continental evolution, mantle-crust interaction and associated mineralization. The western CAOB refers to the west region in North Xinjiang of China and circum-Balkash of Kazakhstan, with occurrences of the spectacular Kazakhstan orocline and its surrounding mountain belts. Because orogenic fabrics of this part mostly preserve their original features caused by the interactions among the southern Siberian active margin in the north and the Tarim Craton in the south, the western CAOB can be regarded as an ideal region to study the processes of the accretionary and collisional orogenesis and associated mineralization. Since a large number of researchers have been working on this region, research advances bloom strikingly in a short-time period. Therefore, we, in this special issue, focus on these new study advances on the south domain of the western CAOB, including the Kazakhstan collage system, Tianshan orogenic belt and Beishan region, and it is anticipated that this issue can draw more attention from the international research groups to be interested in the studies on orogenesis of the CAOB.

TI Early to Middle Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains,

AB The Bogda Mountains, as an important intracontinental orogenic belt, are situated in the southern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and are a key area for understanding the Mesozoic evolution of the CAOB. However, the tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains remains controversial during the Mesozoic Era, especially the Early to Middle Jurassic Periods. The successive Lower to Middle Jurassic strata are well preserved and exposed along the northern flank of the Western Bogda Mountains and record the uplift processes of the Bogda Mountains. In this study, we analysed sedimentary facies combined with detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology at five sections of Lower to Middle Jurassic strata to detect the tectonic evolution and changes of provenance in the Bogda area. During Early to Middle Jurassic times, the fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine environments dominated in the western section of the Bogda area. The existence of Early Triassic peak age indicates that the Bogda Mountains did not experience uplift during the period of early Badaowan Formation deposition. The Early Triassic to Late Permian granitoid plutons and Carboniferous volcanic rocks from the Barkol and Santanghu areas were the main provenances. The significant change in the U-Pb age spectrum implies that the Eastern Bogda Mountains initiated uplift in the period of late Badaowan Formation deposition, and the Eastern Junggar Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin were partially partitioned. The Eastern Bogda Mountains gradually became the major provenance. From the period of early Sangonghe to early Toutunhe Formations deposition, the provenance of the sediments and basin-range frame were similar to that of late Badaowan. However, the Eastern Bogda Mountains suffered intermittent uplift three times, and successive denudation. The uplifts respectively happened in early Sangonghe, late Sangonghe to early Xishanyao, and late Xishanyao to early Toutunhe. During the deposition stage of Toutunhe Formation, a relatively strong tectonic reactivation took place along the Late Palaeozoic Bogda rift belt accompanied by relatively large-scale magmatism. The distinct basement structure between the eastern and western Bogda rift could be the structure basis of difference uplift in the Bogda area during the Mesozoic Era. The Early to Middle Jurassic episodic uplift of Eastern Bogda Mountains perhaps was related to the post-collisional convergence of the Qiangtang Block from late Badaowan to early Sangonghe, the closure of the western Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean at the Early-Middle Jurassic boundary and the tectonic accretion at the south Asian margin of Pamir Block during late Middle Jurassic times.

AB The Tianshan belt of the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt was generated by Paleozoic multi-stage subduction and final closure of several extinct oceans, including the South Tianshan Ocean between the Kazakhstan-Yili and Tarim blocks. However, the subduction initiation and polarity of the South Tianshan Ocean remain issues of highly debated. This study presents new zircon U-Pb ages, geochemical compositions and Sr-Nd isotopes, as well as zircon Hf isotopic data of the Latest Devonian to Early Carboniferous granitic rocks in the Wusun Mountain of the Yili Paleozoic convergent margin, which, together with the spatial-temporal distributions of regional magmatic rocks, are applied to elucidate their petrogenesis and tectonic linkage to the northward subduction initiation of the South Tianshan Ocean. Our zircon U-Pb dating results reveal that these granites were emplaced at the time interval of 362.0 +/- 1.2-360.3 +/- 1.9 Ma, suggesting a marked partial melting event of the continental crust in the Latest Devonian to Early Carboniferous. These granites, based on their mineral compositions and textures, can be categorized as monzogranites and K-feldspar granites. Geochemically, both monzogranites and K-feldspar granites have characters of I-type granites with high K20 contents (4.64-4.83 wt.%), and the K-feldspar granites are highly fractionated I-type granites, while the monzogranites have features of unfractionated I-type granites. Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic modeling results suggest that ca. 20-40% mantle-derived magmas may be involved in magma mixing with continental crust partial melts to generate the parental magmas of the granites. The mantle-derived basaltic magmas was inferred not only to be a major component of magma mixture but also as an important heat source to fuse the continental crust in an extensional setting, which is evidenced by the high zircon saturation temperatures (713-727 degrees C and 760-782 degrees C) of the studied granites. The Latest Devonian to Early Carboniferous extensional setting in the Wusun Mountain region of the Yili Paleozoic convergent margin is addressed by the subduction initiation of the South Tianshan Ocean and constituted a late Paleozoic nascent arc- back-arc system in the southwestern CAOB.

AB Early Paleozoic dioritic and granitic plutons in the Eastern Tianshan Orogenic Belt (ETOB) have been studied in order to constraint the initiation of a magmatic arc formed in this region. Zircon U-Pb dating indicates that two dioritic plutons in the northern ETOB were generated in the Late Ordovician (452 +/- 4 Ma) and the Early Silurian (442 +/- 3 Ma), respectively. Diorites from the two plutons are characterized by enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and highly incompatible elements, with depletions in high field strength elements (HSFE) displaying typical geochemical features of a subduction-related origin. They have positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+5.08- +6.58), relatively young Nd model ages (T-DM = 0.71-1.08 Ga), with Ta/Yb (0.05-0.09) and Nb/Ta ratios (12.06-15.19) similar to those of depleted mantle, suggesting a juvenile mantle origin. Their high Ba/La (13.3-35.9), low Th/Yb (0.72-2.02), and relatively low Ce/Th (4.57-14.7) and Ba/Th (47.8-235) ratios indicate that these diorites were probably produced by partial melting of a depleted mantle wedge metasomatized by both subducted sediment-derived melts and slab-derived aqueous fluids. Zircon U-Pb dating of a granitic pluton in the northern ETOB yielded a Late Ordovician intrusion age of 447 +/- 5 Ma. Granites from this pluton show calc-alkaline compositions with geochemical characteristics of I-type granites. They also show positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+ 6.49- +6.95) and young Nd model ages (T-DM = 0.69-0.87 Ga), indicating that the granites were most likely derived from juvenile lower crust. Our new dating results on the dioritic and granitic plutons suggest that arc-type magmatism in the northern ETOB began prior to or at the Late Ordovician (452-442 Ma). In addition, north-dipping subduction of the Kangguertage oceanic lithosphere may account for the arc-type magmatism and the geodynamic process of the ETOB in the Early Paleozoic.

AB The closure of the North Tianshan Ocean between the Junggar Terrane and the Yili Block is a longtime debated issue in literature, because of the different understanding of the Carboniferous volcanic rocks in the northern margin of the Yili Block. This study presents new geochronological and whole-rock geochemical data for the granitic rocks from the Borohoro pluton to provide constraints on the tectonic regime for the northern West Tianshan during the Carboniferous. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating results reveal two magmatic phases for the Borohoro pluton. The former magmatic activity in the Early Carboniferous formed the fine-grained granodiorite (332 Ma). The later magmatic activity occurred during the Late Carboniferous (305-300 Ma), forming a diversity of granitic rocks, involving quartz diorite, granodiorite and granite. Geochemical and mineralogical studies reveal that the studied granitic rocks from the Borohoro pluton all belong to metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, calc-alkaline I-type granites. They are characterized by enrichment in LILEs relative to HFSEs, and depletion of Nb, Ti and P, typical of continental arc-type granites. The intermediate SiO2, high Al2O3, and relatively low Fe2O3T, Mg and TiO2 contents reflect that these granitic rocks are mainly crust-derived. But the high Mg-# values for most samples and the occurrence of microgranular mafic enclaves indicate that their magma sources were mixed by mantle-derived components. Especially, the Late Carboniferous rocks define an elegant mixing trend in both the Rb-Rb/V and the 1/V-Rb/V diagrams, consistent with mixing between magmas from subcontinental lithospheric mantle and mafic lower crust. Taking into consideration of the facts that all the Devonian to Carboniferous granitoids belong to calc-alkaline I-type granites, and granitoids of A-type didn't appear until the Early Permian, we suggest that the subduction of the North Tianshan Ocean continued to the Late Carboniferous, generating the granitic rocks of the Borohoro pluton.

AB Voluminous Paleozoic intrusions occur in the Beishan Orogenic Collage (BOC) and their genesis and tectonic background are important to reconstruct the accretion-collision processes in the southernmost Altaids. Paleozoic is an important period for arc development in the BOC, where the Gongpoquan and Huaniushan arcs are located. There are two pulses of magmatism in the Huaniushan and Gongpoquan arcs, i.e., the ca. 470-423 Ma I-type and ca. 424-395 Ma S- and A-type granitoids. In this study, we focus on two peraluminous granitic plutons in the Gongpoquan arc, i.e., the Baitoushan muscovite granite and Haergen two-mica granite, aiming at unraveling their petrogenesis and tectonic background. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating yields emplacement ages of ca. 409-395 Ma and ca. 409 Ma for the Baitoushan and Haergen plutons, respectively. Both the granitic plutons are strongly peraluminous with A/CNK ratios of 1.10-1.20, indicative of S-type affinities. The rocks are characterized by high SiO2 and K2O contents with high CaO/Na2O ratios. Moreover, the rocks possess low MgO contents, Rb/Sr and Rb/Ba ratios, together with their relatively high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7139-0.7152) and less radiogenic epsilon Nd(t) values (-3.15 to -5.17), implying a clay-poor and plagioclase-rich crustal source.
   Compared with earlier pulse of arc-related magmatism (ca. 470-423 Ma), the latter pulse of magmatism (ca. 424-395 Ma) consists mainly of "normal granite" characterized by higher SiO2 (> 66%) and K2O contents, weaker fractionated REE patterns and lower SEu values, and gabbroic to dioritic intrusions are only sporadic. Moreover, the granitoids of the latter pulse show variable but more crust-like Sr-Nd isotopic compositions ((Sr-87/Sr-86)(0) = 0.7038-0.7327; epsilon Nd-(t) = 6.70 to + 0.33) than the earlier ones ((Sr-87/Sr-86)(0) = 0.7024-0.7080; epsilon Nd-(t) = 2.56 to + 8.86), indicating that the Early Devonian (ca. 424-395 Ma) experienced extensive crustal melting with minor involvement of mantle materials. Considering Early Devonian geological evidence, the transition from I- to S- and A-type magmatism probably reflects the Early Devonian amalgamation between the Gongpoquan and Huaniushan arcs, which caused not only regional unconformity and strong deformation-metamorphism, but also extensive melting of the accreted crustal materials in the BOC.

AB The Yuhai intrusions (quartz diorite, granite and pyroxene diorite) are located in the eastern part of the Dananhu-Tousuquan island arc belt of the Eastern Tianshan, and associated with the early Paleozoic porphyry Cu mineralization. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating yielded emplacement ages of 443.5 +/- 4.1 Ma for the quartz diorite, 325.4 +/- 2.5 Ma for the granite, and 291 +/- 3.0 Ma for the pyroxene diorite. These rocks are tholeiitic to calc-alkaline and metaluminous, with A/CNK values ranging from 0.66 to 1.10. The Silurian ore-bearing Yuhai quartz diorite is rich in LREEs and LILEs (e.g., K, Ba, Pb and Sr), and depleted in HREEs and HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Ta and Ti). These rocks are MgO-rich (1.90-3.80 wt.%; Mg-# = 37-72), with high Sr/Y, La/Yb and Ba/Th ratios, positive epsilon(Nd)(t) (6.31-6.84) and (epsilon Hf)(t) (13.26-16.40), low (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) (0.7037-0.7039), and low Nb/U and Ta/U ratios. The data suggest that the quartz diorite was generated by the partial melting of subducted juvenile oceanic slab. The oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) of the quartz diorite, calculated by zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios, is higher than that of the granite and pyroxene diorite, implying that the quartz diorite was more favorable to porphyry Cu mineralization. The Carboniferous Yuhai granite reveals similar geochemical features with the quartz diorite, except for the lower Mg-# (27-33), and the more elevated Th/U and Th/La ratios. Furthermore, these rocks also show high epsilon(Nd)(t) (5.2-5.8) and epsilon(Hf)(t) (11.03-14.85) values, and low (Sr-87/Sr-86)i (0.7036-0.7037). These features indicate that the parental magma of the granite was probably derived from a juvenile lower crust with no significant mantle component involvement. Different from the Yuhai quartz diorite and granite, the early Permian Yuhai pyroxene diorite contains low SiO2 (50.76-55.74 wt.%) and high MgO (3.96-4.33 wt.%; Mg-# = 40-44). The epsilon(Nd)(t), epsilon(Hf)(t) and (87Sr/86Sr)i values of the pyroxene diorite are 5.77-6.42, 7.99-12.10 and 0.7035-0.7040, respectively. The pyroxene diorite shows slight enrichments in LREEs ((La/Yb)N = 2.04-2.55), Ba, U, K and Pb, weak depletions in Nb, Ta and Ti, elevated Th/U ratios, and low Ni contents and Ce/Pb ratios. Integrating with the regional tectonic evolution, we suggest that the pyroxene diorite was likely originated from the partial melting of depleted mantle metasomatized by subducted slab-derived fluids. In addition, crustal contamination likely occurred when the pyroxene diorite magma traversed the continental crust.
   Integrating our new results with published works on the early Paleozoic Dananhu-Tousuquan and Bogeda-Haerlike island arc belts, we propose that the Yuhai quartz diorite may have formed in a subduction setting related to the N-dipping subduction of the North Tianshan oceanic plate. The younger Yuhai granite was likely generated by the bipolar subduction of the North Tianshan oceanic plate, which formed both of the Dananhu-Tousuquan belt to the north and the Aqishan-Yamansu belt to the south. The youngest Yuhai pyroxene diorite was likely formed under a post-collisional extension setting after the Dananhu-Tousuquan and Aqishan-Yamansu belts had collided.

AB Purpose: Protecting patient privacy is a major obstacle for the implementation of genomic-based medicine. Emerging privacy-enhancing technologies can become key enablers for managing sensitive genetic data. We studied physicians' attitude toward this kind of technology in order to derive insights that might foster their future adoption for clinical care.
   Methods: We conducted a questionnaire-based survey among 55 physicians of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who tested the first implementation of a privacy-preserving model for delivering genomic test results. We evaluated their feedback on three different aspects of our model: clinical utility, ability to address privacy concerns and system usability.
   Results: 38/55 (69%) physicians participated in the study. Two thirds of them acknowledged genetic privacy as a key aspect that needs to be protected to help building patient trust and deploy new-generation medical information systems. All of them successfully used the tool for evaluating their patients' pharmacogenomics risk and 90% were happy with the user experience and the efficiency of the tool. Only 8% of physicians were unsatisfied with the level of information and wanted to have access to the patient's actual DNA sequence.
   Conclusion: This survey, although limited in size, represents the first evaluation of privacy-preserving models for genomic-based medicine. It has allowed us to derive unique insights that will improve the design of these new systems in the future. In particular, we have observed that a clinical information system that uses homomorphic encryption to provide clinicians with risk information based on sensitive genetic test results can offer information that clinicians feel sufficient for their needs and appropriately respectful of patients' privacy.
   The ability of this kind of systems to ensure strong security and privacy guarantees and to provide some analytics on encrypted data has been assessed as a key enabler for the management of sensitive medical information in the near future. Providing clinically relevant information to physicians while protecting patients' privacy in order to comply with regulations is crucial for the widespread use of these new technologies.

AB Research regarding place and health has undergone a revolution due to the availability of consumer-focused location-tracking devices that reveal fine-grained details of human mobility. Such research requires that participants accept such devices enough to use them in their daily lives. There is a need for a theoretically grounded understanding of acceptance of different location-tracking technology options, and its research implications. Guided by an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), we conducted a 28-day field study comparing 21 chronically ill people's acceptance of two leading, consumer-focused location-tracking technologies deployed for research purposes: (1) a location-enabled smartphone, and (2) a GPS watch/activity tracker. Participants used both, and completed two surveys and qualitative interviews. Findings revealed that all participants exerted effort to facilitate data capture, such as by incorporating devices into daily routines and developing workarounds to keep devices functioning. Nevertheless, the smartphone was perceived to be significantly easier and posed fewer usability challenges for participants than the watch. Older participants found the watch significantly more difficult to use. For both devices, effort expectancy was significantly associated with future willingness to participate in research although prosocial motivations overcame some concerns. Social influence, performance expectancy and use behavior were significantly associated with intentions to use the devices in participants' personal lives. Data gathered via the smartphone was significantly more complete than data gathered via the watch, primarily due to usability challenges. To make longer-term participation in location tracking research a reality, and to achieve complete data capture, researchers must minimize the effort involved in participation; this requires usable devices. For long-term location-tracking studies using similar devices, findings indicate that only smartphone-based tracking is up to the challenge.

AB The analysis of clinical workflow offers many challenges, especially in settings characterized by rapid dynamic change. Typically, some combination of approaches drawn from ethnography and grounded theory-based qualitative methods are used to develop relevant metrics. Medical institutions have recently attempted to introduce technological interventions to develop quantifiable quality metrics to supplement existing purely qualitative analyses. These interventions range from automated location tracking to repositories of clinical data (e.g., electronics health record (EHR) data, medical equipment logs). Our goal in this paper is to present a cohesive framework that combines a set of analytic techniques that can potentially complement traditional human observations to derive a deeper understanding of clinical workflow and thereby to enhance the quality, safety, and efficiency of care offered in that environment. We present a series of theoretically-guided techniques to perform analysis and visualization of data developed using location tracking, with illustrations using the Emergency Department (ED) as an example. Our framework is divided into three modules: (i) transformation, (ii) analysis, and (iii) visualization. We describe the methods used in each of these modules, and provide a series of visualizations developed using location-tracking data collected at the Mayo Clinic ED (Phoenix, AZ). Our innovative analytics go beyond qualitative study, and includes user data collected from a relatively modern but increasingly ubiquitous technique of location tracking, with the goal of creating quantitative workflow metrics. Although we believe that the methods we have developed will generalize well to other settings, additional work will be required to demonstrate their broad utility beyond our single study environment.

AB Electronic health records (EHRs) contain critical information useful for clinical studies. Early assessment of patients' mortality in intensive care units is of great importance. In this paper, a Deep Rule-Based Fuzzy System (DRBFS) was proposed to develop an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients employing a large number of input variables. Our main contribution is proposing a system, which is capable of dealing with big data with heterogeneous mixed categorical and numeric attributes. In DRBFS, the hidden layer in each unit is represented by interpretable fuzzy rules. Benefiting the strength of soft partitioning, a modified supervised fuzzy k-prototype clustering has been employed for fuzzy rule generation. According to the stacked approach, the same input space is kept in every base building unit of DRBFS. The training set in addition to random shifts, obtained from random projections of prediction results of the current base building unit is presented as the input of the next base building unit. A cohort of 10,972 adult admissions was selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data set, where 9.31% of patients have died in the hospital. A heterogeneous feature set of first 48 h from ICU admissions, were extracted for in-hospital mortality rate. Required preprocessing and appropriate feature extraction were applied. To avoid biased assessments, performance indexes were calculated using holdout validation. We have evaluated our proposed method with several common classifiers including naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and D-TSK-FC. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for NB, DT, GB, DBN, D-TSK-FC and our proposed method were 73.51%, 61.81%, 72.98%, 70.07%, 66.74% and 73.90% respectively. Our results have demonstrated that DRBFS outperforms various methods, while maintaining interpretable rule bases. Besides, benefiting from specific clustering methods, DRBFS can be well scaled up for large heterogeneous data sets.

AB Pulmonary cancer is considered as one of the major causes of death worldwide. For the detection of lung cancer, computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) systems have been designed. Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous interne access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6% and 84.58%, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.

AB The boundary element method is a widely used and powerful technique to numerically describe multiphase flows with interfaces, satisfying Stokes' approximation. However, low viscosity ratios between immiscible fluids in contact at an interface and large surface tensions may lead to consistency issues as far as mass conservation is concerned. A simple and effective approach is described to ensure mass conservation at all viscosity ratios and capillary numbers within a standard boundary element framework. Benchmark cases are initially considered demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed technique in satisfying mass conservation, comparing with approaches and other solutions present in the literature. The methodology developed is finally applied to the problem of slippage over superhydrophobic surfaces. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Regularized Green's functions for mixed unbounded-periodic domains are derived. The regularization of the Green's function removes its singularity by introducing a regularization radius which is related to the discretization length and hence imposes a minimum resolved scale. In this way the regularized unbounded-periodic Green's functions can be implemented in an FFT-based Poisson solver to obtain a convergence rate corresponding to the regularization order of the Green's function. The high order is achieved without any additional computational cost from the conventional FFT-based Poisson solver and enables the calculation of the derivative of the solution to the same high order by direct spectral differentiation. We illustrate an application of the FFT-based Poisson solver by using it with a vortex particle mesh method for the approximation of incompressible flow for a problem with a single periodic and two unbounded directions.

AB In the hydrological cycle, the infiltration process is a critical component in the distribution of water into the soil and in the groundwater system. The nonlinear dynamics of the soil infiltration process yield preferential flow which affects the water distribution in soil. Preferential flow is influenced by the interactions between water, soil, plants, and microorganisms. Although the relationship among the plant roots, their rhizodeposits and water transport in soil has been the subject of extensive study, the effect of microbial exudates has been studied in only a few cases. Here the authors investigated the influence of two artificial microbial exudates-catechol and riboflavin-on the infiltration process, particularly unstable fingered flow, one form of preferential flow. Flow experiments investigating the effects of types and concentrations of microbial exudates on unstable fingered flow were conducted in a two-dimensional tank that was filled with ASTM C778 graded silica sand. The light transmission method (LTM) which is based on capturing the light intensity transmitted through a sand-water system and then converting it into degree of water saturation was used to visualize and characterize the flow of water in porous media as well as to image and measure the spatial and temporal distribution of water in porous media. Flow patterns, vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation of the fingers, as well as measurements of the fingers dimension (width), number, and velocity were determined using the light transmission method. Interfacial experiments exploring the influence of microbial exudates on the wettability behavior of water were performed by measuring the contact angle and the interfacial tension of the (solid)-gas-microbial exudate solution systems. Unstable wetting front generating fingered flow was observed in all infiltration experiments. The experimental results showed that the microbial exudate addition affected the infiltration process, as the measurements of the degree of saturation profiles and widths of the fingers differed from those of the control NaCl solution. These differences may be due to an improved water holding capacity in the presence of the microbial exudates. The lowest catechol solution concentration (10 mu M) produced the largest finger width (9.69 cm) among the tested catechol solution concentrations and all the other solutions including the control solution (7.24 cm). Moreover, the wettability of the medium for the catechol solution increased with an increase in concentration. The highest riboflavin solution concentration (1000 mu M) generated the highest finger width (7.75 cm) among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations. However, the wettability of the medium for the riboflavin solution decreased with an increase in concentration. Our study demonstrated that the microbial exudates which are biochemical compounds produced and released by microbes in the environment are capable of influencing the soil infiltration process. The results of this study also demonstrated that the influence of the contact angle expressed as (cos theta)(1/2) should be integrated in the scaling of the finger dimension, i.e., finger width, when the Miller and Miller (1956) scaling theory is applied for the hydrodynamic scaling in porous media.

AB The effects of vegetation cover on overland flow and erosion processes on hillslopes vary with vegetation type and spatial distribution and the different vegetation components, including the above- and below-ground biomass. However, few attempts have been made to quantify how these factors affect erosion processes. Field experimental plots (5 m x 2 m) with a slope of approximately 25 degrees were constructed and simulated rainfall (60 mm hr(-1)) (Rainfall) and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow (20 L min(-1)) (Rainfall + Flow) were applied. Three grass species were planted, specifically Astragalus adsurgens (A. adsurgens), Medicago sativa (M. sativa) and Cosmos bipinnatus (C. bipinnatus). To isolate and quantify the relative contributions of the above-ground grass parts (stems, litter cover and leaves) and the roots to reducing surface runoff and erosion, each of the three grass species was subjected to three treatments: intact grass control (IG), no litter or leaves (only the grass stems and roots were reserved) (NLL), and only roots remaining (OR). The results showed that planting grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield, and the mean reductions were 21.8%, 29.1% and 67.1%, respectively. M. sativa performed the best in controlling water and soil losses due to its thick canopy and dense, fine roots. Grasses reduced soil erosion mainly during the early stage of overland flow generation. The above-ground grass parts primarily contributed to reducing overland flow rate and velocity, with mean relative contributions of 64% and 86%, respectively. The roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion, with mean contribution of 84%. Due to the impact of upslope inflow, overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased under the Rainfall + Flow conditions. The results suggest that grass species on downslope parts of semi-arid hillslopes performed better in reducing water and soil losses. This study is beneficial for forage selection, allocation and management practices, such as forage harvesting, when implementing restoration strategies to control soil and water losses.

AB Spatial distribution of groundwater recharge/discharge fluxes has an important impact on mass and energy exchanges in shallow streambeds. During the last two decades, extensive studies have been devoted to the quantification of one-dimensional (1-D) vertical exchange fluxes. Nevertheless, few studies were conducted to characterize two-dimensional (2-D) heterogeneous flux fields that commonly exist in real-world cases. In this study, we used an iterative ensemble smoother (IES) to quantify the spatial distribution of 2-D exchange fluxes by assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements. Four assimilation scenarios corresponding to different potential field applications were tested. In the first three scenarios, the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields were first inferred from hydraulic head and/or temperature measurements, and then the flux fields were derived through Darcy's law using the estimated conductivity fields. In the fourth scenario, the flux fields were estimated directly from the temperature measurements, which is more efficient and especially suitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable. We concluded that, the best estimation could be achieved through jointly assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements, and temperature data were superior to the head data when they were used independently. Overall, the IES method provided more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those given by the widely used analytical solution-based methods. Furthermore, IES gave reasonable uncertainty estimations, which were unavailable in traditional methods. Since temperature can be accurately monitored with high spatial and temporal resolutions, the coupling of heat tracing techniques and IES provides promising potential in quantifying complex exchange fluxes under field conditions.

AB Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m(2)) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth - which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m(2) hillslope - affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.

AB GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used to support flood risk assessment. However, conventional GIS-MCDA methods fail to adequately represent spatial variability and are accompanied with considerable uncertainty. It is, thus, important to incorporate spatial variability and uncertainty into GIS-based decision analysis procedures. This research develops a spatially explicit, probabilistic GIS-MCDA approach for the delineation of potentially flood susceptible areas. The approach integrates the probabilistic and the local ordered weighted averaging (OWA) methods via Monte Carlo simulation, to take into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights, spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst. The approach is applied to a pilot study for the Gucheng County central China, heavily affected by the hazardous 2012 flood. A GIS database of six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors for the evaluation of susceptibility was created. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the robustness of the model. The results indicate that the ensemble method improves the robustness of the model outcomes with respect to variation in criteria weights and identifies which criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes. Therefore, the proposed. approach is an improvement over the conventional deterministic method and can provides a more rational, objective and unbiased tool for flood susceptibility evaluation.

AB This study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall-runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones (TCs) for probabilistic risk analysis. Due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high-fidelity ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall-runoff, a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind- and pressure-field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models. This builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge, and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from TCs. The utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic TC flood risk products, which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account TC associated rainfall-runoff. Results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge as compared to the Federal Emergency Management Association's (FEMAs) current practices.

AB Quantifying rainfall-derived inflow and infiltration (RDII) in a sanitary sewer is difficult when RDII and overflow occur simultaneously. This study proposes a novel conductivity-based method for estimating RDII. The method separately decomposes rainfall-derived inflow (RDI) and rainfall-induced infiltration (RII) on the basis of conductivity data. Fast Fourier transform was adopted to analyze variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather. Nonlinear curve fitting based on the least squares algorithm was used to optimize parameters in the proposed RDII model. The method was successfully applied to real-life case studies, in which inflow and infiltration were successfully estimated for three typical rainfall events with total rainfall volumes of 6.25 mm (light), 28.15 mm (medium), and 178 mm (heavy). Uncertainties of model parameters were estimated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method and were found to be acceptable. Compared with traditional flow-based methods, the proposed approach exhibits distinct advantages in estimating RDII and overflow, particularly when the two processes happen simultaneously.

AB The concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern, because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes. This paper presents a coupled modelling framework for the predictions of flash flood response and of the occurrence of debris flows initiated by channel bed mobilization. The framework combines a spatially distributed flash flood response model and a debris flow initiation model to define a threshold value for the peak flow which permits identification of channelized debris flow initiation. The threshold is defined over the channel network as a function of the upslope area and of the local channel bed slope, and it is based on assumptions concerning the properties of the channel bed material and of the morphology of the channel network. The model is validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km(2) Vizze basin in the Eastern Italian Alps on August 4-5, 2012. The results show that the proposed methodology has improved skill in identifying the catchments where debris-flows are triggered, compared to the use of simpler thresholds based on rainfall properties.

AB Accurate daily river flow forecast is essential in many applications of water resources such as hydropower operation, agricultural planning and flood control. This paper presents a forecasting approach to deal with a newly addressed situation where hydrological data exist for a period longer than that of meteorological data (measurements asymmetry). In fact, one of the potential solutions to resolve measurements asymmetry issue is data re-sampling. It is a matter of either considering only the hydrological data or the balanced part of the hydro-meteorological data set during the forecasting process. However, the main disadvantage is that we may lose potentially relevant information from the left-out data. In this research, the key output is a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy inference hybrid model that is implemented over the non re-sampled data. The introduced modeling approach must be capable of exploiting the available data efficiently with higher prediction efficiency relative to Constructive Fuzzy Model trained over re-sampled' data set. The study was applied to Litani River in the Bekaa Valley Lebanon by using 4 years of rainfall and 24 years of river flow daily measurements. A Constructive Fuzzy System Model (C-FSM) and a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy System Model (TPC-FSM) are trained. Upon validating, the second model has shown a primarily competitive performance and accuracy with the ability to preserve a higher day-to-day variability for 1, 3 and 6 days ahead. In fact, for the longest lead period, the C-FSM and TPC-FSM were able of explaining respectively 84.6% and 86.5% of the actual river flow variation. Overall, the results indicate that TPC-FSM model has provided a better tool to capture extreme flows in the process of streamflow prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the hydrological impact of the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation: seasonality is, after aridity, a second-order determinant of catchment water yield. Based on a data set of 171 French catchments (where aridity ranged between 0.2 and 1.2), we present a parameterization of three commonly-used water balance formulas (namely, Turc-Mezentsev, Tixeront-Fu and Oldekop formulas) to account for seasonality effects. We quantify the improvement of seasonality-based parameterization in terms of the reconstitution of both catchment streamflow and water yield. The significant improvement obtained (reduction of RMSE between 9 and 14% depending on the formula) demonstrates the importance of climate seasonality in the determination of long-term catchment water balance.

AB Real-time precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolutions are crucial for accurate hydrological forecasting. To improve the spatial resolution and quality of satellite precipitation, a three-step satellite and gauge precipitation merging method was formulated in this study: (1) bilinear interpolation is first applied to downscale coarser satellite precipitation to a finer resolution (P-s); (2) the (mixed) geographically weighted regression methods coupled with a weighting function are then used to estimate biases of Ps as functions of gauge observations (P-o) and P-s; and (3) biases of P-s are finally corrected to produce a merged precipitation product. Based on the above framework, eight algorithms, a combination of two geographically weighted regression methods and four weighting functions, are developed to merge CMORPH (CPC MORPHing technique) precipitation with station observations on a daily scale in the Ziwuhe Basin of China. The geographical variables (elevation, slope, aspect, surface roughness, and distance to the coastline) and a meteorological variable (wind speed) were used for merging precipitation to avoid the artificial spatial autocorrelation resulting from traditional interpolation methods. The results show that the combination of the MGWR and BI-square function (MGWR-BI) has the best performance (R = 0.863 and RMSE = 7.273 mm/day) among the eight algorithms. The MGWR-BI algorithm was then applied to produce hourly merged precipitation product. Compared to the original CMORPH product (R = 0.208 and RMSE = 1.208 mm/hr), the quality of the merged data is significantly higher (R = 0.724 and RMSE = 0.706 mmihr). The developed merging method not only improves the spatial resolution and quality of the satellite product but also is easy to implement, which is valuable for hydrological modeling and other applications.

AB The temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation. This study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework. Two parameters of the monthly model, i.e., k and m, are assumed to be time-variant at different months. Based on the hydrological data set from 121 MOPEX catchments in the United States, we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters (k and m) and catchment properties (NDVI and frequency of rainfall events, alpha). The results show that parameter k is positively correlated with NDVI or alpha, while the correlation is opposite for parameter m, indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m. The multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between 8 and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m. Based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time-variant parameters and NDVI, the mean annual parameter s is downscaled to monthly k and m. The results show that it has lower NSEs than these from model with time-variant k and m being calibrated through SCE-UA, while for several study catchments, it has higher NSEs than that of the model with constant parameters. The proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is greatly important for water resources throughout the entire Yellow River Basin. Streamfiow in the SRYR has experienced great changes over the past few decades, which is closely related to the frozen ground degradation; however, the extent of this influence is, still unclear. In this study, the air freezing index (DDFa) is selected as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation. A water-energy balance equation within the Budyko framework is employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change, which manifests as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation, which can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change. The results show that the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 55% and 33%, respectively, of the streamflow decrease for the entire SRYR from Period 1 (1965-1989) to Period 2 (1990-2003). In the permafrost-dominated region upstream of the Jimai hydrological station, the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 71% of the streamflow decrease. From Period 2 (1990-2003) to Period 3 (2004-2015), the observed streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation; this could be attributed to the combined effects of increasing potential evapotranspiration and more importantly, frozen ground degradation. Frozen ground degradation could influence streamflow by increasing the groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in permafrost-dominated regions. These findings will help develop a better understanding of the impact of frozen ground degradation on water resources in the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil and water loss from farmland causes land degradation and water pollution, thus continued efforts are needed to establish mathematical model for quantitative analysis of relevant processes and mechanisms. In this study, an approximate analytical solution has been developed for overland flow model and sediment transport model, offering a simple and effective means to predict overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions. In the overland flow model, the flow regime was considered to be transitional with the value of parameter beta (in the kinematic wave model) approximately two. The change rate of unit discharge with distance was assumed to be constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane. The excess rainfall was considered to be constant under uniform rainfall conditions. The overland flow model developed can be further applied to natural rainfall conditions by treating excess rainfall intensity as constant over a small time interval. For the sediment model, the recommended values of the runoff erosion calibration constant (c(r)) and the splash erosion calibration constant (c(f)) have been given in this study so that it is easier to use the model. These recommended values are 0.15 and 0.12, respectively. Comparisons with observed results were carried out to validate the proposed analytical solution. The results showed that the approximate analytical solution developed in this paper closely matches the observed data, thus providing an alternative method of predicting runoff generation and sediment yield, and offering a more convenient method of analyzing the quantitative relationships between variables. Furthermore, the model developed in this study can be used as a theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate and land cover are two major factors affecting the water fluxes and balance across spatiotemporal scales. These two factors and their impacts on hydrology are often interlinked. The quantification and differentiation of such impacts is important for developing sustainable land and water management strategies. Here, we calibrated the well-known Hydrus-1D model in a data-rich boreal headwater catchment in Scotland to assess the role of two dominant vegetation types (shrubs vs. trees) in regulating the soil water partitioning and balance. We also applied previously established climate projections for the area and replaced shrubs with trees to imitate current land use change proposals in the region, so as to quantify the potential impacts of climate and land cover changes on soil hydrology. Under tree cover, evapotranspiration and deep percolation to recharge groundwater was about 44% and 57% of annual precipitation, whilst they were about 10% lower and 9% higher respectively under shrub cover in this humid, low energy environment. Meanwhile, tree canopies intercepted 39% of annual precipitation in comparison to 23% by shrubs. Soils with shrub cover stored more water than tree cover. Land cover change was shown to have stronger impacts than projected climate change. With a complete replacement of shrubs with trees under future climate projections at this site, evapotranspiration is expected to increase by similar to 39% while percolation to decrease by 21% relative to the current level, more pronounced than the modest changes in the two components (<8%) with climate change only. The impacts would be particularly marked in warm seasons, which may result in water stress experienced by the vegetation. The findings provide an important evidence base for adaptive management strategies of future changes in low-energy humid environments, where vegetation growth is usually restricted by radiative energy and not water availability while few studies that quantify soil water partitioning exist.

AB To address certain limitations with their current operational model, Environment and Climate Change Canada recently developed the Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) land surface model and the representation of subsurface hydrological processes was targeted as an area for improvement. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of HydroSVS, the component of SVS responsible for the vertical redistribution of water, to simulate soil moisture under snow-free conditions when using flux-tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data. We assessed (1) model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with HydroSVS to point-scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and (2) model complexity by comparing the performance of HydroSVS to that of HydroGeoSphere, a state-of-the-art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model. To do this, we performed one-dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the AmeriFlux network. Results indicate that under Mediterranean and temperate climates, HydroSVS satisfactorily simulated soil moisture (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.26 and 0.70; R-2 >= 0.80), with a performance comparable to HydroGeoSphere (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >= 0.60; R-2 >= 0.80). However, HydroSVS performed weakly under a semiarid climate while HydroGeoSphere performed relatively well. By decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration, this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models. Overall, this study highlights the potential of SVS for hydrological applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Existing literature provides contradictory information about variation in potential green roof hydrological performance over time. This study has evaluated a long-term hydrological monitoring record from a series of extensive green roof test beds to identify long-term evolutions and sub-annual (seasonal) variations in potential hydrological performance. Monitoring of nine differently-configured extensive green roof test beds took place over a period of 6 years in Sheffield, UK.
   Long-term evolutions and sub-annual trends in maximum potential retention performance were identified through physical monitoring of substrate field capacity over time. An independent evaluation of temporal variations in detention performance was undertaken through the fitting of reservoir-routing model parameters. Aggregation of the resulting retention and detention variations permitted the prediction of extensive green roof hydrological performance in response to a 1-in-30-year 1-h summer design storm for Sheffield, UK, which facilitated the comparison of multi and sub-annual hydrological performance variations.
   Sub-annual (seasonal) variation was found to be significantly greater than long-term evolution. Potential retention performance increased by up to 12% after 5-years, whilst the maximum sub-annual variation in potential retention was 27%. For vegetated roof configurations, a 4% long-term improvement was observed for detention performance, compared to a maximum 63% sub-annual variation. Consistent long-term reductions in detention performance were observed in unvegetated roof configurations, with a non-standard expanded-clay substrate experiencing a 45% reduction in peak attenuation over 5-years. Conventional roof configurations exhibit stable long-term hydrological performance, but are nonetheless subject to sub-annual variation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The transport of water and vapour in the desert vadose zone plays a critical role in the overall water and energy balances of near-surface environments in arid regions. However, field measurements in extremely dry environments face many difficulties and challenges, so few studies have examined water and vapour transport processes in the desert vadose zone. The main objective of this study is to analyse the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone (depth of similar to 350 cm) by using measured and modelled data in an extremely arid environment. The field experiments are implemented in an area of the Gobi desert in northwestern China to measure the soil properties, daily soil moisture and temperature, daily water-table depth and temperature, and daily meteorological records from DOYs (Days of Year) 114-212 in 2014 (growing season). The Hydrus-1D model, which simulates the coupled transport of water, vapour and heat in the vadose zone, is employed to simulate the layered soil moisture and temperature regimes and analyse the transport processes of soil water and vapour. The measured results show that the soil water and temperatures near the land surface have visible daily fluctuations across the entire soil profile. Thermal vapour movement is the most important component of the total water flux and the soil temperature gradient is the major driving factor that affects vapour transport in the desert vadose zone. The most active water and heat exchange occurs in the upper soil layer (depths of 0-25 cm). The matric potential change from the precipitation mainly re-draws the spatio-temporal distribution of the isothermal liquid water in the soil near the land surface. The matric potential has little effect on the isothermal vapour and thermal liquid water flux. These findings offer new insights into the liquid water and vapour movement processes in the extremely arid environment. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB There is a need to model and predict the transfer of phosphorus (P) from land to water, but this is challenging because of the large number of complex physical and biogeochemical processes involved. This study presents, for the first time, a 'limits of acceptability' approach of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), in an application to a water quality problem in the Newby Beck catchment (12.5 km(2)), Cumbria, United Kingdom (UK). Using high frequency outlet data (discharge and P), individual evaluation criteria (limits of acceptability) were assigned to observed discharge and P loads for all evaluation time steps, identifying where the model was performing well/poorly and to infer which processes required improvement in the model structure. Initial limits of acceptability were required to be relaxed by a substantial amount (by factors of between 5.3 and 6.7 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used) in order to gain a set of behavioral simulations (1001 and 1016, respectively out of 5,000,000). Of the 39 model parameters tested, the representation of subsurface processes and associated parameters, were consistently shown as critical to the model not meeting the evaluation criteria, irrespective of the chosen evaluation metric. It is therefore concluded that SWAT is not an appropriate model to guide P management in this catchment. This approach highlights the importance of high frequency monitoring data for setting robust model evaluation criteria. It also raises the question as to whether it is possible to have sufficient input data available to drive such models so that we can have confidence in their predictions and their ability to inform catchment management strategies to tackle the problem of diffuse pollution from agriculture.

AB The major limitation of optimization models applied previously for rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems is the systematic evaluation of environmental and human health impacts across all the lifecycle stages. This study integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) into a multi-objective optimization model to optimize the construction areas of green rooftops, porous pavements and green lands in Beijing of China, considering the trade-offs among 24 h-interval RWH volume (Q(R)), stormwater runoff volume control ratio (R), economic cost (E-C), and environmental impacts (EI). Eleven life cycle impact indicators were assessed with a functional unit of 10,000 m(2) of RWH construction areas. The LCA results showed that green lands performed the smallest lifecycle impacts of all assessment indicators, in contrast, porous pavements showed the largest impact values except Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP) elements. Based on the standardization results, ADP fossil was chosen as the representative indicator for the calculation of El objective in multi-objective optimization model due to its largest value in all RWH systems lifecycle. The optimization results for Q(R), R, E-C and EI were 238.80 million m(3), 78.5%, 66.68 billion RMB Yuan, and 1.05E + 16 MJ, respectively. After the construction of optimal RWH system, 14.7% of annual domestic water consumption and 78.5% of maximum daily rainfall would be supplied and controlled in Beijing, respectively, which would make a great contribution to reduce the stress of water scarcity and water logging problems. Green lands have been the first choice for RWH in Beijing according to the capacity of rainwater harvesting and less environmental and human impacts. Porous pavements played a good role in water logging alleviation (R for 67.5%), however, did not show a large construction result in this study due to the huge ADP fossil across the lifecycle. Sensitivity analysis revealed the daily maximum precipitation to be key factor for the robustness of the results for three RWH systems construction in this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this experimental study, we explore the broadening of the glass transition in chemically and structurally complex glass-forming liquids (CGFLs) by means of thermal and rheological characterization techniques. Petroleum fluids with different levels of chemical and structural complexity are used as model materials. Thermal characterization by temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC) reveals a systematic increase in the width of the glass transition region Delta T-g with increasing chemical and structural complexity. The broadening of the glass transition is also strongly reflected in the linear viscoelastic properties that are measured by small-diameter parallel plate rheometry. Most notably, this is observed as the broadening of the relaxation time spectrum at long times. The recently proposed broadened power-law spectrum model is used to describe the constitutive behavior of the investigated petroleum fluids. In this model, the stretching parameter beta serves as a quantitative measure of the spectral broadening. A strong power-law correlation is found between Delta T-g and beta, manifesting a relationship between the broadness of the calorimetric and viscoelastic glass transition in CGFLs.

AB In this work we present the preparation and characterization of new fluoroborate glasses doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ and modified by Ca, Sr and Ba oxides. Glasses with compositions (100-x-y) (MO.2B(2)O(3)) + x NaF + y (YbF3:ErF3) (% in mol), where M is Sr, Ba, Ca, x = 10-30% and y = 0, 1 or 5% were prepared by the melt/quenching technique. Glass forming ability and stability were studied by thermal analysis and it is shown that calcium samples presented the highest stability. The nature of the modifier cation has also shown a direct influence on the absolute and relative intensities of the rare earth ions transitions in the visible and near-infrared regions. Though the calcium samples present lower absorption intensities, they display the best up- and down conversion efficiencies. There are evidences that the incorporation of the fluoride compound leads to a fluorine rich environment on the first coordination sphere of the RE, decreasing the probability of OW groups well known quenchers of RE emissions. Though preliminary, the results in this study can become of relevance for the field of solar cell technology improvement via betterment of solar light harvesting in the infrared and ultraviolet regions.

AB The dependence of microstructure and mechanical properties on alloy composition of a series of Cu48Zr48-xAl4Nbx (x = 0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 at.%) bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) was studied in detail. It was found that the doping element Nb exerts a crucial role on the mechanical properties of the studied BMGCs. By adjusting Nb content, a BMGC possessing an excellent combination of high strength (similar to 1.3 GPa) and significant tensile plasticity (similar to 8%) was obtained. Such superior mechanical performance can be attributed to the formation of multiple shear bands and the deformation-induced martensitic transformation from a cubic primitive B2 phase to a monoclinic B19' phase.

AB The first principle molecular dynamics simulations based on the density functional theory were performed to study the local structure of Co B-based glassy alloys. It was evidenced that the B-centered non-distorted (regular) Kasper polyhedra with a coordination number (CN) of 9-10, i.e. < 0, 3, 6, 0 > and < 0, 2, 8, 0 >, are primary structure-forming clusters in Co B-based glassy alloys. The formation of these regular clusters can be attributed to the efficient dense packing as well as the strong chemical interaction indicated by the results of chemical short range order parameter and electronic charge density. Compared with the Co65B35 glassy alloy, the Ta-bearing Co57B35Ta8 alloy has a higher fraction of Z9 and Z10 (Z = CN) Kasper polyhedra. A higher fraction of these regular Kasper polyhedra and their efficient and stable packing over medium range are likely to constitute the relatively stable regions which may compete with the corresponding crystals, and thus reduce atomic diffusivity and increase the viscosity of liquid/glassy structures. This result is in favor of higher thermal stability and better resistance to plastic flow. Therefore, the Co57B35Ta8 glassy alloy possesses a larger glass forming ability and a higher mechanical strength than the Ta-free glassy alloy.

AB In order to enhance the ionic conductivity in Li+ ion NASICONs, LiTi2(PO4)(3) (LTP), novel LTP-glass-ceramic composites have been prepared by mechanical ball milling assisted synthesis route. Composites were prepared using Li+ ion oxide glassy system (Li2SO4)(x)-(LiPO3)(100-x) where x = 30 mol% and 60 mol%. The glass content in composite was fixed to 20 wt%. Structural, thermal and electrical properties of the novel composites reveal interesting results. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry confirm the formation of LTP-glass-ceramic composite. FESEM investigations performed on the samples suggest that LTP-glass-ceramics contain LTP grains of nano size with an appreciable homogeneity. In-grain (bulk) and grain boundary conductivity exhibit significant increase in the composites. A tentative mechanism of electrical transport has been proposed according to which glass-ceramic phase creates amorphous 'Li+ ion rich regions' at the grain boundaries/interface. Concentration of Li+ ions at the interface of LTP grains possibly leads to the enhanced electrical transport.

AB In this study, we synthesized mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles and applied them to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices to improve the device efficiency by promoting light scattering in the device. Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrode was utilized as transparent anode for the OLEDs, because the AgNW anode integrated with a TiO2 scattering layer can be easily formed using a transfer process. When the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized, the OLED efficiency was improved by about 30% as compared with the case of amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles. This is because the refractive index and surface area of the mesoporous nanoparticles are larger than those of the amorphous ones, thereby further promoting the scattering of the light generated in the OLED device.

AB Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-np) with Ce3+ rich surfaces were synthesized by ecofriendly route using tannic acid. XRD and SAED patterns confirm the cubic structure of CeO2-np. A semi-quantitative XPS analysis revealed the presence of 34 % Ce3+ ions. Tannic acid not only mediates the CeO2-np synthesis, but also helps in reduction of surface states from Ce4+ to Ce3+. Oxygen vacancies were evidenced from XPS and photoluminescence studies. The synthesized nanoparticles showed good antimicrobial activity towards both gram positive (Bacillus subtilis) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. The toxicity of CeO2-np towards tested bacteria is due to production of Reactive oxygen species (ROS). The presence of Ce3+ ions and rich surface oxygen vacancies may lead to excellent production of ROS and simultaneously causing cell wall damage. Present findings show that tannic acid assisted CeO2-np with obtained properties acts as good antibacterial agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A one-step solvothermal method has been demonstrated for large-scale synthesis of trigonal selenium nanowires (t-Se NWs) and bundles by reducing SeO2 with glucose at 150 degrees C for 12 h. These NWs possess a diameter ranging from 80 to 110 nm and length up to several tens of micrometers, and each NW had a uniform diameter along its entire length. Some NWs tended to aggregate by paralleling their long-axis orientations to form NW bundles. The time-dependent experiments revealed that the formation and growth of t-Se NWs was governed by a solid-solution-solid mechanism. The initially generated amorphous Se particles would dissolve in solution to form free Se atoms, and then recrystallized and formed into t-Se NWs due to its helical structures. Such Se NWs and bundles may serve as templates to generate other one-dimensional nanomaterials and find applications in nanoscaled optoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monodisperse hollow hexanitrostilbene-piperazine compound microspheres were fabricated successfully through a facile one-pot procedure based on the reaction of hexanitrostilbene (HNS) and piperazine without any template or surfactant. Synthesis conditions (ratio of reactants, stirring rate, reaction temperature and time) have been optimized to obtain compound microspheres with good monodispersion and narrow size distribution. And the results indicated that as-obtained microspheres possessed central hollow structures. Moreover, a possible formation mechanism for assembling hollow compound microspheres was proposed. This work may introduce a novel idea towards designing and fabricating the new hollow spheres materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly-dense Al-5Si-1Cu-Mg alloy bulk was firstly produced by laser additive manufacture (LAM) technique. LAM involves extraordinary thermal cycles and will therefore significantly affect the microstructure. In this research, the phase evolution of LAMed Al-5Si-1Cu-Mg alloy was studied in detail by characterization along the deposition direction. The rapid solidification of LAM encourages the generation of various unstable phases of vermicular Si, fishbone shaped theta-Al2Cu, blocky pi-Al8Mg3FeSi6 and irregular Q-Al5Mg8Cu2Si6. As the increasing times of thermal cycling, phase evolution takes place by spheroidization of Si phases, transformation of pi-Fe to plate-like beta-Al5FeSi with dissolution of theta and Q phases. In particular, after certain times of thermal excursions, many micron-sized and nano-sized Q' phases precipitate out from matrix, and the stabilized microstructure consists of alpha-Al, Q', Si and beta.

AB Ti2Nb10O29 is a high-capacity, safe and stable anode material for lithium-ion batteries, but suffers from a poor rate capability. To tackle this issue, nanotechnology is employed, and Ti2Nb10O29 hollow nanofibers with an average fiber diameter of similar to 500 nm and shell thickness of similar to 90 nm are prepared by a facile co-electrospining technique followed by calcination in air. This material exhibits not only a high reversible capacity (307 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and durable cyclic stability (0.06% capacity loss per cycle at 10 C over 500 cycles) but also an outstanding rate capability (136 mAh g(-1) at 20 C), thereby becoming a promising anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

AB LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is a promising cathode material for high power lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For the first time we design a tri-functional coating to improve the cycling performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. With the designed BiPO4 coating, the capacity retentions of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are largely improved from 84.3% to 93.6% at 0.5 C after 50 cycles and from 80.6% to 96.2% at 10 C after 100 cycles. The tri-functional coating reduces the charge transfer resistance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode and plays a critical role in enhancing the electrochemical performance and lifetime. This strategy provides a new way to modify electrode materials to elevate the performance of LIBs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel high-performance supercapacitor electrode material, polyaniline (PANI) modified two-dimensional Ti3C2 composites(denoted as PANI-Ti3C2), has been synthesized via in situ polymerization. The experiment results showed that the introduction of PANI to Ti3C2 can improve the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2 because the amino groups in PANI not only increased the electric conductivity for faster ion transport but also improved the surface wettability of Ti3C2 for more active sites and provided faradaic reactions for additional capacity. The specific capacitance of PANI-Ti3C2 can achieve a maximum of 164 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1) and 1.26 times greater than that of Ti3C2 (131 Fg(-1)). Moreover, PANI-Ti3C2 showed superior cycling stability, retaining similar to 96% of its initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB MCM-48, metal doped MCM-48 and MCM-41 have been synthesized by hydrothermal method, respectively. The specific hydrogen storage amount of prepared materials at 77 K below 100 kPa are recorded in order to explore their hydrogen storage mechanisms. Experimental results indicate that pore size is the key factor that dominates their hydrogen storage capacity. Adsorption plays an important role from 0 to 35 kPa and mesoporous materials with smaller pore size seem to be better candidates for hydrogen storage. Diffusion will play a dominant role in the pressure range of 35-100 kPa, and mesoporous materials with larger pore size exhibit higher hydrogen storage capacity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FOAMS; MICROSTRUCTURE; POROSITY
AB With increasing demand for porous materials with their popular use in functional applications, there is a strong need to develop a decent strength prediction method for porous materials. The Gibson-Ashby (G-A) model, which is the most common prediction method, has served this purpose. This model is constructed upon a weakly-structured open-cell porous material, thus providing a 'lower bound' of yield strength. This study considers 'contiguity' as a governing parameter to predict the strength of porous materials and proposes a modified G-A model by incorporating the concept of contiguity. This paper supports preliminary evidence that the new model better describes the strength of selected porous materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deployment of Al components produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) is inhibited by the low strength of the casting Al alloys currently being repurposed for use with this process. As a result, the use of AM to produce Al matrix Composites (AMCs) which have superior properties to their castable counterparts is an emerging area of research. In this paper, micro TiB2 particles were decorated to the surface of larger AlSi10Mg powder particles to create feedstocks through the 'satelliting' method. TiB2/AlSi10Mg composites were then successfully fabricated by Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) with a uniform distribution of the reinforcing TiB2 particles observed. Results show that macro agglomerations of TiB2 particles decrease significantly with decreasing traverse speed and TiB2 content. Porosity is also shown to decrease markedly with increasing traverse speed for this material feedstock. The hardness of deposits is shown to increase with addition of TiB2 content, which implies improvement of material strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thorn-like surface can avert the compact stacking of nanoparticles through the mutual supporting of thorns, while the hollow structure can provide more active sites by the utilization of the inner surface. On account of these, we reported the facile synthesis of self-supporting MnCo2O4 hollow structures using a hydrothermal way and subsequent calcination. Fluorine-coordinated metal ions (Mn2+ and Co2+) react with OH- and CO32-, generating the initial nanoparticles. Nanoparticles then go through a two-step assembly and a gas-driven deformation, ultimately forming the aforementioned morphology. In this process, the fluorine ion and the urea are regarded to play significant roles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crystallographic peculiarities of bainite were investigated in two low carbon microalloyed steels as a function of the parent austenite deformation and the cooling rate. The study was focused on the orientation relationship (OR) between parent austenite and bainitic ferrite and on the paring among probable orientation variants of the bainitic blocks. For the steels studied a common dependency of the OR on the parameter, characterizing the relative position of the transformation temperature within the bainite transformation temperature range, has been obtained. The same remains valid for the variant paring, though the dependency turns out to be more complex in case of ausforming. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 3D Porous carbon derived from pine needle is prepared by hydrothermal followed KOH activation process. The high surface area (1175 m(2) g(-1)) and rich hierarchical pores provide the electrode with high capacitance. And the abundant surface oxygen functional groups offer additional pseudo-capacitance, which would increase the capacitance. It delivers the capacitance of 348 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in a three-electrode cell. The well performance and the low cost make the derived porous carbon as a promising electrode.

AB In this study, the influences of Ag addition to Sn-58Bi solder on SnBi/Cu interfacial reaction and fracture behavior of the aged SnBiAg/Cu solder joints were investigated. The results reveal that the Ag element in the solder can diffuse into the Cu substrate during the soldering and aging process, forming a Cu-Ag alloy layer around the joint interface. The Bi segregation was not observed at the aged SnBiAg/Cu interface, and the embrittlement will not occur at the aged SnBiAg/Cu solder joints once the Bi segregation was restrained.

AB Ternary shell/core/core Bi2S3/graphene quantum dots/TiO2 nanowire arrays (Bi2S3/GQDs/TNWs) photoelectrodes are constructed through electrophoretic deposition of GQDs onto TNWs followed by electrochemical deposition of Bi2S3 QDs. An interesting synergistic effect was observed in configuration of Bi2S3/GQDs/TNWs. Under irradiation, the photocurrent density of 50 lA/cm(2) (an enhancement of similar to 86%) and the removal efficiency of Cr (VI) is 97% (an enhancement of similar to 76%) compared to that TiO2 nanowire array were obtained. Such significant enhancement is attributed to the strong photoabsorption ability of Bi2S3 QDs and excellent electron transport ability of GQDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The realisation of the recoverable strain variation by ultrasonic vibrations was studied in shape memory bimetallic strips produced by explosion welding. Two bimetal "Ti49.4Ni50.6-AISI 304" and "Ti50Ni50Ti49.3Ni50.7" strips were deformed to 5% and subjected to ultrasonic vibrations. It was found that the strain variation initiated by the ultrasonic vibrations was characterised by a larger recovery strain and occurred at lower temperatures than during conventional heating. This was caused by the simultaneous action of the ultrasonic heating and the repeating variable stress that increased the mobility of the interfaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Niobium oxyfluoride (Nb3O7F) with excellent optoelectronic properties holds great promise for applications in photocatalysis, hydrogen production and solar cell. However, how to avoid volatile, pungent & corrosive hydrofluoric acid (HF) in Nb3O7F production is always an important issue. Here, we demonstrate a facile hydrothermal approach to prepare Nb3O7F nanowalls without adding HF. Different characterization tools have been used to analyze the phase, microstructure and photocatalytic properties. The calculated UV-vis and XPS spectra show that the bandgap (Eg) of Nb3O7F nanowalls is about 3.03 eV and valence-band maximum (VBM) is about 1.82 eV. The photocatalytic experiments show that Nb3O7F nanowalls with good stability and repeatability exhibit higher visible-light activity for degrading methylene blue (MB) than commercial P25.

AB Aligned fiber scaffolds are known to control cell behavior in vitro due to contact guidance and have potential applications as a cell carrier, ligament substrate, drug loading and release, nerve regeneration, implantable functional muscle, bone repair and meniscus tissue engineering. Aligned fiber scaffolds are often prepared by electrospinning, however in this study, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) melt spun fiber aligned scaffolds were prepared by a hot pressing method using a temperature of 60-180 degrees C. The hot pressing temperature plays an important role in surface and cross sectional morphology, dimensions, fiber parallel arrangement, thickness, pore diameter, porosity, water absorption and stress. The results indicate that PLA melt spun fiber aligned scaffolds prepared at 60 degrees C had optimum physical properties for applications in tissue engineering. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We introduced the first example of tri-modified TiO2 (Ag-C/N-TiO2) photocatalyst. This method involved preparation of CPS, deposition of TiO2 precursor, the carbonization of CPS, the immobilization and reduction of Ag +. As a result of unique microstructure, Ag-C/N-TiO2 exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than the P25, carbon-doped TiO2, silver-modified TiO2 and co-modified TiO2 because of its synergistic effect, significantly broadening unexplored area of TiO2 modification.

AB We developed sulfur-doped porous graphene frameworks as a highly efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which was prepared through MgO template directed approach by in situ sulfur doping based on the pyrolysis of p-methylbenzenesulfonic acid. The as-obtained electrocatalyst features distinctive porous graphene frameworks and uniform distribution of sulfur dopants with highly active sites. When employed for ORR, such catalyst shows pronounced catalytic activity, improved stability and better resistance toward methanol crossover than those of the commercial Pt/C, and a nearly four-electron transfer number in alkaline media.

AB Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a antiproliferative drug used in vascular scaffolds for prevention of restenosis. Nowadays, the new generation of biodegradable drug-eluting vascular scaffold is extensively developed. However, the effective method for isolation of drug from a scaffold has not been developed yet. This procedure is important because it determines accuracy of quantitative assessment of drug, which is essential for evaluation of its dose or drug remained in the device after degradation. Therefore, the aim of the study was to develop the reliable method dedicated to bioresorbable scaffolds obtained from aliphatic polyesters and polyesterocarbonates for quantitative analysis of sirolimus. The results showed good precision of the extraction with the use of solvents and time-dependency of the sonication. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Complex geometry legs were advantageous to obtain higher thermoelectric potential due to a better thermal dissipation. Among all industrial processes, additive manufacturing using a selective laser sintering (SLS) or melting (SLM) techniques is the most promising to obtain such complex-shape legs without machining step. In this work, for the first time, Higher Manganese Silicide (HMS) sheet samples were synthetized, sintered and shaped simultaneously by additive manufacturing from ball milled manganese and silicon powder. Impact of surface power density and scanning rate of the laser on the microstructural and structural properties was discussed for some SLS/M parameters. Characterizations have shown that both densification and pure HMS phase can be obtained by SLS/M. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB A novel ammonia and triethanolamine assisted sol-gel synthesis method was developed to fabricate TiO2 hollow spheres (THS). The hollow structure of TiO2 could be easily controlled by adjusting the amount of ammonia and triethanolamine. Photocatalytic activities of the THS were evaluated by the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). The results show that the anatase/rutile mixed-phase THS obtained from 850 degrees C thermal treatment exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than Degussa P25 (commercial TiO2 photocatalyst). In addition, electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the mixed-phase THS have potential applications in lithium-ion battery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, we investigate the excitation wavelength NO dependent photoluminescence (PL) behavior in Zn0.45Cd0.55S nanoparticles. The deconvoluted PL emission bands for nanopowders and nanocolloids reveal noticeable spectral blue shift with decreasing lambda(ex) accompanied by intensity enhancement. This unusual behavior is explained in terms of selective particle size distribution in nanostructures, advancing of fast ionization process at short lambda(ex); and solvation process in polar solvent. In addition, we attributed the UV-induced PL intensity enhancement and blue shift of the optical gap to the reduction in particle size by photo-corrosion process associated with the improvement in the quantum size effect; surface modification due to cross-linkage improvement of capping molecules at NPs surface; the creation of new radiative centers and the formation of photo-passivation layers from ZnSO4 and CdSO4, and photo-enhanced oxygen adsorption on Zn0.45Cd0.55S nanoparticles surface.

AB Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) now emerge as a promising new optoelectronic application field for these amazing semiconductors. For the purpose of investigating the device structures and light emission mechanisms of PeLEDs, we have fabricated green PeLEDs based on the ITO/Al2O3/CsPbBr3 heterojunction structure. The emission layer inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 film with small grain sizes (similar to 28.9 nm) was prepared using a two-step method. The device exhibits a typical rectification behavior with turn -on voltage of similar to 6 V. The EL emission band is narrow with the FWHM of similar to 25 nm. The peak EQE of the device was similar to 0.09%. The working mechanism of the device is also discussed. The result of the present work provides a feasible innovation idea of PeLEDs fabrication and great potentials for the development of perovskite based LEDs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanowires (AgNWs) with excellent conductive properties can be used to make transparent electrodes with high transmittance, low haze, high electrical conductivity, and high mechanical strength. AgNWs could be a promising material to replace indium tin oxide (ITO). In this study, a polyol method was used to synthesize one-dimension AgNWs. Molecular dynamics simulation software of the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator was applied to analyze the micro/nano-scale behavior and predict basic mechanical properties of the materials. For optical properties, a near-field electrospray was combined with ultraviolet 355-nm laser ablation process to direct-write patterning of the transparent conductive AgNWs films as electrodes. Three conductive films with various thicknesses of AgNWs prepared by the near-field electrospray process were coated on glass substrates to analyze the surface morphology and optical properties. A scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer were utilized to observe the surface morphology and material composition. An optical integrating sphere and a four-point probe were used to examine the transmittance, haze, and electrical conductivity, respectively. In this study, the optical, electrical and mechanical characteristic as a function of thickness of the films, and laser power levels were characterized. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1D In-doped ZnO (IZO) nanostructures with different morphologies, namely nanowires, nanoseries(serial), nanorods and nanoprisms, have been successfully synthesized by chemical vapour deposition method. The structural, morphology and optical properties of IZO nanowires have been characterized. The ultrafast nonlinear optical and carrier dynamics characteristics of IZO were studied using femtosecond Z-scan, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and two-color pump-probe (TCPP) technique, respectively. The TRPL showed that the luminescence decay lifetimes of about several 10 ps and nanoseconds time response scale can be attributed to the shallow trap (ST) state, and deep trap (DT) state emissions, respectively. The mechanisms of the TRPL behavior in the different emission band were analyzed. The result of TCPP experiment showed that the bleach recovery with lifetimes on the fast (100-200 ps), and slow (>1 ns) time scale, caused by the shallow donor mixed with donor bound recombination, and donor acceptor pair recombination (DAP), respectively. The optical transition process in the IZO nanostructures has demonstrated that the energy transfer process from the host electron-hole pairs can efficiently excite the metal ions. Comparing with the results obtained from the TRPL experiment, we found the fast decay process was resulted from the exciton migration and the slow decay to the recombination process of the relaxed excitons. Our results show that IZO nanostructures are a promising candidate in further optoelectronic device applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a phosphor-free dual wavelength monolithic white LED comprising a tunnel junction that separates a yellow light-emitting InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structure without an electron blocking layer (EBL) from a blue light-emitting MQW structure. Using a well-calibrated APSYS simulation software we investigate its performance in terms of output power, wall plug efficiency, and CIE plot of the emitted light and analyze its operation on the basis of band diagram, carrier distribution, EL spectra and radiative recombination rate taking into account the carrier confinement and carrier reuse effects due to removal of an EBL and incorporation of a tunnel junction, respectively. At the injection current density of 250 A/cm(2), our proposed white LED exhibits 232% improvement in output power as compared to a conventional blue LED and only 40% droop reduction of wall plug efficiency as opposed to 56% in a reported white LED. The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of the emitted light from the proposed white LED structure are found to be (0.310, 0309) at 100 A/cm(2) which signify a good quality white light emission.

AB Near-infrared absorbing dyes must be thermally stable above their processing temperatures. Here, polymer-soluble thermostable phosphate-ester copper complexes that meet these requirements are reported for use as near-infrared absorbing dyes with a wide absorption range from 700 to 1200 nm, and a weak absorbance in the visible region. C5-C12 alkyl phosphate-ester copper complexes were synthesized and their thermal stabilities were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. The previously reported acetoxy-butyl-phosphate copper complex, which contains an ester group, was also synthesized for comparison. The mass of the alkyl-phosphate-ester copper complexes remained constant up to 170 degrees C, whereas that of the acetoxy-butyl-phosphate copper complex started to decrease below 100 degrees C. Some copper complexes showed decomposition temperatures above 250 degrees C. The thermal-decomposition behavior of the n-pentyl-phosphate copper complex, cyclohexyl-phosphate copper complex and 2-ethylhexyl-phosphate copper complex was investigated by thermal-decomposition gas analysis measured by purge-and-trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Cleavage of the O-C bond was the main decomposition reaction for both complexes. The difference in the thermal stabilities of the cyclohexyl-phosphate copper complex and other alkyl-phosphate-ester copper complexes is presumed to result from their different tendencies towards cleavage of the O-C bond. The absorption spectra of the 2-ethylhexyl-phosphate copper complex and the isodecyl-phosphate copper complex showed a broad absorbance from 700 to 1200 nm and a weak absorbance in the visible region. Therefore, these compounds are suitable for window materials that require heat-shielding properties and transparency. The spectra also indicated that the structures of these copper complexes are similar regardless of the sub-stituent on the ligand. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Er3+-doped fluoride glass modified by PbF2 is developed. Upon 980 nm laser-diode excitation, intense luminescence emission around 2.71 mu m from the Er3+4I11/2 -> I-4(13/2) transition is observed. On the basis of the Judd-Ofelt theory, the intensity parameters and radiative properties are determined from the absorption and emission spectra. Compared with conventional Er3+-doped fluoride glass (Er:ZBLAN), the proposed glass possesses a large spontaneous emission probability (A(rad), 29.76 s(-1)) and a high stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(em)) at 2.71 mu m (1.25 x 10(-20) cm(2)). In addition, fibers with high strength might be drawn from the glass preform owing to its good chemical stability; therefore, it may be useful for increasing the output power of mid-infrared lasers. The results indicate that the present glass can be a good candidate for mid-infrared fiber lasers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the process of structure modification for dye-sensitizers, D-A-pi-A motif sensitizers stood out from various structures of dyes owing to their high efficiencies and long lifetimes. In this work, four novel polymeric metal complex dyes in D-A-pi-A pattern (PCZ-QCd, PCZ-QCu, PIDT-QCd and PIDT-QCu), which use Cd (II) or Cu (II) complexes as auxiliary electron acceptors, indacenodithiophene (IDT) and carbazole (CZ) derivatives as donors and 8-quinolinol derivative as it bridge and acceptors (A) were designed, synthesized and applied to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Polymers using different donors and coordination ions are discussed by testing their thermal, optical, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). All polymers show good terminal stability with decomposition temperatures (T-d) higher than 300 degrees C. There is a wide light absorption range in the near ultraviolet and visible region for the polymer (PIDT-QCd) with Cd (II) as coordination ion and IDT as donor. As a result, a highest power conversion efficiency of 6.55% was achieved by PIDT-QCd-based DSSC device. This work provides a distinctive perspective for the designing of sensitizers in DSSCs.

AB Herein, we designed and synthesized a new beta-diketonate-Eu3+ complex-based luminescent probe for peroxynitrite (ONOO-), Eu(hdph)(3)(tpy), by using a 2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-substituted beta-diketone ligand 1,1,1,2,2,3,3-hetafluoro-6-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,6-hexanedione (hdph) and a coligand 2,2',2 ''-terpyridine (tpy). The probe exhibits strong fluorescence with a great quantum yield of 25.6%. Upon the addition of ONOO-, the luminescence of Eu(hdph)(3)(tpy) at 607 nm was dramatically quenched due to the interaction of the 2,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety with ONOO-, which leads to the deactivation of the excited Eu3+ complex and a 71-fold luminescence decrease. The dose-dependent luminescence decrease showed good linear relationship against the ONOO- concentration with the detection limit at nano molar concentration level. In addition, the luminescence response of Eu(hdph)(3)(tpy) to ONOO- displayed high specificity over various reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity and specificity, Eu(hdph)(3)(tpy) was applied for the time-gated luminescence imaging of ONOO- in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated the practical applicability of Eu(hdph)(3)(tpy) as a luminescent probe for the long-term visualization of intracellular ONOO-. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of silver thin films were realized by CO2 laser irradiation. The effects of laser irradiation on the structure, morphology and optical property of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-VIS-NIR double beam spectrometer and Raman system, respectively. XRD patterns show that laser irradiation has the effects of improving grain growth and orientation of Ag thin films. With laser irradiation power increasing, the topography of as-irradiated silver thin films were observed to develop discontinuous nano-ellipsoid structure with a red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance wavelength in visible region. Both the various ellipsoid sizes and the states of aggregation of as irradiated silver thin films contributed to increase significantly the sensitivity of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Additionally, the simulation result of Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) was proved to be in good agreement with that of the experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Luminescent properties of Yb,Er:YAG transparent ceramics containing 5 at% Yb3+ and 0.5, 1 and 1.5 at%, respectively, Er3+ ions have been studied. It has been found that increasing of erbium ions concentration increases both efficiency of nonradiative energy transfer Yb3+ -> Er3+ (which reaches 72% for 1.5 at% Er3+) and the luminescence in the range of 650-700 nm associated with F-4(9/2), (11/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions of Er3+ ions. It was also determined that the concentration quenching of sensitized luminescence of Er3+ ions at 1532 nm is associated with secondary excitation of metastable energy level of Er3+ followed by up conversion emission.

AB A new low-cost optimized hydrothermal process of direct synthesis of ZnO nanowires (NWs)/graphene oxide (GO) hybrid on silicon substrates at a low growth temperature ( similar to 60 degrees C) is reported. The careful optimization of the growth conditions and ZnO/GO relative ratios have resulted in high-density ZnO NWs formation with homogenous density and size distributions directly on GO sheets. The fabricated nano composites were intensively investigated by employing different structural, optical and electrical characterization techniques such as SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, UV-VIS and I-V. SEM analysis showed a formation of highly dense ZnO NWs on GO sheets with homogenous size distributions with average approximate diameter and length of 70 nm and 310 nm, respectively. The EDX combined with FTIR and XRD measurements confirmed the exact chemical composition of the intended structure. The room-temperature UV-VIS spectra revealed an enhance optical absorption of UV-light at an absorption band centered at 370 nm. Under UV-excitation a significant photocurrent increase has been observed. This is can be attributed to the large surface to volume ratio in ZnO-NWs structure, which is associated with oxygen desorption at the large ZnO-NWs surfaces that reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated free charge carriers. The optimum electrical and optical properties of the device have been observed at ZnO-NWs/Go relative ratio of 1:5. These findings could be promising for potential enhanced UV-detectors and flexible optoelectronics devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tm3+/Yb3+:Y2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by solution combustion method. The prepared NPs are confirmed to be pure cubic Y2O3 phase with the mean size of about 45 nm by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Under 980 nm excitation, the temperature dependent upconversion (UC) emission spectra of the NPs are obtained. It is found that the NPs show color tunability with a variation in temperature (from blue to almost white) and also a relatively good suppression of temperature quenching (i.e. similar to 70.4% of the initial intensity at 473 K). By using the fluorescent intensity ratio (FIR) technique, the temperature sensing behaviors are investigated based on the thermal coupled (1)G(4(a)) (477 nm) and 1040) (490 nm) levels and non-thermal coupled 3F(2,3) (684 nm) and (1)G(4(b)) (490 nm) levels from Tm3+ ions, respectively. The results demonstrate that both the absolute sensitivity (S-o) and relative sensitivity (S-r) values based on non-thermal coupled levels of 3F(2,3) and 1040) is larger in the experimental temperature range. The maximum S-o and S-r values are obtained to be similar to 1170 x 10(-4)K(-1) at 573 K and similar to 1.51%K-1 at 445 K, respectively. Therefore, the studied material is a potential multifunctional composite for optical thermometry and temperature safety sign. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparative study of the structural properties of the powders obtained by XRD analysis and Raman spectroscopy was carried out. The formation of rare earth oxides solid solutions throughout the studied compositional range was confirmed. The presence of residual hydroxyl groups in the resulting powders, most notable for scandia, was demonstrated. The broadening of Yb3+ ions luminescence bands in the matrices of structurally disordered mixed oxides was ascertained in comparison with individual rare earth oxides from 16 nm for Yb:Sc2O3 up to 25 nm for Yb-0.1(Y0.75Sc0.25)(1.9)O-3.

AB Nascent academic entrepreneurs need to acquire entrepreneurial competencies to create successful spin-off ventures. In this article, we examine difficulties in this pursuit prior to venture formation and offer a systematic classification of inhibitors. We confirm, combine, and extend two previously identified inhibiting mechanisms into a relational inhibitor category, classify additional structural and cultural-cognitive inhibitors, and highlight how these inhibitors exist both at the individual and the organizational level. We then advance theoretical understanding of the interrelated, multilevel functions of inhibitors on the development of entrepreneurial competencies, and offer policy insights on how universities can mitigate their effects.

AB The question this article addresses is, how far from its optimal level can an innovation policy be implemented at, yet still improve social welfare relative to the laissez-faire outcome? The concern for policymakers is that even an intervention which enhances welfare if set at its optimal magnitude might actually make matters worse if implemented to the wrong degree. Understanding the performance of suboptimal policy levels is practically important, since the complexity and uncertainty of innovation make optimal policy magnitudes elusive in the real world. The model developed herein to investigate this issue is an R&D rivalry game where firms invest in R&D, then engage in Cournot competition. A policymaker seeks to improve welfare by choosing the levels of an R&D subsidy and consumer price subsidy. Results show that the welfare improvement window, defined as the set of all policy levels that improve social welfare, can be worryingly narrow. However, certain features of an innovation process and market lead to wider welfare improvement windows, such as stronger spillovers and moderately costly R&D. Policymakers stand a better chance of improving social welfare by intervening where these features are present.

AB We view ambidexterity as a paradox whereby its components, exploration and exploitation, generate persistent and conflicting demands on an organization. Drawing on the attention based view of the firm (ABV), we examine three antecedents of organizational ambidexterity that reflect ABV's three principles - the principle of focus of attention; the principle of situated attention; and the principle of structural distribution of attention. Specifically, we examine the influence of top management team (TMT) composition, whether or not the firm has a clear written vision, and the extent to which organizational attention is focused on investments in R&D, and continuous improvement. We empirically validate our model on a sample of 422 small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK and fmd that ambidexterity is supported by a blend of integration and differentiation approaches.

AB We study the interaction between supply- and demand-side factors and its effect on innovation. Employing a quasi-natural experiment, we show that a shift in demand has an impact on innovation and this effect is conditional on an enabling supply-side environment. Specifically, we exploit a shift in product demand generated by Medicare approvals for reimbursement coverage of medical devices. Using a triple-difference approach, we find that innovation is significantly greater for medical device firms that experience a positive shock to demand due to the Medicare approvals when the firms are exposed to a more favorable supply-side environment. The highest level of innovation is accomplished when all three of our supply-side factors: venture capital (industry), universities (academia), and National Institutes of Health grants (government) are concentrated in one place. These findings show that (i) a positive interaction between supply- and demand-side factors fosters innovation, and (ii) the trilateral intersection of industry, academia, and government creates the highest level of innovation.

AB Consumers innovate usually for non-commercial motives. They generally lack incentives to diffuse, and this is expected to hamper first adoption - even if consumer innovations are valuable to many other people. We confirm this market failure with survey data of 164 German consumer innovators. First adoption by others is unrelated with general use value, unless the innovator is highly willing to commercialize. Next, as classical diffusion theory does not explain when consumer innovations become available to others, we propose an individual-object process (I-O-P) framework to study factors alleviating the market failure. The viability of the framework is explored by studying the moderating role of entrepreneurial experience (I), product newness (0) and community engagement during the innovation process (P). First adoption of generally valuable consumer innovations is enhanced when a community was involved. We also find tentative evidence for a moderating role of entrepreneurial experience and product newness.

AB In a study of 243 firms of varying sizes across 14 different industries, we investigate the effect of customer participation on new product development performance. We confirm that overall customer participation is positively related to new product development performance and that the effect is mediated by innovativeness. We also demonstrate that these effects are contingent upon absorptive capacity of the firm in question such that firms with high absorptive capacity stand to gain more from engaging their customers in new product development than firms with low absorptive capacity, especially at the later stages of the NPD process. The results are robust to alternative estimation techniques, measures employed to operationalize key concepts, and the industrial makeup of the sample. Post hoc analyses provide non-trivial managerial implications for the decision makers at the firm level.

AB Background: The concept of clinical control in COPD has been developed to help in treatment decisions, but it requires validation in prospective studies.
   Method: This international, multicenter, prospective study aimed to validate the concept of control in COPD [ control = stability ( no exacerbations or impairment in CAT scores) + low impact ( low level of symptoms)]. Data from the screening visit was used to: investigate the level of control, compare characteristics of patients according to the control status, and perform a sensitivity analysis of the levels of control using either clinical criteria or questionnaires ( COPD Assessment Test -CAT- or Clinical COPD Questionnaire -CCQ-).
   Results: A total of 314 patients were analysed, mean age was 68.5 years and mean FEV1 was 52.6% of predicted. According to the prespecified criteria 21% of patients were classified as controlled, all of them with mild/moderate COPD ( Body mass index, Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exacerbations, -BODEx- index <5). A high level of dyspnea, a high CAT score or an exacerbation in the previous 3 months were found, using univariate analysis, to be the main reasons for patients not being classified as controlled. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, chronic bronchitis and having exacerbations in the previous year were associated with uncontrolled COPD. Changing the severity cut off of BODEx from 5 to 3 did not change significantly the percentage of patients fulfilling the criteria of control.
   Conclusions: The proposed criteria of control were only fulfilled by 21% of patients. The suggested cut offs and their predictive value for poor outcomes need to be refined in prospective studies.

AB Subatmospheric pleural pressure ( Ppl), which is approximately -3 to -5 cm H2O at functional residual capacity ( FRC) makes pleura a unique organ in the human body. The negative Ppl is critical for maintaining the lungs in a properly inflated state and for proper blood circulation within the thorax. Significant and sudden pleural pressure changes associated with major pleural pathologies, as well as therapeutic interventions may be associated with life-threatening complications.
   The pleural pressure may show two different values depending on the measurement method applied. These are called pleural liquid pressure and pleural surface pressure. It should also be realized that there are significant differences in pleural pressure distribution in pneumothorax and pleural effusion. In pneumothorax, the pressure is the same throughout the pleural space, while in pleural effusion there is a vertical gradient of approximately 1 cm H2O/cm in the pleural pressure associated with the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column.
   Currently, two main methods of pleural pressure measurement are used: simple water manometers and electronic systems. The water manometers are conceptually simple, cheap and user-friendly but they only allow the estimation of the mean values of pleural pressure. The electronic systems for pleural pressure measurement are based on pressure transducers. Their major advantages include precise measurements of instantaneous pleural pressure and the ability to display and to store a large amount of data. The paper presents principles and details of pleural pressure measurement as well as the rationale for its use.

AB Background: The association of the polyphenol content of human diet with pulmonary function is not yet fully understood. This study aims at evaluating the association of polyphenol consumption with lung function in a novel holistic approach.
   Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of 4551 women and 5108 men ( age >= 35 years) from the Moli-sani study was performed. Participants were randomly recruited from the general population. The EPIC-FFQ was used for the dietary assessment. Polyphenol intakes were calculated using Eurofir-eBASIS, and a polyphenol antioxidant content ( PAC) score was constructed to assess the total content of the diet in these nutrients. Pulmonary function maneuvers were performed, and the forced vital capacity ( FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second ( FEV1) were measured; FVC% predicted and FEV1% predicted were computed using the European Community of Coal and Steel prediction equations that included height and age.
   Results: In both genders, in age, height, and energy intake adjusted models, the majority of classes of polyphenols ( mg/day) showed a positive association with FEV1, FVC, FEV1% predicted, and FVC% predicted ( beta-coef > 0, P < .05). Associations remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors in most cases (beta-coef > 0, P <.05). The PAC score was associated in both genders with an increase in pulmonary function parameters ( beta-coef > 0, P <.05). The inclusion of white blood cell ( WBC) counts in the multivariate model reduced the association in men but not in women.
   Conclusions: A higher overall polyphenol content of human diet was associated with better pulmonary function in a general population. The association might be partially mediated by WBC in men.

AB This is a unique state of the art review written by a group of 21 international recognized experts in the field that gathered during a meeting organized by the European Neuromuscular Centre ( ENMC) in Naarden, March 2017. It systematically reports the entire evidence base for airway clearance techniques ( ACTs) in both adults and children with neuromuscular disorders ( NMD). We not only report randomised controlled trials, which in other systematic reviews conclude that there is a lack of evidence base to give an opinion, but also include case series and retrospective reviews of practice. For this review, we have classified ACTs as either proximal ( cough augmentation) or peripheral ( secretion mobilization). The review presents descriptions; standard definitions; the supporting evidence for and limitations of proximal and peripheral ACTs that are used in patients with NMD; as well as providing recommendations for objective measurements of efficacy, specifically for proximal ACTs. This state of the art review also highlights how ACTs may be adapted or modified for specific contexts ( e.g. in people with bulbar insufficiency; children and infants) and recommends when and how each technique should be applied.

AB Rationale: Airway colonization by Potentially Pathogenic Microorganisms ( PPM) in bronchiectasis is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The electronic nose is a non-invasive technology capable of distinguishing volatile organic compounds ( VOC) in exhaled breath. We aim to explore if an electronic nose can reliably discriminate airway bacterial colonization in patients with bronchiectasis.
   Methods: Seventy-three clinically stable bronchiectasis patients were included. PPM presence was determined using sputum culture. Exhaled breath was collected in Tedlar bags and VOC breath-prints were detected by the electronic nose Cyranose 320(R). Raw data was reduced to three factors with principal component analysis. Univariate ANOVA followed by post-hoc least significant difference test was performed with these factors. Patients were then classified using linear canonical discriminant analysis. Cross-validation accuracy values were defined by the percentage of correctly classified patients.
   Results: Forty-one (56%) patients were colonized with PPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=27, 66%) and Haemophilus influenzae ( n=7, 17%) were the most common PPM. VOC breath-prints from colonized and non-colonized patients were significantly different ( accuracy of 72%, AUROC 0.75, p < 0.001). VOC breath-prints from Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized patients were significantly different from those of patients colonized with other PPM ( accuracy of 89%, AUROC 0.97, p < 0.001) and non-colonized patients ( accuracy 73%, AUROC 0.83, p=0.007).
   Conclusions: An electronic nose can accurately identify VOC breath-prints of clinically stable bronchiectasis patients with airway bacterial colonization, especially in those with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB Objectives/Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common disorder, which can manifest in isolation or in combination with other neurological or psychiatric disorders. We know relatively little about the mechanisms underlying the development of EDS and the clinical management of patients with EDS remains an unmet need. In this study, we hypothesised that thalamic dopaminergic function would be altered in subjects with EDS and we sought to investigate this by assessing [I-123] FP-CIT Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) data, which is a molecular imaging marker of dopamine transporter (DAT).
   Patients/Methods: We performed a case-control study using people registered as healthy subjects in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. We assessed and compared semi-quantified [123I] FPCIT-SPECT in two groups of 21 healthy subjects with and without EDS, who were matched for age, gender, years of education and Rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) Questionnaire scores.
   Results: Our findings show increased thalamic DAT binding in people with EDS compared to matched healthy subjects without EDS. Higher thalamic DAT binding also correlated with worse EDS scores.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that increased dopaminergic function in the thalamus may mediate excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CPAP ADHERENCE; FOLLOW-UP; MORTALITY; COHORT; ADULTS; RISK
AB Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is a highly effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, poor adherence is a limiting factor, and a significant proportion of patients are unable to tolerate CPAP. The aim of this study was to determine predictors of long-term non-compliance with CPAP.
   Methods: CPAP treatment was prescribed to all consecutive patients with moderate or severe OSAS (AHI >= 15 events/h) (n = 295) who underwent a full-night CPAP titration study at home between February 1, 2002 and December 1, 2016. Adherence was defined as CPAP use for at least 4 h per night and five days per week. Subjects had periodical follow-up visits including clinical and biochemical evaluation and assessment of adherence to CPAP.
   Results: Median follow-up observation was 74.8 (24.2/110.9) months. The percentage of OSAS patients adhering to CPAP was 41.4% (42.3% in males and 37.0% in females), and prevalence was significantly higher in severe OSAS than in moderate (51.8% vs. 22.1%; p < 0.001; respectively). At multivariate analysis, lower severity of OSAS (HR = 0.66; CI 95 0.46-0.94) p < 0.023), cigarette smoking (HR = 1.72; CI 95 1.13-2.61); p = 0.011), and previous cardiovascular events (HR = 1.95; CI 95 1.03-3.70; p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of long-term non-adherence to CPAP after controlling for age, gender, and metabolic syndrome.
   Conclusions: In our cohort of patients with moderate/severe OSAS who were prescribed CPAP therapy, long-term compliance to treatment was present in less than half of the patients. Adherence was positively associated with OSAS severity and negatively associated with cigarette smoking and previous cardiovascular events at baseline. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim was to study, with a developmental approach, the longitudinal association between night-waking from age 2 to 5-6 years and behavior at age 5-6 years.
   Methods: Within the French birth cohort study Etude sur les Determinants pre et post natals du developpement et de la sante de l'ENfant (EDEN), repeated measures of children's night-waking were collected at age 2, 3 and 5-6 through parental questionnaires and were used to model night-waking trajectories. Behavior was assessed with the "Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire," which provides five subscales measuring a child's conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relation problems, antisocial behavior, and hyperactivity/attention problems. The behavioral subscales were dichotomized at the tenth percentile. Multivariable logistic regressions, adjusted for parents' socio-economic factors, parental characteristics, and children's characteristics and sleep habits allowed us to study, in 1143 children, the association between night-waking trajectories from 2 to 5-6 years and behavior at age 5-6 years.
   Results: The " 2 to 5-6 rare night-waking" trajectory represented 78% of the included population (n = 896), and the " 2 to 5-6 common night-waking" 22% (n = 247%). Children belonging to the " 2 to 5-6 common night-waking trajectory" had, at age 5-6, increased risk of presenting emotional symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.27-3.70, p = 0.004), conduct problems (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.00-2.65, p = 0.050), and hyperactivity/attention problems (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.00-2.57, p = 0.049). After adjusting for baseline behavior at age two years, only the association with emotional symptoms remained significant (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.15-3.55, p = 0.015). Results did not differ according to sex.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that the persistence of night-waking difficulties in early years is positively associated with emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, and conduct problems. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) is a protein toxin commonly found in snake venom. It has many applications, ranging from biotechnology to potential anticancer therapeutics. LAAO converts L-amino acid into a-keto acid and release ammonia and hydrogen peroxide as by-products. Induction of oxidative stress in cancer cells is one of the cancer treatment strategies as controlled and targeted release of hydrogen peroxide can theoretically induce sufficient oxidative stress to kill cancer cells. Furthermore, L-amino acid oxidase has been shown to selectively bind to cell membranes of specific phospholipid composition and deliver the hydrogen peroxide to localized regions on the cell surface. In this mini review, we discuss the relevance of L-amino acid oxidase, in terms of its structure and enzyme activity, its potential as a cytotoxic agent and exploitation of its cytotoxic nature as an anticancer therapeutic.

AB Okadaic Acid (OA) is a marine toxin responsible for DSP (Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning) in humans produced by dinoflagellate. The genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of OA have been well reported in mammalian experimental animals and in vitro cultured cells. However, there are no available investigations regarding the involvement of the oxidative stress pathways in OA toxicity, especially on aquatic animals such as fish. In this context, we aimed in the present work to demonstrate whether OA (7.5 mu g/ml) induces oxidative stress and histopathological damages in the fish species Sparus aurata under short term exposure (2 h, 4 h and 24 h). To this end, we have assessed lipid peroxidation and anti-oxidative stress response in liver tissue, and finally ultrastructural changes were investigated in hepatic and gills tissues. Our results clearly showed that OA induced significant enhancement in all tested parameters in a time dependent manner and seems to be a strong inducer of oxidative stress in aquatic animals. The data of the present study indicate also that histology is a successful tool to reveal OA impact on liver and gill tissues of Sparus aurata since the animal showed vascular dilation and hepatocellular membrane disintegration in liver and hypertrophy in secondary lamellae and necrotic aspect in the primary lamellae in gill tissue.

AB Azaspiracid (AZA) producing microalgae have been reported internationally and could potentially impact a variety of seafood. Scallops (Chlamys farreri) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from China were fed with the AZA2 producer, Azadinium poporum, to study uptake, metabolism and oxidative stress in the shellfish. LC-MS/MS showed significant accumulation and differential metabolism of AZA2 in the scallops and mussels. In mussels AZA2 was metabolized to AZA19, with subsequent decarboxylation to AZA6. In scallops no AZA19 or AZA6 was observed, however, a novel AZA metabolite was formed that is isobaric with AZA19 ([M+H](1), m/z 886), but elutes at a different retention time. In addition it was noted that the scallop metabolite was stable during heating, while AZA19 has been shown to decarboxylate. Concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activities of antioxidant enzymes were monitored. ROS levels increased slightly in the meat of scallops and mussels due to starvation in the acclimation and depuration periods, but reduced in the feeding periods with non-toxic Isocluysis galbana or toxic A. poporum. No obvious variations were found in activities for a range of antioxidant enzymes. These results provide new insights on the potential for accumulation and metabolism of AZAs in bivalve species relevant to this area of China, which is of importance considering the recent finding of AZA producing microalgae in the region.

AB In this study, the toxicology of A. exitialis, a lethal mushroom found in China, and the toxicokinetics of peptide toxins contained in it were evaluated. Beagles were fed A. exitialis powder (20 or 60 mg/kg) in starch capsules, after which they were assessed for signs of toxicity, as well as biochemical and pathological changes. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to assay the peptide toxins. The total peptide toxins in A. exitialis was 3482.6 +/- 124.94 mg/kg. The beagles showed signs of toxicity, such as vomiting and diarrhea, at 12-48 h following ingestion of A. exitialis. Furthermore, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels in plasma, as well as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time peaked at 36 h post A. exitialis ingestion. Furthermore, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels peaked at 48 h after A. exitialis ingestion. Three dogs that were administered 60 mg/kg A. exitialis died at 24-72 h after ingesting the capsules. Additionally, liver histopathological examinations showed hemorrhagic necrosis of hepatocytes. alpha-Amanitin, beta-amanitin, and phallacidin were rapidly absorbed and eliminated from plasma after A. exitialis was ingested. A long latency period (12-24 h post A. exitialis ingestion) was observed in the dogs before the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. There was acute liver damage thereafter. Gastric lavage and enhanced plasma clearance methods such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or plasma exchange may be ineffective in removing amatoxins from blood at 12 h post A. exitialis ingestion. Enhanced excretion of amatoxins in urine could be effective within 2 days after ingestion of A. exitialis because amatoxins in 0-2 d urine accounted for more than 90% of the total urine excretion.

AB Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is used for an increasing number of neurological and non-neurological indications and disorders. Since the duration of action of this neurotoxin is limited, the goal of the work was to improve the pharmacological time course of BoNT. We explored the effect of several polysaccharides on the duration of action of BoNT/A1 in rat electromyography. The formulation of BoNT/A1 containing globular chitosan increased the threshold stimulation intensity almost 2 times in 30 days after injection if compared with the baseline threshold. However, conventional linear chitosan, heparin and hyaluronic acid did not have such an effect. In addition, we compared the effectiveness of different doses of BoNT/A1 (25, 50, 75, and 100 U) with globular chitosan and compared the acute toxicity of this formulation with that of BoNT/A1 in physiological saline after intramuscular injection. The results demonstrated that the dose 25 U of BoNT/A1 with globular chitosan was both effective and safe for animals after intramuscular injection. The assessed median lethal dose (LD50) for intramuscular injection in rats was 1.4 times higher for a combination of BoNT/A1 with globular chitosan than that for a solution of BoNT/A1 in physiological saline. Thus, the results of our study have provided evidence that intramuscular injection of the formulation of BoNT/A1 (25 U) containing globular chitosan in rats is safe and significantly prolongs the effective duration time of BoNT/A1.

AB Palythoa caribaeorum is a very common colonial zoanthid in the coastal reefs of Brazil. It is known for its massive production of mucus, which is traditionally used in folk medicine by fishermen in northeastern Brazil. This study identified biologically active compounds in P caribaerum mucus. Crude mucus was collected during low tides by the manual scraping of colonies; samples were maintained in an ice bath, homogenized, and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 hat 4 degrees C; the supernatant (mucus) was kept at -80 degrees C until use. The enzymatic (proteolytic and phospholipase A(2)), inhibitory (metallo, cysteine and serine proteases), and hemagglutinating (human erythrocyte) activities were determined. The results showed high levels of cysteine and metallo proteases, intermediate levels of phosholipase A(2), low levels of trypsin, and no elastase and chymotrypsin like activities. The mucus showed potent inhibitory activity on snake venom metalloproteases and cysteine proteinase papain. In addition, it showed agglutinating activity towards O+, B+, and A(+) erythrocyte types. The hemostatic results showed that the mucus prolongs the aPTT and PT, and strongly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, collagen, epinephrine, ADP, and thrombin. The antimicrobial activity was tested on 15 strains of bacteria and fungi through the radial diffusion assay in agar, and no activity was observed. Compounds in P. caribaeorum mucus were analyzed for the first time in this study, and our results show potential pharmacological activities in these compounds, which are relevant for use in physiopathological investigations. However, the demonstration of these activities indicates caution in the use of crude mucus in folk medicine. Furthermore, the present or absent activities identified in this mucus suggest that the studied P caribaeorum colonies were in thermal stress conditions at the time of sample collection; these conditions may precede the bleaching process in zoanthids. Hence, the use of mucus as an indicator of this process should be evaluated in the future. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Elemental sulfur (S-0) is always produced during bio-denitrification and desulfurization process, but the S-0 yield and purification quality are too low. Till now, no feasible approach has been carried out to efficiently recover S-0. In this study, we report the S-0 generation and recovery by a newly designed, compact, biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor (BfMFR), where S-0 was generated within a Thauera sp. strain HDD-formed biofilm on membrane surface, and then timely separated from the biofilm through membrane filtration. The high S-0 generation efficiency (98% in average) was stably maintained under the operation conditions with the influent acetate, nitrate and sulfide concentration of 115, 120 and 100 mg/L, respectively, an initial inoculum volume of approximate 2.4 x 10(8) cells, and a membrane pore size of 0.45 mu m. Under this condition, the sulfide loading approached 62.5 kg/m(3)center dot d, one of the highest compared with the previous reports, demonstrating an efficient sulfide removal and S-0 generation capacity. Particular important, a solid analysis of the effluent revealed that the recovered S-0 was adulterated with barely microorganisms, extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), or inorganic chemicals, indicating a fairly high S-0 recovery purity. Membrane biofilm analysis revealed that 80.7% of the generated S-0 was accomplished within 45-80 mu m of biofilm from the membrane surface and while, the complete membrane fouling due to bacteria and EPSs was generally observed after 14-16 days. The in situ generation and timely separation of S-0 from the bacterial group by BfMFR, effectively avoids the sulfur circulation (S2- to S-0, S-0 to SO42-, SO42- to HS-) and guarantees the high S-0 recovery efficiency and purity, is considered as a feasible approach for S-0 recovery from sulfide- and nitrate-contaminated wastewater.

AB Previous work has demonstrated that pre-treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) with free nitrous acid (FNA i.e. HNO2) enhances the biodegradability of WAS, identified by a 20-50% increase in specific methane production in biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. This suggests that FNA pre-treatment would enhance the destruction of volatile solids (VS) in an anaerobic sludge digester, and reduce overall sludge disposal costs, provided that the dewaterability of the digested sludge is not negatively affected. This study experimentally evaluates the impact of FNA pre-treatment on the VS destruction in anaerobic sludge digestion and on the dewaterability of digested sludge, using continuously operated bench-scale anaerobic digesters. Pre-treatment of full-scale WAS for 24 h at an FNA concentration of 1.8 mg NN/L enhanced VS destruction by 17 +/- 1% (from 29.2 +/- 0.9% to 34.2 +/- 1.1%) and increased dewaterability (centrifuge test) from 12.4 +/- 0.4% to 14.1 +/- 0.4%. Supporting the VS destruction data, methane production increased by 16 1%. Biochemical methane potential tests indicated that the final digestate stability was also improved with a lower potential from FNA treated digestate. Further, a 2.1 +/- 0.2 log improvement in pathogen reduction was also achieved. With inorganic solids representing 15-22% of the full-scale WAS used, FNA pre-treatment resulted in a 16-17% reduction in the volume of dewatered sludge for final disposal.

AB Algae and cyanobacteria frequently require separation from liquid media in both water treatment and algae culturing for biotechnology applications. The effectiveness of cell separation using a novel dissolved air flotation process that incorporates positively charged bubbles (PosiDAF) has recently been of interest but has been shown to be dependent on the algae or cyanobacteria species tested. Previously, it was hypothesised that algal organic matter (AOM) could be impacting the separation efficiency. Hence, this study investigates the influence of AOM on cell separation using PosiDAF, in which bubbles are modified using a commercially available cationic polyelectrolyte poly(N, N-diallyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). The separation of Chlorella vulgaris CS-42/7, Mychonastes homosphaera CS 556/01 and two strains of Microcystis aeruginosa (CS-564/01 and CS-555/1), all of which have similar cell morphology but different AOM character, was investigated. By testing the cell separation in the presence and absence of AOM, it was determined that AOM enhanced cell separation for all the strains but to different extents depending on the quantity and composition of carbohydrates and proteins in the AOM. By extracting AOM from the strain for which optimal separation was observed and adding it to the others, cell separation improved from <55% to >90%. This was attributed to elevated levels of acidic carbohydrates as well as glycoprotein-carbohydrate conjugations, which in turn were related to the nature and quantity of proteins and carbohydrates present in the AOM. Therefore, it was concluded that process optimisation requires an in-depth understanding of the AOM and its components. If culturing algae for biotechnology applications, this indicates that strain selection is not only important with respect to high value product content, but also for cell separation.

AB To demonstrate the effectiveness of UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) to disinfect water, UV-LEDs at peak emission wavelengths of 265, 280, and 300 nm were adopted to inactivate pathogenic species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella pneumophila, and surrogate species, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis spores, and bacteriophage Q beta in water, compared to conventional low-pressure UV lamp emitting at 254 nm. The inactivation profiles of each species showed either a linear or sigmoidal survival curve, which both fit well with the Geeraerd's model. Based on the inactivation rate constant, the 265-nm UV-LED showed most effective fluence, except for with E. coli which showed similar inactivation rates at 265 and 254 nm. Electrical energy consumption required for 3-log(10) inactivation (E-E,3) was lowest for the 280-nm UV-LED for all microbial species tested. Taken together, the findings of this study determined the inactivation profiles and kinetics of both pathogenic bacteria and surrogate species under UV-LED exposure at different wavelengths. We also demonstrated that not only inactivation rate constants, but also energy efficiency should be considered when selecting an emission wavelength for UV LEDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the occurrence, removal and risk of 42 organic micropollutants (MPs), including 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 12 endocrine disrupting chemicals, in 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) distributed across China. The composition profiles of different MP categories in the influent, effluent, and excess sludge were explored and the aqueous removal efficiencies of MPs were determined. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacies of different wastewater treatment processes in eliminating MPs. Results indicate that different MP categories showed quite similar distributions among the studied WWTPs, with phenolic estrogenic compounds (PEs), macrolides, and fluoroquinolones being always dominant in the influent, effluent and excess sludge. Tetracyclines, bezafibrate, caffeine, steroid estrogens, and PEs showed high and stable aqueous removal efficiencies, whereas other MPs showed considerably varied aqueous removal efficiencies. Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process combined with a moving-bed biofilm reactor achieved the highest aqueous removal of MPs among various secondary treatment processes. A combined process consisting of ultrafiltration, ozonation and CIO2 disinfection resulted in the highest removal of MPs among the tertiary treatment processes. Sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, estrone, and bisphenol A in the effluent, as well as beta-estradiol 3-sulfate in the excess sludge could pose high risks. This study draws an overall picture about the current status of MPs in WWTPs across China and provides useful information for better control of the risks associated with MPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for biofuel production and treatment of wastewater sludge. The current study investigates a novel utilization of biomass-assisted filtration of primary sludge to obtain high dry matter (DM) content sludge. Drastic improvements in filtration speed are achieved using different types of lignocellulosic biomass filter aids prepared via mechanical pretreatment. The combined sludge-biomass filter cake is subsequently used as a feedstock for HTL and shows superior bio-crude yields and properties compared to their individual counterparts. The chemical energy recovery to bio-crude is increased to 75% compared to 46% for biomass and 67% for sludge on its own. The increased DM content of filter cakes (similar to 25%) compared to primary sludge (5%) increases the energy efficiency of HTL of primary sludge by a factor of 4.5. Introducing a biomass filteraid-HTL combination to a wastewater treatment plant would reduce the organic carbon load to treat by 62%. By combining sludge with lignocellulosic biomass the use of alkali catalyst can be avoided entirely which represents a major cost factor in HTL of lignocellulosics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecological degradation of streams remains a major environmental concern worldwide. While stream restoration has received considerable attention, mitigation efforts focused on the improvement of physical habitat have not proven completely effective. Several small-scale studies have emphasized that effective restoration strategies require a more holistic understanding of the variables at play, although the generalization of the findings based on the small-scale studies remains unclear. Using a comprehensive statewide stream monitoring database from West Virginia (WV), a detailed landscape dataset, and a machine learning algorithm, this study explores the interactive impacts of water quality and physical habitat on stream ecosystem health as indicated by benthic macroinvertebrate scores. Given the long history of energy extraction in this region (i.e., coal mining and oil/gas production), investigation of energy extraction influences is highlighted. Our results demonstrate that a combination of good habitat and low specific conductance is generally associated with favorable benthic macroinvertebrate scores, whereas poor habitat combined with water quality conditions typically indicative of high ionic strength are associated with impaired stream status. In addition, streams impacted by both energy extraction and residential development had a higher percentage of impairment compared to those impacted predominantly by energy extraction or residential development alone. While water quality played a more important role in the ecosystem health of streams impacted primarily by energy extraction activities, habitat seems to be more influential in streams impacted by residential development. Together, these findings emphasize that stream restoration strategies should consider interactive effects of multiple environmental stressors tailored to specific sites or site types - as opposed to considering a single stressor or multiple stressors separately.

AB Insufficient oxygen supply is identified as one of the major factors limiting organic pollutant and nitrogen (N) removal in constructed wetlands (CWs). This study designed a novel aerated vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) using waste gas from biological wastewater treatment systems to improve pollutant removal in CWs, its potential in purifying waste gas was also identified. Compared with unaerated VFCW, the introduction of waste gas significantly improved NH4+-N and TN removal efficiencies by 128.48 +/- 3.13% and 59.09 +/- 2.26%, respectively. Furthermore, the waste gas ingredients, including H2S, NH3, greenhouse gas (N2O) and microbial aerosols, were remarkably reduced after passing through the VFCW. The removal efficiencies of H2S, NH3 and N2O were 77.78 +/- 3.46%, 52.17 +/- 2.53%, and 87.40 +/- 3.89%, respectively. In addition, the bacterial and fungal aerosols in waste gas were effectively removed with removal efficiencies of 42.72 +/- 3.21% and 47.89 +/- 2.82%, respectively. Microbial analysis results revealed that the high microbial community abundance in the VFCW, caused by the introduction of waste gas from the sequencing batch reactor (SBR), led to its optimized nitrogen transformation processes. These results suggested that the VFCW intermittently aerated with waste gas may have potential application for purifying wastewater treatment plant effluent and waste gas, simultaneously.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of freezing and cold storage at 4 degrees C on bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentration and SEC fractions determined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as well as on spectral properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy. In order to account for differences in DOM composition and source we analyzed storage effects for three different sample types, including a lake water sample representing freshwater DOM, a leaf litter leachate of Phragmites australis representing a terrestrial, 'fresh' DOM source and peatland porewater samples. According to our findings one week of cold storage can bias DOC and DON determination. Overall, the determination of DOC and DON concentration with SEC analysis for all three sample types were little susceptible to alterations due to freezing. The findings derived for the sampling locations investigated here may not apply for other sampling locations and/or sample types. However, DOC size fractions and DON concentration of formerly frozen samples should be interpreted with caution when sample concentrations are high. Alteration of some optical properties (HIX and SUVA(254)) due to freezing were evident, and therefore we recommend immediate analysis of samples for spectral analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Better understanding the responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals is a key for considering using riverbed sediment bacterial community as an indicator of river water contamination by heavy metals. For this, integrated evaluation based on bacterial density, activity and community structure through incubation experiments under well-controlled conditions is necessary to obtain more closely relevant findings that are difficult to achieve through field studies. The findings may also include those that can serve as new evidence to clarify contrary findings reported in previous studies. In this study, sequencing batch incubation experiments were performed using sediment suspensions from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses. The effects of four metals (Pb, Cr, Cd and Cu) were investigated by spiking them separately under three different concentration levels. Glucose was added once every day as the carbon source throughout the whole incubation lasted for 30 days. The changing trends of the density of general and heterotrophic bacteria showed clearly that the responses of sediment bacteria to Cu were obviously stronger, followed by that to Cd; whereas, the responses to Pb and Cr were not apparent. For incubation with Cu, a short-term inhibition effect appeared in the initial 3 days and was then followed by a long-term promotion effect reflected by obvious increases of bacterial density against control. In regard of bacterial activity evaluated based on the first-order consumption rate for glucose, a trend of decreases was revealed. The results of PCR-DGGE and sequence analysis of extracted 16S rDNA further suggested there were bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and could grow readily to become new dominating ones. The existence of such bacterial species was inferred as the reason leading to the observed increases of bacterial density during incubation with the metal. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Comparison of pharmaceutical abatement in various water matrices by

AB Pharmaceutical abatement in a groundwater (GW), surface water (SW), and secondary effluent (SE) by conventional ozonation, the conventional peroxone (O-3/H2O2), and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) processes was compared in batch tests. SE had significantly more fast-reacting dissolved organic matter (DOM) moieties than GW and SW. Therefore, O-3 decomposed much faster in SE than in GW and SW. At specific ozone doses of 0.5-1.5 mg O-3/mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the application of O-3/H2O2 and E-peroxone process (by adding external H2O2 stocks or in-situ generating H2O2 from cathodic O-2 reduction during ozonation) similarly enhanced the OH yield from O-3 decomposition by similar to 5-12% and 5-7% in GW and SW, respectively, compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, due to the slower reaction kinetics of O-3 with H2O2 than O-3 with fast-reacting DOM moieties, the addition or electro-generation of H2O2 hardly increased the OH yield (<4% increases) in SE. Corresponding to the changes in the OH yields, the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and clofibric acid) increased evidently in GW (up to similar to 14-18% at a specific ozone dose of 1.5 mg O3/mg DOC), moderately in SW (up to 6-10% at 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC), and negligibly in SE during the O-3/H2O2 and E-peroxone treatment compared to conventional ozonation. These results indicate that similar to the conventional O-3/H2O2 process, the E-peroxone process can more pronouncedly enhance O-3 transformation to OH, and thus increase the abatement efficiency of ozone-resistant pharmaceuticals in water matrices exerting relatively high ozone stability (e.g., groundwater and surface water with low DOM contents). Therefore, by installing electrodes in existing ozone reactors, the E-peroxone process may provide a convenient way to enhance pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water applications, where groundwater and surface water with low DOM contents are used as the source waters.

TI Robust performance of a membrane bioreactor for removing antibiotic

AB Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are an emerging concern in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as dissemination of ARGs can pose a serious risk to human health. Few studies, however, have quantified ARGs in membrane bioreactors (MBRs), although MBRs have been widely used for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. To reveal the capacity of MBRs for removal of ARGs and the response of membrane fouling after antibiotic exposure, five typical ARG subtypes (sull, sulll, tetC, tetX and ereA) and intl were quantified affiliated by systematic membrane foulants analysis in a laboratory-scale anoxic/ aerobic membrane bioreactor (ADO-MBR). Sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline hydrochloride additions increased ARG abundances by 0.5-1.4 orders of magnitude in the activated sludge, while the ARG removal performance of the membrane module remained stable (or even increased with ARG absolute abundance in several cases), with the abundance of removed ARGs ranging from 0.6 to 5.6 orders of magnitude. Specifically, the distribution of ARGs in membrane foulants accounted for 13%-25% of the total absolute abundance of all tested MBR samples. Indeed, substantial fouling occurred after the antibiotic additions, with the mean concentrations of soluble microbial product (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) increasing by 340% and 220%, respectively, in a membrane fouling cycle; moreover, the contents of EPS and SMP in the membrane foulants were significantly correlated with the ARG absolute abundance of membrane foulants (p < 0.05), among which more significant correlations occurred between both the protein and polysaccharide of foulants than that with humic acid. The dense membrane fouling layer and the membrane itself constituted dual barriers that effectively avoided the leakage of ARGs from the membrane module. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the proliferation and removal of ARGs in MBR systems, and highlight the contribution of membrane fouling to ARG removals in terms of the potential of MBR as an effective strategy to reduce ARC levels in WWTP effluent.

AB The aim of this paper is to present the first study on spatial and temporal variation in the enantiomeric profile of chiral drugs in eight European cities. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and enantioselective analysis were combined to evaluate trends in illicit drug use in the context of their consumption vs direct disposal as well as their synthetic production routes. Spatial variations in amphetamine loads were observed with higher use in Northern European cities. Enantioselective analysis showed a general enrichment of amphetamine with the R-()-enantiomer in wastewater indicating its abuse. High loads of racemic methamphetamine were detected in Oslo (EF = 0.49 +/- 0.02). This is in contrast to other European cities where S-(+)-methamphetamine was the predominant enantiomer. This indicates different methods of methamphetamine synthesis and/or trafficking routes in Oslo, compared with the other cities tested. An enrichment of MDMA with the R-()-enantiomer was observed in European waste-waters indicating MDMA consumption rather than disposal of unused drug. MDA's chiral signature indicated its enrichment with the S-(+)-enantiomer, which confirms its origin from MDMA metabolism in humans. HMMA was also detected at quantifiable concentrations in wastewater and was found to be a suitable biomarker for MDMA consumption. Mephedrone was only detected in wastewater from the United Kingdom with population-normalised loads up to 47.7 mg 1000 people(-1) day(-1). The enrichment of mephedrone in the R-(+)-enantiomer in wastewater suggests stereoselective metabolism in humans, hence consumption, rather than direct disposal of the drug. The investigation of drug precursors, such as ephedrine, showed that their presence was reasonably ascribed to their medical use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of nitrogen, mainly in form of ammonium (NH4+), in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a highly energy demanding process, mainly due to aeration. It causes costs of about half a million Euros per year in an average European WWTP. Alternative, more economical technologies for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater are required. This study proves the complete anoxic conversion of ammonium (NH4+) to dinitrogen gas (N-2) in continuously operated bioelectrochemical systems at the litre-scale. The removal rate is comparable to conventional WWTPs with 35 +/- 10 g N m(-3) d(-1) with low accumulation of NOT, NOT, N2O. In contrast to classical aerobic nitrification, the energy consumption is considerable lower (1.16 +/- 0.21 kWh kg(-1) N, being more than 35 times less than for the conventional wastewater treatment). Biotic and abiotic control experiments confirmed that the anoxic nitrification was an electrochemical biological process mainly performed by Nitrosomonas with hydroxylamine as the main substrate (mid-point potential, E-ox = +0.67 +/- 0.08 V vs. SHE). This article proves the technical feasibility and reduction of costs for ammonium removal from wastewater, investigates the underlying mechanisms and discusses future engineering needs.

AB Leptospirosis has emerged as an important urban health problem as slum settlements have expanded worldwide. Yet the dynamics of the environmentally transmitted Leptospira pathogen has not been well characterized in these settings. We used a stratified dense sampling scheme to study the dynamics of Leptospira abundance in surface waters from a Brazilian urban slum community. We collected surface water samples during the dry, intermediate and rainy seasons within a seven-month period and quantified pathogenic Leptospira by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We used logistic and linear mixed models to identify factors that explained variation for the presence and concentration of Leptospira DNA. Among 335 sewage and 250 standing water samples, Leptospira DNA were detected in 36% and 34%, respectively. Among the 236 samples with positive results geometric mean Leptospira concentrations were 152 GEq/ mL The probability of finding Leptospira DNA was higher in sewage samples collected during the rainy season when increased leptospirosis incidence occurred, than during the dry season (47.2% vs 12.5%, respectively, p = 0.0002). There was a marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity in Leptospira DNA distribution, for which type of water, elevation, and time of day that samples were collected, in addition to season, were significant predictors. Together, these findings indicate that Leptospira are ubiquitous in the slum environment and that the water-related risk to which inhabitants are exposed is low. Seasonal increases in Leptospira presence may explain the timing of leptospirosis outbreaks. Effective prevention wilt need to consider the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogenic Leptospira in surface waters to reduce the burden of the disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrate contamination in ground- and surface water is a persistent problem in countries with intense agriculture. The transition zone between rivers and their riparian aquifers, where river water and groundwater interact, may play an important role in mediating nitrate exports, as it can facilitate intensive denitrification, which permanently removes nitrate from the aquatic system. However, the in situ factors controlling riparian denitrification are not fully understood, as they are often strongly linked and their effects superimpose each other. In this study, we present the evaluation of hydrochemical and isotopic data from a 2-year sampling period of river water and groundwater in the riparian zone along a 3rd order river in Central Germany. Based on bi- and multivariate statistics (Spearman's rank correlation and partial least squares regression) we can show, that highest rates for oxygen consumption and denitrification in the riparian aquifer occur where the fraction of infiltrated river water and at the same time groundwater temperature, are high. River discharge and depth to groundwater are additional explanatory variables for those reaction rates, but of minor importance. Our data and analyses suggest that at locations in the riparian aquifer, which show significant river water infiltration, heterotrophic microbial reactions in the riparian zone may be fueled by bioavailable organic carbon derived from the river water. We conclude that interactions between rivers and riparian groundwater are likely to be a key control of nitrate removal and should be considered as a measure to mitigate high nitrate exports from agricultural catchments.

AB Presence of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICMs) in source water is of high concern, because of their potential to form highly toxic iodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs). This study investigated kinetics, mechanisms and products for oxidation of one ICMs, iopamidol (IPM) by ferrate (Fe(VI)). The obtained apparent second-order rate constants for oxidation of IPM by Fe(VI) ranged from 0.7 M-1 s(-1) to 74.6 M-1 s(-1) at pH 6.0-10.0, which were highly dependent on pH. It was found that the oxidation of IPM by Fe(VI) led to the formation of highly toxic I-DBPs. Iodoform (IF), iodoacetic acid and triiodoacetic acid formations were observed during the oxidation and IF dominated the formed I-DBPs. The formation of I-DBPs was also governed by pH and the maximum formation of I-DBPs occurred at pH 9.0. Transformation pathways of IPM by Fe(VI) oxidation were speculated to proceed through deiodination, amide hydrolysis and oxidation of amine reactions. The deiodination reaction during the oxidation of IPM by Fe(VI) contributed to the formation of I-DBPs. The formation of I-DBPs during the oxidation of IPM by Fe(VI) was significantly higher than those of iohexol, diatrizoate and iopromide, which was consistent with the lowest molecular orbital energy gap of IPM. Although Fe(VI) is considered as a green oxidant, the formation of highly toxic I-DBPs during the oxidation of IPM should receive great attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, nitrite was added into sludge during freezing process to evaluate its role in waste activated sludge (WAS) solubilization and effect on sludge dewatering characteristics. The results showed that the introduction of 100 mg L-1 of nitrite could increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration from 29.5 to 48.8 mg DOC g(-1) VSS under freezing conditions. More DOC was released with the increase of nitrite concentration. Freezing temperature, or freezing speed, also played a role in sludge solubilization. It was found that some readily-biodegradable low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, e.g. LMW protein, LMW polysaccharide, LMW neutrals, building blocks and LMW acids, were mainly released during the freezing process with the presence of nitrite. Interestingly, nitrite could also improve the sludge filterability at the lower nitrite concentration as a result of the increased sludge particle size. However, electrolytes (sodium nitrite) addition effects may mask such enhancement when nitrite concentration was high (800 mg L-1). The rheological characteristics of sludge could be well modeled by Herchel-Bulkley model and the introduction of nitrite into freezing process further increased sludge flowability and decreased sludge viscosity. These results indicated that freezing with the presence of suitable concentration of nitrite could promote sludge solubilization and dewaterability. As such, good liquid and solid separation can be achieved with the recovery of liquid stream as carbon source. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biogenic manganese oxide (BioMnO(x)) can efficiently adsorb various minor metals. The production of BioMnOx in reactors to remove metals during wastewater treatment processes is a promising biotechnological method. However, it is difficult to preferentially enrich manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) to produce BioMnO(x) during wastewater treatment processes. A unique method of cultivating MnOB using methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) to produce soluble microbial products is proposed here. MnOB were successfully enriched in a methane-fed reactor containing MOB. BioMnO(x) production during the wastewater treatment process was confirmed. Long-term continual operation of the reactor allowed simultaneous removal of Mn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II). The Co(II)/Mn(II) and Ni(II)/Mn(II) removal ratios were 53% and 19%, respectively. The degree to which Mn(II) was removed indicated that the enriched MnOB used utilization-associated products and/or biomass-associated products. Microbial community analysis revealed that methanol-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Hyphomicrobiaceae family played important roles in the oxidation of Mn(II) by using utilization-associated products. Methane-oxidizing bacteria were found to be inhibited by MnO2, but the maximum Mn(II) removal rate was 0.49 kg m(-3) d(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While the presence of iron is generally not seen as favorable for UV-based treatment systems due to lamp fouling and decreased UV transmittance, we show that told levels of iron can lead to improvements in the abatement of chemicals in the UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process. The oxidation potential of an iron-assisted UV/H2O2 (UV254 + H2O2 + iron) process was evaluated at neutral pH using iron levels below USEPA secondary drinking water standards (<0.3 mg/L). Para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) was used as a hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) probe to quantify HO center dot steady state concentrations. Compounds degraded by different mechanisms including, carbamazepine (CBZ, HO center dot oxidation) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA, direct photolysis), were used to investigate the effect of iron on compound degradation for UV/H2O2 systems. The effects of iron species (Fe2+ and Fe3+), iron concentration (0-0.3 mg/L), H2O2 concentration (0-10 mg/L) and background water matrix (low-carbon tap (LCT) and well water) on HO center dot production and compound removal were examined. Iron-assisted UV/H2O2 efficiency was most influenced by the target chemical and the water matrix. Added iron to UV/H2O2 was shown to increase the steady-state HO center dot concentration by approximately 25% in all well water scenarios. While CBZ removal was unchanged by iron addition, 0.3 mg/L iron improved NDMA removal rates in both LCT and well water matrices by 15.1% and 4.6% respectively. Furthermore, the combination of UV/Fe without H2O2 was also shown to enhance NDMA removal when compared to UV photolysis alone indicating the presence of degradation pathways other than HO center dot oxidation.

AB An effective approach for eutrophication control and phosphate recovery remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a new technique for phosphate sequestration in lake and phosphate recovery using novel magnetically recoverable magnetite/lanthanum hydroxide [M-La(OH)(3)] hybrids that can be prepared using a simple one-pot synthesis method. Batch studies show that M-La(OH)(3) exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate with sorption capacities of up to 52.7 mg-Pig at pH 7.0 in water. A simple model indicates that the efficiency of M-La(OH)(3) for phosphate sequestration in lake is significantly attenuated by 34-45% compared to that in water, due to interference from sediment particles. However, our results demonstrate that sediments suspensions mixed with a M-La(OH)(3) content of 1-3% exhibit a capability of up to 1.2 mg-Pig for sequestering external phosphate compared with that of 0.2 mg-Pig for pristine sediment at pH 7.3. M-La(OH)(3)-mixed sediment suspensions appear to effectively sequester phosphate over an environmentally relevant pH range from 4 to 8.5. Phosphorus (P) fractionation experiments indicate that the enhanced phosphate sorption by M-La(OH)(3)-mixed sediment suspensions is mainly due to the increased fractions of NaOH-P and inorganic P. This work indicates that the M-La(OH)(3) has the potential for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chromium (Cr) isotope fractionation analysis is a promising tool for monitoring Cr(VI) reduction in natural aqueous systems. In addition, large amounts of CH4 in natural aqueous sediments are oxidized to CO2 through methanotrophs, thereby mitigating emissions to the atmosphere. However, the investigations on the Cr(VI) reduction process with methanotrophs, and the associated Cr isotope fractionation patterns are scarce. In this study, we have shown that Cr(VI) reduction can occur in the presence of CH4 as the sole electron donor in a hollow-fiber membrane reactor (HfMBR) after direct bacteria enrichment from sediment samples. Products of the methane oxidation by the methanotrophs are used by microbes to reduce Cr(VI) as shown by the progressive increase in delta Cr-53 with time in the CH4 feed reactor. The isotope fractionation factor (epsilon) of -2.62 +/- 0.20%o was obtained from the application of the Rayleigh distillation model. The results of Cr isotope fractionation analysis also explained the decrease of Cr(VI) concentration in the N-2 feed reactor, where the delta Cr-53 values remained steady in the first two weeks but significantly increased in the last two weeks, indicating that physical adsorption and subsequent Cr(VI) reduction occurred. This study extended the application of Cr isotope fractionation, showing the suitability of this method for clarifying different Cr(VI) removal processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous investigations showed that cationic polyacrylamide (cPAM), a flocculant widely used in wastewater pretreatment and waste activated sludge dewatering, deteriorated methane production during anaerobic digestion of sludge. However, details of how cPAM affects methane production are poorly understood, hindering deep control of sludge anaerobic digestion systems. In this study, the mechanisms of cPAM affecting sludge anaerobic digestion were investigated in batch and long-term tests using either real sludge or synthetic wastewaters as the digestion substrates. Experimental results showed that the presence of cPAM not only slowed the process of anaerobic digestion but also decreased methane yield. The maximal methane yield decreased from 139.1 to 86.7 mL/g of volatile suspended solids (i.e., 1861.5 to 1187.0 mL/L) with the cPAM level increasing from 0 to 12 g/kg of total suspended solids (i.e., 0-236.7 mg/L), whereas the corresponding digestion time increased from 22 to 26 d. Mechanism explorations revealed that the addition of cPAM significantly restrained the sludge solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis processes. It was found that similar to 46% of cAPM was degraded in the anaerobic digestion, and the degradation products significantly affected methane production. Although the theoretically biochemical methane potential of cPAM is higher than that of protein and carbohydrate, only 6.7% of the degraded cPAM was transformed to the final product, methane. Acrylamide, acrylic acid, and polyacrylic acid were found to be the main degradation metabolites, and their amount accounted for similar to 50% of the degraded cPAM. Further investigations showed that polyacrylic acid inhibited all the solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis processes while acrylamide and acrylic acid inhibited the methanogenesis significantly.

AB Due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of pyridine, the conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability. In this study, an electricity-assisted anaerobic system was developed in order to enhance biodegradation of pyridine from wastewater. The results showed that the performance and stability of the anaerobic reactor was remarkably improved for pyridine biodegradation with the applied direct current of 0.3 mA, where the efficiencies of pyridine and total organic carbon removal as well as NH4+-N formation were as high as 100.0%, 96.1 +/- 1.2% and 60.1 +/- 2.1% respectively. The compact biofilm due to electrical stimulation as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode might promote pyridine bio-mineralization in the anaerobic reactor. Moreover, the species related to pyridine biodegradation (Desulfovibrio, Dokdonella, Hydrogenophaga, and Paracoccus) were enriched in the anodic biofilm, which would be another reason for better reactor performance. This study demonstrated that electrical stimulation would be a potential alternative for the enhancement of pyridine removal from wastewater in anaerobic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Authigenic nanoparticles containing iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) have been identified at the anoxic/oxic interface of various aquatic ecosystems, forming upon the oxidation of reduced Fe. Little is known about the prevalence of these authigenic nanoparticles in streams, their impact on biogeochemical fluxes, or the bioavailability of P associated with them. In this paper we used transmission electron microscopy to document the presence of authigenic (amorphous) nanoparticles, rich in Fe and P, in baseflow of streams in the Southern Piedmont region of the U.S. We used a simple centrifugation and ultrafiltration technique to separate authigenic nanoparticles from truly dissolved (<1 kDa) and crystalline mineral/coarse organic fractions in baseflow, employing three different quality control methods to verify a successful separation: X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and stoichiometry of Fe and aluminum. This allowed us to quantify the amount of Fe and P in three different fractions of baseflow: truly dissolved, authigenic nanoparticles, and crystalline mineral/coarse organic particles. For the rural and urban stream in our study, on average, authigenic nanoparticles in baseflow transport 66% of Fe, with baseflow concentrations ranging from 80 mu g/L to 650 mu g/L. Authigenic nanoparticles also transport an average of 38% of reactive P, depending upon seasonality and time elapsed since the last storm event. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging ozone-based electrochemical advanced oxidation process that combines conventional ozonation with in-situ cathodic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production for oxidative water treatment. In this study, the effects of the E-peroxone pretreatment on disinfection by-product (DBP) formation from chlorination of a synthetic surface water were investigated and compared to conventional ozonation. Results show that due to the enhanced transformation of ozone (O-3) to hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) by electro-generated H2O2, the E-peroxone process considerably enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) abatement and significantly reduced bromate (BrO3-) formation compared to conventional ozonation. However, natural organic matter (NOM) with high UV254 absorbance, which is the major precursors of chlorination DBPs, was less efficiently abated during the E-peroxone process than conventional ozonation. Consequently, while both conventional ozonation and the E-peroxone process substantially reduced the formation of DBPs (trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids) during post-chlorination, higher DBP concentrations were generally observed during chlorination of the E-peroxone pretreated waters than conventional ozonation treated. In addition, because of conventional ozonation or the E-peroxone treatment, DBPs formed during post-chlorination shifted to more brominated species. The overall yields of brominated DBPs exhibited strong correlations with the bromide concentrations in water. Therefore, while the E-peroxone process can effectively suppress bromide transformation to bromate, it may lead to higher formation of brominated DBPs during post-chlorination compared to conventional ozonation. These results suggest that the E-peroxone process can lead to different DBP formation and speciation during water treatment trains compared to conventional ozonation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simultaneous recovery of calcium phosphate granules (CaP granules) and methane from vacuum collected black water (BW), using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was previously investigated. It was calculated that only 2% of the total phosphorus (P) fed was present as CaP granules whereas 51% of the P accumulated dispersed in the reactor, limiting the applicability of this process for recovery of phosphate. This study proposes adding calcium to increase the P accumulation in the reactor and the production of CaP granules. Calcium was added in a lab-scale UASB reactor fed with BW. An identical UASB reactor was used as reference, to which no calcium was added. The treatment performance was evaluated by weekly monitoring of influent, effluent and produced biogas. Sludge bed development and CaP granulation were assessed through particle size analysis. The composition and structure of CaP granules were chemically and optically assessed. Calcium addition increased accumulation of P in the reactor and formation and growth of granules with size > 0.4 mm diameter (CaP granules). Moreover, with calcium addition, CaP granules contained 5.6 +/- 1.5 wt% of P, while without calcium a lower P content was observed (3.7 +/- 0.3 wt%). By adding Ca, 89% of the incoming P from BW accumulated in the reactor and 31% was sampled as CaP granules (> 0.4 mm diameter). Addition of 250 mgCa L-1 of BW was the optimum loading found in this study. Furthermore, no significant reduction in CODTotal removal (> 80%) and CH4 production (0.47 +/- 0.10 gCOD-CH4 g(-1)COD(Total)-BW) was observed. Therefore, adding calcium can significantly increase the CaP granulation without inhibiting the simultaneous CH4 recovery. This further indicates the potential of this process for phosphate recovery.

AB A non-supervised (k-means) and a supervised (k-Nearest Neighbour in combination with genetic algorithm optimisation, k-NN/GA) pattern recognition algorithms were applied for evaluating and interpreting a large complex matrix of water quality (WQ) data collected during five years (2008, 2010-2013) in the Paute river basin (southern Ecuador). 21 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters collected at 80 different WQ sampling stations were examined. At first, the k-means algorithm was carried out to identify classes of sampling stations regarding their associated WQ status by considering three internal validation indexes, i.e., Silhouette coefficient, Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz. As a result, two WQ classes were identified, representing low (C1) and high (C2) pollution. The k-NN/GA algorithm was applied on the available data to construct a classification model with the two WQ classes, previously defined by the k-means algorithm, as the dependent variables and the 21 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters being the independent ones. This algorithm led to a significant reduction of the multidimensional space of independent variables to only nine, which are likely to explain most of the structure of the two identified WQ classes. These parameters are, namely, electric conductivity, faecal coliforms, dissolved oxygen, chlorides, total hardness, nitrate, total alkalinity, biochemical oxygen demand and turbidity. Further, the land use cover of the study basin revealed a very good agreement with the WQ spatial distribution suggested by the k-means algorithm, confirming the credibility of the main results of the used WQ data mining approach.

AB Sludge treatment and disposal have become important environmental issues in China. Mechanical dewatering is widely used to reduce the amount of sludge to be disposed and relieve the rapid growth pressure of waste sludge. In comparison to traditional sludge dewatering processes, pressure electro-osmotic dewatering has many advantages on sludge dewatering efficiency, low conditioner dosage and concentrated cake are both beneficial to further recycling of waste sludge. In general, complex electrochemical effects (eg. electrochemical oxidation, ohmic heating and pH gradient effect) are accompanied by the pressure electro-osmotic dewatering process. These electrochemical effects will inevitably cause solubilization and/or degradation of key constituents of wastewater sludge - extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). In this study, the effects of voltage, pH and ionic strength on sludge electro-osmotic dewatering performance and electrochemical effects were investigated. The solubilization and degradation of EPS were analyzed by examining the variation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the filtrate, and the relationships between microstructural properties of sludge cake and DOM and electro-osmosis dewatering performance in electro-dewatering process was examined. It was found that electro-dewatering properties were improved by raising the operating voltage or decreasing the pH value, while dewatering rate initially increased at low ionic strength it decreases with increased ionic strength. In addition, the porous structure of cathodic cake was more plentiful than that at the anode. At the cathode, the EPS dissolution was mainly related to alkalization, while the oxidation and acidification were responsible for release of EPS at the anode. Meanwhile, electrophoresis effect was able to promote migration of EPS toward the anode. The average electro-osmotic dewatering rate at the anode (R-2.>0.79, p < 0.02) and at the cathode (R-2.>0.87, p < 0.03) strongly correlated with the volume of pore of sludge cake. There was no correlation between the total content of anodic DOM (R-2<0.31, p>0.08) and electro-osmotic dewatering rate at the anode, however, the content of cathodic DOM (R-2 > 0.62, p < 0.09) negatively correlated with average electro-osmosis dewatering rate of cathode. Since cathode is the main water-permeable side in sludge electro-dewatering, and the sticky biopolymers (proteins and humic subtances) could not be converted into small molecules, higher EPS release was associated with worse sludge filterability. As for the anode, the biopolymers were degraded into small molecules due to electrochemical oxidation, which greatly reduced the impact of DOM on dewatering effect. Therefore, the operating conditions (voltage, pH and ionic strength) caused changes in electrochemical effects, which played a crucial role in compartmentalization of sludge EPS dissolution and consequently sludge electro-dewatering behavior.

AB Emission models are useful tools for the study and management of atmospheric emissions from passive liquid surfaces in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are potential sources of odour nuisance and other environmental impacts. In this work, different theoretical and empirical models for the gas side (k(G)) and liquid-side (k(L)) mass transfer coefficients in passive surfaces in WWTPs were critically reviewed and evaluated against experimental data. Wind forcing and the development of the wind-wave field, especially the occurrence of microscale wave breaking, were identified as the most important physical factors affecting mass transfer in these situations. Two approaches performed well in describing the available data for k(G) for water vapour. One is an empirical correlation whilst the other consists of theoretical models based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate. We also fit to the experimental data set a new, alternate equation for k(G), whose performance was comparable to existing ones. However, these three approaches do not agree with each other in the whole range of Schmidt numbers typical for compounds found in emissions from WWTPs. As to k(L), no model was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set. Excluding two suspected biased sources, the WATER9 (US EPA, 1994. Air Emission Models for Waste and Wastewater. North Carolina, USA. EPA-453/R-94-080A) approach produced the best results among the most commonly used k(L), models, although still with considerably high relative errors. For this same sub-set, we propose a new, alternate approach for estimating k(L), which resulted in improved performance, particularly for longer fetches. Two main gaps were found in the literature, the understanding of the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer over liquid surfaces, and the behaviour of k(L) for larger fetches, especially in the range from 40 to 60 m.

AB BACKGROUND: The persistence of synchondrosis in adulthood can confound diagnostic decisions made during patient management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old woman who presented neck pain, acute headache, and acute cervical myelopathy symptoms after suffering whiplash grade 3 in a car rear-end impact underwent a conventional radiologic study that revealed no fracture and no anatomic spine variations. The magnetic resonance imaging study revealed no spinal cord intensity signal changes, but it showed a persistent (remnant) dentocentral synchondrosis that was undetected in a previous conventional radiographic evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The localization and level of the remnant of the dentocentral synchondrosis are extremely important from the clinical viewpoint because of odontoid and C2 fractures. Neurosurgeons should thus be aware of the possible presence of a persistent (remnant) C2 dentocentral synchondrosis in adult subjects in order to avoid misdiagnosis with C2 fracture.

AB BACKGROUND: Diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by calcifications affecting mainly the spinal anterior longitudinal ligament. This disease is mainly asymptomatic but cervical osteophytes can sometimes cause dysphagia (DISHphagia), hoarseness, and even dyspnea.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report, for the first time in the medical literature, a case of a 76-year-old patient with DISH causing an important dysphagia as well as bilateral vocal cord paralysis causing critical dyspnea. The patient was surgically treated by anterior resection of the osteophytes and application of bone wax, with significant clinical improvement and no radiologic recurrence after 2 years of follow-up.
   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A thorough literature review didn't yield any article reporting on bilateral vocal cord paralysis caused by DISH. Management of this condition is typically multidisciplinary, and treatment of cervical osteophyte-associated dysphagia or respiratory compromise is primarily medical, after performing necessary tests to rule out other causes of dysphagia. Surgical intervention is warranted when medical treatment fails, when there is weight loss, a significant airway compromise or sleeping alterations. A treatment algorithm is proposed in the end of this review for symptomatic anterior osteophytes caused by DISH in the mobile cervical spine.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recollapse of the augmented vertebrae after percutaneous vertebral augmentation treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has obtained much attention. Although many potential risk factors have been proposed, they are still disputed. The aim of our study was to identify the characteristics of the augmented vertebrae that had undergone a recollapse according to a systematic review from the earliest available records up to August 2017 and then conduct a meta-analysis based on eligible studies to assess significant potential risk factors for recollapse of the augmented vertebrae.
   METHODS: Fourteen studies were identified for investigating recollapse of the augmented vertebrae. Of those studies, 9 studies were eligible for meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: Pooled results showed that 5 primary factors were associated with recollapse of the augmented vertebrae, including preoperative intravertebral cleft, the affected vertebrae in the thoracolumbar region, preoperative severe kyphotic deformity, solid lump cement distribution pattern, and higher vertebral height restoration. It was possibly another risk factor that the distance between PMMA and superior end plate was relatively large.
   CONCLUSIONS: Careful observation of patients with these risk factors and reasonable intervention could be useful to prevent deterioration of their clinical course.

AB In the past, women in neurosurgery were deemed "less than a minority." Pioneering women entered neurosurgical residency programs alone, facing large obstacles to become surgical experts. Recent data suggest a stark increase in the number of women neurosurgical residents. As the field of neurosurgery attempts to increase numbers of women surgeons, it must also adjust workplace culture to embrace a new group of trainees. Here, we share an account of historical numbers, as well as evidence of a changing landscape within neurosurgery and suggestions of ways to modify workplace culture based on examples set in other career paths.

AB BACKGROUND: Whether modified laminoplasty is better than conventional laminoplasty is unclear. Thus, a meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of preserving or repairing the posterior deep extensor insertion to C2 in laminoplasty was conducted for patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM).
   METHODS: Several electronic databases were chosen to search for relevant studies. The primary indices included preoperative and postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, JOA recovery rate, muscle atrophy rate, preoperative and postoperative range of motion (ROM), ROM decrease rate, and incidence of axial pain. Results are expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes.
   RESULTS: Eight studies involving 763 patients were included in this study. The postoperative cervical ROM was significantly higher in the modified group (P = 0.01, MD = 3.0 [0.66, 5.35]), as was the cervical posterior muscle volume (P = 0.02, MD = 28.28 [4.42, 52.3]) and the operation time (MD = -45.04, 95% CI -49.79, -40.29; P < 0.01). The incidence of axial symptoms in the modified group was lower than that in the conventional group (P < 0.01, OR 0.28 [0.17, 0.46]), as was the rate of decrease of cervical ROM (P = 0.004, MD = -6.72 [-11.25, 2.19]). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the groups in blood loss, preoperative and postoperative JOA score, or JOA recovery rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: Modified laminoplasty had shorter operation times, a lower incidence of axial pain, a higher cervical ROM, and a lower atrophy rate compared with conventional laminoplasty. The clinical and radiologic results of modified laminoplasty have been partly superior to those of conventional laminoplasty to date.

TI Intractable Hiccups After Coil Embolization of Partially Thrombosed
   Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Coil embolization; Dorsal medulla; Hiccups; Singultus; Thrombosed
   aneurysm
ID PRESENTING SYMPTOM; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; SINGULTUS
AB BACKGROUND: Hiccups are defined as sudden-onset involuntary contractions of the diaphragm followed by immediate inspiration and laryngeal closure, and they are considered intractable if prolonged beyond 1 month. A reflux arc involving phrenic, vagal, and central midbrain modulation is likely responsible for hiccups. We herein report a case of intractable hiccups caused by compression of the dorsal aspect of the medulla oblongata after treatment of a partially thrombosed distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man presented with severe headache and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography showed a partially thrombosed distal PICA aneurysm associated with a fusiform aneurysm in the ipsilateral vertebral artery. Based on the limited distribution of the clot, we performed endovascular coil occlusion of the aneurysm lumen followed by parent vessel occlusion for the distal PICA aneurysm. After the procedure, the patient presented with hiccups that could not be controlled by any medications. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an area of hyperintensity at the bilateral dorsal part of the medulla adjacent to the embolized aneurysm. The hiccups spontaneously disappeared 1 month after the procedure, and the abnormal signal findings also disappeared within the same period. The hiccups did not recur for 30 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this case, the precise location of the culprit lesion causing the patient's hiccups was the dorsal medulla oblongata. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of structural or functional disorders of the reflux arc in patients with intractable hiccups.

   PATHOGENESIS; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of a patho-logic arteriovenous shunt formed from a tangle of vessels lacking a capillary bed. AVMs were previously accepted as congenital in nature; however, an increase in the number of reported de novo cerebral AVMs challenges the assertion that all AVMs develop in utero hence, the possibility of these lesions presenting postnatally cannot be excluded. A review of literature revealed 31 published cases of de novo AVM formation between 1996 and 2017.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 7-year-old boy with a history of an intracranial aneurysm that was found to have an asymptomatic de novo AVM formation on a routine follow-up angiography. He was being followed since the age of 8 months when the aneurysm was incidentally found during work-up for mild hemiparesis. At that time, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4-mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm along with a right hemispheric stroke and cortical dysplasia. No arteriovenous malformation was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: The exact pathophysiology of de novo AVMs is not completely understood, but a combination of genetic, molecular, and environmental factors may play a role. Our case report only adds to the growing body of clinical evidence supporting the notion that these lesions may be acquired. It would be appropriate to consider an AVM as an abnormal vascular response to an injury rather than a static congenital lesion.

AB INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has shown good results in experimental models of hemorrhagic stroke. The clinical application of TH, however, remains controversial, since reports regarding its therapeutic effect are inconsistent.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses comparing TH with a control group in terms of mortality, poor outcome, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and specific complications. The subgroup analyses were stratified by study type, country, mean age, hemorrhage type, cooling method, treatment duration, rewarming velocity, and follow-up time.
   RESULTS: Nine studies were included, most of which were of moderate quality. The overall effect demonstrated insignificant differences in mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.06; P = 0.11) and poor outcome rate (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.70-1.12; P = 0.32) between TH and the control group. However, sensitivity analyses, after we omitted 1 study, achieved a statistically significant difference in poor outcome favoring TH. Moreover, in the subgroup analyses, the results derived from randomized studies revealed that TH significantly reduced poor outcomes (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.22-0.74; P = 0.003). In addition, TH significantly reduced DCI compared with control (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.93; P = 0.02). The incidence of specific complications (rebleeding, pneumonia, sepsis, arrhythmia, and hydrocephalus) between the 2 groups were comparable and did not reach significant difference.
   CONCLUSIONS: The overall effect showed TH did not significantly reduce mortality and poor outcomes but led to a decreased incidence of DCI. Compared with control, TH resulted in comparable incidences of specific complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors and outcomes and to develop a cogent perioperative management algorithm for dural defects (DDs) in anterior surgery for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   METHODS: Ninety OPLL patients who had undergone anterior cervical decompression between January 2014 and December 2016 were reviewed. DDs occurred in 12 patients. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data; intraoperative and postoperative management; and complications were analyzed. Risk factors for DDs were assessed with multivariate analysis. A treatment algorithm was identified based on these findings and our experience.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of DDs was 13.3% (12/90). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the ratio of OPLL base to spinal canal (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, P=0.012), kyphotic cervical alignment with thick OPLL masses (OR 9.44, P=0.026), and lateral, curved, and irregular OPLL masses (OR 8.28, P=0.037) could be risk factors for DDs. DDs were repaired intraoperatively with onlay grafts, and lumbar drains were placed in all DD patients. The treatment was successful in all DD patients, and outcome measures did not differ between the DD and no DD groups. No patient had experienced complications associated with DDs and CSF leaks at the final follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with broad-based OPLL, kyphotic cervical alignment with thick OPLL masses, and lateral, curved, and irregular OPLL masses have a higher risk of DD in anterior surgery for OPLL. Intraoperative primary repair with onlay grafts combined with early lumbar drains is a simple, safe, and effective strategy for DDs. The outlook for the long-term sequelae of DDs is optimistic if they are managed adequately.

   HYPOTHERMIA; MANAGEMENT; HYPERTENSION; CIRCULATION; METABOLISM; TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND: In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), maintaining systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg, intracranial pressure (ICP) <20 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) >60-70 mm Hg is recommended to improve clinical outcomes. A recommended CPP value for patients treated with decompressive craniectomy (DC) has not been clearly studied. We aimed to determine whether the targeted CPP can be lowered in patients treated with DC.
   METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 191 patients who underwent DC for TBI. All patients were monitored for ICP and blood pressure during and after DC. CPP was calculated every 2 hours after DC. Patient outcomes were evaluated 6 months after initial treatment.
   RESULTS: Mean patient age was 50.8 years (median 52 years), and 79.1% of patients were male. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6.2 (median 6). Comparing clinical outcome based on postoperative ICP >25 mm Hg and <25 mm Hg, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 1.4 (>25 mm Hg) and 4.9 (<25 mm Hg) (P = 0.000). In patients maintained at ICP <25 mm Hg, mortality was increased significantly with CPP between 35 mmHg and 30 mm Hg (chi(2), P = 0.029 vs. P = 0.062).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TBI who underwent DC with postoperative ICP maintained <25 mm Hg and CPP >35 mm Hg may have similar mortality as patients with CPP >60-70 mm Hg who did not undergo DC. For patients with TBI who undergo DC, targeted CPP might be lowered to 35 mm Hg if ICP is maintained <25 mm Hg.

AB BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for primary brain tumors and intracranial metastases but can occasionally precede new enhancing lesions on imaging studies that are difficult to discern between tumor recurrence (TR) and radiation necrosis (RN). The aim of this study was to identify clinical presentation and imaging patterns of RN compared with TR that may obviate the need for invasive definitive biopsy.
   METHODS: Patients who received radiation therapy and subsequently presented with a new intracranial lesion were reviewed from 2001 to 2016; 27 patients were identified with adequate records and confirmed pathology to have RN present or TR only. Patient and lesion characteristics were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Sensitivity and specificities were calculated for imaging features and quantitatively segmented lesion and edema volumes for identifying RN.
   RESULTS: Karnofsky performance scale score at presentation significantly predicted pathologic diagnosis on univariate analysis (P = 0.044). Radiation dosage and time from radiation therapy to lesion onset did not differ among pathologic diagnosis groups. No differences existed between RN and TR on quantitative imaging analyses. Multivariate logistic regression found higher Karnofsky performance scale score to be an independent factor associated with TR relative to RN (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.56, P = 0.030).
   CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic imaging can often be inaccurate in detecting RN alone, even with quantitative volume assessment. Functional status on repeat presentation may increase the likelihood of accurate diagnosis before definitive biopsy when neuroimaging remains unclear.

AB BACKGROUND: The effects and safety of transradial access for stenting of carotid artery stenosis in patients with bovine-type and type III aortic arch are currently unknown and are the purpose of this study.
   METHODS: Patients who were treated with stenting via transradial (n = 28) compared with transfemoral (n = 30) access of carotid artery stenosis complicated with bovinetype and type III aortic arch were enrolled. The clinical data were studied for comparison.
   RESULTS: The success rate of transradial access for carotid artery stenting was 100%. During the transradial access procedure, 3 patients experienced a temporary blood pressure drop and bradycardia that was resolved with atropine injection. No radial artery occlusion or severe cardiac or cerebral events occurred. The success rate of transfemoral access for carotid artery stenting was 90% with failure in 3 patients. No complications occurred during or after the stenting procedure. The irradiation duration was significantly (P = 0.001) smaller in transradial than in transfemoral access stenting (8.6 +/- 0.87 vs. 11.4 +/- 1.25 minutes). The arterial stenosis ranged 71.25%-96.50% (mean, 86.50% +/- 10.15%) for transradial and 78%-97.75% (85.1% +/- 10.42%) for transfemoral access groups before treatment, and the residual stenosis following treatment was significantly smaller in either the transradial (2.4%-17.75%; mean, 11.2% +/- 6.03%) or transfemoral (4%-18.6%; mean, 12.4% +/- 6.3%) groups compared with before treatment, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transradial access for stenting of patients with type III aortic arch plus left carotid artery stenosis or in the bovine-type aortic arch combined with right carotid artery stenosis can decrease the stenting difficulty, risks of embolization, and radiation time and increase the success rate.

ID EXTRADURAL HEMANGIOMA; ANGIOMA; BRAIN
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate imaging characteristics of spinal epidural cavernous hemangiomas (ECHs) and improve understanding of this rare disease.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 7 cases of ECH, confirmed with surgical pathology and imaging. All patients underwent computed tomography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging. One patient underwent diffusion-weighted imaging.
   RESULTS: ECH originated from vertebrae with coarsened trabeculae in 5 patients. Among these, 1 tumor was mainly in the intervertebral foramen and paravertebral space, 2 extended to the intraspinal and paravertebral spaces and appeared dumbbell-shaped, and 2 were located in the intraspinal space. Purely epidural hemangiomas were present in 2 patients; 1 of these patients had adjacent bony erosion. Epidural hemangiomas were isointense in 6 patients and hyperintense in 1 patient on T1-weighted images; lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images in all 7 patients. Peripheral fat was present in 4 ECHs; 2 were of vertebral origin, and 2 were of epidural space origin. In the patient who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging, the lesion showed restricted diffusion. The affected vertebra had coarsened trabeculae, which may be a critical finding for differentiating ECHs of vertebral origin from foraminal nerve sheath tumors. Peripheral fat around hemangiomas of vertebral origin and primary epidural space hemangiomas indicates chronicity. -
   CONCLUSIONS: ECHs are classified either as epidural hemangiomas of vertebral origin or as primary epidural hemangiomas. Awareness of imaging characteristics of ECHs may facilitate diagnosis and treatment of these lesions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary apoplexy can cause severe neuro-ophthalmologic or endocrinologic sequelae, requiring timely treatment. The present study was performed to evaluate postoperative neurologic outcomes and to identify their risk factors in patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary apoplexy.
   METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with pituitary apoplexy who underwent transsphenoidal surgery were reviewed retrospectively. The initial rates of visual acuity (VA) decrease, visual field (VF) defect, and ocular palsy were 34.1%, 46.3%, and 68.3%, respectively. The median maximal diameter and tumoral volume was 2.6 cm (range, 2.0-4.6 cm) and 5.3 cm(3) (range, 2.4-38.8 cm(3)), respectively. Seventeen patients (41.5%) underwent surgery within 7 days. The median follow-up duration was 45 months (range, 12-196 months).
   RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 62.9% (22/35) of patients had made a full recovery from preoperative neurologic deficits, with partial recovery observed in the remaining patients. The rates of improvement and full recovery from VA decrease were 92.9% and 57.1%, respectively; those from VF defect were 94.7% and 36.8%, respectively; and those from ocular palsy were 100.0% and 96.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, initial visual impairment score (>= 20) was the only significant risk factor for postoperative neurologic sequelae (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 40.8). Surgical timing was not associated with postoperative neurological recovery (P < 0.733).
   CONCLUSIONS: Ocular palsy was fully recovered in 96.4% patients with pituitary apoplexy after transsphenoidal surgery. Initial visual impairment status was found to be more strongly associated with postoperative neurologic recovery than surgical timing.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion are associated with approach-related disadvantages. Oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is the proposed solution, especially for upper lumbar levels. We analyzed the size and regional anatomy of the corridor used in the OLIF technique between levels L1 and L5.
   METHODS: This is a morphometric study of 200 randomly selected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies with features of lumbar degenerative disease. On MRI, the oblique corridor was defined as the smallest distance between the psoas major muscle and aorta or inferior vena cava (or common iliac artery) and measured at the L1/L2, L2/L3, L3/L4, and L4/L5 disc levels on both the left and right on the axial images at the mid-disc level.
   RESULTS: Mean distances of the oblique corridor on the left side were L1/L2 [18.90 mm, L2/L3 [15.50 mm; L3/L4 [12.75 mm, and L4/L5 [8.92 mm; on the right side, they were L1/L2 [14.80 mm, L2/L3 [5.50 mm, L3/L4 [3.00 mm, and L4/L5 [1.46 mm. For both sides, the corridor size was not significantly affected by sex, and it increased with age and decreased at the inferior lumbar disc levels. The L1/L2 and L2/L3 levels may be obstructed by the ipsilateral kidney and renal vasculature on both sides and the liver on the right side.
   CONCLUSIONS: A left-sided OLIF approach is viable for both sexes. Oblique access to the L1/L2 and L2/L3 disc levels is feasible regardless of age, whereas the L3/L4 and L4/L5 levels may be more suitable in older patients, especially for male patients. The right-sided approach is less likely to be performed effectively.

AB BACKGROUND: The prognosis and recurrence rate after resection of an anterior skull base lesion via transciliary supraorbital keyhole craniotomy depend on residual tumor volume. The extent to which pathology and size of tumor influence the resection rate using this approach is unknown.
   METHODS: Sixty-two patients underwent a total of 64 operations using the supraorbital keyhole approach in this retrospective study. Meningioma was the most common tumor, followed by pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma. Age, sex, tumor volume, operative duration, blood loss, and complication rates were evaluated. Pre-and postoperative residual tumor volumes were measured using OsiriX software (medical image viewer system) based on magnetic resonance imaging. A 15-mL cut value divided the subjects into large versus small meningioma groups.
   RESULTS: The average resection rate for meningiomas was 95.2% compared with 83.9% for craniopharyngiomas and 53.2% for pituitary adenomas. The major complication rate (primarily blindness and hemiplegia) was 4.48% in all tumors. No operative-related deaths occurred. There were no surgical revisions to traditional large craniotomies. No significant differences in age, sex, postoperative volumes, resection rates, or recurrence rates were noted between small and large meningioma groups. However, longer operative times and hospital stays, and greater blood loss occurred in the large meningioma group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transciliary keyhole craniotomy is a safe and effective approach for anterior skull base tumors, especially meningiomas. Excellent resection results were achieved even in cases of large meningiomas. Although longer operative times, longer hospital stays, and greater blood loss occurred in larger compared with smaller meningioma cases, recurrence rates were similar.

AB OBJECTIVE: The frequency and extent of epidural fluid collection after percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) have not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of epidural fluid collection after PELD.
   METHODS: From March 2008 to November 2015, immediate postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 464 consecutive patients, comprising 284 men and 180 women, were obtained after PELD. The mean age of the patients at the time of admission was 43.1 years (range, 18-81 years). We also performed 24-hour follow-up MRIs after PELD in 35 patients to evaluate the morphologic changes on epidural fluid collection and to identify whether the collection was due to saline accumulation or cerebrospinal fluid leak.
   RESULTS: The level of disc herniation was at L4-5, L5-S1, L3-4, and L2-3 in 245 (52.8%), 173 (37.3%), 37 (8.0%), and 9 (1.9%) patients, respectively. Of 464 patients, 418 (90.1%) had abnormal epidural fluid collection, 404 (87.1%) patients had ventral epidural fluid collection, 393 (84.7%) patients had dorsal epidural fluid collection, and 10 patients had epidural hematoma as per immediate postoperative MRI. According to the 24-hour follow-up MRI findings, 30 patients had epidural fluid collection; the epidural fluid collection in 28 patients (93.3%) resolved with time, and a minimal amount of fluid remained in 2 patients, but the lesion size decreased compared with that on the previous day.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epidural fluid collection usually occurs after percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, which is mainly due to saline accumulation and typically resolves with time, without treatment or complications.

AB PURPOSE: To assess clinical outcomes after dynamic stabilization in discogenic low back pain.
   METHODS: From April 2012 to January 2015, 23 patients with discogenic low back pain were treated with dynamic stabilization via the Wiltse approach. Main clinical assessments included visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and complications. Radiographs were evaluated for lumbar range of motion and intervertebral height. The Woodend classification was determined by magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: There were 23 cases evaluated with a mean follow-up time of 39 months. At last follow-up, visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved significantly compared with preoperatively (P < 0.05). At the stabilized segments, the height of intervertebral discs was increased significantly after surgery (P < 0.05). At last follow-up, the height was reduced to the preoperative level. At the operated segment, 47.4% of the flexion/extension range of motion was retained. Six discs showed rehydration with 1 grade improvement on the Woodend classification.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic stabilization was a safe and effective treatment in carefully selected groups of patients with discogenic low back pain and promoted disc regeneration to some extent.

   RISK-FACTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior cerebral artery aneurysms (ACAs) are characterized by higher rupture rate and small size at rupture. It was shown that the aneurysm/vessel size ratio, and not the absolute size, might predict the risk of rupture in small unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between a size ratio and outcome in patients with unruptured nondissecting ACA aneurysms (UNDAs).
   METHODS: A total of 187 consecutive patients with 12 A1 (6.2%), 149 anterior communicating artery (77%), and 33 distal ACA (17%) aneurysms were retrospectively evaluated. The size ratio was defined as (size of aneurysm)/(size of parent artery). Neurologic worsening (NW) was defined as an increase in score of 1 or more on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patient population was 63 +/- 11 years and 132 UNDAs (68%) were seen in women. Complete, partial neck clipping, and aneurysm trapping were archived in 188 (97%), 2 (1.0%), and 4 (2.1%) UNDAs, respectively. An excellent outcome (mRS score 0) at 12 months was archived in 177 (93%) UNDAs overall and 177 (95%) in UNDAs with preoperative mRS score of 0 (n = 186). Postoperative ischemic lesions (odds ratio, 193; 95% confidence interval, 17-2205; P < 0.0001) and the size ratio > 3.0 (odds ratio, 11; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-105; P = 0.031) were related to 12-month NW on multivariate analysis. The aneurysm size was not related to 12-month NW.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the size ratio, and not the absolute size, was related to 12-month NW in surgically treated UNDAs.

   CLINICAL-FEATURES; BASILAR ARTERY; FOLLOW-UP; STENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Acute dissecting aneurysms of the posterior circulation are a rare cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Established endovascular treatment options include parent artery occlusion and stent-assisted coiling, but appear to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Vessel reconstruction with flow diverters is an alternative treatment option; however, its safety and efficacy in the acute stage remains unclear.
   METHODS: This is a multicentric retrospective analysis of 15 consecutive acutely ruptured dissecting posterior circulation aneurysms treated with flow diverters. The primary end point was favorable aneurysm occlusion, defined as OKM C1-3 and D (O'Kelly Marotta scale). Secondary end points were procedure-related complications and clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: Nine of 15 aneurysms (60%) arose from the intradural portion of the vertebral artery, 3 were located on the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and 1 each on the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior cerebral artery, and basilar artery. Flow diverter placement was technically successful in 14 of 15 cases (93%). After endovascular treatment, none of the ruptured aneurysms rebled. Median clinical follow-up was 217 days and median angiographic follow-up was 203 days. Favorable occlusion was observed in 7 of 14 aneurysms (50%) directly after flow diverter placement; of those, 5 were completely occluded (36%). Seven patients (47%) with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage died in the acute phase. Favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale <= 2) was observed in 4 of 15 patients (27%) and a moderate outcome (modified Rankin scale 3/4) was observed in 5 of 15 patients (33%). All aneurysms showed complete occlusion at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters might be a feasible, alternative treatment option for acutely ruptured dissecting posterior circulation aneurysms and may effectively prevent rebleeding. Larger cohort studies are required to validate these results.

AB OBJECTIVE: Brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs) account for up to 18% of all intracranial cavernous malformations. Due to their complex anatomic location, they represent a significant challenge for neurosurgeons. As such, the identification of risk factors associated with negative outcomes is of significant importance. We analyze a series of 50 cases of BSCMs treated surgically in order to identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical resection of BSCM at our institution between 2000 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of unfavorable outcomes, defined as those with a modified Rankin score (mRs) of > 2.
   RESULTS: Fifty Latin American patients, with a mean age of 35.85 +/- 13.06 years, consisting of 29 females (58%) and 21 males (42%), underwent surgical resection. Mean modified Rankin Scale (mRs) score at admission was 2.6 +/- 1.05, and the mean BCSM size was 18.00 +/- 7.19 mm. The rate of gross total resection was 92%. Overall, 80% of patients showed improved or unchanged clinical status at the last follow-up period; however, only 58% of patients had a favorable outcome with a mean mRs of 2.33 +/- 1.136. Multivariable logistic binary regression identified hemorrhagic recurrence (P = 0.040), lower cranial nerve deficit (P = 0.019), and BSCMs > 15 mm in diameter (P = 0.006) as predictive factors for unfavorable surgical outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: BSCM size, compromise of lower cranial nerves, and hemorrhagic recurrence before surgery were identified as risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes of surgically treated BSCMs in this cohort.

AB INTRODUCTION: Early decompression craniectomy (within 48 hours of stroke onset) in acute and malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke (IS) reduces mortality and increases the proportion of patients with favorable functional outcome. Various cultural and social issues among Asians lead to some differences in clinical practice, especially when surgical interventions are involved. Accordingly, decompressive craniectomy in Asian patients with stroke is often delayed.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for all patients with acute IS hospitalized in our center were entered into a prospectively maintained registry. In this retrospective analysis, data for all patients with malignant MCA IS who underwent decompressive craniectomy were extracted. Various demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging factors were analyzed for identifying independent predictors of favorable functional outcome at 6 months, which was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3 points.
   RESULTS: From January 2005 to December 2014, a total of 75 patients with acute MCA IS underwent decompressive craniectomy. Median age was 55 years (interquartile range 44-64) with male preponderance (66%) and median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score 21 points (interquartile range 18-24). A considerable proportion of these patients (38.7%) received intravenous thrombolysis. The majority (70%) of patients suffered right MCA IS, and decompressive surgery was performed within 48 hours of symptom onset in 50 (67%) of the patients. Favorable functional outcome was achieved in 25 (33.3%) patients at 6 months. Right MCA stroke (odds ratio 9.158; 95% confidence interval 1.881-44.596, P = 0.006) and early decompression surgery (odds ratio 4.011; 95% confidence interval 1.058-15.208, P = 0.041) were independent predictors of favorable functional outcome at 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early decompression craniectomy, especially in right MCA ischemic stroke, is associated with better favorable functional outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: The growing elderly population has contributed to an increasing incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in this cohort worldwide. Here we describe our institutional experience in the management of TBI in elderly Indian patients.
   METHODS: This was a 3-year retrospective analysis of 73 consecutive patients age >= 65 years admitted to our university hospital with TBI. Exclusion criteria included a history of concussion injury, chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), discharge against medical advice, and declared dead within 6 hours after arrival. Mode of injury, clinicoradiologic features, management, and outcomes were analyzed. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to assess outcome.
   RESULTS: Our cohort was predominately male (82%). The mean patient age was 72.1 years (range, 65-97 years), and 20 were age >= 75 years. Head injuries (HIs) were mild in 37 patients, moderate in 18, and severe in 18. The majority of injuries were contusions. Fifty-five patients (75%) were managed conservatively, and 18 (25%) underwent surgery. There were 7 deaths (9.5%). The rate of poor outcome was 26% overall, and 45% in patients age >= 75 years. Poor outcome in severe HI was seen in 83% (15 of 18) of the entire cohort but in 100% (7 of 7) of the very elderly patients. On univariate analysis, age >= 75 years, severe HI, acute SDH, and surgical management were significantly associated with poor outcome while acute SDH and surgical management were significant on multilogistic regression analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Age >= 75 years, severe HI, and acute SDH are poor prognostic factors in patients with TBI. The benefit of surgery in these patients is unlikely, and surgery needs to weighed judiciously, keeping in mind the economics involved and the fate of caregivers, especially in developing countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the validity of a virtual surgical training system on lumbar pedicle screw placement for residents.
   METHODS: Ten inexperienced residents were randomly assigned to the simulation training (ST) group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The ST group performed the lumbar pedicle screw placement on the virtual surgical training system, and the control group was given an introductory teaching session before the cadaver test. A total of 8 adult fresh cadavers including 5 males and 3 females were collected and randomly allocated to the 2 groups. Each group performed the bilateral L1-L5 pedicle screw instrumentation in the cadaver specimens, respectively. Accuracy was assessed by computed tomography after instrumentation. The screw penetration rates, acceptable rates, and average screw penetration distance of the 2 groups were compared using statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: The screw penetration rate of the ST group (12.5%) was significantly lower than the control group (37.5%, P < 0.05). The screw acceptable rates in ST and control groups were 100% and 85%, respectively, with statistical differences between each other (P < 0.05). There was also a statistically significant difference of the average screw penetration distance between the ST (1.37 +/- 0.62 mm) group and control group (2.42 +/- 0.51 mm, P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The virtual surgery simulation with greater accuracy is superior to the traditional teaching methods in surgical training of pedicle screw placement and can be used as a promising alternative for training of neurosurgical procedures.

AB BACKGROUND: It is unclear which patients have the greatest risk of developing complications in the first days after endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (ETS) and how long patients should stay hospitalized after surgery. The objective of this study is to identify which patients are at risk for early postoperative medical and surgical reinterventions to optimize the length of hospitalization.
   METHODS: The medical records of 146 patients who underwent ETS for a pituitary adenoma between January 2013 and July 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Data were collected on baseline patient-related characteristics, characteristics of the pituitary adenoma, perioperative complications and interventions, and postoperative outcomes. Patients who underwent additional interventions on days 2, 3, and 4 after ETS were identified as cases, and patients who did not have any interventions after day 1 postoperatively were identified as controls.
   RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 4.279; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.149-15.933; P = 0.03), incomplete adenoma resection (OR, 2.840; 95% CI, 1.228-6.568; P = 0.02) and increased morning sodium concentration on day 2 after surgery (OR, 5.211; 95% CI, 2.158-12.579; P < 0.001) were associated with reinterventions. Patients without interventions on day 1 or 2 had only an 18.6% chance of a reintervention (OR, 0.201; 95% CI, 0.095-0.424).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes mellitus, incomplete adenoma resection, and increased morning sodium concentration on day 2 after surgery have an increased chance on reinterventions. In addition, patients without any interventions on day 1 and 2 are at low risk for later reinterventions. These patients could be suitable candidates for early hospital discharge.

ID BREAST-CANCER; BENEFIT; SURVIVORS; STRESS; IMPACT
AB OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to describe the quality of life (QoL) changes of survivors of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) 1 year after surgery and to identify determinants of QoL with an emphasis on the role of perceived posttraumatic growth (PTG). We also tried to examine the linear and quadratic relationship between QoL and PTG.
   METHODS: Two hundred sixty participants were included in the final data analysis. The Chinese version of posttraumatic growth inventory and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain scale were used to measure PTG and QoL. Hierarchical linear models were fitted to explore the individual time trajectories in change of QoL and examine the relationship between demographics, clinical features, PTG, and QoL.
   RESULTS: All dimensions of QoL and PTG increased over time except physical well-being, social well-being in QoL, and new possibilities in PTG. Time, PTG score, insurance, socioeconomic status, and right hemisphere tumor position were positive predictors of QoL. Seizure and depression negatively predicted QoL. The quadratic of PTG predicted QoL; however, the coefficient of quadratic PTG approached zero.
   CONCLUSIONS: In general, PTG and QoL increased over time. Perceived PTG could significantly predict QoL of LGGs survivors 1 year after surgery. A quadratic relation between PTG and QoL was not found. Although our data suggested that the growth of QoL may vary across different patients, there were only 2 time points in this study. Future studies should set more time points to examine this relationship.

   RECOMMENDATIONS; MANAGEMENT; STATEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard to confirm complete removal of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus. However, the transfemoral approach requires specialized instrumentation and is cumbersome and difficult to perform with the patient in the prone or decubitus position. We report the use of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (iDSA) with the transradial approach and examine its usefulness and safety.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical features, radiologic images, surgical findings, and iDSA findings of patients with AVM who underwent surgery for nidus removal. Transradial iDSA was performed within 30 minutes for patients who required angiographic confirmation after AVM resection. This procedure was simple with the radial arterial line for blood pressure monitoring used as digital subtraction angiography catheter access route.
   RESULTS: Transradial iDSA was performed in 23 patients. Twelve patients were not in the general supine position during neurosurgery; 7 patients were operated on in prone position, and 5 patients were operated on in the park bench position. Remnant nidus was identified by iDSA in 2 patients, and additional measures were required.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebral angiography during surgery for cerebral AVM could be performed safely via the transradial approach. This approach showed several merits in terms of easy access; no extra requirements, such as preoperative sheath implantation, anticoagulation during the surgery, or a radiolucent table; and usefulness in any surgical position. Further studies using this approach and comparison with the transfemoral approach are necessary.

AB BACKGROUND: Advances in minimally invasive interbody fusion have greatly enhanced surgeons' capability to correct adult spinal deformity with reduced morbidity. However, the feasibility of such approaches is limited in patients with previous osteoporotic fractures as the resultant vertebral deformity renders the end plate geometry incongruous with conventional interbody implants. Current 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology offers a novel solution by fabricating custom-made implants tailored to individual anatomy. We present the results of a patient with osteoporotic lumbar fractures treated by such technology.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old woman, with previous osteoporotic fractures at L2 and L3 resulting in concave deformity of the end plates, presented with intractable radiculopathy secondary to lateral recess and foraminal stenosis (L2-3 and L3-4). A minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion at L2-3 and L3-4 was considered favorable, but due to the associated vertebral collapse, off-the-shelf implants were not compatible with patient anatomy. In silico simulation based on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging was thus conducted to design customized cages to cater for the depressed recipient end plates and vertebral loss. The design was converted to implantable titanium cages through 3D additive manufacturing. At surgery, a tight fit between the implants and the targeted disk space was achieved. Postoperative CT scan confirmed excellent implant-end plate matching and restoration of lost disk space. The patient began to ambulate from postoperative day 1 and at 6-month follow-up resolution of radicular symptoms and CT evidence of interbody fusion were recorded.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D-printed custom-made interbody cages can help overcome the difficulties in deformity correction secondary to osteoporotic fractures.

AB BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) of the central nervous system (CNS) with synchronous or metachronous extra-CNS disease is a rare childhood malignancy with a dismal prognosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 7-week-old female with metastatic AT/RT and synchronous malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney who received an intensive multimodal approach combining surgical resection, intrathecal chemotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). She is currently 24 months old without any evidence of disease. In addition, we completed an extensive literature review of cases with CNS AT/RT and synchronous or metachronous extra-CNS primary tumors. To date, 31 pediatric cases have been reported, and the median overall-survival was 6 months after diagnosis. The only 3 survivors received autologous PBSCT, and 2 of these patients had complete resection of their CNS tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of CNS AT/RT with extra-CNS primary disease and the lack of standard treatment contribute to its reported dismal prognosis. We report a case of a long-term survivor with metastatic AT/RT and synchronous extra-CNS primary tumor. Maximal surgical resection, intrathecal chemotherapy, and consolidative autologous PBSCT may improve prognosis and avoid radiation.

ID DISC SURGERY; HERNIATION; DIAGNOSIS; BACK
AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation complicated with nerve root anomaly presents great challenges to diagnosis and treatment. Improper selection of surgical procedures may cause inferior outcomes and neurologic injury.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year old man presented with low back pain and radicular symptoms involving bilateral L5 and S1 nerve roots. Instead of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy, aggressive decompression was carried out because of a deviation between the examination and imaging findings. Surgical detection disclosed a confluent nerve root comprising 2 adjacent contributions that arose from the thecal sac exiting from the left L5/S1 foramen, in the absence of the root otherwise exiting through the caudal foramen. We found that the overwhelming left radicular symptoms were attributable to compression on this swelling anomalous root by a narrowed L5/S1 root cannula. Aggressive decompression and distraction of the intervertebral space successfully released the nerve root. Twenty months postoperatively, the patient experienced evident relief of the radicular symptoms and improvement of muscle strength with no complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lumbosacral nerve root anomaly should be remembered and ruled out before selecting surgical methods. Inappropriate procedures can not alleviate the symptoms associated with the anomalous roots and may expose such patients to the risk of neural injury. In clinical practice, surgeons should select percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy with caution, and stop the procedure instantly when unexplainable radicular irritation is evoked.

DT Review
DE Acute respiratory failure; Parkinson disease; Postoperative; Stridor
ID MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; INVOLVEMENT; PALSY
AB BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, is commonly thought of as a motion disorder, but it can have significant effect on the respiratory system. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in these patients, but it can also affect laryngeal function causing dysphonia, dysphagia, and dysarthric speech. Acute upper airway obstruction is a rare finding in PD, especially in the perioperative settings. In this article we report a PD patient who developed upper respiratory obstruction post-operatively. We also review the literature and highlight the importance of preoperative evaluation to identify patients who may be at risk of this complication.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a PD patient presenting for brain stimulation electrode implantation under general anesthesia, who postoperatively developed stridor and near complete upper airway obstruction despite maintenance of oral anti-Parkinson medication regimen intraoperatively. The patient was reintubated in post-anesthesia-care unit, and tracheostomy was performed after 1 week due to persistent vocal cord dysfunction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Baseline vocal cord impairment in PD patients can be acutely aggravated perioperatively. Symptoms such as dysphagia and dysarthria, which can indicate susceptibility to postoperative upper airway obstruction, may not be well recognized by the patient and family. Surgical candidates should be carefully interviewed preoperatively, and watchful monitoring of respiratory function intraoperatively and postoperatively is of paramount importance. Neurosurgical and neuroanesthesia team should be aware of, and prepared to manage, this potentially life-threatening airway obstruction in PD patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Injury of the ureter is a potentially devastating complication most often reported in gynecologic, colorectal, or vascular pelvic surgery or endoscopic procedures for ureteric diseases. We report a rare case of ureteral rupture occurring as a complication of percutaneous pedicle screw placement.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old man reported unbearable abdominal pain on the day after right L4-L5 transforaminal intervertebral fusion and percutaneous pedicle screw placement. A computer tomography workup showed contrast media extravasation outside the excretory system consistent with a left ureteral traumatic perforation. The patient underwent left nephrostomy and a double-J stent insertion and subsequently fully recovered. The ureter completely healed, enabling stent removal 5 months later.
   METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were screened for ureteral injury caused by posterior lumbar surgery.
   RESULTS: We found 27 other reports with only 1 other case after minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complications of minimally invasive pedicle screw placement are often described as dural tear of neurologic impairment. This report shows that unexpected side effects are still possible and spine surgeons should be aware especially when performing minimally invasive procedures, in which, by definition, pedicles are concealed from direct visualization.

DT Article
DE Adamkiewicz; Aneurysm; Artery; Spine; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID SPINAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; INTRADURAL ARTERY; SECONDARY
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an isolated spinal aneurysm is extremely rare. Patients usually present with symptoms and signs resulting from spinal cord compression. No standard guidelines are available for the treatment of this condition.
   CASE ILLUSTRATION: In this report we present the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian male who presented with sudden-onset back pain and bilateral lower extremity weakness. Spinal angiogram revealed an isolated aneurysm of the artery of Adamkiewicz. The aneurysm was successfully managed by surgical clipping, and the patient recovered well with rehabilitation. At 46 months' follow-up, the patient was able to ambulate and perform activities of daily living independently.
   CONCLUSION: Our case is the first description of surgical clipping of a ruptured isolated spinal aneurysm of the artery of Adamkiewicz with a long-term successful outcome and shows that it is a safe and feasible option in carefully selected patients.

   TREMOR; MEDICAL THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: While deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a relatively safe procedure, skin erosion is a commonly reported hardware complication that can threaten the DBS system. Patients with Parkinson disease are especially at risk for this complication due to their autonomic dysregulation and impaired nutrition. Early detection of impending skin erosion allows for intervention that may prevent hardware destruction. Here we report a novel technique to address this complication preemptively. We describe the use of an acellular dermal matrix to prevent skin erosion in 20 patients with Parkinson disease who were treated with DBS and showed signs of impending skin erosion.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with signs of impending hardware erosion were identified. An acellular dermal matrix was surgically placed under the at-risk skin overlying the DBS lead.
   RESULTS: None of the 20 patients treated with this technique went on to require further revision surgery or removal of hardware.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical placement of acellular dermal matrix in patients identified as having impending hardware erosions is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent hardware complications.

AB BACKGROUND: The association between pre-intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) statin use and clinical outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still conflicting. Recently, some studies investigating the effects of in-hospital statin use after the onset of ICH have been published. To provide a more complete picture of the clinical effects of statin use in ICH, we performed a systematic review to examine whether statin use influences clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in our systematic review. Metaanalysis of 12 studies suggested that pre-ICH statins use did not significantly decrease mortality when aggregated across all time points tested-that is, inhospital or at 30 or 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.03). Meta-analysis of 7 studies suggested that pre-ICH statins use did not significantly affect poor functional outcomes, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3-6 (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72-1.18) or mRS score of 4-6 (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.60-1.40). Meta-analysis of 7 studies suggested that in-hospital statin use significantly decreased mortality when aggregated across all time points tested (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.28-0.50). Statin discontinuation was independently associated with poor clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patients with pre-ICH statin use did not improve clinical outcomes. However, in-hospital statin use can significantly decrease mortality after ICH. In-hospital statin therapy might be beneficial for patients with ICH.

ID SPINE FUSION; SAFETY; RHBMP-2; MATRIX; BMP-2; GRAFT
AB BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) graft showed promising outcome during early phases of its use. However, unreported adverse events and off-label use shattered its safe profile and raised concerns regarding its indication. In 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited its use in anterior cervical spine procedures due to the possibility of edema, hematoma, and need to intubate. At the molecular level, BMPs act as multifactorial growth factors playing a role in cartilage, heart, and bone formation. However, its unfavorable effect on bone overgrowth or heterotopic ossification post spine surgeries has been described. Reported cases in the literature were limited to epidural bone formation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare and interesting case of a 59-year-old female, in whom BMP caused intradural bone growth several years after an anterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery.
   CONCLUSION: Caution must be exercised while using BMPs because of inadvertent complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery after surgery for craniosynostosis is a complication that has never been described in the pertinent literature. Although reported for other types of surgeries, no case has been described in the pediatric population.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a case of pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery that occurred 9 days after corrective surgery for scaphocephaly. We also describe the management of this complication.
   CONCLUSION: Pseudoaneurysm is an exceptional complication in surgery for craniosynostosis, but it should be considered in case of swelling in the temporal region.

AB BACKGROUND: Presurgical evaluation for temporal lobe epilepsy routinely assesses speech and memory lateralization and anatomic localization of the motor and visual areas but not baseline musical processing. This is paramount in a musician. Although validated tools exist to assess musical ability, there are no reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms to assess musical processing. We examined the utility of a novel fMRI paradigm in an 18-year-old left-handed pianist who underwent surgery for a left temporal low-grade ganglioglioma.
   METHODS: Preoperative evaluation consisted of neuropsychological evaluation, T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and fMRI. Auditory blood oxygen leveledependent fMRI was performed using a dedicated auditory scanning sequence. Three separate auditory investigations were conducted: listening to, humming, and thinking about a musical piece.
   RESULTS: All auditory fMRI paradigms activated the primary auditory cortex with varying degrees of auditory lateralization. Thinking about the piece additionally activated the primary visual cortices (bilaterally) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Humming demonstrated left-sided predominance of auditory cortex activation with activity observed in close proximity to the tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an fMRI paradigm for evaluating musical processing that could form part of preoperative assessment for patients undergoing temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy.

ID SPONTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION; DURA-MATER; VARIX; RADICULOPATHY;
   ENHANCEMENT; PUNCTURE; VEINS; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Overshunting of cerebrospinal fluid may lead to intracranial hypotension and dilation of spinal epidural veins. Radiculopathy may rarely occur secondary to engorged spinal epidural veins. In addition, the cause of radiculopathy may be obscured by concomitant spinal degenerative changes. We present a case and review the pathogenesis as well as the current clinical literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman presented with positional headaches from intracranial hypotension in the setting of cerebrospinal fluid over-shunting. The patient also had back pain and lumbar radiculopathy, which became more severe after lumboperitoneal shunt placement. On radiographic work-up, there was evidence of right L5 nerve root impingement secondary to a disc bulge and an engorged lumbar epidural venous plexus secondary to overshunting. The patient underwent surgery for a planned L4-5 decompression with a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. The operation was complicated by rapid blood loss originating from the epidural venous plexus, and we were unable to safely place the interbody graft.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal surgeons need to be aware of the rare diagnosis of radiculopathy secondary to epidural venous plexus engorgement, as it may change the treatment approach or lead to deleterious intraoperative consequences, such as hemorrhage.

   MYELOPATHY; FEATURES; LIPOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF), the most common type of spinal vascular malformation, tends to manifest as progressive myelopathy over several years. Spinal dural AVFs are considered an acquired lesion and, in contrast to spinal arteriovenous malformations, are not often associated with other anomalies. The presence of a spinal dural AVF in the setting of a lipomyelomeningocele and tethered cord is extremely rare. Both lesions tend to cause similar symptoms, and patients with concomitant lesions generally require surgical intervention for both.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female with lifelong urinary incontinence and mild weakness in the left lower extremity presented with progressive worsening of left lower extremity weakness as well as worsening bowel and bladder incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 4 years before our evaluation revealed a lipomyelomeningocele and a tethered cord; a new MRI demonstrated a new additional finding of flow voids suspicious of an underlying vascular malformation. Diagnostic angiography revealed a dural AVF fed by a left lateral sacral artery. Onyx embolization of the dural AVF was performed, and the patient improved steadily postoperatively without the need for surgically addressing the tethered cord.
   CONCLUSION: In this case report, we present evidence of de novo development of a spinal dural AVF associated with a lipomyelomeningocele. In addition, this is the second documented patient in the literature with a lipomyelomeningocele and concomitant dural AVF who did not undergo detethering of the cord as part of treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical management of lesions located in the upper clival region is challenging. Complex open transcranial approaches have been used to reach surgical targets in these areas. The frontotemporozygomatic approach combined with an intradural posterior clinoidectomy has been proposed as the most reliable route to manage such lesions. We investigated combining a minimally invasive endoscopic endonasal extradural posterior clinoidectomy (EPC) with a standard frontolateral approach to expand the working area within the upper clival region.
   METHODS: Investigators dissected 10 human cadaveric heads at the Laboratory of Surgical NeuroAnatomy of the University of Barcelona. The heads were positioned to simulate a supine position, enabling the simultaneous use of both endonasal and frontolateral routes. The dissections were divided into 3 steps-standard frontolateral approach, EPC, and re-evaluation of the frontolateral route-aiming to compare the surgical exposure before and after EPC.
   RESULTS: After EPC, through the frontolateral pathway it was possible to improve visualization and working angles to the interpeduncular fossa and retrosellar and upper clival regions. Increase in extension of the carotid-oculomotor window was 7 mm and 10 mm before and after the posterior clinoidectomy, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: EPC provided extra working space for the frontolateral approach to the upper clival area with 42.8% expansion of the carotid-oculomotor triangle. Surgical series are needed to demonstrate clinical advantages and disadvantages of this novel combined approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal osteochondroma is a rare but recognized cause of myelopathy. Brown-Sequard syndrome is a form of severe myelopathy characterized by a clinical picture of hemisection of the spinal cord. Brown-Sequard syndrome caused by osteochondroma is extremely rare, calling for individualized surgical procedures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 16-year-old girl with hereditary multiple exostoses and a rare case of thoracic osteochondroma causing partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. Customized surgical procedures were designed to avoid iatrogenic spinal cord injury. The patient underwent neural decompression and tumor excision through a transpedicular approach. The surgical procedure consisted of 4 consecutive steps: 1) laminectomy, 2) costotransversectomy and pediculectomy, 3) extracavitary removal of the mass, and 4) pedicular fixation with fusion. Total resection of the tumor was achieved macroscopically without intraoperative spinal cord injury. The postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient returned to a normal life without evidence of recurrence at 24-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with hereditary multiple exostosis and new onset of neurologic symptoms, the possibility of a spinal osteochondroma should be considered. In the situation of an intraspinal exostosis protruding from the lateral side, customized surgical procedures with a transpedicular approach may be a valid way to minimize intraoperative neural injury and achieve a satisfactory outcome.

   HYDROCEPHALUS; CT; PATIENT; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Although cranioplasty is a common procedure, it may cause a variety of complications. Massive brain swelling after cranioplasty (MBSC) is an unusual complication that has been reported more frequently in recent years. Most of the existing information about this condition is speculative and the cause remains unclear.
   METHODS: A PubMed and Scopus search adhering to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was performed to include studies reporting patients with MBSC. Different information was analyzed in these cases to describe the characteristics and identify risk factors for MBSC.
   RESULTS: The search yielded 19 articles with a total of 26 patients. All studies were case reports and small case series. In most patients, preoperative intracranial hypotension and a considerable degree of sinking of skin flap were identified; this was the only constant finding observed in these cases. In addition, we propose a grading system to estimate the degree of preoperative sinking of skin flap and an algorithm with recommendations to decrease the incidence of MBSC.
   CONCLUSIONS: MBSC is an unusual, highly lethal, and probably under-reported condition. The information gathered in this review indicates that MBSC occurs secondary to a cascade of pathologic events triggered by the bone flap implantation. This evidence suggests that the primary pathologic change is a sudden increase in the intracranial pressure acting on a brain chronically exposed to intracranial hypotension.

AB BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine, an antibodyedrug conjugate commonly abbreviated as T-DM1, is accepted as effective therapy for trastuzumab-resistant metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 significantly increases progression-free and overall survival when compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. Among the common side effects related to T-DM1, thrombocytopenia and mucosal hemorrhage are seen, although they are infrequently judged to be clinically significant. Intracranial hemorrhages are extremely rare, and only 3 cases of hematomas have been reported in association with T-DM1 and remote radiotherapy, 2 of them with progressive enlargement.
   OBJECTIVE: Herein we describe a patient who presented with a cerebellar hematoma that progressively enlarged over 8 months during treatment with T-DM1 and only a few months after whole-brain radiation therapy plus a stereotactic radiosurgery boost for a HER2-positive breast cancer cerebellar metastasis. The pathology of the hematoma was similar to that in previous cases and suggested a unique pathophysiology related to an interaction between T-DMI and radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: A progressively enlarging intraparenchymal hematoma can be seen just a few months after delivery of radiation therapy for a metastatic brain lesion in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who are receiving T-DM1. In such patients, even a small focus of hemorrhage on magnetic resonance images should prompt close follow-up with serial imaging.

AB BACKGROUND: Catheter-based endovascular thrombectomy has gained popularity for use in patients with acute large-vessel occlusion; however, various complications have been reported. Herein, we present a unique, serious procedure-related complication.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 91-year-old woman with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion underwent endovascular thrombectomy with a stent retriever, but the device could not be retrieved from the horizontal segment of MCA during the procedure. Subsequently, she underwent emergency craniotomy. The lodged stent was extracted with microforceps using a counter-stretch of the vessels, so as not to avulse the perforating arteries. The stent device was retrieved uneventfully through a sheath introducer that was inserted through the femoral artery. Postprocedural indocyanine green video angiography showed complete recanalization of the MCA and internal cerebral artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is a rare case in which successful open surgery was performed to retrieve a snagged stent retriever, with successful recanalization of the large cerebral artery occlusion.

ID VIRUS VASCULOPATHY; MRI; OPHTHALMICUS; FEATURES; STENOSIS; ADULTS
AB BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus in the trigeminal nerve. HZO-initiated cerebral vasculopathy is well characterized; however, there are no documented cases that report the efficacy of surgical revascularization for improving cerebral hemodynamics following progressive HZO-induced vasculopathy. We present a case in which quantitative anatomic and hemodynamic imaging were performed longitudinally before and after surgical revascularization in a patient with HZO and vasculopathic changes.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female with history of right-sided HZO presented with left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria and multiple acute infarcts. Angiography performed serially over a 2-month duration revealed progressive middle cerebral artery stenosis, development of new moyamoya-like lenticulostriate collaterals, and evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in cervical portions of the internal carotid artery. Hemodynamic imaging revealed right hemisphere decreased blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. In addition to medical therapy, right-sided surgical revascularization was performed with the intent to reestablish blood flow. Follow-up imaging 13 months post revascularization demonstrated improved blood flow and vascular reserve capacity in the operative hemisphere, which paralleled symptom resolution.
   CONCLUSIONS: HZO can lead to progressive, symptomatic intracranial stenoses. This report suggests that surgical revascularization techniques can improve cerebral hemodynamics and symptomatology in patients with aggressive disease when medical management is unsuccessful; similar procedures could be considered in managing HZO patients with advanced or progressive vasculopathy.

AB A 23-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because she had suffered from back pain for 3 years and paralysis of both lower limbs for 10 days. Neurologic examination showed sensory disturbance and complete paralysis in bilateral lower extremities with negative Babinski sign. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed there was an enhanced intradural lesion between T2 and T12, which pressed the spinal cord. The lesion was resected completely by laminectomy approach, and the tumor was totally intradural extramedullary. Postoperative pathologic findings confirmed that the lesion was ependymoma. Preoperative symptoms recovered slightly after surgery. The back pain disappeared and muscle strength of both lower extremities returned to level 4 one year after the operation. Meanwhile, her sensory function in both legs improved but was not completely normal. Intradural extramedullary primary ependymomas are rare. To our knowledge, this case is the largest one ever reported in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranial osteomyelitis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires early diagnosis with prompt and appropriate management by neurosurgeons to prevent further central nervous system complications.
   METHODS: The literature in the Medline database was comprehensively reviewed with the keywords "cranial osteomyelitis," "skull base osteomyelitis (SBO)," "central skull base osteomyelitis," and "temporal bone osteomyelitis." Items in the reference list of each article relevant to the objective of this study were reviewed.
   RESULTS: This review produced 183 articles: 13 book chapters, 24 case reports, 17 case series, 98 original articles, 30 review articles, and 1 meta-analysis. We classified cranial osteomyelitis as sinorhino-otogenic, including anterior, middle, and posterior skull base osteomyelitis; and non-sinorhino-otogenic, including iatrogenic, posttraumatic, hematologic, and osteomyelitis with other causes.
   CONCLUSIONS: New diagnostic modalities, the introduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and recent advances in neurosurgical procedures have led to a decrease in the rate of treatment failure in cranial osteomyelitis. Early recognition of initial nonspecific symptoms is key to diagnosing and managing this treatable but life-threatening condition. Early identification of the causative pathogen, appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy over a period of 8-20 weeks, and aggressive surgical debridement are essential for managing cranial osteomyelitis. On the other hand, inadequate treatment is responsible for refractory cases and poses a great diagnostic challenge. A new classification dividing cranial osteomyelitis into sinorhino-otogenic versus nonsinorhinootogenic groups could prove valuable for clinical communication and treatment.

ID ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE; TACHYCARDIA
AB INTRODUCTION: Chiari malformation (CM) type I commonly presents with symptoms such as tussive headaches, paresthesias, and, in severe cases, corticobulbar dysfunction. However, patients may present with atypical symptoms lending to the complexity in this patient population. We present a case of a CM patient presenting with atypical cardiac symptoms and arrhythmias, all of which resolved after surgical decompression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old female presented with atypical chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, headaches, and dizziness for 2 years. Multiple antiarrhythmics and ultimately cardiac ablation procedure proved to be ineffective. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed CM, and the patient ultimately underwent surgical decompression with subsequent resolution of her symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: The surgical management of CM patients presenting with atypical symptoms can be challenging and often lead to delays in intervention. To our knowledge this is the only reported case of a patient presenting with tachyarrhythmia and atypical chest pain with resolution after Chiari decompression. We believe the dramatic improvement documented in the present case should serve to advance Chiari decompression in CM patients presenting with refractory tachyarrhythmia in whom no other discernable cause has been elucidated. Further studies are needed to better correlate the findings and to hopefully establish a criteria for patients that will likely benefit from surgical decompression.

TI Building Healthcare Capacity in Pediatric Neurosurgery and Psychiatry in
   a Post-Soviet System: Ukraine
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Pediatric neurosurgery; Psychiatry; Ukraine
ID FOLIC-ACID
AB OBJECTIVE: Many academic centers in North America are initiating global partnerships to build physician capacity in resource-poor countries. An opportunity arose to develop a pediatric program (Ukraine Paediatric Fellowship Program, UPFP) in Ukraine, a large European country in transition from a Soviet/communist political and social system. This entailed dealing with a centralized and rigid healthcare system based on the Semashko model of the former Soviet Union.
   METHODS: Our capacity-building model has several key features: endowed philanthropic funding for sustainability, bilateral exchange of knowledge, a focus primarily on pediatric brain disorders, and team building. Centers for partnering are selected on the basis of need, receptivity to change, and participants' fluency in English. Ukrainian physicians attend month-long observerships in Toronto, and biannual teaching visits are conducted by Canadian clinicians.
   RESULTS: Over 5 years, 7 teaching visits have taken place, and 20 physicians have trained at SickKids Hospital in Toronto. Six Ukrainian children's hospitals are now collaborating with UPFP. New surgical procedures have been introduced, such as endoscopic ventriculostomy and corpus callosotomy. Patient referrals to regional institutions have increased, and new projects that affect fetal and infant neurodevelopment have been initiated (e.g., treatment of perinatal maternal depression and folic acid fortification of flour). Ukrainian participants rate the program highly in their evaluations.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a short time, UPFP has had considerable success in increasing physician capacity for improved pediatric care in regions of Ukraine. The keys to success have included focusing locally, selecting trustable partners, building incrementally, and creating interspecialty synergies.

TI Newly Diagnosed Acquired Hemophilia A Manifesting as Massive
   Intracranial Hemorrhage Following a Neurosurgical Procedure
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acquired coagulopathies; Acquired hemophilia A; Hemostatic screening;
   Neurosurgical procedure
ID MANAGEMENT; REGISTRY; EACH2; TESTS
AB OBJECTIVE: Increased attention has been paid to limiting preoperative hemostatic screening because assessment of patient history can be used as an alternative. However, there may be some clinical pitfalls in overlooking acquired coagulopathies. Here, we present a case of newly diagnosed acquired hemophilia A (AHA) that manifested as a massive intracranial hemorrhage without unexplained bleeding history or abnormal hemostatic results.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old man, who had a history of surgical clipping of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm 30 years ago, experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage because of a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He underwent surgical clipping and external decompressive craniectomy; 30 days later, cranioplasty was performed without preoperative hemostatic screening because of his normal coagulation status at the time of a previous surgery. Persistent wound bleeding and epistaxis suddenly began 6 hours after surgery. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive intracranial hematoma in the damaged parenchyma, although the patient was asymptomatic. At that time, laboratory tests showed isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and the presence of factor VIII inhibitor, which confirmed AHA. To manage the bleeding, fresh frozen plasma was transfused for 4 consecutive days, and hemostasis was finally achieved. Thereafter, the laboratory test results were normalized in 5 weeks. The patient's clinical course has been uneventful for 7 months without recurrence of AHA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acquired coagulopathies are relatively rare but life-threatening. Because clinical history is insufficient to predict an acquired coagulopathy, preoperative hemostatic screening should be performed before each neurosurgical procedure.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with bitemporal lobe epilepsy are generally not considered for surgical resection. Fortunately, responsive neurostimulation provides another avenue for the management of this challenging disease process. In conjunction with our epileptologist, we consider responsive neurostimulation for patients who have clinical features of temporal lobe epilepsy without clear localization on imaging and stereoelectroencephalography.
   METHODS: Here we describe our technique for implanting a responsive neurostimulator (NeuroPace, NeuroPace Inc., Mountain View, California) with depth electrodes monitoring the hippocampus and para-hippocampus using stereotactic robotic guidance (ROSA, Medtech SA, Montpeillier, France).
   RESULTS: We have used this technique with 5 patients without morbidity. Four of 5 patients have received clinical benefit (Engel classification I-III). Promisingly, long-term seizure monitoring with use of the NeuroPace system has suggested lateralizing information on 3 of these patients that was not apparent on previous invasive monitoring.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robotically implanted responsive neu-rostimulation is a safe and effective treatment for bitemporal epilepsy and can possibly lead to valuable diagnostic information to guide future surgical management in patients who previously were not considered candidates for resective or ablative surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis (OLMA) represents a rare subtype of familial transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis, characterized by deposition of amyloid in cranial and spinal leptomeninges along with ocular involvement. Of >100 TTR mutations identified, few have been associated with OLMA. Herein we describe the first report of leptomeningeal amyloidosis associated with the c.381T>G (p.Ile127Met) TTR mutation, linking this variant to the OLMA phenotype.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53 year-old man presented with a 2-year history of progressive symptoms including upper and lower limb weakness, ataxia, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Neuroimaging, including gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal axis, identified diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along the brainstem and spinal cord plus evidence of hemosiderosis. Pathologic and genetic analyses of biopsy material from enhancing intradural extramedullary tissue at the thoracolumbar junction was diagnostic of amyloidosis of a transthyretin type secondary to a TTR c.381T>G (p.Ile127Met) mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS: OLMA represents a rare subtype of heritable transthyretin amyloidosis that may present with progressive neurological decline secondary to central nervous system leptomeningeal amyloid deposition. This case identifies the c.381T>G (p.Ile127Met) TTR mutation variant as being implicated in the OLMA phenotype.

   Panic disorder; Seizure; Temporal lobe epilepsy
ID GANGLIOGLIOMA; SEIZURES; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Ganglioglioma is a rare, benign, intraaxial glioneuronal tumor but a relatively common cause of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Given its often nonspecific neuropsychiatric manifestations and frequently negative electroencephalographic workup, TLE can be easily misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, particularly panic attacks.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 17-year-old boy who was found to have lesional TLE secondary to a left temporal ganglioglioma, 5 years after having been misdiagnosed with panic disorder and having undergone ineffective and unnecessary psychotherapy. He was successfully cured by surgery. Although a few similar cases of TLE masquerading as a panic disorder have been previously reported in the literature, this is the youngest and only pediatric patient described to date.
   CONCLUSION: This report underscores the challenges in making an accurate clinical diagnosis of TLE and the importance of timely brain imaging whenever an atypical or medically refractory panic disorder is encountered.

AB BACKGROUND: The recurrence rate of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) after trepanation is relatively high and involves various factors. We encountered an extremely rare case in which metastasis of an extracranial malignant tumor to the hematoma capsule was thought to be causing short-term repeated recurrences of CSDH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 74-year-old man who had undergone bur hole evacuation of left CSDH 7 months earlier and had been receiving chemotherapy for stage IV gastric cancer for the preceding 6 months. He presented with symptoms of right hemiparesis and was diagnosed with left CSDH. Bur hole evacuation was performed twice, but the hematoma enlarged again both times within a short period. A third bur hole evacuation was performed after middle meningeal artery embolization, but the hematoma again enlarged shortly thereafter. Hematoma enlargement was finally suppressed by extracting the hematoma capsule under craniotomy. In histopathologic examinations, hematoxylin-eosin staining showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma primarily along the luminal side of the hematoma capsule and immunohistochemical staining showed results identical to findings from the existing gastric cancer. Pathologic results confirmed metastasis of the gastric cancer to the hematoma capsule, and this was considered to be the cause of short-term repeated recurrence of CSDH.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of metastasis to a hematoma capsule originating from an extracranial malignant tumor. The clinical course in the present case suggests metastasis of extracranial malignant tumor to the CSDH capsule as an extremely rare cause of recurrence.

ID NEUROLOGICAL DEFICIT; SPINAL NEURINOMAS; RESECTION; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal schwannomas are the most common intradural extramedullary tumors. However, a string of beadlike schwannomas is rare. In some cases, the beadlike tumors might present a multiple segmental growing pattern, often located in the lumbar spinal canal and on 1 nerve fiber. Despite its benign nature, the resection of this string of beadlike tumors could be a challenge to neurosurgeons, especially when the tumors extend to a long distance.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old female was admitted to our hospital, and her diagnosis was beadlike schwannomas. We performed 2 small hemilaminectomies and pulled all the tumors out gently. The patient made a full recovery quickly after resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this case, we first reported a new surgical approach for the removal of a string of beadlike cauda equina schwannomas. We hypothesize that this procedure would be a potential addition to the present surgical methods under some circumstances.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary cervical melanoma is rare; this is especially true of extradural melanoma arising in the nerve root. Characterizing these cases can provide a basis for improved melanoma management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old female patient with numbness and pain in the right shoulder and arm persisting for 5 years was admitted. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural ladle-shaped mass shape beyond the C7-T1 intervertebral foramen that resembled a nerve sheath tumor. Histopathologic analysis following complete resection confirmed the lesion as malignant melanoma. Radiotherapy and temozolomide and cisplatin chemotherapy were administered in an accompanying hospital with regular follow-ups at our institution. After 2 months of postoperative adjuvant therapy, hepatic metastatic lesions developed. The chemotherapy regimen was changed to carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and recombinant human endostatin injections for a 6-month period. Follow-up 8 months after chemotherapy (16 months post surgery) indicated a good prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the past 10 years only 1 case of primary extradural spinal melanoma in cervical intervertebral foramen has been described, with no reported cases of hepatic metastasis. As radiographic results are not unequivocal, a diagnosis of spinal melanoma must be based on postoperative histologic confirmation. However, to date there is no standard postoperative adjuvant therapy for these patients. The chemotherapy regimen described in this report has broader implications for melanoma treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: The cervicothoracic junction is a challenging anatomic transition in spine surgery. It is commonly affected by different types of diseases that may significantly impair stability in this region. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) is an atypical cervical vertebra with unique anatomic features compared to subaxial cervical spine (C3 to C6). C7 has relatively broader laminae, larger pedicles, smaller lateral masses, and a long nonbifid spinous process. These features allow a variety of surgical methods for performing posterior rigid instrumentation in the form of different types of screws, such as lateral mass screws, pedicle screws, transfacet screws, and intralaminar screws. Many biomechanical studies on cadavers have evaluated and compared different types of implants at C7.
   METHODS: We reviewed PubMed/ Medlineby using specific combinations of keywords to summarize previously published articles that examined C7 posterior rigid instrumentation thoroughly in an experimental fashion on patients or cadavers with additional descriptive radiologic parameters for evaluation of the optimum surgical technique for each type.
   RESULTS: A total of 44 articles were reported, including 22 articles that discussed anatomic considerations (entry points, sagittal and axial trajectories, and features of screws) and another 22 articles that discussed the relevant biomechanical testing at this transitional region if C7 was directly involved in terms of receiving posterior rigid implants.
   CONCLUSIONS: C7 can accommodate different types of screws, which can provide additional benefits and risks based on availability of bony purchase, awareness of surgical technique, biomechanics, and anatomic considerations.

   ANGIOMA; MANAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Brainstem cavernomas (BSCs) are rare and difficult to treat. The treatment strategy for symptomatic lesions in elderly patients remains unclear. In this review, we discuss the optimal treatment strategy and consider effective surgical strategies in elderly patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The clinical data of 8 elderly patients (age > 70 years) with symptomatic BSCs drawn from the literature and 2 of our cases are summarized in this review. The mean patient age was 73.3 +/- 3.13 years, and the most common location was the pons. Multiple rebleeding before surgery was seen in at least 4 cases, with clinical presentation and surgical approach varying depending on the location. Surgical removal was performed in 9 cases, and 1 case was treated with radiosurgery. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 26.1 +/- 18.2 months. Neurologic improvement was found in 5 cases, and postoperative decline was seen in 1 of the surgery cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection of the cavernoma with severe symptoms might be recommended in elderly patients, especially in those with multiple rebleeding events. From the viewpoint of surgery, we consider the subacute phase the optimal time to remove cavernomas in elderly hemorrhagic patients. However, multiple rebleeding events might exacerbate the neurologic deficit. Therefore, the subacute phase from the first or second rebleeding might be the best time for the surgical resection. At surgical intervention, preservation of the surrounding brain should be prioritized over complete removal of the cavernoma and hematoma.

TI Angiographic "Blush" After Stereotactic Radiosurgery Ablation of
   Residual Arteriovenous Malformation in Pediatric Patient: Case Report
   and Review of Literature

   COMPLICATION; MANAGEMENT
AB INTRODUCTION: While surgical resection remains a primary treatment for accessible arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become thoroughly integrated into the AVM armamentarium; however, delayed sequelae of this treatment have become evident with increased long-term follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the second case of an aberrant local arterial angiographic blush without early venous drainage or an associated lesion following AVM SRS.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old female presented with a ruptured 4-cm right medial frontal periventricular Spetzler-Martin grade 3 AVM with isolated intraventricular hemorrhage. She underwent subtotal resection followed by SRS. Six years later, diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a prominent arterial-phase filling microvasculature without early venous drainage in the region of the irradiated residual AVM nidus.
   CONCLUSION: Although there is a paucity of information on angiographic blush following AVM SRS, consensus in the literature suggests that without early venous drainage, these lesions appear to pose an insignificant threat to the patient. These angiographic findings may be on a spectrum of delayed cerebrovascular radiation changes, and thus indefinite follow-up may be considered, especially in pediatric patients.

ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID FISTULAS; LYMPH-NODE METASTASES; MULTIFORME;
   EXTENSION; SPREAD; BONE
AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme, is the most common primary malignant cerebral tumor in adults. Although glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most aggressive tumors in the brain, propagation through the dura mater is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old man presented with progressive headache and aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging identified an abnormal mass extending transcranially through the widened foramen rotundum into the infratemporal fossa and cavernous sinus. Emergency surgery was performed because of the patient's disturbed consciousness and uncal herniation. The pathologic diagnosis was glioblastoma with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) wild type arising in the left temporal region of the brain, penetrating the dura mater and propagating to the middle fossa with enlargement of the foramen rotundum. The tumor was resected, and radiochemotherapy with temozolomide was administered.
   CONCLUSION: Although the mechanism of tumor spread is unknown, we hypothesized that originally there may have been spontaneous dural defects or thinning, such as a meningoencephalocele in the middle fossa, and the tumor coincidentally occurred there.

ID ENDONASAL TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; ANIMAL-MODELS; DEFICITS
AB BACKGROUND: Neuroscience research uses neurosurgery in animal models for several experimental techniques. To our knowledge, there is no published method for small animal neurosurgery training. Based on the similar thickness of chicken eggshells and mouse, rat, and some small primate skulls, here we propose an egg model training protocol for stereotaxic surgery.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: To perform training it was used a boiled egg and the same materials needed to perform stereotaxic neurosurgery in small animals.
   DISCUSSION: This protocol allows trainees in neuroscience research to become familiar with the microsurgery setting and learn neurosurgery techniques, such as craniotomy drilling, dura mater removal, and electrode implantation.
   CONCLUSION: Egg model suitably mimics animal neurosurgery for the replacement and sparing of animals intended for training in neurosurgical skills.

LA English
DT Article
DE Cavernoma; Cavernous malformation
AB BACKGROUND: Cystic cerebral cavernomas belong to a rare subset of cavernous malformations in the brain. At present, there is limited information with regard to the demographics and etiology of this condition.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present a case of a previously well 13-year-old male who presented with symptoms secondary to a cystic lesion of the fourth ventricle compressing on his brainstem. He underwent stereotactic aspiration of the cystic lesion and insertion of an Ommaya reservoir in the same setting. Postoperatively, his symptoms improved. The cyst fluid did not yield any positive cytology or culture results. A repeat MRI brain did not demonstrate evidence of any underlying lesion. However, the patient was readmitted for hemorrhage into the region of his previous fourth ventricular lesion. Surgical evacuation of the haematoma was performed and intraoperative tissue was sent for pathological interrogation. The final histology reported a cavernoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is an unusual presentation of an intracranial vascular anomaly in a pediatric patient. Key features of the case include the diagnostic dilemma and management challenges faced from a neurosurgical perspective.

ID DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY; DEVICE
AB BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a valuable therapeutic option for many types of drug-resistant epilepsy. Muscle hooks and carotid endarterectomy rings have been used for cervical delamination preceding the implantation of stimulation electrodes. The attachment on both sides of a rubber band of Kamiyama-style hanging needles, as are used for scalp and dural retraction during craniotomy, yields a useful tool for VNS implantation. Here we report our experience with this method.
   METHODS: We present our method using a rubber band plus hooks and a review of 21 consecutive patients who underwent VNS implantation using our rubber band - plus-hooks method.
   RESULTS: None of the 21 patients experienced intra-operative or perioperative complications. Hooks placed in connective tissue around the common carotid artery and jugular vein raised the vagus nerve by elevating the carotid sheath. A single surgeon was able to perform all cervical manipulations under a surgical microscope. The average operation time in this series of 21 patients was 137 minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of hooks attached to both sides of a rubber band rendered VNS implantation safer by lifting the vagus nerve and standardizing the procedure.

DE Arteriovenous malformation; Dysphagia; Hiccups; Spine
ID SPINAL VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Conus medullaris arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare spinal vascular malformations presenting most frequently with features of myelopathy (Foix-Alajounine syndrome), radiculopathy, bowel/bladder dysfunction, or acute spinal hemorrhage (Coup de poignard of Michon) causing profound neurological deficit. Here we present the case of a young patient with progressive dysphagia and intractable hiccups as a rare first presentation symptom of later verified conus medullaris AVM.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old male patient presented with acute onset of dysphagia and persistent hiccups. His magnetic resonance imaging of the spine demonstrated a lesion at the T11 and T12 levels with an associated holocord syrinx and syringobulbia to the level of the medulla. The patient underwent a decompressive suboccipital craniectomy and C1 (atlas) laminectomy with wide myelotomy of the medulla followed by T11 and T12 laminectomy and AVM reduction. Two days after partial AVM occlusion the patient developed transient worsening of his symptoms. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging showed recurrence of dilatation of the central canal. A syringo-subarachnoid shunt was sited at the level of the previous myelotomy of the medulla, after which his neurological symptoms resolved completely.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report in the English literature to date of a conus AVM presenting with intractable hiccups. These are extremely rare sporadic vascular malformations, and although their natural history is poorly understood, symptomatic patients generally deteriorate, culminating in severe disability. Management requires a multimodality approach including combined endovascular and microsurgical treatment. The patient in our case made a full recovery confirmed at 2-year follow-up.

ID GADOLINIUM; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-based contrast agents are relatively safe for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of nervous system pathology. Few reports have been reported regarding the severe adverse effects. These are mostly mild anaphylactoid reactions, especially in the vulnerable group.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of an adverse effect of gadoteric acid concerning the misuse as intraventricular administration. To our knowledge, this is the first report related to intraventricular spillage and its results. A 38-year-old male patient with a complaint of headache and drowsiness was admitted to the hospital, after which cranial MRI revealed that he had a posterior fossa mass. An operation was performed with the catheterization of the lateral ventricule as a safety device at the beginning, and later mass was evacuated gross totally. Frozen pathology result showed the tumor was medulloblastoma. On the first postoperative day a control contrasted cranial and total spinal MRI was planned. He was observed to have a tonic-clonic generalized seizure soon after returning to the ward. After giving the acute management with antiepileptics, the patient was stabilized and it was recognized that the patient was administered contrast media by the intraventricular route. Symptomatic treatment and cerebrospinal fluid irrigation by external ventricular drainage helped the patient's improvement. After a week his symptoms were relieved and he had no complications during outpatient controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to formal basic supportive treatment, cerebrospinal fluid irrigation of the toxic contrast material is the best management method in case of such an unexpected misadministration of gadoteric acid.

AB INTRODUCTION: Dr. Collin S. MacCarty (1915-2003) invented the MacCarty keyhole, which is now widely used as the starting burr hole for orbitozygomatic craniotomy. We present a historical vignette on MacCarty's life and chronicle his contributions to neurosurgery.
   METHODS: A detailed search for articles relating to the biography and professional career of Dr. MacCarty was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar by using the key words "Collin MacCarty" and "MacCarty keyhole." References found in those articles were also reviewed.
   RESULTS: On September 20, 1915, Collin MacCarty was born in Rochester, Minnesota. MacCarty was exposed to the medical field at an early age. He witnessed legendary surgeons like Alfred Adson perform brain and spine operations. Expectedly, MacCarty pursued a career in neurosurgery. He was influenced by Walter Dandy as a house office at Johns Hopkins and completed his neurosurgical training at the Mayo Clinic under Adson. In a distinguished career in neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic, MacCarty served many important roles, including Chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery from 1963 to 1975 and President of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. He was world-renowned for his vast experience with meningiomas. In 1961, MacCarty described a burr hole to expose the periorbita and frontal dura while approaching intraorbital meningiomas. This burr hole became immortalized as the "MacCarty keyhole" and is used widely today in frontotemporal orbitozygomatic approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collin S. MacCarty was an influential neurosurgeon. Among a multitude of contributions, he is most well-known for inventing the " MacCarty keyhole" which is widely implemented nowadays as the starting point for orbitozygomatic approaches.

TI Choroid Plexus in the Central Canal of the Spinal Cord Causing Recurrent
   Syringomyelia

ID NEURAL STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS; CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; EPENDYMAL CELLS;
   ARACHNOID CYST; DIFFERENTIATION; INJURY; BRAIN; RAT
AB BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia is a fluid-filled cavitation within the substance of the spinal cord. This condition usually follows a primary pathology that disrupts the normal cerebrospinal fluid circulation or disturbs the microcirculation and cytoarchitecture of the spinal cord parenchyma. However, an etiology of recurrent syringomyelia resulting from an ectopic choroid plexus (CP) has not been discussed. Ectopic CP rests may be found within the central nervous system. Although there has been a single report, describing ectopic intramedullary spinal cord CP, to our knowledge, extra-cranial nonmalignant CP in the central canal of the spinal cord has not been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report CP in the central canal of the spinal cord in a 23-year-old male patient who had developmental delay and diabetes mellitus type I who presented with dissociated sensory changes and muscle wastage predominantly on the right upper and lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a multiloculated spinal cord syringomyelia stretching from cervical (C3) to the conus medullaris causing recurrent neurologic deficits. A biopsy of the central canal spinal cord lesion revealed CP. Decompression and syringosubarachnoid shunt insertion stabilized the patient's neurology.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our illustrative case reveals the presence of CP in the central canal of the spinal cord that may suggest a role in the etiology of recurrent syringomyelia. Although management poses a challenge to neurosurgeons, prompt decompression and shunting of the syringomyelia remains a favorable approach with acceptable outcomes. Further investigation into the pathophysiology of central canal CP ectopic causing recurrent syringomyelia and its correlation with spinal cord development may help future treatments.

AB INTRODUCTION: Brain is suspended in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space by subarachnoid trabeculae (SAT), which are collagen-reinforced columns stretching between the arachnoid and pia maters. Much neuroanatomic research has been focused on the subarachnoid cisterns and arachnoid matter but reported data on the SAT are limited. This study provides a comprehensive review of subarachnoid trabeculae, including their embryology, histology, morphologic variations, and surgical significance.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted with no date restrictions in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Wiley Online Library, Cochrane, and Research Gate. Terms for the search included but were not limited to subarachnoid trabeculae, subarachnoid trabecular membrane, arachnoid mater, subarachnoid trabeculae embryology, subarachnoid trabeculae histology, and morphology. Articles with a high likelihood of bias, any study published in nonpopular journals (not indexed in PubMed or MEDLINE), and studies with conflicting data were excluded.
   RESULTS: A total of 1113 articles were retrieved. Of these, 110 articles including 19 book chapters, 58 original articles, 31 review articles, and 2 case reports met our inclusion criteria.
   CONCLUSIONS: SAT provide mechanical support to neurovascular structures through cell-to-cell interconnections and specific junctions between the pia and arachnoid maters. They vary widely in appearance and configuration among different parts of the brain. The complex network of SAT is inhomogeneous and mainly located in the vicinity of blood vessels. Microsurgical procedures should be performed with great care, and sharp rather than blunt trabecular dissection is recommended because of the close relationship to neurovascular structures. The significance of SAT for cerebrospinal fluid flow and hydrocephalus is to be determined.

   PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are often treated with medications or a surgical procedure. However, there is little evidence that such treatments result in 50% pain reduction and improvement in quality of life. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of treatments in patients with MS and trigeminal neuralgia.
   METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration database from inception until October 2016. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusions, data extraction, and bias assessment.
   RESULTS: All studies were of low quality using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. For medical management, 10 studies were included, of which one was a randomized controlled trial. Two studies were on the use of misopropol, unique to patients with MS. For surgical therapy, 26 studies with at least 10 patients and a minimum of 2 years follow-up were included. All types of surgical procedures are reported and the results are poorer for TN with MS, with 50% having a recurrence by 2 years. The main complication was sensory loss. Many patients had to undergo further procedures to become pain free and there were no agreed prognostic factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence to support any 1 medical therapy and so earlier surgery may be preferable. A patient with TN and MS has therefore to make a decision based on low-level evidence, beginning with standard drug therapy and then choosing a surgical procedure.

DT Article
DE Adolescent; Footdrop; Intraneural ganglion; Knee pain; Peroneal nerve;

ID NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts (IGCs) are nonneoplastic lesions. They are responsible for a small number of footdrop cases, which occur after additional nerve damage. The earliest patient symptom related to IGCs is knee pain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 17-year-old boy developed pain in the left knee, which progressively worsened over 14 months. He did not seek any medical assistance during this time. The patient subsequently was involved in a bicycle accident, and 3 months later he was unable to raise his left foot and was referred to our clinic for footdrop. Surgery was performed, but the weakness persisted. We could not detect any functional reinnervation on electromyography 12 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors in determining the prognosis of IGCs are the extent of the nerve trauma and the early diagnosis and treatment of the IGC. Detection of almost complete functional denervation on electromyography may indicate that it is too late for surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: In our study, we comprehensively detail the technique of the low retrosigmoid approach to the lateral medullary area, including the inferior cerebellar peduncle, postolivary sulcus, pontomedullary sulcus, and inferior olivary nucleus, as well as the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle.
   METHODS: Four formalin-fixed, silicone-injected, cadaveric human heads were examined under the operating microscope to demonstrate pertinent descriptive anatomy using the low retrosigmoid approach in a stepwise manner. Clinical parameters of a patient with a lateral medullary lesion were reviewed retrospectively to describe preoperative and postoperative examination and surgical details of the approach to the lateral medulla.
   RESULTS: The clinical case report describes a low retrosigmoid craniotomy performed to access the exiting points of cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus), foramen of Luschka, inferior cerebellar peduncle (lateral medullary zone), postolivary sulcus, and olivary nucleus. The lesion was exposed using the inferior cerebellar peduncle and removed using standard microsurgical technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: The lower retrosigmoid infratonsillar approach provides excellent exposure to medullary safe entry zones, including the transolivary, postolivary sulcus, pontomedullary sulcus, and lateral medullary (inferior cerebellar peduncle) zones, for removal of lesions in this area.

ID ETONOGESTREL IMPLANT; REMOVAL; INSERTION; LOCALIZATION; MIGRATION; SITE;

AB BACKGROUND: Despite demonstrable safety and efficacy of subdermal contraceptive implants (SCIs), both insertion and removal of SCIs in the arm have been associated with neurovascular complications. The aim of this study was to investigate type and prognosis of nerve injuries associated with SCIs.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of 4 electronic databases for studies pertaining to patients with nerve injury and concurrent SCI. Studies published between January 1987 and June 2017 were included. Implant location, damaged nerves, clinical presentation, preoperative imaging (x-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging), neurologic evaluation (nerve conduction studies, electromyography), and treatment methods were reviewed. To outline management strategies, 2 illustrative cases of major nerve injury caused by SCI removal were presented.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 10 studies including 12 patients. Fourteen nerve injuries in 12 patients were reported during SCI insertion (n = 1) and removal (n = 11). Medial antebrachial cutaneous (n = 5) and median (n = 5) nerves were primarily affected. Neuropathic pain was the main symptom. Primary reasons for nerve injury were pulling or grasping of the nerve (n = 9) after mistaking it for the implant. Neurapraxia (n = 7) was the most common lesion and was treated with implant removal and clinical surveillance (n = 6). Five patients completely recovered; the remaining patients continued to have motor and/or sensory deficit at mean follow-up of 0.7 year (range, 0-2 years).
   CONCLUSIONS: Nerve injuries related to SCIs are rare but potentially serious. For nonpalpable SCIs, a multidisciplinary approach, including practitioners with experience treating peripheral nerve injuries, is invaluable.

AB BACKGROUND: Several strategies have been proposed for developing and spreading surgical specialties in Sub-Saharan East Africa. Regarding neurosurgery, improvements are coming from the cooperation between Western and African institutes by means of the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons and independent organizations but, far from big cities and more equipped hospitals, shortcomings in the delivery of services persist.
   METHODS: Through the application of 1 formally trained neurosurgeon volunteer, the Foundation for International Education in Neurological Surgery and Neurocirugia, Educacion y Desarrollo coordinated a 2-month neurosurgical project at Mathari Consolata Hospital in Nyeri (Kenya), designed to analyze critical points and to find suggestions for initiating and developing a neurosurgical service, providing in the meantime clinical and surgical care for patients.
   RESULTS: During the mission, general and local issues limiting the neurosurgical activities at the hospital were studied. They were discussed with the hospital board and the project supervisors, thereby ensuring short-term and medium-term solutions and possible future cooperation with the hospital. The volunteer also carried out clinics and surgery for neuro cases and neurosurgical training for nurses and doctors.
   CONCLUSIONS: The model proposed should be considered a preliminary and immersive survey to evaluate the eligibility of a decentralized East African hospital to interface with neurosurgical activities, through the support of experienced local institutes and Western organizations. Host hospitals would also have the chance to enhance clinical services currently lacking and to train its personnel at low cost. The program may represent a rewarding personal and professional opportunity for young trained neurosurgeons, which also addresses the contemporary shortage of local specialists.

AB BACKGROUND: Shunt nephritis is a rare, reversible immune-complex mediated complication of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection that can progress to end-stage renal disease and even death if diagnosis is delayed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The present case report details the manifestation and clinical course of shunt nephritis in a 50-year-old patient who presented with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome 30 years after ventriculojugular shunt placement. Diagnosis was delayed due to initial negative CSF and blood cultures, but a later CSF culture was positive for Propionibacterium acnes. After treatment with intravenous antibiotics and complete removal of shunt with subsequent replacement with a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the nephritic symptoms resolved, but the patient continued to have reduced kidney function consistent with stage IIIa chronic kidney disease.
   CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the clinical importance of having a high index of suspicion in patients with a ventricular shunt who present with symptoms consistent with nephritis, even in the setting of negative cultures and delayed presentation.

ID OPHTHALMIC ARTERY ANEURYSM; ANTERIOR CEREBRAL-ARTERY; UNRUPTURED
   INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; FEATURES; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysms are the leading cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and are most commonly associated with the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and anterior communicating artery complex. We describe the presentation and management of a 27-year-old man with concurrent bilateral A1-2 junction aneurysms and fusiform intraorbital ophthalmic artery (OA) aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man with no past medical history presented with 3 months of headaches. Imaging showed a large dysplastic left A1-2 junction aneurysm and a smaller saccular right A1-2 junction aneurysm, with potentially adherent domes. Two fusiform aneurysms of the intraorbital segment of the left OA were also identified. The patient underwent coil-assisted pipeline embolization of the left A1-A2 aneurysm, with complete obliteration and reconstitution of the normal parent vessel. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right A1-2 aneurysm 3 weeks later, which was found to have grown significantly at the time of treatment. Three-month follow-up showed spontaneous resolution of the OA aneurysms, persistent obliteration of the left aneurysm, and significant recurrence of the right aneurysm, which was treated with stent-assisted coil embolization. A second recurrence 3 months later was successfully treated with repeat coiling. At the time of this treatment, the patient was also found to have 2 de novo distal middle cerebral artery and ACA dysplastic aneurysms, which were not treated. Follow-up angiography 6 weeks later showed stable complete obliteration of the right A1-2 aneurysm and interval complete resolution of the dysplastic middle cerebral artery aneurysm. The distal ACA aneurysm was observed to have minimally increased in size; however, the parent vessel showed signs of interval partial thrombosis with contrast stasis within the aneurysm. This final aneurysm is being followed with serial imaging. The patient remains neurologically intact with complete resolution of his headaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report the case of a young man with no past medical history who presented with multiple dysplastic aneurysms. Successful staged endovascular intervention resulted in obliteration of aneurysms with spontaneous obliteration of the intraorbital OA aneurysms observed at 3 months. We present this case to review the multiple challenges of managing complex ACA aneurysms and to highlight the usefulness of endovascular intervention in their treatment.

ID PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; LAMINAR SCREW; SPINE; PALSY; INSTRUMENTATION; C7
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical laminectomy has 2 major disadvantages: postlaminectomy adhesion of dural membrane and lack of a fusion bed. The objective of this study was to determine whether simultaneous cervical laminoplasty with fusion (CLPF) might overcome these unwanted outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent CLPF for treating cervical myelopathy with instability who were followed up for at least 12 months were enrolled. Preoperative and postoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores before and after surgery, recovery rates (RRs), C2-C7 lordosis, and fusion success rates were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 50 patients (35 males and 15 females; mean age, 60.5 +/- 14.0 years) who underwent CLPF. The average duration of clinical follow-up was 24.6 +/- 16.1 months. Mean preoperative and postoperative NDI scores were 27.0 +/- 10.6 and 17.6 +/- 7.2, respectively (P = 0.004). Mean preoperative and postoperative JOA scores were 10.4 = 4.2 and 13.6 = 3.0, respectively (P = 0.001). The mean JOA RR was 49.8 +/- 42.2%. No significant changes in C2-7 lordosis were noted after surgery (preoperative, 7.0 +/- 8.0 degrees; postoperative, 7.3 +/- 6.3 degrees; P = 0.789). The fusion success rate was 96% (48 of 50 patients). Fusion mass areas at C5 level were significantly different between the opening side and the hinge side opening side, 15.8 +/- 13.1 mm(2); hinge side, 50.8 +/- 27.2 mm(2); P < 0.001). There was no postoperative restenosis or epidural fibrosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: CLPF might be useful for canal decompression and a good fusion bed while avoiding postoperative epidural fibrosis.

   SURGICAL-TREATMENT; OCCLUSION; STROKE; ANGIOGRAPHY; DECOMPRESSION;
   SPONDYLOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Bow hunter's syndrome (BHS) is rare and typically induced by mechanical compression of the dominant vertebral artery (VA) during head rotation. We report a case of BHS induced by nondominant VA compression in which contralateral VA patency was preserved. Definite diagnosis of BHS is not often feasible because of transient symptoms and nonspecific clinical features, such as vertigo or dizziness, especially in nondominant VA compression. We discuss the diagnostic clues of BHS and clinical features of BHS caused by nondominant VA compression through a literature review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old man suffered repeated bouts of dizziness whenever his head was rotated to the left. This dizziness was consistently accompanied by downbeat nystagmus (DBN). Radiography revealed left VA compression by a lateral osteophyte at the C3-C4 level only during left head rotation. In contrast, patency of the right VA, which was almost equivalent in size to the left VA, was preserved during head rotation. The distinctive clinical finding of head rotation-induced DBN, which is usually associated with lesions involving the caudal midline cerebellum, was observed. Symptoms disappeared immediately after left VA decompression with osteophytectomy and C3-C4 fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite excellent flow through the contralateral VA, occlusion of the nondominant VA occasionally induces BHS. According to a review of the literature, BHS cases do not always depend on the VA on one side for blood supply. Head rotation-induced DBN can be useful for diagnosis of BHS, even in cases of nondominant VA compression.

   METASTASES; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Thymic carcinoid with spinal metastasis is an extremely rare entity. Clinically, the tumor presents either by its endocrine manifestations or by mechanical compression of surrounding structures. However, no previously published case studies have reported neck pain and neurologic deficit in the initial presentation of an atypical thymic carcinoid.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man, a nonsmoker, presented with a 12-month history of intermittent neck pain and a 1-month history of progressive numbness and weakness of the right upper limb. Cervical MRI showed multiple abnormal signals and C2 soft-tissue mass intruding into the vertebral canal. Cervical CT scan showed multiple bone lesions. The diagnosis of thymic carcinoid was obtained by preoperative lymph node biopsy. The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and occipitocervical fixation. Significant alleviation of pain and neurologic improvement were achieved. The postoperative pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of thymic carcinoid.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neck pain and neurologic deficit could be the first presentation of thymic carcinoid with spinal metastasis. Palliative surgery is an effective method to improve quality of life in patients with thymic carcinoid with spinal metastasis.

AB BACKGROUND: Isolated intraspinal neurosarcoidosis is a rare clinical entity, with most reports describing intramedullary involvement in adults.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We detail the case of a 9-year-old girl with rapid-onset compressive myelopathy secondary to a thoracic epidural lesion. Although pathologic diagnosis was challenging, a presumptive diagnosis of isolated extradural neurosarcoidosis was made in light of the patient's investigations and dramatic response to corticosteroids.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although less likely than neoplasia, rheumatologic processes such as inflammatory granulomatous disease warrant consideration in similar cases.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we describe an extremely rare case of frontoethmoidal schwannoma extending through the olfactory groove with exertional CSF rhinorrhea as the initial symptom. A 50-year-old woman was presented to our clinic for frequent nasal discharge on exertion. A postcontrast computed tomographic scan demonstrated heterogeneously enhanced tumor from the anterior cranial fossa to the anterior ethmoid sinus. A gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance image revealed a well-defined heterogeneously enhanced tumor situated in the midline anterior cranial fossa and anterior ethmoid sinus. After the resection, the defect of the right anterior skull base was reconstructed with a fascia graft and adipose tissue taken from the abdomen, as well as a pedicle periosteum flap. A histologic examination revealed the tumor as schwannoma. Her rhinorrhea completely resolved. She regained her sense of smell and taste 1 month after the operation.
   CONCLUSION: According to previous reports, olfactory groove, and paraolfactory groove/periolfactory groove schwannomas can be divided into 4 types: subfrontal, nasoethmoidal, frontoethmoidal, and ethmofrontal. Among them, a frontoethmoidal schwannoma can manifest exertional CSF rhinorrhea as an initial symptom.

AB BACKGROUND: Although attributing the origin of schwannomas from the olfactory nerve is nearly impossible, if they do not have Schwann cells, intracranial supratentorial schwannomas are mainly located in the anterior skull base.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 46-year-old female who presented with right tinnitus, dizziness, and bifrontal headache, progressive, starting 2 years before. Imaging studies revealed an incidentally neoplastic, extraaxial, homogeneously appearing tumor on the right anterior skull base. The patient underwent surgical treatment with total resection of the tumor by a bicoronal approach. The histopathologic study reported schwannoma.
   CONCLUSION: We describe this case in detail and discuss the likely origin of this tumor, with a concomitant literature review.

AB BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of the posterior arch of vertebrae are rare conditions that may incidentally be found on neck radiographs. We report a case and present a comprehensive review of the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old boy presented with intermittent paresthesia in the lower extremities, mild neck pain, and episodes of drop attacks following neck flexion. Radiologic investigations depicted a complete absence of the posterior element of C1, C2, and C3 along with bilateral absence of C4 pedicles.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of posterior arch abnormalities is of high-level of importance because of resultant neurologic defects. To the best of our knowledge, no case of this type has been reported in literature thus far.

ID THORACOLUMBAR KYPHOSIS; SUTCLIFFE TYPE
AB BACKGROUND: Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD) is a rare disease characterized by vertebral and metaphyseal abnormalities. The treatment of SMD spinal deformities remains a challenge for spinal surgeons. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of vertebral column resection of SMD by thoracolumbar kyphosis and scoliosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old man with SMD was referred to us with multivertebral anomalies and scoliosis, and a rigid curved thoracolumbar kyphosis in T11-12. The patient had fixed thoracolumbar kyphosis and scoliosis with neurologic symptoms. The morphology of vertebra was measured and calculated based on radiologic data. A 3-dimensional printing was made to help the spinal orthopedics. The anterior fusion was made with cages reconstruction and posterolateral fusion with screw fixation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The spinal axes were corrected with obvious and satisfying realignment effects. The neurologic symptoms disappeared after surgery. The 1-year follow-up period was uneventful. Surgical treatment for SMD multiaxial spine malformation is feasible. Posterior column resection with segmental pedicle screw fixation and complementary fusion provides obvious curative effects for adult patients with neurologic complications.

ID UNILATERAL LAMINOTOMY; SURGERY; FUSION; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify whether multiple compressions of nerve roots resulted in poorer surgical outcome when patients were treated with single-level decompressive laminectomy or multilevel decompressive laminectomy. To reach this we compared preoperative and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, and walking duration of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patients treated with single-level and multilevel decompressive laminectomy.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 112 consecutive patients undergoing lumbar decompressive surgery without arthrodesis for LSS between March 2010 and September 2013. Forty-eight patients were treated with single-level laminectomy and 64 patients were treated with multilevel laminectomy. ODI scores, VAS scores, and walking duration were measured for all patients preoperatively and 30 months after decompressive surgery.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 64.41 +/- 13.4 years. The ODI scores, VAS scores, and walking duration difference between patients treated with single-level laminectomy and multilevel laminectomy were statistically significant and higher for the first group (P < 0.05). There were more operative complications in patients treated with multilevel decompressive laminectomy; however, there was no statistically significant difference between single-level and multilevel decompressed patients regarding complications (P = 0.119). Four of the patients treated with multilevel decompressive laminectomy experienced postoperative spondylolisthesis needing posterior instrumented fusion.
   CONCLUSION: Recovery in terms of ODI scores, VAS scores, and walking duration was better in LSS patients undergoing single-level laminectomy than in those undergoing multilevel laminectomy. Also, the rates of operative complications and postoperative follow-up spondylolisthesis were higher in patients treated with multilevel laminectomy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Interdisciplinary management of elderly patients requiring spine surgery has been shown to improve short- and long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether an interdisciplinary team approach mitigates use of intensive care unit (ICU) resources.
   METHODS: A unique comanagement model for elderly patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery was implemented at a major academic medical center. The Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health Program (POSH) was launched with the aim of improving outcomes in elderly patients (>65 years old) undergoing complex lumbar spine surgery. In this model, a geriatrician evaluates elderly patients preoperatively, comanages daily throughout hospital course, and coordinates multidisciplinary rehabilitation, along with the neurosurgical team. We retrospectively reviewed the first 100 cases after the initiation of the POSH protocol and compared them with the immediately preceding 25 cases to assess the rates of ICU transfer and independent predictors of ICU admission.
   RESULTS: A total of 125 patients undergoing lumbar decompression and fusion surgery were enrolled in this pilot program. Baseline characteristics and intraoperative variables, as well as number of fusion levels and duration of surgery, were similar between both cohorts. There was a significant difference in the use of ICU services (ICU admission rates) between both cohorts, with the non-POSH cohort having a 3-fold increase compared with the POSH cohort (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, lack of an interdisciplinary comanagement team approach was an independent predictor for ICU transfers in elderly patients undergoing corrective surgery (odds ratio 8.51, 95% confidence interval 2.972-24.37, P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that an interdisciplinary comanagement model between geriatrics and neurosurgery is independently associated with reduced use of critical care services.

AB BACKGROUND: Few studies have demonstrated detailed physical risk factors of hemorrhagic complications (HCs) associated with the Angio-Seal closure device. This retrospective study aimed to identify the risk factors of HC due to Angio-Seal use.
   METHODS: Data from 143 cases that underwent neurointerventional procedures that involved puncturing the femoral artery and that used an Angio-Seal to close the puncture site were reviewed. We divided these cases into HC and no HC groups and retrospectively compared age, sex, past medical and preference history, body mass index (BMI), femoral artery depth, dual antiplatelet therapy use, activated clotting time, general anesthesia use, sheath size, right femoral artery puncture, and treatment time.
   RESULTS: HC occurred in 7 cases, 2 of which were excluded because of technical failure. Accordingly, we examined physical risk factors in 5 cases (3.5%) in the HC group and in 136 cases (96.5%) in the no HC group. A low BMI and shallow femoral artery depth were significantly associated with HC, whereas the other factors were not. A receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a BMI cut-off value of 20.98 and a femoral artery depth of 11.1 mm could achieve optimal diagnostic efficiency for predicting HC.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a BMI <21 may require careful hemostasis monitoring, and it is better not to undergo arterial puncture site closure using Angio-Seal for those with a femoral artery depth <11.1 mm.

AB BACKGROUND: Acoustic neuroma is the most common extra-axial primary cerebellopontine angle tumor in adults. A plethora of studies have been published on acoustic neuroma, but none of the previous works have highlighted the most influential articles. Our objective was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles on acoustic neuroma.
   METHODS: We performed a title-specific search on the Scopus database using the following search terms: "acoustic neuroma," "vestibular schwannoma," and "cerebellopontine angle." We recorded the 50 most-cited articles and reviewed them.
   RESULTS: The 50 most-cited articles had an average of 175 citations per article. All articles were published between 1980 and 2006, with 1997 the most prolific year, when 7 articles were published. The journals Neurosurgery and Laryngoscope published 10 and 8 of these articles, respectively. The most common study categories were nonsurgical management (17/50) and surgical management (13/50). Studies were predominantly published by otolaryngologists (22/50) and neurosurgeons (14/50). Douglas Kondziolka was the author with the highest number of contributions, with 7 publications. The majority of the articles were produced in the United States (64%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Identifying articles on acoustic neuroma with the most impact provides an important overview of the historical development of treatment methods and publication trends related to this condition. A finalized, comprehensive list of the most important works represents an excellent tool that can serve as a guide for evidence-based clinical practice.

TI The Utility of Early Postoperative Head Computed Tomography in Brain
   Tumor Surgery: A Retrospective Analysis of 755 Cases

DT Article

AB OBJECTIVE: Scheduled early postoperative computed tomography (EPOCT) after craniotomy for brain tumor resection is standard at many institutions. We analyzed utility of preplanned EPOCT after elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 755 brain tumor resections for which EPOCT was performed within 4 hours of surgery. Postoperative clinical neurologic examination results were classified into expected (baseline or predicted postoperative examination), changed (from baseline examination), and unreliable (sedated or baseline comatose patient). Scans were analyzed for unexpected and/or worrisome findings (e.g., hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke). In cases of unexpected findings, management changes were correlated to patient's neurologic examination. Demographic information, tumor histology, and tumor location were analyzed to determine risk factors for unexpected findings.
   RESULTS: Rate of unexpected EPOCT findings was 4.1%. Patients with expected postoperative examinations were at significantly lower risk of abnormal findings (odds ratio [OR] = 0.074, P < 0.001). Patients with intraventricular tumors (OR = 5.7, P = 0.001) were at higher risk compared with patients with metastatic tumors (OR = 0.24, P = 0.06). No unexpected EPOCT findings led to management changes in patients with expected postoperative neurologic examinations. All unexpected EPOCT findings in patients with changed postoperative neurologic examinations led to management changes. Patients with nonreliable neurologic examinations were at significantly higher risk for unexpected findings on EPOCT (OR = 6.33, P < 0.001) and subsequent management changes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Routine EPOCT is not indicated for patients undergoing brain tumor resection if postoperative neurologic examination is unchanged, as imaging is unlikely to result in management changes. EPOCT should be obtained in all patients with worrisome changes in examination or nonreliable examinations, as both groups have high rates of unexpected findings on imaging that lead to management changes.

ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Rathke cleft cysts (RCC) are benign lesions of the sella that often present with headache. It is not currently well established whether surgical resection of RCC results in resolution of headache. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of RCC resection on headache resolution.
   METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through June 2017 for articles that evaluated the effect of RCC resection on headache resolution. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using fixedeffects and random-effects models.
   RESULTS: Ten case series with 276 patients were included. Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) was used to resect RCC in all of the studies. Only 1 patient in 1 study underwent transcranial surgery. Using the fixed effect model, the overall headache resolution prevalence was 71.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.3%, 77.3%) among patients who underwent resection of RCC (I-2 = 76.9%; P-heterogeneity < 0.01). Subgroup analysis based on center (P-interaction < 0.01) and continent (P < 0.01) showed a higher resolution in studies conducted in a single center (79.8%; 95% CI 73.7%, 84.8%) than in multiple centers (40.0%; 95% CI 26.9%, 54.8%) and a higher resolution in studies conducted in Asia (85.0%) than in Europe (61.5%) or North America (65.7%). Metaregression analysis was significant on mean follow-up time (slope = 0.03; P = 0.02), percentage of women (slope -0.05; P < 0.01), journal impact factor (slope 0.73; P < 0.01), and study quality (slope -0.99; P < 0.01) but not on mean age (P = 0.10). None of the above-mentioned results were significant when the random effects model was used. No evidence of publication bias was observed.
   CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the resection of RCC in patients presenting with headache is associated with headache resolution.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether there is a difference in the difficulty of extirpation after use of Embosphere versus n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for the embolization of meningiomas.
   METHODS: Study subjects were 20 patients with meningioma who underwent embolization using either NBCA or Embosphere from April 2012 to December 2016. The difficulty of extirpation was compared and assessed in terms of objective indices, such as operative duration, perioperative bleeding, and Simpson grade, and in terms of subjective indices such as "impression on operative field" and "hardness of tumors" that the surgeon assessed using 3-point scales (dry, moderate, bloody, and soft, moderate, hard, respectively). Pathologic findings, including ischemia, necrosis, and inflammatory changes, were assessed.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding the mean values of operative duration (P = 0.27), perioperative bleeding (P = 0.23), and Simpson grade (P = 0.39). On the other hand, there was a significant difference with respect to the "impression on operative field" and "hardness of tumors," with reports of dry (54%; P = 0.034) and soft (81%; P = 0.0001), respectively, in the Embosphere group exceeding those of the NBCA group. The pathologic findings showed that although ischemic change (P = 0.43) and necrosis (P = 0.79) were observed in both groups, perivascular inflammation was observed only in the NBCA group (P = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: No relative merits were found regarding objective indices, whereas the Embosphere group had superior "ease of extirpation" as reported by the surgeon.

AB OBJECTIVE: Platelet transfusions for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) on antiplatelet therapy (APT) remain controversial. Diverging past research and differences in platelet preparation warrant further investigation of this topic. In this study, the association between platelet transfusion and clinical outcomes of ICH is investigated in patients matched by ICH score, a validated predictor of mortality.
   METHODS: A consecutive review of all patients from 2012 to 2015 with nontraumatic ICH was performed. Risk factors including demographics, medical comorbidities, APT use, and ICH score were reviewed. Standardized differences were used to assess baseline characteristics; logistic regression models were performed to determine whether platelet transfusions were associated with adverse outcomes, both before and after matching for ICH score.
   RESULTS: A total of 538 patients with nontraumatic ICH were investigated. Of these, 168 were on APT; 71 were excluded. Thirty-nine patients (40%) received platelet transfusions and 58 (60%) did not. An overall mortality of 9.3% was measured, with 29.9% of patients enduring complications. In the unmatched cohort, patients who received platelet transfusions were more likely to deteriorate (odds ratio [OR], 4.7), undergo surgical intervention during their hospital stay (OR, 7.2), be discharged with a worse modified Rankin Scale score (OR, 3.6), or die (OR, 6.1). After matching by ICH score, platelet transfusion was not a significant predictor for any negative outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of platelet transfusions in patients with ICH based on ICH score. For patients on APT, platelet transfusion is not associated with clinical outcomes in an ICH scoreematched sample.

AB BACKGROUND: Soccer, bicycling, and horseback riding are sports most commonly associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Germany. The latter 2 sports activities are commonly practiced with helmets, and data on helmet use and usefulness vary widely.
   METHODS: On Ethics Committee approval, a retrospective analysis was performed for patients age 5-17 between January 2009 and August 2014 based on a diagnosis of TBI, using the electronic patient file for 2 university hospital locations. Descriptive data analysis and multivariate and univariate logistic regression were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs).
   RESULTS: A total of 380 children were identified, including 162 females (42.6%) and 218 males (57.4%), with a mean age of 11.9 +/- 3.8 years. Activities included bicycling (n = [64), horseback riding (n = 19), and soccer (n = 16). Helmet use was documented in 26 patients (14 cyclists, 12 riders), and nonuse was documented in 20 (all cyclists). Compared with not wearing a helmet, wearing a helmet was associated with a trend toward lower odds of loss of consciousness (OR, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-2.52). A cohort of 251 patients with nonesports-related TBI (NSTBI) served as a control group for further analyses. Compared with the NSTBI group, the odds of amnesia were 2.9 times greater (95% CI, 1.1-21.6) in the patients with a riding-related TBI and 4.8 times greater (95% CI, 0.3-239) in those with a cycling-related TBI, and the odds of epidural hematoma were 2.2 times greater (95% CI, 0.4-12.3) in those with a cycling-related TBI and 4.9 times greater (95% CI, 0.5-50.4) greater in those with a soccer-related TBI.
   CONCLUSIONS: We gained important epidemiologic data on pediatric TBI in our region. Despite the descriptive nature of the data, a trend toward reduced odds of loss of consciousness was seen in the helmet wearers. Nevertheless, serious injury can occur despite helmet use.

AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapeutic modality; however, only a percentage of eligible patients undergo the procedure.
   OBJECTIVES: To study patients' perspectives toward DBS surgery.
   METHODS: A survey was sent to 95 consecutive adult patients who underwent DBS surgery for Parkinson disease, essential tremor, or dystonia; the response rate was 73% (69 patients). Post-hoc analyses were performed to evaluate factors that led to favorable outcomes. The average time between surgical procedure to survey completion was 16 months.
   RESULTS: Awake surgery, use of a rigid head frame, and having hair clipped were seldom reported as major deterrents to surgery. Patients retrospectively reported an average comfort level of 8.3 +/- 1.8 during surgery. The average comfort level with head frame placement was reported as 5.2 +/- 3.15, and patients reporting discomfort with the frame nonetheless reported overall comfort with the procedure (8.7 +/- 1.8). An analysis of satisfaction revealed that 90% of patients would recommend the procedure to a family member or friend and that 78% of patients would undergo the procedure again. A post-hoc analysis of patients who were not satisfied with the procedure revealed that this subset reported significantly less overall comfort (6.9 +/- 1.7, P = 0.0003) and were less likely to report that the goals and expectations of surgery were clearly discussed before surgery (P = 0.0004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Frame placement, awake surgery, and head shaving did not appear to play a significant role in most patients' decision-making process to undergo DBS, as analyzed in this retrospective cohort. The majority of patients were satisfied with the procedure and reported being comfortable. Managing goals and expectations preoperatively played a significant role in ultimate overall satisfaction.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects lower-and middle-income countries (LMIC). The factors influencing outcomes in LMIC have not been examined as rigorously as in higher-income countries.
   METHODS: This study was conducted to examine clinical and demographic factors influencing TBI outcomes in Latin American LMIC. Data were prospectively collected during a randomized trial of intracranial pressure monitoring in severe TBI and a companion observational study. Participants were aged >= 13 years and admitted to study hospitals with Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8. The primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Scale, Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months. Predictors were analyzed using a multivariable proportional odds model created by forward stepwise selection.
   RESULTS: A total of 550 patients were identified. Six-month outcomes were available for 88%, of whom 37% had died and 44% had achieved a GOS-E score of 5-8. In multivariable proportional odds modeling, higher Glasgow Coma Scale motor score (odds ratio [OR], 1.41 per point; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.61) and epidural hematoma (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86) were significant predictors of higher GOS-E score, whereas advanced age (OR, 0.65 per 10 years; 95% CI, 0.57-0.73) and cisternal effacement (P < 0.001) were associated with lower GOS-E score. Study site (P < 0.001) and race (P = 0.004) significantly predicted outcome, outweighing clinical variables such as hypotension and pupillary examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from severe TBI is high in Latin American LMIC, although the rate of favorable recovery is similar to that of high-income countries. Demographic factors such as race and study site played an outsized role in predicting outcome; further research is required to understand these associations.

AB BACKGROUND: A wide spectrum of treatment choices is proposed for poor-prognosis patients with vertebral metastases. The continuous increase of this population and the propagation of less invasive techniques necessitate further study concerning which patients could benefit from palliative surgery.
   METHODS: All patients with a Tokuhashi score <= 8 who had undergone palliative surgical treatment for vertebral metastasis within 4 years were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and data concerning the disease and the operation were recorded. Patients were assessed on discharge and at 2 months concerning eventual benefit from surgery, based on pain measurements, motor function (Frankel grade), spinal stability assessment, and complications. Statistical analysis was performed to detect possible interrelations.
   RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were reviewed. The average age was 56.5 years. The mean Tokuhashi score was 5.9, and the mean Karnofsky score was 56.4. Thirty-six patients experienced immediate improvement, 12 were lost to follow-up, and 42 were found to have benefited from surgery 2 months later. High Karnofsky score, radicular pain, morphine use, absence of complications, and immediate improvement predicted benefit from surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decision making for a patient with poor prognosis concerning eventual surgery for a vertebral metastasis should be based mainly on the patient's clinical presentation; the primary cancer site is of less importance.

ID PSEUDOTUMOR CEREBRI SYNDROME; MANAGEMENT; UPDATE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY;
   ADULTS; ACETAZOLAMIDE; HEADACHE; CRITERIA; CHILDREN; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by headaches, visual obscurations, and papilledema, and the diagnosis involves lumbar puncture (LP) with an elevated opening pressure (OP) >= 20 cm H20. When papilledema is absent, the diagnosis becomes less clear. Some physicians have argued that the absence of papilledema rules out IIH, whereas others maintain that elevated OP is sufficient for diagnosis.
   METHODS: The authors performed a single-institution 4year retrospective analysis of patients who underwent invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for presumed IIH.
   RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were reviewed, and 13 had classic symptoms of IIH, documented elevated OP, and absence of papilledema; 5/13 (38%) patients had proven intracranial hypertension as shown by invasive ICP monitoring, whereas 8/13 (62%) had normal ICP.
   CONCLUSIONS: With the use of current diagnostic algorithms of clinical presentation and elevated OP, over half of patients without papilledema in our series would be falsely diagnosed with IIH, which could result in unnecessary medical and surgical intervention. Thus, elevated OP as determined by LP is insufficient to diagnose IIH. On the other hand, the absence of papilledema does not rule out intracranial hypertension.

AB BACKGROUND: Gross total resection (GTR) in patients with glioblastoma (GB) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) is associated with improved survival. We examined how tumor location, tumor grade, and age affected this benefit.
   METHODS: We selected patients with lobar AA or GB in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 1999 to 2010. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.
   RESULTS: We identified and studied 1429 patients with lobar AA and 12,537 patients with lobar GB in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, GTR of frontal lobe AA was associated with approximately 50% reduction in risk of death compared with subtotal resection (STR) (hazard ratio 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.73; P < 0.001). This hazard ratio corresponds to a median increase in overall survival of > 8 years with GTR compared with STR. In nonfrontal AAs, there was no survival difference between GTR and STR (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.08; P = 0.143). Location-specific survival benefit from GTR in AAs was significant in patients 50 pound years old but was not evident in patients > 50 years old. In patients with GB, no location-dependent survival benefit with GTR was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate complex interaction between tumor grade, frontal lobe location, and age in their various contributions to survival benefit gained from GTR. The greatest survival benefit of GTR relative to STR was observed in patients 50 pound years old with frontal AAs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of pulsed radio-frequency (PRF) stimulation of the thoracic medial branch of the dorsal ramus in patients with chronic thoracic facet joint (TFJ) pain who were refractory to medial branch block (MBB).
   METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. The author retrospectively reviewed data from 72 patients who had received therapeutic MBB with 0.5 mL of 2% lidocaine mixed with 0.5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine to treat TFJ-origin upper or midback pain. Of these patients, 20 were included to evaluate the effects of PRF on the thoracic medical branch to manage TFJ pain refractory to therapeutic MBB. PRF stimulation was administered at 5 Hz and a 5-millisecond pulsed width for 360 seconds at 45 V. The pain-reducing effect of the PRF procedure was evaluated via the numeric rating scale (NRS) at 1, 2, and 3 months after treatment. Successful pain relief was defined as >= 50% reduction in the NRS score compared with the score before treatment.
   RESULTS: The NRS scores changed significantly over time (pretreatment, 6.0 +/- 1.0; 1 month, 3.3 +/- 2.2; 2 months, 3.9 +/- 2.1; and 3 months, 4.0 +/- 2.2). At 1, 2, and 3 months after the PRF procedure, the NRS scores were significantly reduced compared with the scores before the treatment. Eleven (55%) of 20 patients reported successful pain relief at 3 months after PRF.
   CONCLUSIONS: The author suggests that PRF on the thoracic medial branch is an effective and safe interventional technique for the control of chronic TFJ pain.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of carotide-carotid artery crossover bypass with a synthetic vascular graft for symptomatic type 1A common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO).
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with symptomatic type 1A CCAO who underwent carotide-carotid artery crossover bypass surgery via a retropharyngeal route with a synthetic vascular graft in the Department of Neurosurgery at our hospital. Preoperative demographic data, surgical complications, incidence of stroke during follow-up, and other clinical data were summarized.
   RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2016, carotide-carotid artery crossover bypass was performed with a synthetic vascular graft in 4 patients with type 1A CCAO. The mean patient age was 63.3 years (range, 49-69 years). Clinical symptoms included dizziness, amaurosis fugax, persistent limb numbness, and transient ischemic attack. In all 4 patients, postoperative computed tomography angiography showed internal carotid artery thickening due to successful bypass, whereas computed tomography perfusion showed improved postoperative cerebral perfusion on the side of the lesion. The sole perioperative complication was a complaint of foreign body sensation on swallowing in 1 patient. The mean duration of follow-up was 40.3 months (range, 14-77 months), during which no newly occurred cerebral ischemia or synthetic vascular graft occlusion was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Carotide-carotid artery crossover bypass with a synthetic vascular graft is a safe and effective therapeutic approach for patients with symptomatic type 1A CCAO. However, studies with larger series are needed to enable more precise conclusions.

AB BACKGROUND: Solitary intracranial metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) are rare, and their management is still controversial. This research aimed to seek suitable therapeutic methods for this disease.
   METHODS: We retrospectively studied 11 pathologically confirmed cases of solitary intracranial metastases of DTC in a single institution from January 2000 to December 2016 and systematically reviewed 52 cases of this disease out of 416 cases described in the literature on PubMed. These 63 cases were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis, and post-hoc test.
   RESULTS: The diameters of intracranial metastases in all 63 cases were greater than 2 cm. Lung metastases (P = 0.000) and neurosurgery (P = 0.014) were 2 independent prognostic factors of this disease. Only neurosurgery (P = 0.05) was an independent prognostic factor in the patients with lung metastases, and neurosurgery (P = 0.044) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (P = 0.041) were 2 independent factors in the patients without lung metastases. Longer overall survival (OS) was achieved in the gross total removal (GTR) and subtotal removal (STR) groups than in the no neurosurgery group (P = 0.015, P = 0.084, respectively), and there was no significance between the GTR and STR groups (P = 0.918).
   CONCLUSION: The patients without lung metastases had a better prognosis than did the patients with lung metastases. Neurosurgery could obviously improve the prognosis, and if possible, GTR of metastases was supposed to be achieved; STR could be considered. WBRT was a suitable method after neurosurgery in the patients without lung metastases but could not prolong OS in the patients with lung metastases.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningitis is a serious complication occurring after neurosurgical operations, which can result in severe morbidity and high mortality. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the risk factors of postoperative meningitis in a large clinical center of neurosurgery in China.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent a neurosurgical procedure between January 2014 and December 2015 were selected, and 1016 cases were included our final analysis. On the basis of propensity scores, 84 patients with postoperative meningitis were successfully matched to 84 patients without postoperative meningitis.
   RESULTS: After propensity score matching, age, hospitalization duration, intraoperative use of corticoids, intraoperative use of antibiotics, external ventricular drainage, lumbar drainage, enteral nutrition, duration of surgery, major craniotomy, and transsphenoidal surgery were associated with postoperative meningitis. Furthermore, preoperative use of corticoids, intraoperative use of corticoids, intraoperative use of antibiotics, external ventricular drainage, lumbar drainage, and major craniotomy were independent predictors of postoperative meningitis in propensity score-matched cohort. A prediction model including these 6 independent predictors was established. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve and discriminant analysis confirmed that this model has strong predictive power for evaluating postoperative meningitis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prediction model built in our study can be an excellent tool for predicting meningitis after neurosurgical procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of decompression alone (D group) with decompression and fusion (DF group) for patients who were diagnosed with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS).
   METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies that compared decompression alone with decompression and fusion for LDS. Then, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted, and the extracted data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.3. We used the random effects model for studies that had heterogeneity between them, and for those without heterogeneity, the fixed model was used.
   RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials and 14 nonrandomized controlled studies involving 77,994 patients were included for this meta-analysis. Although the DF group was associated with a higher postoperative change score on a visual analog scale compared with the D group in terms of back (P = 0.02) and leg (P = 0.04), they failed to reach the minimum clinically important difference. Moreover, no significant differences were found in Oswestry Disability Index, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, Short-Form 36 physical and mental component summaries score, and patients' satisfaction (P > 0.05) between treatment groups. Complication rate and reoperation rate (P > 0.05) were similar in both groups. Data analysis also showed that the DF group was associated with longer operation time (P < 0.00001), more intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.00001), and longer length of hospital stay (P < 0.00001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with LDS, decompression and fusion surgery did not yield better clinical outcomes than decompression alone surgery. Also, the complication rate and reoperation rate were comparable between treatment groups. However, patients who had undergone decompression alone had shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, and shorter hospital stay.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact on functional outcome and postoperative pain of a modified C-shaped skin incision and muscle flaps in patients undergoing minicraniotomy via a retrosigmoid approach (mCRSA).
   METHODS: Enrolled patients were studied prospectively and divided/assigned to group A, with a standard straight/lazy S-shaped incision, or to group B, with a modified C-shaped incision. The latter consisted of a 4-cm C-shaped skin incision with medial convexity (placed 8 cm lateral to the external occipital protuberance, with the lower edge terminating 1.5-2 cm above the mastoid tip), followed, after subperiosteal dissection, by superior and inferior reflection of the muscle flaps by stitches.
   RESULTS: Eighty patients, 40 in each group, were enrolled in the study. The overall complication rate was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in group B. The incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was 4% in group B versus 12% in group A; furthermore, no wound infection was recorded in group B, whereas 2 cases (4%) occurred in group A. Overall, group B patients had a higher satisfaction rate (P = 0.0002), and the prevalence of postoperative retroauricular pain/neck discomfort was significantly higher (P = 0.0002) in group A (30% vs. 0%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The modified C-shaped skin incision and muscle flaps technique provides superior surgical exposure with advantages over the standard straight/lazy S-shaped incision including no need for a self-retaining retractor and a shorter working distance. This study supports the research hypothesis that the landmarks-based design of the C-shaped incision may decrease the risk of occipital muscle/cutaneous nerve injuries and CSF leak, resulting in better functional outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of cerebrovascular abnormalities in diagnostic subgroups of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in a regional neurosurgical center in the modern era.
   METHODS: Data of 609 consecutive patients with spontaneous SAH in a 3-year period (August 2010 to August 2013) were prospectively collected. Patients were divided into 3 diagnostic subgroups: computed tomography (CT) positive for SAH; CT negative but positive cerebrospinal fluid examination by spectrophotometry for SAH; CT negative for SAH and inconclusive cerebrospinal fluid examination. All patients fit for intervention underwent CT angiography with or without digital subtraction angiography to identify vascular abnormalities for subsequent treatment.
   RESULTS: Of 609 patients, 554 were fit for further investigation and consideration of further intervention; 514 patients had confirmed SAH. Mean patient age was 54.0 years; 61.5% of patients were women. Of patients, 390 (75.9%) showed vascular abnormalities on angiography. There were 438 patients (85.2%) with confirmed SAH diagnosed on CT scan (group 1). Vascular abnormalities were detected in 81.1% of patients; 18.9% of patients with positive CT scan had no identifiable cause of SAH. Of patients with confirmed SAH, 76 (14.8%) had negative CT scan but positive lumbar puncture (group 2); 46.1% of patients in this group had vascular abnormalities. Three patients with inconclusive cerebrospinal fluid examination had lesions requiring treatment. Median length of hospital stay in group 1 patients was longer than median length of hospital stay in group 2 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of vascular abnormalities in spontaneous SAH is lower than the traditionally quoted figure, which has diagnostic and prognostic implications for patient management.

AB BACKGROUND: Epidural steroid injection for low back and leg pain has been shown to result in a positive clinical outcome. Lumbosacral selective nerve root block (SNRB) via a transforaminal approach is commonly performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, ultrasound guidance is an alternative to overcome the radiologic disadvantages. This study examined the accuracy of needle-tip localization under ultrasound guidance with a contrast bubble, compared with fluoroscopic guidance.
   OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives were to envisage the needle-tip localization with an air bubble by ultrasound and also to determine the accuracy of needle-tip location in transforaminal lumbar SNRB for low back and leg pain patients who were not surgical candidates.
   METHODS: A prospective study of 30 SNRBs was conducted. An air bubble was produced and was used to envisage the needle-tip location under ultrasound guidance. Finally, the needle tip was confirmed by fluoroscopy. The accuracy of needle-tip location was statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four SNRBs were performed at L4-5 and 6 SNRBs at L3-4. The accuracy of needle-tip localization was 80%.
   CONCLUSION: In order to avoid radiation exposure during the SNRB procedure, ultrasound guidance might be an alternative. Despite being accepted practice, there is a steep learning curve involved in the use of ultrasound guidance for lumbar SNRB, and proper training is crucial. A contrast bubble is a prospective enhancement for better visualization of ultrasound guidance.

AB BACKGROUND: Readmission and reoperation are used as hospital and surgeon quality metrics. Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), are a major cause of readmission, morbidity, and mortality after spine surgery. Specific procedural, perioperative, and patient characteristics may be associated with these outcomes.
   METHODS: We retrospectively examined records from 6869 consecutive spine surgeries at our institution. We collected data on patient demographics, surgery, hospital course, and 30-day rates of VTE, readmission, reoperation, and epidural hematoma. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of each outcome.
   RESULTS: Factors associated with VTE within 30 days of surgery include a history of VTE (odds ratio [OR] 3.92 [confidence interval 1.83-8.36], P < 0.001), estimated blood loss (EBL; OR 1.017 [1.005-1.029], P = 0.004), fracture (OR 5.42 [2.09-14.05], P = 0.001), history of PE (OR 4.04 [1.22-13.42], P = 0.023), and transfusion (OR 2.26 [1.07-4.77], P = 0.033). Factors associated with readmission were a history of PE (OR 3.27 [1.07-9.97], P = 0.038), PE (OR 8.07 [2.26-28.8], P = 0.001), transfusion (OR 2.54 [1.55-4.17], P < 0.001), comorbid disease burden (OR 1.35 [1.01-1.80], P = 0.041), and tumor surgery (OR 2.84 [1.32-6.10], P = 0.007). Factors associated with reoperation were EBL (OR 1.024 [1.006-1.042], P = 0.008), transfusion (OR 3.86 [1.38-10.79], P = 0.01), and PE (OR 6.05 [1.03-35.62], P = 0.046). Transfusion was associated with epidural hematoma within 30 days (OR 7.38 [1.37-39.83], P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion and EBL are associated with numerous negative outcomes. Transfusion is an independent predictor of VTE, readmission, reoperation, and epidural hematoma requiring evacuation. Specific pathologies were associated with specific negative outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal metastatic disease compromises the quality of life and prognosis of the patients. Prognosis is an important factor for the decision-making process and needs to be precise in order to adjust the intensity of therapy. The Tokuhashi score is a universal instrument to determine the prognosis. The objective was to analyze the effectiveness of the Tokuhashi score in determining the prognosis of the patients with spine metastasis by comparing the expected survival time from the Tokuhashi score with the survival time observed among surgical patients.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from October 2008 to October 2015. The inclusion criteria were symptomatic patients with spinal metastasis who underwent spinal cord decompression and had a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The exclusion criteria were patients without histologic confirmation and were lost to follow-up. The Tokuhashi score was applied, and once the expected survival was defined, it was compared with the survival time observed in the follow-up.
   RESULTS: The sample studied was 117 patients. The commonly female (58%) and breast spinal metastasis was often observed (25.6%). The patients were followed for a minimum period of 12 months. The actual survival was beyond that estimated by the Tokuhashi score (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: The Tokuhashi score was not reliable to predict the prognosis. Patients with lower scores that surgical treatment was not recommended by the Tokuhashi score had better quality of life and longer survival after surgery. Tokuhashi score is not a precise tool to establish the best therapy and survival in patients with spinal metastasis.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with a modification of the conventional techniques for the removal of large spinal epidural hematomas (SEHs), based on multi-level "skip hemilaminectomies."
   METHODS: Eleven patients with SEHs extending over 5 or more spinal segments were treated at our institution via a modified hemilaminectomy technique from 2008 to 2014. This procedure, that we called "skip hemilaminectomy," consists in performing consecutive, alternating, unilateral laminar decompressions at 2-3 levels, followed by sub-laminar undercutting, ipsi- and contralateral flavectomy, plus hematoma removal.
   RESULTS: Complete clot evacuation and full neurologic recovery were always achieved. A short hospital stay, fast postoperative mobilization, a minimized need of analgesic drugs, and no complications were recorded.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our preliminary experience, skip hemilaminectomy seems to be as safe as more conventional techniques (laminectomy, extended hemilaminectomy) for the removal of large multilevel SEHs, granting full neurologic improvement, short surgical times-even for very large lesions-and no complications at follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVES: Spinal stabilization surgery is an integral part of the treatment of spinal metastatic disease. Bony fusion is the hallmark of spinal stabilization in non-oncology patients. Spinal oncology patients are unlikely to achieve bony fusion because of their overall prognosis and concurrent therapies. Stabilization surgery without fusion may be a reasonable approach for these patients. Literature evaluating the effectiveness of this approach is limited. The object of this study was to investigate the rate of instrumentation failure in patients undergoing posterior spinal instrumented stabilization without fusion for spinal metastatic disease.
   METHODS: Data from consecutive cases of spinal surgery at our institution during an 81-month period were reviewed. Demographics, clinical notes, and computed tomography findings were recorded and used to evaluate instrumentation failures. Patients who underwent separation surgery that included laminectomy and posterior spinal instrumentation without fusion for spinal metastatic disease and had follow-up computed tomography scans >3 months postoperatively were selected for the study.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. Mean age was 64.85 +/- 6.53 years. Nine patients were women. A mean of 1.61 +/- 0.96 laminectomy levels was performed. A mean of 8.26 +/- 1.48 screws was inserted. The mean postoperative discharge date was 5.07 +/- 1.47 days. Mean follow-up duration was 12.17 +/- 11.73 months. None of the patients had a change in instrumentation position, pedicle screw pullout, change in spinal alignment, or progressive deformity. No patient required reoperation or instrumentation revision or replacement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that instrumented spinal stabilization without fusion is an acceptable approach for patients with spinal metastatic disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the consequences of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) on sexual pleasure in patients with an otherwise favorable neurologic outcome.
   METHODS: Anonymous, standardized questionnaires concerning sexual function, including the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and a statement on subjective change in sexual pleasure after aSAH, were completed by 33 patients treated at the Cantonal Hospital St Gallen between 2005 and 2013. All had favorable neurologic outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or 5).
   RESULTS: Ten patients (31.3%) reported a subjective worsening of sexual pleasure after aSAH. Sexual dysfunction according to FSFI criteria affected 9 of the 19 female patients (47.4%). All 19 women had a hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Erectile dysfunction was present in 7 of the 14 male patients (50%). Patients with World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade 2 aSAH were significantly more likely to report a subjective worsening of sexual experience after hemorrhage than those with WFNS grade 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known evaluation of sexual health following aSAH with otherwise favorable neurologic outcomes, and confirms that sexual dysfunction is common in this population. Sexual health should be explored during follow-up with these patients.

TI Correlation of Lactate Concentration in Peripheral Plasma and

LA English
DT Article
DE Acute hydrocephalus; Glasgow Outcome Scale; Plasma lactate and
   cerebrospinal fluid lactate level; Tuberculous meningitis
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BRAIN TISSUE; PYRUVATE; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is an endemic infectious disease in developing countries, and it can become a serious illness in children. Treatment of TBM is more difficult and prone to failure than treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. TBM causes hydrocephalus, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, global ischemia, and neurologic deficits, which disturb cellular metabolism and increase lactate levels. A reliable, widely available clinical indicator of TBM severity is needed. Successful treatment of TBM is assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).
   METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 34 patients with TBM and acute hydrocephalus who had undergone fluid diversions and were admitted to Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung from 2014 to 2015. A portable machine for blood glucose measurement was used to measure lactate concentrations. Statistical significance was defined as P <= 0.05.
   RESULTS: Average levels of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate were 1.99 +/- 0.70 mmol/L and 3.04 +/- 1.05 mmol/L, respectively. A significantly higher level of lactate was observed in CSF compared with plasma. Preoperative plasma lactate was negatively correlated to GOS (r = -0.539; P = 0.013), and CSF lactate was negatively correlated to GOS (r = -0.412; P = 0.027). Average lactate levels in CSF (central) were higher than plasma (peripheral) levels. GOS scale of patients decreased with increased plasma and CSF lactate levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Examination of plasma and CSF lactate levels should be included in routine examinations to determine extent of cellular damage and GOS score in patients with TBM and acute hydrocephalus who have undergone fluid diversions.

AB BACKGROUND: The major limitation of computer-based three-dimensional fluoroscopy is increased radiation exposure of patients and operating room staff. Combining spine navigation with intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopy (io3DF) can likely overcome this shortcoming, while increasing pedicle screw accuracy rate. We compared data from a cohort of patients undergoing lumbar percutaneous pedicle screw placement using io3DF alone or in combination with spine navigation.
   METHODS: This study consisted of 168 patients who underwent percutaneous pedicle screw implantation between 2009 and 2016. The primary endpoint was to compare pedicle screw accuracy between the 2 groups. Secondary endpoints were to compare radiation exposure of patients and operating room staff, duration of surgery, and postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: In group 1, 438 screws were placed without navigation guidance; in group 2, 276 screws were placed with spine navigation. Mean patient age in both groups was 58.6 +/- 14.1 years. The final pedicle accuracy rate was 97.9% in group 1 and 99.6% in group 2. Average radiation dose per patient was significantly larger in group 1 (571.9 mGym(2)) than in group 2 (365.6 mGym(2)) (P = 0.000088). Surgery duration and complication rate were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: io3DF with spine navigation minimized radiation exposure of patients and operating room staff and provided an excellent percutaneous pedicle screw accuracy rate with no permanent complications compared with io3DF alone. This setup is recommended, especially for patients with a complex degenerative spine condition.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic factors for microvascular decompression (MVD) in patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN), with a particular focus on the morphology of the posterior cranial fossa (PCF).
   METHODS: The present study investigated 126 surgically treated patients with primary TN with more than 1-year follow-up who underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging between April 2003 and September 2015. We retrospectively reviewed clinical information and operative findings. Outcomes of MVD were also evaluated and patients were classified into "success" and "failure" groups. Furthermore, length, width, and height of the PCF were measured by approximation to an ellipsoid with reference to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. These values were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: Atypical type 2 TN (P < 0.001) and weak neurovascular compression (P < 0.001) correlated significantly with poor outcomes of MVD for primary TN. In terms of PCF morphology, the failure group showed a flatter PCF than the success group, whereas sex, age, affected side, topography of facial pain, interval between onset and surgery, responsible vessel, location of compression along the nerve, and site of compression around the circumference of the nerve root did not significantly affect outcomes of MVD for primary TN.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified type 2 TN, weak neurovascular compression, and flatness of the PCF as predictors of poor prognosis after MVD for primary TN.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate the effect and safety of endo-vascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms concomitant with severe adjacent atherosclerotic stenosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with aneurysms and adjacent stenosis were prospectively enrolled. The characteristics of the aneurysm, parent artery, atherosclerotic stenosis and endovascular treatment methods were analyzed.
   RESULTS: All aneurysms were successfully embolized (100%), with stent-assisted coiling in 14 (53.8%) cases, coiling alone in 10 (38.5%), double microcatheter coiling in 1 (3.8%), and balloon-assisted coiling in the remaining 1 (3.8%). Immediately after embolization, complete occlusion was achieved in 10 cases (38.5%), nearly complete occlusion in 6 (23.1%) and non-complete occlusion in 10 (38.5%). Ten aneurysms were type I and were managed with coiling alone in 8 cases and stent-assisted coiling in the remaining 2 cases, with complete occlusion achieved in 6 cases (60%), nearly complete in 2 (20%), and noncomplete in the other 2 (20%). Sixteen aneurysms were type II and treated with stent-assisted coiling in 12 cases (75%), single coiling in 2 (12.5%), double microcatheters in 1 (6.3%), and balloonassisted coiling in the remaining aneurysm (6.3%). Aneurysm occlusion was complete in 4 cases (25%), nearly complete in 4 (25%), and noncomplete in the other 8 (50%). Clinical follow-up of 2 months to 5 years (mean 26 +/- 11 months) demonstrated no rebleeding, with the modified Rankin scale score of 0-2 in 20 patients, 3 in 4, and 6 in the remaining 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial aneurysms concomitant with severe adjacent atherosclerotic stenosis can be successfully treated endovascularly, and careful evaluation of the characteristics of the aneurysm, parent artery, stenosis and collateral circulation can help reducing complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: Owing to the aging of the population in the United States, it is anticipated that injury mechanisms, treatment, and outcomes of spinal cord injuries (SCI) will change. There is a scarcity of literature on nontraumatic SCI. Our goal in this study was to evaluate the causes, management, complications, and outcomes after SCI.
   METHODS: In a retrospective review, patients with traumatic and nontraumatic SCI admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit at a level 1 trauma center from 2003 to 2013 were reviewed.
   RESULTS: In all, 757 entries were identified, and 685 unique patients met our inclusion criteria; 17.4% were < 35 years of age, 51.7% were 35 to 64 years of age, and 30.9% were at least 65 years old. The young adults had the highest proportion of fractures (60.5%) and subluxations (21.8%), whereas the oldest group had the highest rates of stenosis (35.4%), spondylotic myelopathy (16.5%), and cancer (15.1%). In SCI patients < 35 years of age, 66.6% of injuries were caused by traumatic mechanisms of injury compared with 30.2% in the geriatric cohort. In the total of all SCI, 61.6% were nontraumatic. Surgical management was more prevalent with increasing age (58.8%, 73.7%, 82.1% from youngest to oldest group), as were overall rates of complications (58.6%, 59.4%, 66.7%). Mortality rates significantly increased with age (2.5%, 18.9%, 40.6% overall mortality rates in the 3 age groups). The overall mortality rate in nontraumatic SCI patients was 27.7% compared with 14.8% in traumatic SCI patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Falls caused significantly more SCIs than expected, but most SCIs were predominantly nontraumatic in cause. The epidemiology of SCI is shifting rapidly.

AB BACKGROUND: The management of intracranial aneurysms in the pediatric population presents unique challenges. Cases are rare and tend to be of higher complexity compared with aneurysms in adults. Outcomes in long-term follow-up are not well-characterized. Here we present illustrative case examples to demonstrate key concepts in managing these lesions in the context of the modern neurovascular era.
   METHODS: Four institutional databases of neurovascular procedures from 2012 to 2017 were reviewed. Patients <18 years old who underwent treatment for intracranial aneurysms were included. Patient characteristics, aneurysm details, treatment information, and angiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: Ten cases of intracranial aneurysms in 9 children were identified. Management included direct clipping, trapping and bypass, endovascular coil embolization, endovascular vessel sacrifice, and flow diversion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The management of intracranial aneurysms in pediatric patients requires special considerations, from the diagnostic phase to treatment methods and follow-up regimen. These are ideally considered by a multidisciplinary team, with expertise from pediatric neurosurgeons, cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, and neurointerventionalists.

AB OBJECTIVE: An abdominal pseudocyst (APC) is a distal catheter site-specific failure in patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Few studies with more than 10 patients have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze causes of peritoneal catheter revisions with special emphasis on revisions because of an APC.
   METHODS: Pediatric patients with first shunt operation between 1982 and 1992 were included, and time, cause, and modality of peritoneal catheter revision were determined retrospectively.
   RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients were treated for hydrocephalus, and 112 patients received a peritoneal catheter during the follow-up. An APC was diagnosed in 14 (12.5%) patients, and 28 revisions were needed for its treatment. The rate of shunt infection in patients with APC was 50%, but bacterial examination of the pseudofluid culture revealed infection in only 3 patients. Age at first surgical procedure, type of first surgical procedure, and etiology of hydrocephalus were not associated with APC diagnosis. APC recurred in 4 patients. These patients had a catheter repositioning directly into the peritoneum as first surgical treatment. No recurrences were observed in patients with shunt externalization or replacement of the peritoneal catheter.
   CONCLUSIONS: An APC is a major long-term complication after ventriculoperitoneal shunt treatment. Although a sterile inflammatory response cannot be excluded completely, our results favor the hypothesis of low-level shunt infection. In both cases, the surgical consequences are the same. An infected APC should be treated as a shunt infection. Uninfected patients can be treated with shunt externalization and replacement of only the peritoneal catheter.

AB OBJECTIVE: The role of atlantoaxial instability in the pathogenesis of Chiari 1 formation (Chiari formation) in pediatric age-group patients is evaluated.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the period of January 2010 to June 2017, 33 pediatric patients having Chiari formation were treated with atlantoaxial fixation. Twenty-four patients had basilar invagination, and 9 patients had no bone abnormality at the craniovertebral junction. Sixteen patients had syringomyelia, and 9 patients had both basilar invagination and syringomyelia. Considering the type of facet alignment and atlantoaxial instability, the patients were divided into 3 groups. Type 1 dislocation (13 patients) was anterior atlantoaxial instability wherein the facet of the atlas was dislocated anterior to the facet of the axis. Type 2 dislocation (5 patients) was posterior atlantoaxial instability wherein the facet of the atlas was dislocated posterior to the facet of the axis. Type 3 dislocation (15 patients) was the absence of demonstrable facet malalignment. Type 2 and 3 atlantoaxial facet instability were labeled as central atlantoaxial dislocation. In 14 patients, dynamic images showed mobile and at least partially reducible vertical atlantoaxial dislocation.
   RESULTS: All patients were treated with atlantoaxial plate and screw fixation using techniques described in 1994 and 2004. Foramen magnum decompression or syrinx manipulation was not performed in any patient. Occipital bone and subaxial spinal elements were not included in the fixation construct. All patients had gratifying and sustained clinical improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: The outcome further confirms the cause-effect relationship of Chiari formation and atlantoaxial instability.

AB OBJECTIVE: Dural substitutes are used in decompressive craniectomy (DC) to prevent adhesions during subsequent cranioplasty. Current literature attributes them to reduced blood loss and reduction in operative time of cranioplasty. The use of double-layer substitute has rarely been documented. We studied the use of double-layer G-patch as a dural substitute in DC and evaluated its outcome during subsequent cranioplasty with special focus on flap elevation time and blood loss during cranioplasty.
   METHODS: We performed emergency frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy using a double layer of G-patch as dural substitute. Subsequent cranioplasty was done in these 35 patients. The development of adhesion formation between the tissue layers, amount of blood loss, and flap elevation time were recorded.
   RESULTS: During the cranioplasty, a clear and smooth plane of dissection was found between the 2 layers of G-patch in all cases. Average flap elevation time was 21.8 minutes, and average time taken for cranioplasty was 124.12 minutes. Average blood loss was 83 mL. None of the patients required re-exploration for infection of bone flap or postoperative bleed.
   CONCLUSIONS: While evaluating the use of dural substitute during DC as an adhesion preventive material for subsequent cranioplasty, flap elevation time and blood loss should be taken into account rather than operative time. Double-layer G-patch during DC facilitates subsequent cranioplasty by preventing adhesions between the layers, resulting in easier dissection and reduced blood loss.

TI Smartphone Usage Patterns by Canadian Neurosurgery Residents: A National
   Cross-Sectional Survey
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Canadian neurosurgery residents; Mobile apps; Smartphone usage
ID MOBILE DEVICES; REHABILITATION; EDUCATION; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Smartphones and their apps are used ubiquitously in medical practice. However, in some cases their use can be at odds with current patient data safety regulations such as Canada's Personal Health Information Protection Act of 2004. To assess current practices and inform mobile application development, we sought to better understand mobile device usage patterns among Canadian neurosurgery residents.
   METHODS: Through the Canadian Neurosurgery Research Collaborative, an online survey characterizing smartphone ownership and usage patterns was developed and sent to all Canadian neurosurgery resident in April of 2016. Questionnaires were collected and completed surveys analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 146 eligible residents, 76 returned completed surveys (52% response rate). Of these 99% of respondents owned a smartphone, with 79% running on Apple's iOS. Four general mobile uses were identified: 1) communication between-members of the medical team, 2) decision support, 3) medical reference, and 4) documentation through medical photography. Communication and photography were areas where the most obvious breaches in the Canadian Personal Health Information Protection Act were noted, with 89% of respondents taking pictures of patients' radiologic studies and 75% exchanging them with Short Message System. Hospital policies had no impact on user behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Smartphones are used daily by most neurosurgery residents. Identified usage patterns are associated with perceived gains in efficacy and challenges in privacy and data reliability. We believe creating and improving workflows that address these usage patterns has a greater potential to improve privacy than changing policies and enforcing regulations.

AB OBJECTIVE: In adults, spinal ependymomas constitute only 3% to 6% of central nervous system tumors. Because of their rarity and poor prognosis, large population-based studies are needed to assess the epidemiology and survival risk factors associated with these tumors in the hope of improving outcome. The authors undertook this retrospective study to explore factors that may influence survival in adult patients with spinal ependymomas.
   METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, a prospective cancer registry, the authors retrospectively assessed survival in histologically confirmed spinal ependymomas in patients 18 years of age and older. Survival was described with Kaplan-Meier curves, and a multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the association of several variables with survival while controlling for confounding variables.
   RESULTS: Overall survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis was 97.0%, 94.3%, and 93.3%, respectively. Patient age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.07, P < 0.001), tumor grade IV (HR 11.11, 95% CI 1.27-97.02, P = 0.032), and the use of radiation therapy during the course of treatment (HR 4.42, 95% CI 1.69-11.57, P = 0.003) were each associated with decreased survival. Gross total resection (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-1.10, P = 0.026) was associated with improved overall survival. Gender, tumor size, and tumor extension were not found to impact survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: High-grade ependymomas occurring in the spine have a much worse prognosis than do those with lower grades. Early diagnosis and surgery appear to be associated with improved survival and outcomes, whereas radiation therapy has an unclear role.

   MORBIDITY; TRAUMA
AB BACKGROUND: Jefferson fractures, or burst fractures of the C1 vertebra, can be managed surgically or conservatively, depending on their stability.
   METHODS: We identified all patients who were treated for a C1 fracture at our institution between 1999 and 2016 for retrospective analysis. Patients with any other concurrent cervical fractures or nontraumatic etiology of fracture were excluded. Stability was defined as either lateral mass displacement >= 7 mm on computed tomography or presence of transverse atlantal ligament disruption on magnetic resonance imaging. We collected data on patients' demographic, clinical, and radiographic presentation and identified variables independently associated with instability at presentation and failure to achieve fusion at follow-up.
   RESULTS: We identified 65 patients. On multivariable regression, instability at presentation was independently associated with atlantodens interval (odds ratio [OR] 2.357, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.0629-1.271], P = 0.099) and type 3 fracture (OR 6.081, 95% CI [1.068-34.612], P = 0.042). Failure to achieve fusion was independently associated with age (OR 1.226, 95% CI [1.007-1.495], P = 0.043), motor vehicle collision as mechanism of injury (OR 22834.3, 95% CI [3.135-1.66-8], P = 0.027), and type 2 fracture (OR 168.537, 95% CI [1.743-16292.92], P = 0.028). Type 3 fracture was positively associated with halo vest for management (OR 17.171, 95% CI [2.882-102.289], P = 0.002) and negatively associated with a rigid cervical collar for management (OR 0.0616, 95% CI [0.0104-0.3653], P =0.002). All 4 patients who underwent surgery presented with unstable fracture (P = 0.0187).
   CONCLUSIONS: Atlantodens interval, mechanism of injury, and fracture type affect Jefferson fracture management decisions and outcomes, including instability at presentation and fusion at follow-up. Most fractures were managed nonsurgically regardless of stability.

   VENTRICULUS-TERMINALIS; SCALPEL SIGN; SYRINX; PAIN; MYELOPATHY;
   MYELOMALACIA; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Syringomyelia is considered as a fluid-filled cavitation inside the spinal cord. However, there is no agreement whether a dilated central canal should be included under this heading or how glioependymal cysts, myelomalacias, or cystic tumors should be distinguished from syringomyelia. This article provides a definition of syringomyelia and guidelines for its diagnosis.
   METHODS: Between 1991 and 2015, of 3206 patients with spinal cord pathologies 2276 demonstrated cystic features. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Syringomyelia was differentiated from cystic intramedullary tumors, glioependymal cysts, myelomalacias, and dilatations of the central canal by clinical and radiologic criteria.
   RESULTS: A total of 1535 patients were diagnosed with syringomyelia, 635 with dilatations of the central canal, 52 with glioependymal cysts, 52 with mylomalacias, and 2 with cystic intramedullary spinal cord tumors. Additional neuroradiologic studies revealed the causes of syringomyelia. As a result 604 patients showed pathologies at the craniocervical junction leading to disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The commonest was a Chiari I malformation in 543 patients. Nine hundred thirty-one patients presented with pathologies in the spinal canal. The commonest causes were spinal arachnopathies, leading to CSF flow obstructions in 533 patients, intramedullary tumors in 152 patients, and tethered cord syndromes in 69 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of syringomyelia should be reserved for patients with a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord related to either a disturbance of CSF flow, spinal cord tethering, or an intramedullary tumor. For patients in whom such a relation cannot be established, the diagnosis of syringomyelia should be withheld.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causes of partial remission in patients with basilar invagination (BI) and irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD) treated with transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate (TARP) without odontoidectomy and quantify the distance of odontoid descent.
   METHODS: Between August 2010 and July 2012, 22 consecutive patients with BI with IAAD who underwent TARP surgery were reviewed. The preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters were evaluated. Followup data and the symptom treatment interval (STI), defined as the interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical treatment, were assessed. Neurological function was evaluated as neurologic improvement, defined as ([Postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score] - [Preoperative JOA score])/(17 - [Preoperative JOA score]). The patients were assigned to group A (<50%) or group B (>= 50%) based on their level of neurologic improvement.
   RESULTS: All 22 patients improved clinically to varying degrees. The mean preoperative STI was 105.6 +/- 67.6 months for group A and 45.3 +/- 46.7 months for group B (P < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in follow-up (P > 0.05) or with respect to radiographic parameters (P > 0.05). Persistent brainstem compression was observed in 1 patient, whose symptoms were not adequately relieved after revision surgery (transoral odontoidectomy and posterior decompression and fusion). No fixation failure was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Descent of the odontoid process is useful for treating basilar invagination. TARP surgery without odontoidectomy may pull the dens caudally and ventrally to achieve sufficient decompression of the spinal cord. Neurologic improvement may be associated with STI.

AB BACKGROUND: Many methods for treating complex anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysms are available; however, there is substantial variation among methods because of various aneurysm locations, the relationship of the aneurysm to arterial branches, aneurysm size and other morphologic characteristics, and the diameters of the parent or branching arteries.
   METHODS: We reviewed complex ACA aneurysms based on both our own experience and the available literature. Each unique case is analyzed in terms of the characteristics of the aneurysm, along with analysis and classification of the revascularization method used. Computer tablet-drawn illustrations of each unique technique are provided for comprehension and application in various situations.
   RESULTS: Over 6 years, we treated 5 cases of complex ACA aneurysms (1 precommunicating, 1 communicating, 1 postcommunicating, and 2 precallosal-supracallosal segment) with revascularization. Side-to-side anastomoses included pericallosal ACA segment-pericallosal ACA segment in 3 cases, supracallosal ACA segment-supracallosal ACA segment in 1 case, and ipsilateral callosomarginal artery-pericallosal artery in 1 case. Final modified Rankin scale score was 0 in 4 of 5 cases and 3 in 1 case. Six treatment strategies were used for the precommunicating aneurysm, 8 for the communicating aneurysm, 7 for the postcommunicating aneurysm, and 9 for the 2 precallosal-supracallosal segment aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of complex ACA aneurysms should be tailored according to the location and nature of the aneurysm and collateral circulation. Viable and feasible treatment strategies must be established by the neurovascular surgeon.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of uniplanar and multiaxial pedicle screws on apical vertebral derotation efficiency in patients with Lenke V adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
   METHODS: For this retrospective study, patients with Lenke V adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with uniplanar pedicle screws (group I) and multiaxial pedicle screws (group II) were collected from January 2013 to December 2015. Grade of apical vertebral rotation was evaluated before and after surgery using the Nash-Moe and Upasani methods, respectively. The Scoliosis Research Society-22 scale was also used to evaluate patient satisfaction.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in terms of age, duration of follow-up, correction ratio, and preoperative level of apical rotation between groups (P < 0.05). Group I showed better apical vertebral derotation than group II (level 0, 10.5% vs. 2.3%; level I, 71.1% vs. 38.6%; level II, 18.4% vs. 59.1%; P = 0.001). The progression group showed lower bone maturity (odds ratio 52.0; 95% confidence interval, 6.3-430.7; P < 0.0001) in group I, and similar results were observed in group II (OR 12.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-121.3; P = 0.057). Patients in group I showed better satisfaction than patients in group II based on Scoliosis Research Society-22 scores (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both types of pedicle screws could provide effective correction, but the uniplanar pedicle screw was better for derotation of vertebrae and provided patients with better satisfaction. Skeleton immaturity was positively correlated with progression of vertebral rotation after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of anterior-only (AO), posterior-only (PO), and anteroposterior (AP) surgical approaches for treatment of dystrophic cervical kyphosis in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).
   METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 81 patients with dystrophic cervical kyphosis secondary to NF1. Length of kyphosis, duration of halo traction, Cobb angle, C2-7-sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1 slope, Neck Disability Index score, and postoperative complications were evaluated before and, if possible, after each surgical approach.
   RESULTS: AP approach provided the best outcomes (average spinal Cobb angle was corrected from 61.2 +/- 9.1 degrees to 5.7 +/- 3.2 degrees, P < 0.05); there was no significant difference between AO and PO approaches (P > 0.05). With regard to cervical sagittal balance, AP approach had the most improvements of C2-7-SVA (mean C2-7-SVA was corrected from 3.2 +/- 9.2 mm to 12.8 +/- 2.6 mm, P < 0.05); the difference between AO and PO approaches was not significant (P > 0.05). T1 slope results were similar to C2-7-SVA. Neck Disability Index score of all patients improved significantly after surgery (P < 0.05); specifically, patients who had an AP approach constituted the largest portion of the satisfied patient group. Postoperative junctional kyphosis occurred in 11 patients (1 AP approach, 6 AO approach, 4 PO approach); these findings correlated with patients with <= 5 fused segments.
   CONCLUSIONS: AP approach surgery provided the best correction of dystrophic cervical kyphosis and sagittal balance for patients with NF1. Patients undergoing an AP approach were more satisfied with their outcomes. Junctional kyphosis can be prevented effectively using an AP approach in patients with >5 fused segments.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of anterior and posterior approaches for selective thoracic fusion (STF) and selective thoracolumbar/lumbar fusion (SLF) in treating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
   METHODS: English-language literature on selective fusion treatment of AIS published before September 2016 was retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were manually selected for inclusion based on preset criteria. Relevant radiologic data were extracted, and a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five eligible studies were included. The Cobb angles of the main thoracic and minor thoracolumbar/lumbar curves at the final follow-up were significantly and similarly corrected in the anterior and posterior STF groups. Anterior but not posterior STF was effective in correcting thoracic and thoracolumbar junctional hypokyphosis and in promoting sagittal balance, as determined by the relative position of the C7 plumb line. Similarly, in both the anterior and posterior SLF groups, the final Cobb angles of main thoracolumbar/lumbar and minor thoracic curves were significantly reduced compared with angles before surgery (P < 0.05). In contrast, posterior but not anterior SLF was effective in correcting lumbar hypolordosis and thoracic hypokyphosis. Both anterior and posterior SLF promoted coronal balance, with no effects on sagittal balance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both anterior and posterior approaches are effective for treatment of AIS. Anterior is more effective than posterior STF in correcting thoracic and thoracolumbar junctional hypokyphosis and in restoring sagittal balance. Posterior is more effective than anterior SLF in correcting lumbar hypolordosis and thoracic hypokyphosis and in restoring the sagittal curvature.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate the feasibility of facial motor evoked potential (FMEP) in facial nerve (FN) monitoring during vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery under 2 anesthesia protocols and to examine its value for postoperative prognosis.
   METHODS: This prospective study included 106 patients with VS who underwent microsurgical excision between May 2014 and November 2016 at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China. All patients were investigated for FMEP elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation in the contralateral facial motor cortex. The patients randomly received total intravenous anesthesia or combined intravenous-inhalation anesthesia. Postoperative FN function was evaluated 7-10 days after surgery (short-term) and at the last follow-up (long-term) using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. HB grades 1 and 2 were deemed satisfactory, whereas HB grades 3-6 were deemed unsatisfactory. The value of the final-to-start FMEP ratio for predicting short-term and long-term postoperative FN functions was examined.
   RESULTS: Valid FMEPs were obtained in 97 patients, which were recorded from the mentalis muscle. The FMEP amplitude ratio was significantly correlated with short-term and long-term postoperative FN functions. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the FMEP ratio cut-off values of 77.4% (area under the curve = 0.797) and 56.9% (area under the curve = 0.900) predicted satisfactory FN function 7-10 days after surgery and at the last follow-up, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found in FMEP quantitative parameters between the 2 anesthesia protocols.
   CONCLUSION: The FMEP amplitude ratio is a valuable predictor for postoperative FN function. FMEP ratio >= 57% is predictive of satisfactory long-term FN function.

AB BACKGROUND: There has been a massive shift in the balance toward endovascular therapy for basilar artery (BA) aneurysms in the modern era.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiologic data from patients with BA aneurysms who were treated in a single medical center during a 10-year period from August 2006 to May 2016.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with 46 aneurysms during the 10-year period were included. The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion in 35 cases using a 1-stage operation was 58.8% (20/34). The graft patency rates of 13 bypass surgeries were 84.6% (11/13) within 1 week and 69.2% (9/13) at 3 months after surgery. The cut flow index for all bypass cases was 0.79. The overall survival was 94% at discharge (2 patients died). The 3-month outcome was favorable (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) for 27 patients (77.1%) and poor (modified Rankin Scale score 3-5) for 5 patients (14.2%), and 3 patients died (8.6%). The survival for patients with BA apex aneurysms was higher than the survival observed for patients with BA trunk/vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical treatments for BA aneurysms can be effective, with good patient outcomes in the early stage after operation. Patients with wide-necked, fusiform, or dolichoectatic aneurysms seem to exclude the aneurysm, preventing unnecessary retreatments with bypass techniques. The potential for a poor prognosis of patients with BA trunk/vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms was higher than that for patients with basilar apex aneurysms who presented with unfavorable subsequent events.

AB BACKGROUND: There are a multitude of treatments for low-grade lumbar spondylolisthesis. There are no clear guidelines for the optimal approach.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify the surgical treatment patterns for spondylolisthesis among United States spine surgeons.
   METHODS: 445 spine surgeons in the United States completed a survey of clinical/radiographic case scenarios on patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis with neurogenic claudication with (S+BP) or without (S-BP) associated mechanical back pain. Treatment options included decompression, laminectomy with posterolateral fusion, posterior lumbar interbody fusion, or none of the above. The primary outcome measure was the probability of 2 randomly chosen surgeons disagreeing on the treatment method.
   RESULTS: There was 64% disagreement (36% agreement) among surgeons for treatment of spondylolisthesis with mechanical back pain (S+BP) and 71% disagreement (29% agreement) for spondylolisthesis without mechanical back pain (S-BP). For S+BP, disagreement was 52% for those practicing 5 to 10 years versus 70% among those practicing more than 20 years. Orthopedic surgeons had greater disagreement than did neurosurgeons (76% vs. 56%) for S-BP. Greater clinical equipoise was seen for SLBP than for S-BP regardless of surgeon characteristics. For spondylolisthesis without mechanical back pain, neurosurgeons were significantly more likely to select decompression-only than were orthopedic surgeons, who more commonly selected fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical equipoise exists for the treatment of spondylolisthesis. Differences are greater when the patient presents without associated back pain. Surgeon case volume, practice duration, and specialty training influence operative decisions for a given pathologic condition. Recognizing this practice variation will hopefully lead to better evidence and practice guidelines for the optimal and most cost-effective treatment paradigms.

AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a severe cerebrovascular accident with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between level of inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aSAH patients, the severity of aSAH, and the outcome of aSAH patients.
   METHODS: aSAH patients were prospectively included and followed-up for 6 months. CSF samples were collected at 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 days after aSAH onset. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the CSF of aSAH patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   RESULTS: Eighty-one aSAH patients were enrolled. The levels of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and TNF-alpha in the CSF were especially higher in the group of aSAH patients with cerebral edema, cerebral vasospasm, and a high grade on Hunt-Hess scale, the high World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades, and Fisher grade (P < 0.01). Higher levels of plasma C-reactive protein in the blood were correlated with poor outcome. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the levels of inflammatory cytokines in CSF were 0.85, 0.84, and 0.95, respectively. Clinical features (age, Hunt-Hess grade, etc.) were positively correlated with poor outcomes (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The levels of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in CSF were elevated in aSAH patients and were positively associated with cerebral edema and acute hydrocephalus. Our findings suggest that CSF inflammatory cytokines might be biomarkers to assess severity and predict outcomes.

ID CITATION-CLASSICS; THROMBECTOMY; ASSOCIATION; JOURNALS; TRIALS; WORKS
AB OBJECTIVE: The total number of citations of a research article can be used to determine its impact on the scientific community. We aimed to identify the top-100 articles published on ischemic stroke and evaluate their characteristics.
   METHODS: Based on the database of Journal Citation Reports, 934 journals were selected that published original ischemic stroke articles. We used Web of Science citation search tool to identify top-100 citation classics, i.e., articles with more than 400 citations, in the field of ischemic stroke. All original articles were evaluated for publication year, journal category, journal and its impact factor, number of total and annual citations, research topic, publishing country, and institutional affiliation.
   RESULTS: The top-100 citation classics in ischemic stroke were published from 1970 to 2015, with the decade of 1990-1999 contributing 47 articles of historical significance. Median of total citations and annual citations in our analysis were 625.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 851.3-4 94.5) and 35.7 (IQR 79.9-25.9), respectively. The majority of the articles originated from the United States (n = 57), focused over the medical management (n = 26), and were published in the New England Journal of Medicine or Stroke (n = 25 each) journals. The median impact factor for the journals that published top-100 ischemic stroke citation classics was 9.11 (IQR 21.49-6.11).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our list of top-100 citation classics specific to ischemic stroke provide a detailed insight into academic achievements, historical perspective and serves as a guide for the scientific progress in stroke.

TI Perineural Spread of Melanoma to the Brachial Plexus: Identifying the
   Anatomic Pathway(s)

LA English
DT Article
DE Brachial plexus; Cervical plexus; Melanoma; Oncology; Perineural spread;
   Peripheral nerve
ID DESMOPLASTIC MELANOMA; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; HEAD; NECK
AB BACKGROUND: Perineural spread of melanoma is a well-known mechanism of metastasis in cases involving cranial nerves. Brachial plexus involvement is rare, and the pathway is unknown.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of the Mayo Clinic database was performed to identify patients with a history of melanoma and brachial plexus compromise treated between 1994 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were a history of melanoma, a clinical diagnosis of brachial plexopathy, radiologic features consistent with perineural spread, and biopsy of melanoma within nerves.
   RESULTS: We identified 42 patients (24 men and 18 women; median age, 61 years; range, 37-84 years) with a history of melanoma and brachial plexopathy. On a review of clinical information, 2 cases met our inclusion criteria. Both patients presented with progressive brachial plexopathy, and imaging studies revealed features consistent with perineural spread. In 40 excluded patients, brachial plexopathy was caused by metastasis to axillary lymph nodes (n = 11), trauma (n = 8), post-surgical sequelae (n = 7), tumors other than melanoma (n = 5), inflammation (n = 5), radiation (n = 2), a combination of radiation and postsurgical changes (n = 1), and radiculopathy (n = 1).
   CONCLUSIONS: The 2 patients identified had similar clinical and radiologic features. We believe that there is a pattern of perineural spread to the brachial plexus through the cervical plexus. A literature review identified several recently published cases demonstrating an analogous mechanism of melanoma spread involving upper cervical nerves, supporting our proposed pathway.

AB OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present prospective, randomized, single-blinded controlled study was to measure heat during bony decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis with high-speed drills and an ultrasonic bone-cutting knife.
   METHODS: Ninety patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis were included in this study and randomized for lumbar spinal canal decompression using either a highspeed drill with automatic irrigation, high-speed drill with manual irrigation, or an ultrasonic bone-cutting knife with automatic irrigation (USBCD). For evaluation of group homogeneity, a visual analog scale pain score and neurologic findings were measured preoperatively and post-operatively. Temperatures during bony decompression were measured using a forward-looking infrared camera system.
   RESULTS: Clinical results among the 3 groups did not differ in pain reduction, improvement of neurologic findings, or the rate of complications. However, significantly lower values were found for absolute and mean maximal temperatures during bony decompression in the USBCD group compared with the groups of patients who received the high-speed drill with automatic irrigation and the highspeed drill with manual irrigation, indicating this technique to be less aggressive in terms of thermal induction of bone necrosis. USBCD allows more precise bone removal compared with high-speed drills, and despite increased device time, no significant difference in the overall decompression time was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: All methods examined produced short temperature peaks with possible, at least temporary, damage to bone and neural tissue. Automatic irrigation was associated with lower heat development compared with manual irrigation. Despite evidence of critical temperatures, no clinical correlation (e.g., neurologic deficits) was encountered in this study. Clinically, all 3 methods presented equally good results.

AB OBJECTIVE: A three-dimensional reconstruction technique using the CustomBone (CB) prosthesis allows custom-made cranioplasty (CP) possessing osseointegration properties owing to its porous hydroxyapatite (HA) composition. This reconstruction technique has replaced less expensive techniques such as subcutaneously preserved autologous bone (SP). Our primary objective was to evaluate complications between CB and SP CP techniques. A secondary objective was to assess cosmetic results and osseointegration of CPs.
   METHODS: This single-center study comprised patients undergoing delayed CB or SP CP after craniectomy between 2007 and 2014. A prospective interview was conducted to collect all data, including 2-year follow-up clinical and radiologic data. Cosmetic results were assessed by a qualitative score, and osseointegration was assessed by measuring relative fusion at the CP margins.
   RESULTS: Of 100 patients undergoing CB or SP CP between 2007 and 2014, 92 (CB, n =44; SP, n =48) participated in the prospective interview. No significant difference in complication rates was observed between the 2 groups. The main complication specific to the CB group was fracture of the prosthesis observed in 20.8% patients. A higher rate of good cosmetic results was observed in the CB group (92.5% vs. 74.3%, P = 0.031). In the CB group, 51% of patients demonstrated no signs of bone fusion of the CP.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the CB prosthesis is associated with cosmetic advantages, the porous hydroxyapatite composition makes it fragile in the short-term and long-term, and effective osseointegration remains uncertain.

AB BACKGROUND: Within language function research, there is a shift of focus from cortical specialization to a more hodotopical view including subcortical fiber tracts in functional and oncologic considerations. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) is well established to visualize subcortical fiber tracts. Recently, a new technique has been developed using cortical regions mapped via repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as seed regions. This study investigates if rTMS-based DTI FT for language pathways is also feasible postoperatively and whether preoperative versus postoperative fiber changes correlate with changes and severity of the patients' aphasia grades.
   METHODS: rTMS-based DTI FT was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 24 patients with left hemispheric perisylvian tumors. Language pathways were analyzed individually preoperatively and postoperatively with 5 different settings of minimum fiber length and fractional anisotropy. Transient aphasia was defined as any new or worse language impairment caused by surgery that resolved within the regular 3-month follow-up interval. Because postoperative aphasia does not allow rTMS language mapping, preoperative rTMS data were used throughout.
   RESULTS: Patients with transient aphasia postoperatively had a significant reduction in fiber count compared with patients without deficit (321.5 +/- 242.8 fibers vs. 518.0 +/- 435.2 fibers; P = 0.01). Furthermore, in this patient group, the arcuate fascicle was lost postoperatively twice as often compared with patients with no deficit after surgery (52% vs. 26%; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rTMS-based DTI FT is feasible for postoperative examination of language pathways. Moreover, changes in preoperative versus postoperative fibers correlate well with the grade of aphasia.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to perform an integrative clinical and survival analysis for patients with coexisting glioma and intracranial aneurysm and to assess the influence of prognostic factors on overall survival (OS).
   METHODS: A systematic literature search on PubMed and Web of Science was performed for literature in English published from 1951 to August 2017. Detailed information including clinical characteristics, treatments, critical events, and time to events for survival analysis was extracted from the included articles. Clinical characteristics of included patients were reviewed, and survival analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors of OS.
   RESULTS: A total of 56 cases from 38 articles published in English-language journals were included in this study, and relative details were selected for integrative analysis. Univariate analysis demonstrated that age (<47/>= 47 years), ruptured aneurysm (yes/no), glioma type (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]/no GBM), World Health Organization (WHO) grade (low/high), and radiotherapy (yes/no) had a statistically significant correlation with OS (log-rank P = 0.004, P = 0.037, P = 0.004, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). Further, multivariate analysis revealed that WHO grade (hazard ratio [HR], 22.383; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.795-279.151; P = 0.016) and receiving radiotherapy (HR, 0.054; 95% CI, 0.009-0.333; P=0.002) were the independent prognostic factors for OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: This integrative survival analysis revealed that WHO grade and receiving radiotherapy were independent prognostic factors for OS, and patients with low-grade glioma and receiving radiotherapy had longer survival than counter groups. Nevertheless, similar clinical studies which should be larger samples, multicenter, and collaborative are needed further.

AB BACKGROUND: SERPINA1 plays an anti-inflammatory role in protecting tissues from proteolytic mechanisms. SERPINA1 is positive in gliomas by immunohistochemical analysis; however, the role of SERPINA1, including the relationship with prognosis, has been uncertain. In recent years, digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided ultra-sensitive assessment of messenger RNA expression from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study, we quantitatively determined the expression of SERPINA1 in high-grade gliomas (HGGs) using digital PCR, and we analyzed its relationship with prognosis.
   METHODS: Twenty-nine FFPE surgical samples from patients with HGGs (7 of World Health Organization [WHO] grade III and 22 of WHO grade IV), and human glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and U118, were used for analysis. A qualitative assessment using immunostaining and quantitative assessment using digital PCR were performed to assess the expression of SERPINA1.
   RESULTS: The expression of SERPINA1 was demonstrated in glioma tissues and glioblastoma multiforme cell lines by immunostaining. Digital PCR analysis showed that SERPINA1 was expressed in 14.3% and 63.6% of the tissues from patients with grade III and grade IV HGG, respectively (P = 0.035). The median overall survival of 38.8 months in the low SERPINA1 expression group was longer than that of 15.3 months in the high expression group (P = 0.030).
   CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and the amount of SERPINA1 expression were higher in grade IV than in grade III HGGs. The high expression of SERPINA1 indicates a poor prognosis of HGGs.

   MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm rupture might be accompanied by intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which is associated with poor outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors and clinical impact of IVH severity.
   METHODS: A total of 995 consecutive patients with SAH treated at our institution between January 2003 and June 2016 were eligible for this study. Clinical and radiologic findings were correlated with the presence and severity of IVH assessed with the original Graeb score.
   RESULTS: A total of 487 patients with SAH (48.9%) presented with IVH (mean IVH severity, 5.48 points [+/- 3.5]). IVH severity correlated with poorer initial clinical condition (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade > 3; P < 0.001), acute hydrocephalus (P = 0.001), and poor outcome at 6 months (modified Rankin Scale score > 2; P < 0.001). The location of the ruptured aneurysm in the anterior cerebral artery independently predicted the occurrence (P = 0.007) and severity of IVH (P < 0.001). In turn, aneurysm size affected only the severity of IVH (P = 0.001) but not its occurrence (P = 0.153). Early complications of SAH occurring within 72 hours after the bleeding event (cerebral infarction [P = 0.043], early mortality [P = 0.001], and primary craniectomy [P = 0.043]) were independently associated with the severity of IVH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Severity of aneurysmal IVH is a strong contributor to initial severity and early complications of SAH. Patients with larger aneurysms, especially located in the anterior cerebral artery, are at particular risk of severe IVH in cases of aneurysm rupture.

   PREVENTION; METHOTREXATE; TEMOZOLOMIDE
AB BACKGROUND: Epidural fibrosis is a challenging topic in spinal surgery. This phenomenon constitutes one of the main reasons behind postlaminectomy syndrome or failed back surgery syndrome, which leads to persistent back and leg pain in association with compression and/or stretching the nerve root or the dura. The exact mechanism of action in epidural fibrosis is complex and remains uncertain. Excessive deposition of collagen, fibronectin, and dermatan sulfate, known as the "extracellular matrix," and decrease of tissue cellularity results in epidural fibrosis. The most investigated and important actor in epidural fibrosis as well as in other forms of aberrant wound healing is presumed to be transforming growth factor-1 beta formation. Tamoxifen (TAM), a synthetic nonsteroidal antiestrogen used in breast cancer, is also effective in inhibiting fibroblast proliferation via downregulation of transforming growth factor-1 beta.
   METHODS: Twenty-four adult male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Laminectomy was the sole intervention in the control group. Spongostan was placed in the operation lodge after laminectomy in the second group. In the treatment group, TAM was administrated orally after laminectomy. Epidural fibrosis, dural thickness, inflammatory response, and arachnoidal involvement were evaluated and graded histopathologically.
   RESULTS: Epidural fibrosis, dural thickness, and inflammatory response in the subjects treated with TAM were significantly less than in the control and Spongostan group and the differences were statistically significant. Although arachnoidal involvement was observed in a subject in the TAM group, the differences between all groups weren't statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen reduced epidural fibrosis, dural thickness, and inflammatory response after laminectomy in rats.

AB BACKGROUND: Following a previous systematic review of currently available endoscope holders (EHs), we aspired to detect trends, task-specific preferences, and pitfalls of EH in various cranial neuroendoscopic procedures.
   METHODS: A questionnaire was disseminated to members of the International Federation of Neuroendoscopy. The questionnaire evaluated indications and pitfalls of EH in different applications, in particular, differentiating between intraventricular and skull base endoscopy, as well as subcategories of these 2 main fields. Furthermore, interest or involvement in research projects on EH was investigated.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two surgeons responded, with a broad geographic distribution represented. Most (54%) do not routinely use EH. Others use holders mainly for intraventricular rather than skull base procedures. Most surgeons (96%) regularly work with a co-surgeon. Reported weaknesses of EH included crude movements, downward drift, loss of depth perception, lack of flexibility, iatrogenic injury, cost, and bulky construct. There is still a lack of consensus on surgical indications. Tumor resections in intraventricular and skull base regions (not small sellar tumors) seem to stand out as good, widely accepted indications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although EH have a role in cranial neuroendoscopy, their use seems limited and their technical features are regarded as suboptimal by most neuroendoscopists. Weaknesses and implications were detected in all application categories (skull base and intraventricular) but may vary slightly. Potentially, separate systems with distinct features may be required for skull base versus intraventricular surgery. There is a need for further evolution of EH, which could lead to a future paradigm shift in their use.

AB BACKGROUND: The transciliary keyhole approach has been actively employed for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in many institutions, although applying this technique to ruptured aneurysms remains controversial. We investigated risk factors related to poor surgical outcomes in ruptured aneurysms and attempted to clarify the differences between conventional craniotomy and keyhole surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed at a single institution of medical records and images from surgeries of 188 patients who underwent keyhole surgery for ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms between July 2007 and February 2015.
   RESULTS: The study included 116 (62%) female and 72 (38%) male patients; age range was 23-86 years. Preoperative clinical grades were good in almost all patients except for a few patients with poor clinical grades. Mean aneurysm size was 5.5 mm, and the most common aneurysm location was the anterior communicating artery (n = 82). Most patients (n = 158; 91.5%) showed good clinical outcomes. Univariate analysis of risk factors associated with poor-grade outcomes after 3 months was performed. Hunt and Hess grade (odds ratio [OR] 13.50, P < 0.0001), World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies scale (OR 7.69, P < 0.0001), aneurysm size (OR 1.21, P = 0.019), and vasospasm (OR 6.43, P = 0.0003) were statistically significant, whereas Fisher grade, skin-to-skin time (operation time), rebleeding, and ventricle puncture were not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because incidence of poor surgical outcome of keyhole surgery is not different from known conventional craniotomy, this approach is an acceptable treatment option in a good-grade ruptured anterior circulation aneurysm.

AB BACKGROUND: We reviewed our clinical experience of patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) who gave birth and assessed characteristics of those experiencing neurologic deterioration.
   METHODS: The patients were classified into patients diagnosed with MMD during pregnancy and puerperium (group 1) and those diagnosed before pregnancy (group 2). We retrospectively reviewed patient characteristics, MMD treatment, neurologic symptoms before and during pregnancy and/after puerperium, obstetrical history, and delivery type in groups 1 and 2.
   RESULTS: Group 1 included 2 patients with deterioration of pre-existing transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and acute cerebral infarction and 1 patient with seizures and newly developed TIAs during pregnancy and/or puerperium. Group 2 included 20 patients with 23 pregnancies. In group 2, 4 patients had deterioration of TIAs during pregnancy and puerperium. There were significant differences between the cases without neurologic deterioration and with deterioration in group 2 (TIAs >= 10 before pregnancy, 0% vs. 75%, P = 0.002; severely reduced regional cerebrovascular reserve on single-photon emission computed tomography, 10.5% vs. 100%, P = 0.002; and surgical revascularization before pregnancy, 75% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.04). In groups 1 and 2, 6 of the 7 cases in which TIAs occurred or worsened during pregnancy or puerperium recovered to prepregnancy TIA levels after puerperium.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severely reduced regional cerebrovascular reserve on single-photon emission computed tomography and frequent TIAs before pregnancy may experience neurologic deterioration during pregnancy, delivery, and puerperium. Surgical revascularization before pregnancy may decrease neurologic deterioration during these periods.

AB OBJECTIVE: The petrosquamosal sinus (PSS) is clinically important as it represents a potential hemorrhagic hazard during neurosurgical procedures. This double-approach radiologic study and meta-analysis aimed to assess the imaging characteristics of the PSS on computed tomography (CT) and systematically analyze its prevalence to improve imaging accuracy and assist in neurosurgical management.
   METHODS: The retrospective radiologic study included CT scans of 388 patients aged 18 years or older. All patients with any visible intracranial pathologies or history of head trauma were excluded. To identify articles eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis, an extensive search was conducted through PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and CNKI. Data extracted included investigative method, prevalence of the PSS among subjects, ethnicity, gender, side, laterality, and mean diameter. The extracted data were pooled into a meta-analysis with a random-effects model.
   RESULTS: The radiologic study showed that the PSS was visualized in 25.5% of the sides examined, that it was slightly more common among females (27.5%) than males (23.8%) and on the left (21.7%) than the right (29.4%). Its mean diameter was 1.14 +/- 0.58 mm. The meta-analysis revealed that the overall prevalence of the PSS in the population is 11.1%, that it is more common in females (27.4%) than males (17.6%), and that a unilateral PSS is more common (78.2%) than a bilateral one (21.8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: As a PSS is present in about one tenth of the population, it is important to consider the possibility that it is present when undertaking neurosurgical procedures and to assess preoperative CT scans to avoid complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with brain tumors, particularly gliomas, commonly present with seizures. Higher incidence of seizure has been reported in low-grade gliomas and tumors located within the temporal and insular area. The association between IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with preoperative seizures in glioma and the magnitude of this association in low-grade versus high-grade gliomas are unclear. To clarify this relationship, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.
   METHODS: Following accepted guidelines and systematic review recommendations, electronic searches were performed in journal databases up to May 2017. Data were extracted and pooled via meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: We compared 782 patients with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with 803 patients with wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 before surgery. There was a significant difference in seizure incidence between the IDH1 mutation group (61.6%) and wild-type IDH1 group (32.1%) (odds ratio 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-6.02; I-2 = 73%; P = 0.01). Similar findings were observed in analysis of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations (odds ratio 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-4.33; I-2 = 58%; P < 0.0001). The difference remained in both mutation groups (IDH1, IDH1 and IDH2) with grade II gliomas but not with grade III and IV gliomas. Patients with grade II gliomas showed a higher rate of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and seizures than patients with grade III and IV gliomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a significant association of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with incidence of preoperative seizures. This association was significant only in patients with low-grade glioma (grade II) and not in patients with higher grade gliomas (grade III and IV).
