AB We present a fluctuating boundary integral method (FBIM) for overdamped Brownian Dynamics (BD) of two-dimensional periodic suspensions of rigid particles of complex shape immersed in a Stokes fluid. We develop a novel approach for generating Brownian displacements that arise in response to the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary integral formulation of a mobility problem in which a random surface velocity is prescribed on the particle surface, with zero mean and covariance proportional to the Green's function for Stokes flow (Stokeslet). This approach yields an algorithm that scales linearly in the number of particles for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, handles particles of complex shape, achieves high order of accuracy, and can be generalized to three dimensions and other boundary conditions. We show that Brownian displacements generated by our method obey the discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance relation (DFDB). Based on a recently-developed Positively Split Ewald method Fiore et al. (2017) [24], near-field contributions to the Brownian displacements are efficiently approximated by iterative methods in real space, while far-field contributions are rapidly generated by fast Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. FBIM provides the key ingredient for time integration of the overdamped Langevin equations for Brownian suspensions of rigid particles. We demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium BD simulations of suspensions of starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal integrator. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Random Walk (RW) is a common numerical tool for modeling the Advection-Diffusion equation. In this work, we develop an improved scheme for incorporating a heterogeneous reaction (i.e., a Robin boundary condition) in a discrete-time RW model. In addition, we apply the approach in two test cases. We compare the improved scheme with the classical as well as with analytical and other numerical solution. We show that the new scheme can reduce the computational error significantly, relative to the first order scheme. This reduction comes at no additional computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Recently the concept of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) has been introduced with very encouraging results for the purpose of modelling the unclosed tensors in the context of RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) turbulence modelling. This paper extends the previous framework to modelling subgrid stresses (SGS) in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). In order to achieve this goal the GEP algorithm was coupled with an external multiprocessor postprocessing tool that evaluates a cost function based on a-priori analysis of explicitly filtered DNS data of turbulent premixed planar flames. Although LES of combustion systems is becoming increasingly popular, the closures for sub-grid scale (SGS) stresses have mostly been derived assuming constant density flows. However, it has been shown recently that depending on the relative strength of heat release and turbulence, counter-gradient transport can occur for the stress tensor if the isotropic part is not properly accounted for. The focus of this work is not to put forward a particular new model but to demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can successfully be used in the framework of LES modelling. To achieve this purpose the GEP software is used for modelling the deviatoric stress, the trace of the SGS tensor and the stress tensor itself. Although the functional form of the model was not imposed, the evolutionary algorithm did find a well known model from the literature with even the model constants comparable to values reported in the literature.

AB Peridynamics is a non-local based method and an extension of classical continuum theory that has been proved to have the ability to solve problems involving discontinuities. This work extends the state-based Peridynamic formulation to describe heat transfer process in the adjacent regions via using the domain decomposition technique. The state-based Peridynamic heat conduction model is proposed to couple with a generalized thermal diffusion model in a two-field form, in which both the temperature and the thermal flux are treated as the primary variables. Coupled with thermal interface conditions, the proposed two-field state-based Peridynamic heat conduction naturally leads to a classical differential algebraic equation, which permits the numerical simulations of thermal contacts between various diffusion models. A unified time integration, termed as generalized single step single solve (GS4), is extended to solve the resulting differential algebraic equations. Numerical results of the simulations are reported and compared with those obtained by Finite Element Method which show that the method is promising for these applications in terms of accurately capturing the physics and preserving the interface conditions.

AB A Lagrangian incompressible fluid flow model is extended by including an implicit surface tension term in order to analyze droplet dynamics. The Lagrangian framework is adopted to model the fluid and track its boundary, and the implicit surface tension term is used to introduce the appropriate forces at the domain boundary. The introduction of the tangent matrix corresponding to the surface tension force term ensures enhanced stability of the derived model. Static, dynamic and sessile droplet examples are simulated to validate the model and evaluate its performance. Numerical results are capable of reproducing the pressure distribution in droplets, and the advancing and receding contact angles evolution for droplets in varying substrates and inclined planes. The model is stable even at time steps up to 20 times larger than previously reported in literature and achieves first and second order convergence in time and space, respectively. The present implicit surface tension implementation is applicable to any model where the interface is represented by a moving boundary mesh. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Predictive analysis of complex computational models, such as uncertainty quantification (UQ), must often rely on using an existing database of simulation runs. In this paper we consider the task of performing low-multilinear-rank regression on such a database. Specifically we develop and analyze an efficient gradient computation that enables gradient-based optimization procedures, including stochastic gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods, for learning the parameters of a functional tensor-train (FT). We compare our algorithms with 22 other nonparametric and parametric regression methods on 10 real-world data sets and show that for many physical systems, exploiting low-rank structure facilitates efficient construction of surrogate models. We use a number of synthetic functions to build insight into behavior of our algorithms, including the rank adaptation and group-sparsity regularization procedures that we developed to reduce overfitting. Finally we conclude the paper by building a surrogate of a physical model of a propulsion plant on a naval vessel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Glass-ceramics are noted for their unusual combination of properties and manifold commercialized products for consumer and specialized markets. Evolution of novel glass and ceramic processing routes, a plethora of new compositions, and unique exotic nano- and microstructures over the past 60 years led us to review the definition of glass-ceramics. Well-established and emerging processing methods, such as co-firing, additive manufacturing, and laser patterning are analyzed concerning the core requirements of processing glass-ceramics and the performance of the final products. In this communication, we propose a revised, updated definition of glass-ceramics, which reads "Glass-ceramics are inorganic, non-metallic materials prepared by controlled crystallization of glasses via different processing methods. They contain at least one type of functional crystalline phase and a residual glass. The volume fraction crystallized may vary from ppm to almost 100%".

AB In classical nucleation theory, the thermodynamic driving force of crystallization is computed by comparing the bulk properties of the liquid and crystal phases for the respective macroscopic samples. Such approach represents a reasonable approximation as far as the bulk properties of the critical clusters do not deviate significantly from the properties of the newly evolving macroscopic phases. However, in general, this assumption is not true and may lead to incorrect results. As one consequence, the classical approach utilizing, in addition, the capillarity approximation overestimates as a rule the work of critical cluster formation and underestimates the steady-state nucleation rate. Based on a generalization of the classical Gibbs' approach, the basic equations are formulated here allowing one a correct determination of the properties of the critical clusters and of the work of critical cluster formation. In this way, a new tool for the quantitative description of crystal nucleation has been advanced retaining the advantages of the classical treatment but avoiding its shortcomings. Several general consequences are discussed. In particular, it is demonstrated that this method opens a new perspective in the interpretation of possible effects of atomic-scale structure of the melts on the rate of crystal nucleation.

AB General relations for the dependence of the thermodynamic driving force of crystallization and the specific interfacial energy melt-crystal of critical crystal clusters on temperature and pressure are derived. Its application to the analysis of experimental data on crystal nucleation seems to support at a first glance a proposal by Kauzmann on the existence of a pseudo-spinodal curve in melt-crystallization. Provided this assumption is true, Kauzmann temperature (and for pressure-induced nucleation, the Kauzmann pressure) cannot be reached by a metastable liquid due to intensive crystallization processes occurring in its vicinity. However, such suggestion cannot be retained taking into account the kinetic terms (diffusion coefficients, viscosity) in the expression for the nucleation rate. The absence of a pseudo-spinodal in melt-crystallization can be verified also in an alternative way by considering the characteristic time scales of crystallization and relaxation. Finally, it is shown that the phenomenon denoted commonly as Kauzmann paradox is merely an untypical as compared to normal conditions type of behavior. Neither in its original formulation nor in its consequences it results in any contradictions with basic laws of nature. They are prevented either by normal (not associated with a pseudo-spinodal) crystallization or a conventional glass transition.

AB Recently, we have developed the borosilicate glass, in which ZrO2 phase is singly crystallizable, and has found an emissive monoclinic ZrO2 dendrites in the resulting GCs. In order to promote the formation of monoclinic phase, we have examined the effect of substitution of alumina Al2O3 for ZrO2 in the precursor glass composition, i.e., 15Na(2)O-(15 - x)ZrO2-xAl(2)O(3)-30B(2)O(3)-40SiO(2). It was found that the substitution of small amount of Al2O3 (x = 1) gave a positive effect, i.e., increase in the amount of monoclinic phase and decrease in the crystal size. Furthermore, the substitution improved the internal quantum-yield. On the other hand, the further substitution (x >= 2) provided the decrease in amount of the monoclinic phase.

AB The influence of low-frequency vibrational treatment on the crystallization of basalt wool fibers was studied. In this work, three series of samples were investigated. The first sample set was only one-sided heated at temperatures from 300 degrees C to 900 degrees C for 24 h. The second sample set was after only vibrational treatment with a frequency of 50 Hz and oscillations amplitude of 1 mm for 6-48 h. The third sample set was after simultaneous treatment of one-sided heating and vibration at temperatures from 300 degrees C to 600 degrees C with a frequency of 50 Hz and oscillations amplitude of 1 mm for 24 h. It is shown that at temperatures close to the glass transition temperature, vibration can influence on the relaxation processes in glasses and accelerate them. Mechanism of glass structure transformation in the basalt fiber does not change, but it starts at a slightly lower temperature. That is a consequence of an additional low-energy vibrational treatment. The vibrational treatment intensifies the crystallization process in basalt fibers and decreases the service temperature of the material by at least 40-50 degrees C.

Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed to study crystallization behavior. Additionally, experiments were performed on pressed glass pellets and drops of molten glass. The specimens were heat-treated at different temperatures for different dwell times and finally quenched. The microstructure was analyzed for a cross section of the samples using scanning electron microscopy and the chemical composition was characterized using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Combined with high-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements, it was possible to identify the predominant crystalline phases: binary barium silicates, walstromite, celsian, and itsiite.

In this study, we prepared twelve different samples: three different compositions (BTGx; x = 50, 55 and 60), two different melting temperatures (1250 and 1550 degrees C), and with/without crystallization process. The crystallization phenomenon was confirmed by XRD analysis. In photoluminescence spectra, only one broad emission peak at 520 nm was observed in the glass samples, while another peak was observed in glass-ceramic samples at 450 nm in addition to 520 nm peak. The similar tendency was also observed in X-ray induced scintillation spectra. According to the crystallization, the scintillation efficiency was enhanced.

AB We have investigated photoluminescence (PL) and scintillation properties of 30BaO-15TiO(2)-(55-x)GeO2-xSiO(2) (BTGSx: x = 0, 13.75, 25, 30, 41.25 and 55) glasses and glass-ceramics prepared by the conventional melt quenching method. In the PL spectra of all the samples, an emission band was observed around 490 nm. In addition, another emission band was detected around 530 nm in the BTGS30, BTGS25, BTGS13.75 and BTG55 glass-ceramics. From the PL decay time constants, the emission bands at 490 and 530 nm were confirmed to be due to the T-3(1)-(1)A(1) transition of Ti4+ ions and E-2-T-2(2g) transition of Ti3+ ions, respectively. The quantum yields of all the glass-ceramics were higher than those of the glasses of the same chemical compositions. In scintillation spectra, all the samples showed emission peaks similarly seen in PL. The scintillation intensities of the glass ceramics were higher than those of the glasses of the same chemical compositions.

The SBNP glasses were prepared by a conventional melt-quenching method. The obtained glasses were annealed at various temperatures and holding times for nucleation and growth of nanocrystallites. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that samples were either glass or glass-ceramic containing Sr0.5Ba0.5Nb2O6 nanocrystallites, and heat treatments at higher temperatures and longer holding times have promoted the crystallization. Furthermore, radioluminescence and TL intensities were higher for the glass-ceramics than glass; thus, efficient luminescence can be yielded in glass-ceramics.

AB Transparent sodium lutetium fluoride aluminosilicate glasses and glass-ceramics were prepared by the melting quenching method. The glasses were doped with 0.5 mol% Er3+ and 0.5Er(3+)-xYb(3+) (x = 2, 4 mol%) to obtain efficient up-conversion (UC) emission, as well as infrared emission at similar to 1.0 and 1.5 mu m. After suitable thermal treatment, transparent glass-ceramics with cubic NaLuF4 nanocrystals ranging from 10 to 50 nm were obtained. The crystallization process was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed the incorporation of rare-earth (RE) ions into the nanocrystals. The luminescent features of the near-infrared emission spectra of Er3+ and Yb3+ in the co-doped samples demonstrated efficient energy transfer between both ions. The presence of Yb3+ greatly enhanced the UC emission in the co-doped samples and tuned the emission from green to yellow. These effects were more pronounced for the glass-ceramics, confirming the incorporation of RE ions in the nanocrystals. The possible UC processes and mechanisms leading to population of S-4(3/2) and F-4(9/2) excited levels are discussed.

AB We report on a non-ferroelectric, piezoelectric polar glass-ceramic specifically targeted for high-temperature sensor use (T > 300 degrees C). Potential applications include accelerometers for turbine engines and in-cylinder pressure sensors for diesel engines. Choice of an alkali-free, Sr-fresnoite (Sr2TiSi2O8) + added SiO2 bulk composition led to desirably high electrical resistivity while maintaining good piezoelectric sensitivity. Piezoelectric properties are highly competitive with existing high-temperature single crystals and ceramics, consisting of d(33) = 10, d(31) = 1.5, and d(15) = 34 (pC/N). Support for the high value of the shear mode d15 coefficient comes from both direct measurement as well as consideration of the expected variation in effective d33 due to deviation in perfect (001) crystalline alignment, as demonstrated in this system by Wisniewski et al. (2012). Due to the low dielectric permittivity in this system (epsilon(T)(33)/epsilon(0) = 11.5; epsilon(T)(11)/epsilon(0) = 16.5, both at 1 kHz), the voltage coefficients are quite high: g(33) = 103, g(31) = 15, and g(15) = 233 (x 10(-3) V m/N). The room-temperature pyroelectric coefficient p(3) of +8 mu C/m(2)/degrees C is followed by a hysteretic peak, though repeatable, near 175 degrees C, attaining -70 mu C/m(2)/degrees C, but by 250 degrees C, p(3) has returned to low levels and passes through zero around 275 degrees C. Of crucial particular importance for high-temperature applications is high electrical resistivity, well exemplified by this material, with p similar to 10(12) Omega-cm at 300 degrees C and 10(6) at 850 degrees C; higher levels of resistivity can be obtained through use of raw materials with lower levels of alkali contaminants. The combination of high electrical resistivity coupled with good piezoelectric sensitivity and the lack of a Curie temperature, with its associated aging effects, makes Srfresnoite glass-ceramics a realistic contender in the technically-challenging field of high-temperature piezoelectric materials.

AB In this study, the effect of Hf addition on the glass formation ability (GFA), micro structural, thermal and magnetic properties were investigated in the Fe-B-Cu alloy with high saturation magnetization (M-s). It is found that the addition of Hf is beneficial for improving GFA of (Fe86B13Cu1)(100) - Hf-x(x) Alloys. The melt-spun ribbons at x = 0.75 and x = 1.0 show an entirely amorphous structure by x-ray diffraction and have two obvious separated exothermic peaks on DSC curves, Hf element plays a positive role on postponing the first crystallization and improved the thermal stability of the amorphous Fe-B-Cu-Hf alloys. As x = 0.75, the melt-spun ribbon has a higher apparent activation energy of Fe3B phase than of the ribbon at x = 1.0, and the first crystallization is easier than the second crystallization. Therefore it was easy to obtain an alpha-Fe/amorphous dual phases structure alloy ribbons with few or without Fe3B phase by a suitable annealing process near peak temperature of the first crystallization. After annealing, the saturation magnetization (M-s) was tested by vibrating sample magnetometer, and the value of x = 0.75 changes slightly first, then increase obviously and reach the maximum 220 emu/g at 750 K higher T-p2. This alloy shows a good glass forming ability and a high saturation magnetization.

AB The recently confirmed monolayer ferromagnet CrI3 is a frisky example of a two-dimensional ferromagnetic material with great application potential in van der Waals heterostructures. Here we present a soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of the magnetic bulk properties of CrI3, giving insight into the magnetic coupling scenario which is relevant for understanding its thickness-dependent magnetic properties. The experimental Cr L-2,L-3 X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra show a good agreement with calculated spectra for a hybridized ground state. In this high-spin Cr ground state the Cr-I bonds show a strongly covalent character. This is responsible for the strong superexchange interaction and increased spin-orbit coupling, resulting in the large magnetic anisotropy of the two-dimensionally layered CrI3 crystal.

AB The phase constitution, the microstructural growth behavior, and the anti-indentation performance of 2Cr13 thin-wall part were successfully tailored through inter-layer dwelling time alteration using cold metal transfer (CMT) technology. The short inter-layer dwelling time induced the presence of a low amount of gamma-Fe phase, as well as extremely elongated ferrite grains containing ultrafine needle-shaped martensite throughout the entire part. This finally led to a narrow fluctuation in microhardness. The long dwelling time contributed to the alpha-Fe phase formation only and a periodic microhardness trendline, which was related to a periodic microstructure featured by martensite laths within the block-shaped ferrite matrix. This method, in an intentional manner, could be adopted to manufacture a particular component with local properties that are altered with location through a single material deposition.

AB Bioactive glass coatings were deposited for the first time onto wood-derived biocarbon scaffolds using the sol-gel technique. The cellular pore structure of the beech wood was retained during the sol-gel coating process. Owing to the presence of the bioactive glass layer, the originally bioinert biocarbon scaffold was fully covered with newly-formed hydroxyapatite (HA) upon soaking in simulated body fluid. The ability to form HA is generally accepted as the proof of in vitro bioactivity. This opens up the possible application of wood-derived scaffolds in biomedicine (bone repair) and biotechnology.

AB Hydrothermal method is widely used to fabricate metal oxide films with various morphology. CuWO4 is promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical conversion of light into chemical fuels. In this report, we report that CuWO4 films on FTO substrate are hydrothermally synthesized by introducing a seeding layer without which only mixed phases of CuO and WO3 are obtained under the moderate temperature (180 degrees C) reaction conditions. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the photoactivity of the CuWO4 is dependent on the concentration of the hydrothermal solution. Tuning the composition of reaction solution into W-rich resulted WO3-CuWO4 composite film which exhibits much improved photoelectrochemical performance due to enhanced charge separation.

AB A unique three dimensional Ag/Ag3PO4/CeO2 with Z-scheme structure was constructed and applied in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under visible light, demonstrating superior performance in yielding CH3OH (42.5 mu mol gcat(-1)) and C2H5OH (31.5 mu mol gcat(-1)). During the photocatalysis, CeO2 microspheres provide abundant pores for loading Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, ensuring the stability of the light sensitizers. Furthermore, there is an inner electric field formed between Ag3PO4 and CeO2 with Ag working as e -h(+) quenching bridge. Benefited from the high conductivity of Ag, the combination between holes in CeO2 VB and electrons in Ag3PO4 CB can be promoted, enabling the formation of Z-scheme structure and leaving plenty of electrons in CeO2 host for CO2 reduction. Moreover, CeO2 as a basic metal oxide can transform inert linear CO2 to b-HCO3 and b-CO32 species to decline reductive potential of CO2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The CeO2 core-shell hollow nanospheres with a diameter of about 800 nm have been successfully synthesized by adjusting heating rate of self-templated calcination in a facile hydrothermal route. Various techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, Raman spectra, PL spectra were employed to study the obtained CeO2 samples. With the decrease of heating rate, the morphology of the obtained CeO2 samples gradually transforms from solid spherical to core-shell spherical structure. It is found that a number of Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies arise in the obtained CeO2 core-shell hollow nanospheres with a cubic fluorite structure, which can account for their similar broad emission bands of photoluminescence. The emission intensity of their PL spectra has obvious difference, several factors, such as morphology, structure and size of samples could be all work for this result. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transparent and conductive aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films were developed using a sol-gel method and annealed in 95 N-2/5 H-2 forming gas. The pressure effects of forming gas on the structural and electrical properties, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. XPS analysis reveals that the fraction of the chemisorbed oxygen in the annealed film in 0.01 MPa 95 N-2/5 H-2 did not exhibit any apparent change compared to the non-annealed films, while the oxygen vacancy content exhibited a remarkable increase. When pressure goes up to 0.03 MPa, significant changes of both the oxygen vacancy concentration and the chemisorbed oxygen content were observed in the annealed films. At 0.03 MPa, the films displayed a perfect orientation along the c-axis and exhibited the lowest resistivity of 1.6 x 10(-3) Omega.cm. Our study shows that it is possible to optimize the oxygen distribution and improve the electrical property of AZO film by adjustment of the forming gas pressure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The data show that release of hydrogen on Mg anode was mainly associated with exposed Mg. Meanwhile, the differences in anodic HE behaviors obtained with two exposure methods indicate that hydrogen was predominantly generated via chemical reaction between Mg and electrolyte on Mg anode surface.

AB We report the improved performance of graphene oxide (GO) based resistive random-access memory devices (ReRAM) through mild hydrogen plasma treatment. The threshold voltage of the ReRAM device is successfully reduced from 2.6 to 1.8 V together with an enhanced ON/OFF ratio of 10(3) with the help of hydrogen plasma treated GO (HGO). Significantly, the rise of a weak 2D band in Raman spectrum of HGO reveals the mild reduction of GO by H-2 plasma. The concurrent removal of oxygen moieties on basal plane and on edges of graphitic network in GO by the virtue of H-2 plasma is argued to contribute enhanced performance in ReRAM devices. The significant diminution of oxygen moieties on GO lattice in HGO infused device reduces the insulating barrier formed at Al/GO interface which reinforced the electron transport. The effective selection of plasma treatment is found to be one of the proficient routes to enhance the storage capabilities of GO based resistive memory devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe the synthesis of ca. 3 nm cysteamine and glutathione-coated luminescent gold nanoparticles (CG-AuNPs) using a one-pot mild reduction method; resulting nanoparticles were extensively characterized. Fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements indicate the synthesized gold nanoparticles exhibit excellent stability at physiological pH and high ionic strength. We demonstrate that these nanoparticles can act as highly sensitive and selective dualmodality sensors of Cu2+ ions under physiologically-relevant conditions. Limits of detection were determined to be 18.2 nM (fluorescence) and 19.6 nM (DLS), respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SiO2 porous ceramic membrane was prepared through phase inversion tape casting and pressureless sintering method. Flower-like Si2N2O nanowires was in-situ formed on the surface of the SiO2 membrane, in NH3 atmosphere, through vapor-solid (VS) process. Once modified by inorganic SiNCO film, superhydrophobicity of the membrane with a water contact angle (WCA) of 160 degrees was achieved, which showed high chemical and thermal stability. The prepared membrane had a very good performance in membrane distillation (MD) experiments, with water flux as 11.11 L.m (2.)h (1) and >99.9% salt rejection for 4 wt% NaCl aqueous solution at 90 degrees C, which was kept stable in harsh conditions.

AB Amorphous red phosphorus modified ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) hollow spheres were synthesized via a simple onestep hydrothermal method. The P-modified ZIS exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation, and 1 wt% P-ZIS were found to be the optimal performance for both the H-2 evolution and X3B degradation. Moreover, the reason for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity was discussed in detail, which is the addition of P not only can broaden the response range of the catalyst in the visible light wavelength range, but also promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes.

ID FAR-INFRARED ABSORPTION
AB Polypropylene-high energy proton irradiated silicon composite was prepared by hot pressing. The dielectric properties of the composite was measured at both low and microwave frequency range up to 45.9 GHz. The composite has a relative permittivity of 3.7 at 5 and 15 GHz but decreased to 2.82 at 45.9 GHz. The loss tangent decreased from 3.36 x 10(-3) to 1.7 x 10(-3) with increase in frequency in the same frequency range whereas the reported polymer-ceramic composites show an increasing trend in loss factor. The decreasing trend of the loss tangent with increasing frequency indicates the possibility of its use in high frequency applications such as IOT and 5G. The composite containing 30 vol% of high energy proton irradiated high resistivity Si has a relative permittivity of 2.82 and loss tangent 0.0017 at 45.9 GHz. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of polypropylene decreased from 140 to 60 ppm/degrees C and the composite has a thermal conductivity of 0.95 W/mK. The thermal conductivity of polypropylene (0.22) has increased by about 331% by the addition of 30 vol% of high resistivity silicon powder. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nature-inspired structures as transparent conducting electrodes are exciting alternatives to conventional TCEs because they provide higher transmittance and conductivity at low temperatures on flexible substrates. The current work is focussed to develop a metal mesh structure with the help of plant leaf vein as a template. Bilayer metal mesh of thickness < 100 nm was deposited and transferred to flexible plastic substrate at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to obtain the ratio of open area space and covered space of the electrodes. The bilayer metal mesh structure shows high optical transmittance (>85%) and electrical resistivity of the order of 10(-4) Omega cm. The metal mesh TCE based on leaf vein template opens up new ways of obtaining large charge transfer resolving the junction resistance problem encountered in case of metal nanowires.

AB Herein, for the first time we attempt to use graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as a cathode for magnesium ion batteries. We demonstrate a simple electrochemical technique to synthesise GNP-Mg composites and modify its structure using heat treatment similar to 600 degrees C (H-GNP-Mg). Their structures were evaluated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and elemental distribution determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). GNP and H-GNP-Mg cathodes deliver a high specific capacity of similar to 387/170, and 179/165 mAh/g for the 1st cycle and 2nd cycle, respectively. This work illustrates that GNP's feature high conductivity and surface areas which make them promising cathode candidates for magnesium batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reduced graphene oxide/graphitic carbon nitride composite (rGO/g-C3N4) was ultra-rapidly obtained via microwave irradiation using GO and melamine as raw materials, carbon fiber as microwave absorber, respectively. Results of structural investigation indicated that the rGO/g-C3N4 heterostructures was successfully set up with the blend of rGO and g-C3N4, and the existence of rGO hadn't disrupted the lattice structure of g-C3N4. The pseudo-first order kinetic constant of Rhodamine B (RhB) photodegraded by rGO/g-C3N4 under visible light was 2.86 times as large as that of g-C3N4, which could be mainly ascribed to the more efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs caused by the synergistic effect of rGO and g-C3N4.

Different from previous reports which usually synthesized Cs4PbBr6 in the forms of colloidal nanocrystals, powder or bulk crystal, here we proposed a facile method of growing highly-luminescent Cs4PbBr6 microcrystals on substrate. The obtained sample shown high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of about 48.9%. Through adjusting the growth condition, hexagonal and novel flower-like highlyluminescent Cs4PbBr6 microcrystals can be obtained. This kind of one-step synthesis of highlyluminescent Cs4PbBr6 microcrystals with ultra-high PLQY could be applied in the related integrated photonics and optoelectronic devices.

AB Novel microporous carbon materials (DCMC) with excellent electron conductivity and ultrahigh surface area (1896.9 m(2) g (1)) are successfully prepared from discarded clothes. The porous carbon-encapsulated sulfur composites were synthesized by a feasible melting process and used as host materials for lithium sulfur batteries. Because of the unique microporous, ultrahigh surface area and irregular wrinkled surface coexisting structure, the resulting microporous carbon/sulfur (DCMC/S) composite cathode possesses a good rate capability and long-term cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity of the DCMC2/S composite electrode with 74.3 wt% sulfur content is 1082.6 mAh g (1) at a current rate of 0.2 C. At a higher current rate of 1 C, it possesses excellent cyclic performance and retained a capacity of 422.8 mAh g (1) after 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.11% per cycle. The coulombic efficiency remains over 98% during cycling. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two immiscible metals (W and Cu) were deposited using two metallic targets by GLAD co-sputtering. A wet chemical etching technique was implemented to remove the copper and modify the typical inclined microstructure into a more porous architecture. The electrical resistivity behavior of the co-sputtered W-Cu film was characterized as a function of temperature before and after wet chemical etching. The results show that the columnar microstructure exhibits metallic-like electrical properties. The average DC electrical resistivity rho changes from 1.66 x 10 (5) Omega m to 4.28 x 10 (5) Omega m after etching. The anisotropy at room temperature is A = 1.8 +/- 0.1 for as-deposited W-Cu film and reaches 2.8 +/- 0.1 after the etching procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels with a porous microstructure and good swelling behavior were fabricated via lyophilization and cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). Platelet adhesion studies revealed that platelets easily adhered to hydrogels while coagulation studies showed rapid blood aggregate formation. In-vitro cytotoxicity studies showed ECM hydrogels are biocompatible. In-vivo studies using rat tail bleeding and rabbit arterial injury showed ECM hydrogels' ability in hemostasis. ECM hydrogels formed a physical barrier and activated platelets that resulted in rapid thrombin formation during in-vivo application. The present study revealed ECM hydrogels could be a potential biomaterial for hemostat application. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, complex drug-cellulose acetate (CA) composite films were designed and fabricated possessing pre-determined grid spacing for inter-connected fibrous films. Ibuprofen (IBU) was selected as the active ingredient and grid spacing was varied between 300 and 500 mu m (fiber diameter similar to 35 lm) for various geometries. Process parameter impact on fiber morphology and deposition was investigated. FTIR confirmed IBU encapsulation and XRD analysis indicated the drug was dispersed (amorphous) in films. Inter-connected grid void geometry was shown to impact water contact behavior, and drug release mechanism was shown to be Fickian diffusion. Furthermore, drug release rate depended on geometry of engineered structures. The findings suggest a spatial design approach for modulated drug release from bespoke drug delivery dosage forms.

AB Perovskite nanocrystal with good environmental stability is one of the most urgent problems to be solved in practical applications. Herein we report a fast facile polymer-assisted synthesis of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (denoted as IPNCs) with environmental stability. The IPNCs with tunable bandgap and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (52%-93%) can be fabricated within 10 s at room temperature. The Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer here not only directly acts as a ligand and reaction sites to confine the nucleation and crystal growth of IPNCs, but also facilitate the preparation of highly luminescent IPNCs-based film with superior water resistance. We also demonstrate its potential application in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) by combining green and red IPNCs-based film with a blue LED chips. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brookite is the least studied TiO2, and its modification for improved photocatalytic activity remains a challenge because of the difficulties encountered in obtaining its pure form. Here, we report for the first time visible-light-active brookite (BT) nanorods with a high specific surface area and a large amount of oxygen vacancies, which are synthesized via a simple, one-step, surfactant-free, wet-chemical method. The oxygen vacancies of the BT nanorods facilitate absorption of visible light, and the absorption property could be tailored by post-annealing, without any significant change in the surface area and anisotropic morphology. BT nanorods annealed at 300 degrees C show superior photocatalytic activity compared to anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and other visible-light-active photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The physical and electrochemical performances are investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical tests. The Na3V2(PO4)(3)/C nanorods displayed an excellent sodium storage performance. For example, it showed an initial capacity of 107 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C and retained almost 100% of the initial capacity at the 100th cycle. Moreover, the discharge capacity was up to 30 mA h g(-1) at 30 C, suggesting a high rate capability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Scholars have attached increasing attention to Graphene nanosheet (hereinafter referred to as GNS)-loaded transition metal oxide composites owing to the ability of attaching inorganic nanoparticles with better capacity and capacitance and better capacity than GNS of conductive polymer materials. A novel mesoporous structure of NiO nanoplates encapsulated in graphene matrix was synthesized and designed rationally. The composite composed of GNS and mesoporous NiO nanoplates can expand the approximate specific surface area of electrolyte. It has various advantages, such as good charge transport and short ion diffusion path. In addition, the interconnected graphene conducting network, as an adhesive, can maintain structural stability and promote charge transport by encapsulating mesoporous NiO nanoplates. The specific capacity is increased to 1050 F g(-1) through the improved optimized NiO/GNS hybrid electrodes. This study provides a new idea for the design and manufacture of high performance transition metal oxide energy storage devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we demonstrate a facile synthesis of CDs-MoS2-Fe3O4 nanohybrid composites as an efficient photocatalyst to enhance the removal of dyes from wastewater. Detailed characterization through SEM, TEM, EDAS, UV-vis, XRD, FT-IR and VSM confirmed the synthesis of thin MoS2 nanosheets and the formation of the nanohybrid composites. As a result, CDs-MoS2-Fe3O4 exhibits excellent reusability through magnetic separation and its degradation rate of methylene blue as high as 96.8% with few additions of materials (25 mu g/ml). The ultrahigh photocatalytic performance and chemical stability, accompanied with this facile and simple synthetic process, promising CDs-MoS2-Fe3O4 as a low-cost, ultrahigh-performance and robust photocatalyst in practical dyes degradation.

AB Of the various forms of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, and brookite), anatase is reported to be the best photocatalysts. High-temperature stable anatase TiO2 photocatalyst is required for antibacterial applications in building materials. Hysteretic effect of phase transformation in two-dimensional pure TiO2 is observed. The transformation from anatase to rutile phase varies with a large temperature range (400-1000 degrees C). The delayed phase transformation of 2D anatase TiO2 results from the synergetic effect of its own anomalous phase evolution and 2D morphologic structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel conductive composite hydrogel (PPy/NCC-g-AA) was fabricated via an in-situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole monomer (Py) into a three-dimensional (3D) framework of acrylic acid (AA) grafted nanocrystal cellulose hydrogel (NCC-g-AA). Due to the high stability of the semi-interpenetrating network structure originating from PPy and NCC-g-AA hydrogel, the mechanical strength of the composite hydrogel was significantly enhanced, with the compressive modulus increasing from 0.23 to 4.16 MPa. The introduced carboxyl groups of AA enabled the hydrogel with improved water retention capacity (swelling ratio up to 910%). By doping with sodium p-toluenesulfonate (TsONa), the hydrogel showed much higher electrical conductivity (up to 8.8 x 10(-3) S/cm) than that of undoped. This hydrogel is a promising candidate for applications in catalyst supports, nerve regeneration and carbon capture. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Presence of rich bioactive compounds (polyphenol, cinnamaldehyde and flavanols) in cinnamon make them greatly beneficial for biomedicinal and food applications. Considering such prospects, we prepared decahedral cinnamon nanoparticles (DCNPs) in pure honey via pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique at varied laser ablation energy (LAE, 0-180 mJ) and characterized. LAE dependent structure and morphology of such DCNPs were determined. DCNPs grown at LAE of 90 mJ manifested the best size distribution with average diameter of 17.08 +/- 4.71 nm. Furthermore, bactericidal traits of these DCNPs against Escherichia coli (EC) and Bacillus subtilis (BS) bacterial strains were assessed using agar well diffusion and optical density analyses. The DCNPs assisted inhibition zone diameter-antibiotic tested against such bacterial strains was remarkably enlarged. The proposed DCNPs were shown to be effective for the development of future nanomedicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheet materials are of increasing importance. Many examples for their synthesis exist, but they generally show some common requirements, such as rigid reaction conditions, high cost and complicated multiple synthetic steps. Here we report a facile and cost-effective way to prepare porous carbon nanosheets by using an exfoliated nanopaper-like biomass, i.e., melaleuca bark as precursor. It is found that just after a simple carbonization treatment, the nanopaper-like barks can be directly transformed into two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with a unique hierarchical porous structure. A high BET surface area of 1397 m(2)/g can be reached for the obtained carbon materials without any extra activation process. Tuning of nanostructures could be facilely accomplished by varying carbonization treatment conditions. The as-prepared porous carbon nanosheet serves well as the sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BiOI/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by in-situ crystallization. The influence of the heterostructure on the photocatalyst was investigated by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, UV-vis DRS and PL characterization. The photocatalytic performance of the sample was evaluated by the photocatalytic removal rate of Hg-0 under visible-light irradiation. The results show that BiOI-390 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance. It can be attributed to the construction of heterostructures, which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Based on characterization and experiments, a reasonable Z-scheme charge transfer and photocatalytic reaction mechanism were proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel chemical reduction of organic aluminum for coating Al on the graphene surface is proposed. During the process, Al powder reacted with the (C2H5)(2)Br solution to produce (C2H5)(3)Al solution, followed by gradual decomposition of (C2H5)3Al into Al atoms. Al atoms gradually deposited on the surface of graphene, nucleated, grew up, until Al coating was formed on the surface of graphene. With the increase of reaction temperature, the decomposition rate of (C2H5)(3)Al increased, which was beneficial to the formation of Al atoms and Al coating. The reducing agent, NaH, promoted the reaction and formation of Al coating. When the reaction temperature was optimized to 100 degrees C, and the reaction time was 1.5 h, with NaH added to the solution, high quality Al-coated graphene was obtained.

Dual full band gaps of 9.2 GHz - 9.9 GHz and 10.7 GHz - 11.5 GHz that may stop the propagation of microwaves despite the directions or polarizations are found in the band diagram. As a contrast, the transmission property of the manufactured sample is measured by a transmission/reflection method. Two band gaps in accordance with the simulation are confirmed.

AB Biphasic (anatase-rutile) TiO2 can play a significant role in photon harvesting and charge transport in Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). However, fabrication of biphasic TiO2 thin film for electrode is crucial at low temperature. This paper reports the fabrication of plasmonic Ag loaded biphasic TiO2 electrode using sol-gel dip coating method to study the synergistic effect of surface plasmon resonance and homo-interface on photon harvesting and charge transport in DSSC. Structural and optical analyses confirm the phase composition and elevated absorption of the electrodes. Comparative study on the performance of DSSCs assembled with electrodes shows that Ag loaded biphasic TiO2 enhanced 60% power conversion efficiency (PEC) compared to anatase TiO2. This enhanced efficiency is mainly attributed to the reduced band gap, improved interfacial charge transfer, increased electron lifetime and retarded charge recombination. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper contributes to the debate on the energy efficiency paradox according to which consumers fail to adopt cost-effective, energy efficient technologies over less efficient technologies and therefore fail to reduce energy consumption. Both traditional and behavioural theories are used to investigate the decision-making process of residential consumers with empirical evidence based upon a specially designed quasi-experimental survey of 784 households on the decision to connect to a district-heating system, a more energy efficient alternative to individual heating systems. The results suggest an internal discount rate of around 36 per cent for homeowners, a signal that consumers undervalue future energy costs. We also find the household's decision to be negatively affected by years of payback up to around 7-8 years. Our findings suggest that neglecting consumer inattention and heuristics can lead to biases which cast doubt on the existence of the energy efficiency paradox. We believe that these results help to explain why some consumers are unlikely to invest in energy efficient technology, particularly those on low incomes.

AB Geographic clusters confer advantages to collocated firms, in particular access to local know-how. This article argues that the access to local know-how is contingent on the extent to which inventive activity is concentrated in the cluster. We draw on sociological theories of generalized exchange to argue that contrasting logics of exchange emerge in geographic clusters that have opposing effects on the extent to which firms benefit from collaborating with local organizations and source local knowledge. A longitudinal data set of 1903 firms engaged in nanotechnology research is used to examine the relationship between firm co-authorships on scientific articles with firms and public research organizations (PROs) and firm inventive performance. Results indicate that when cluster-level firm inventive concentration is high, collaborations with local firms are associated with lower inventive performance. We also find that firms source less local knowledge for their own inventions when firm inventive concentration is high. In contrast, concentrated inventive activity among PROs increases the positive relationship between collaborations with local PROs and firm inventive performance. Results also show firms source more knowledge from local PROs when local PRO inventive concentration is high. The findings suggest that inventive concentration both helps and hinders spill-over of cutting-edge knowledge.

AB This study examines how R&D alliance governance affects both the probability and magnitude of negative spillovers triggered by a partner's safety crisis. I show that hierarchical governance leads to a lower probability that a partner will suffer a crisis and thus trigger a negative spillover, yet this governance mode leads to negative spillovers of greater magnitude should they happen. Because expected spillover costs are calculated as the probability of occurrence times the magnitude of such costs, it is not clear which governance mode best minimizes expected spillover costs. I combine transaction costs economics and signaling theory to develop a contingency model that identifies which effect is more likely to dominate, as a way to address the reported dilemma. I found evidence in support of the described dilemma and the contingency model in a sample of 296 R&D outsourcing alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry.

We use harmonized and comparable data on a total of 40,577 small, medium and large firms surveyed in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) and provide some support for the reported patterns previously found in the innovation literature. Our results indicate that estimates from studies using cross-section data may be upward biased but nevertheless, innovative firms are significantly and economically more productive in both the manufacturing and services sectors.

   ANALYSIS
AB We investigate if and to what extent the receipt of a "selective" subsidy - a public subsidy awarded through a competitive procedure - helps new technology-based firms (NTBFs) to access R&D alliances. In particular, we theoretically enquire and empirically analyze which founding team-level characteristics allow NTBFs to: i) get a selective subsidy; and ii) access an R&D alliance with another firm or a public research organization/university, once the subsidy is awarded. We use a sample of 902 NTBFs that operate in Italy, where industrial policy has never had an explicit and exclusive mandate neither for targeting NTBFs nor for easing their access to R&D networks. By means of several identification strategies and estimation methods, our results point to the relevance of selective subsidies in facilitating NTBFs to enter R&D alliances, independently from the objective of the policy measure. Second, founders' technical education figures as a key determinant to get the first selective subsidy. Finally, founders' previous industry-specific work experience allows NTBFs to better exploit the selective subsidy, by positively moderating the impact of the subsidy on the likelihood to establish a corporate R&D alliance.

AB The use of university-industry collaboration in the innovation process is viewed as a major driver of firm competitiveness. The organizational dynamics underlying successful external relationships, however, remain poorly understood. Using longitudinal case studies of 15 innovation projects, we examine how firms with varying degrees of experience in collaborating with universities and public research organizations rely on different social capital dimensions to achieve successful collaborations. We find that experienced firms establish external collaborations on the basis of cognitive social capital, but this basis is reinforced by relational social capital over time. Conversely, less experienced firms initially base their university collaborations on relational social capital, which is reinforced by cognitive social capital over time. Based on these findings, we theorize on the interplay of different dimensions of social capital in university-industry collaborations over time. Our study has important implications for the management of collaborative innovation projects. In particular, it provides guidance to enable less experienced firms to develop successful collaborations with university partners.

AB Since outbreaks in 2003, avian influenza has received a considerable amount of funding and become a controversial science policy issue in various respects. Like in many other global and multidisciplinary societal problems fraught with high levels of uncertainty, a variety of perspectives have emerged over how to "tackle" avian influenza and public voices have expressed concern over how research funds are being allocated. In this article, we document if and how research agendas are being informed by public policy debates. We use qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the relations between expectations of outcomes of public science and the existing research landscape. Interviews with a cross-section of stake-holders reveal a wide range of perspectives and values associated with the nature and objectives of existing research avenues. We find that the landscape of public avian influenza research is not directly driven by expectations of societal outcomes. Instead, it is shaped by three institutional drivers: pharmaceutical industry priorities, publishing and public research funding pressures, and the mandates of science-based policy or public health organizations. These insights suggest that, in research prioritization, funding agencies should embrace a broad perspective of research governance that explicitly considers underlying institutional drivers. Deliberative approaches in public priority setting might help to make agendas more plural and diverse and thus more responsive to the contested and uncertain nature of avian influenza research.

AB This article investigates the relationship between industry technology intensity and the impacts of agglomeration economies on industrial growth. Many recent studies suggest the actual economic impacts of different forms of agglomeration economies depend on industrial characteristics such as technology intensity, but systematic empirical evidence is still lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze employment data covering all 3-digit NAICS industries of U.S. counties. The results confirm that technology-intensive industries are more likely to benefit from Jacobs spillovers as measured by related variety, while sectors with low technology intensities can better benefit from MAR spillovers as measured by regional specialization.

AB This paper investigates the fragmentation of the EU innovation system in the field of renewable energy source: (RES) by estimating the intensity and direction of knowledge spillovers over the years 1985-2010. We modify the original double exponential knowledge diffusion model proposed by Caballero and Jaffe (1993) to provide information on the degree of integration of EU countries' RES knowledge bases and to assess how citation patterns changed over time. We show that EU RES inventors have increasingly built "on the shoulders of the other EU giants", intensifying their citations to other member countries and decreasing those to domestic in ventors. Furthermore, the EU strengthened its position as source of RES knowledge for the US. Finally, we shoes that this pattern is peculiar to RES, with other traditional (i.e. fossil-based) energy technologies and other radically new technologies behaving differently. Our results provide suggestive, but convincing evidence that the reduction in fragmentation emerged as a result of the EU support for RES taking mainly the form of demand-pul policies.

AB Based on a spatial extension of an R&D investment model, this paper measures the macroeconomic impact of the French R&D policy mix on business R&D using regional data. Our measure takes into account not only the direct effect of policies but also indirect effects generated by the existence of spatial interaction between regions. Using a unique database containing information on the levels of various R&D policy instruments received by firms in French NUTS3 regions over the period 2001-2011, our estimates of a spatial Durbin model with structural breaks and fixed effects reveal the existence of a negative spatial dependence among R&D investments in regions. In this context, while a-spatial estimates would conclude that all instruments have a crowding-in effect, we show that national subsidies are the only instrument that is able to generate significant crowding-in effects. On the contrary, it seems that the design, size and spatial allocation of funds from the other instruments (tax credits, local subsidies, European subsidies) lead them to act (in the French context) as beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

DT Article
DE Consumer innovation; Commercial diffusion; Makerspaces; Collaboration;
   User innovation; Innovation policy
ID USER INNOVATION; COMMUNITIES
AB Makerspaces are open communities for tinkering, innovating, and socializing: They are equipped with tools and training that support "making" by participants. It has been argued that makerspaces can be a powerful vehicle to enhance both innovation and innovation diffusion by consumers. This research note offers initial empirical evidence for these claims. Through a survey of 558 participants drawn from makerspaces worldwide, the study shows that the innovation rate is about 53% and that the diffusion rate is about 18% among these individuals - substantially higher than the innovation and diffusion rates found in national innovation surveys of general populations, i.e. individuals who innovate independently at home at their own discretion.
   These findings doubtless reflect both a selection and a treatment effect: Individuals inclined or motivated to innovate and/or diffuse, tend to join makerspaces; and once individuals do participate, the rich resources they find in makerspaces most likely will improve the opportunities to innovate and/or diffuse successfully. Since innovation by consumers is both personally and economically valuable, these findings support the case for further research into the nature of successful makerspaces, and suggest the potential social welfare value of public investment.

AB While open innovation provides a new paradigm to sustain a firm's competitive advantage, opening up to external knowledge also entails substantial risks of appropriation and opportunism. Building on this "open paradox" framework, this study investigates whether societal trust-a key aspect of informal cultural norms-serves as an effective mechanism in improving relational governance among partners, thereby leading to better collaborative outcomes. Using a novel panel data on co-owned patents across 29 countries, we show that firms in high trust countries are able to produce a higher level of joint output (i.e., co-owned patents). This effect is more pronounced when perceived opportunism is higher (i.e., firms in high-tech industries, or in countries with less disclosure transparency), and when formal contracts are less enforceable (i.e., in countries with relatively weak legal systems). We further show that open innovation is the channel through which societal trust promotes innovative efficiency. Overall, our study establishes societal trust as a key factor in influencing the efficiency of open innovation.

AB We extend the Profit from Innovation (PFI) framework (Teece, 1986) by combining it with open innovation insights: we explore when and how managers make the transition between closed and open innovation, and how they use appropriation (formal and informal defense mechanisms) and project strategies to capture the value generated from the innovation at the project level. Based on a radical innovation project at Jaguar (UK), we contribute to a process and temporal perspective of open innovation by shedding light on two core project processes and their enabling mechanisms which influenced the ability of Jaguar to maximize profits from the innovation. The first core project process was the choice of timing of the shift from a closed to an open model of innovation: it was enabled by a pro-active change in the formal defense strategy (i.e. submission of a patent), and by an internal loose coupling project strategy that involved autonomy of the project champion and internal engineers' weak membership in the project. The second core process was an external loose coupling project strategy that was enabled by the deployment of two complementary informal appropriation mechanisms namely, the reduction of the scope of tasks allocated to external partners combined with the development of guarded relationships with them.

AB Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to chronic respiratory failure. Few studies have investigated ALS-related dyspnoea, and none have characterised the emotional distress it inflicts. We hypothesised that ALS-related dyspnoea has a strong affective component that relates to quality of life.
   Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted in 41 ALS patients > 18 with chronic respiratory failure and an indication for noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Dyspnoea was assessed using the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) at baseline and 1 month after NIV initiation. Correlations between scores evaluating the sensory and affective dimensions of dyspnoea and other patient-reported outcomes and pulmonary function tests were analysed.
   Results: Dyspnoea was described as intense (median [IQR] score on a 0-10 scale: 6.5 [4.0-7.5]). The sensory dimension of dyspnoea was polymorphic, but "air hunger" was the most common (48.8%) and the most intense (6 [4-8]) sensory descriptor. In the affective domain, most patients rated "anxious" (85.4%) and "afraid" (60.9%) above 0. The MDP affective dimension correlated significantly with other patient-reported outcomes, with the strongest correlation being between MDP "anxious" and the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (Pearson's R = 0.70). One month after initiation of NIV, dyspnoea during unassisted breathing was described in virtually the same terms, particularly the affective dimension.
   Discussion: ALS-related dyspnoea is intense and fear-provoking, persists during unassisted breathing between NIV sessions, and significantly impacts health-related quality of life. This study highlights the need for increased awareness of and research into ALS-related dyspnoea.

AB Objective: This study investigated the accuracy of impulse oscillometry (IOS) combined with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) to assess asthma control among preschool children.
   Methods: A total of 79 preschool children(3-6 year old) with asthma and 25 healthy preschool children who visited a paediatrician were enrolled in this study. All of the children were tested for allergens, respiratory system resistance (at 5 and 20 Hz [R5, R20]), respiratory system reactance (at 5 Hz [X5]), the resonant frequency of reactance (Fres), and the area under the reactance curve (between 5 Hz and Fres (reactance area [AX]) using IOS and FeNO. A paediatric respiratory specialist who was unaware of the IOS and FeNO results assigned children with asthma to either the asthma-controlled group (n = 27) or the asthma-uncontrolled group (n = 52) based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria. A healthy control group (n = 25) was also included. The relationships between the FeNO and IOS values as well as the asthma control of the three groups were analysed, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated for each measure.
   Results: (1) During the controlled group, means +/- standard deviations of AX, R5-20, R5, X5 and FeNO were 26.15 +/- 7.534, 3.52 +/- 1.311,9.97 +/- 1.576,-3.85 +/- 0.572,-3.85 +/- 0.572. During the uncontrolled group, means +/- standard deviations of AX, R5-20, R5, X5 and FeNO were 38.34 +/- 13.563,5.36 +/- 1.545,11.41 +/- 2.029,-5.07 +/- 1.554,36.40 +/- 21.07. Among preschool children, significant differences were observed between the controlled and uncontrolled group with regard to the small airway functional parameters (AX, R5-20, R5, and X5) and FeNO(P < 0.05).(2) A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.786 for FeNO alone, 0.751 for X5 alone, and 0.866 for X5 combined with FeNO (cut-off value: 27 ppb).
   Conclusion: FeNO combined with the small airway function parameter X5 accurately assessed asthma control among preschool children.

AB Rationale: No comprehensive analysis has previously been performed to evaluate the clinical aspects of and microbiological evidence associated with Mycobacteroides abscessus complex (MABC) infection in a region, such as Japan, with a low MABC incidence.
   Objectives: This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of MABC, which included clinical relatedness to erm(41) sequevar, phenotype (as colony morphology and minimum inhibitory concentration), and genotype.
   Methods: A total of 121 MABC patients (68 with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and 53 with M. abscessus subsp. massiliense) were recruited into this retrospective clinical-biological study from tertiary hospitals in Japan between 2004 and 2014.
   Results: Approximately 30% of MABC patients had a history of previous nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) disease. Furthermore, 24.8% of the patients had another concomitant NTM infection after they were diagnosed with MABC. Fewer than 10% of the patients in the M. abscessus group had T28C in erm(41). While we observed a higher conversion rate for M. massiliense than for M. abscessus (72.4% and 34.8%, respectively, p = 0.002), recurrence remained relatively common for M. massiliense (31.0%). In the M. abscessus patients, the MIC of clarithromycin (CLR) was significantly lower on day 3 in patients with a better treatment response than in refractory patients (The median MIC; 0.75 mu g/ml v.s 2.0 mu g/ml, p = 0.03). There was no significant relation between clinical manifestations and variable number of tandem repeat genotypes.
   Conclusions: Because the history and simultaneous isolation of other NTM in MABC infection are relatively common, these information should be carefully translated into clinical actions. The evaluation of early CLR resistance in M. abscessus and the erm(41) functions should be important to improve the treatment strategy.

ID APOPTOSIS-INDUCING LIGAND; RADIOGRAPHIC EMPHYSEMA; KIDNEY-FUNCTION;
   INFLAMMATION; RESOLUTION; CALCIUM; MARKER; COPD
AB Background: Smokers are highly susceptible to lung and cardiovascular disease that can reduce their survival. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a protein in the circulation that may suppress vascular and pulmonary inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that diminished circulating TRAIL levels would be associated with poor survival in smokers with lung and cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: Serum TRAIL level was measured by immunoassay in 474 smokers. Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary artery calcium scoring along with emphysema, lung function, and survival.
   Results: The 474 smokers were 65.7 +/- 6.3 years old and 52.2% male with 55.3 +/- 31.5 pack-years of tobacco-exposure. 83 of them died during 3588.2 person-years of follow up. At baseline, lower TRAIL level was associated with more coronary artery calcium (OR = 1.2 per SD, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.02), and with history of myocardial infarction (OR = 2.3 per SD, 95% CI 1.2-4.5, p = 0.02), angina (OR = 1.6 per SD, 95% CI 1.1-2.6, p = 0.03), and angioplasty (OR = 1.8 per SD, 95% CI 1.0-3.1, p = 0.04) in models adjusted for cardiovascular risk-factors, FEV1, and emphysema. Also, lower TRAIL level was associated with emphysema severity independent of demographics and tobacco exposure (beta = 0.11 sq. root units, 95% CI 0.01-0.22, p = 0.03). Further, TRAIL level was lowest in smokers with comorbid emphysema and coronary artery calcification rather than either condition alone. Finally, lower TRAIL level was independently associated with increased mortality in smokers particularly in those with comorbid emphysema and coronary artery calcification (HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.90).
   Conclusions: TRAIL level is reduced in smokers with comorbid emphysema and coronary artery disease, and is associated with reduced survival.

AB Background: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, which usually associated with chronic airway inflammation. The anti-heat shock protein (anti-HSP) 70 is a novel risk factor for asthma. The aim of the present study was to survey the effect of saffron supplementation on anti-HSP70, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and spirometry test in patients with allergic asthma.
   Basic procedures: In this clinical trial, patients (N = 80, 32 women and 48 men, 18-65 years old) with mild and moderate allergic asthma were randomized into two groups: a group of patients who received two capsules of saffron (100 mg/d) and a control group who received two capsules of placebo for 8 weeks. Anti-HSP70, hs-CRP and spirometry test were determined in patients before (week 0) and after (week 8) intervention. SPSS software (version 16.0; Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for data analysis.
   Main findings: Saffron in comparison with placebo significantly reduced the hs-CRP (p < 0.001) and anti-HSP70 (p < 0.001) concentrations. In spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in first second(FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio and forced expiratory flow 25-75%.(FEF 25-75) increased significantly in saffron in comparison to placebo group (p < 0.05).
   Principal conclusions: Results of the present study suggested that saffron supplementation in patients with allergic asthma decreased significantly anti-HSPs 70 and hs-CRP and also improved some spirometry test factors.

AB Introduction: Pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are common. Yields from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been reported to be between 31 and 65%. The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on BAL has not been extensively evaluated in a mixed immunosuppressed patient population.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of immunosuppressed adults with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent BAL at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Only one BAL per patient was included. We compared the rate of positive PCR testing to conventional testing. We then investigated factors associated with positive PCR testing. Finally, we assessed for changes in antimicrobial therapy after bronchoscopy.
   Results: Three hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent BAL with 249 patients having pneumocystis PCR testing and 142 having viral PCR testing. Pneumocystis identification occurred in 43 patients and viral species identification occurred in 56 patients. PCR testing increased pneumocystis identification compared to microscopy, 14% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, and viral identification compared to culture, 25% vs. 6%, p = 0.0001. Of the patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing 49% had antibiotics stopped, 66% were started on anti-pneumocystis therapy, and only 6% did not receive treatment. There was no difference in the number of patients with antibiotics stopped based on viral PCR testing results.
   Discussion: PCR testing increases BAL yield in immunosuppressed patients compared to conventional testing. Pneumocystis identified by PCR only may cause a self-limited infection and may not require antimicrobial therapy. PCR testing should be included in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients.

AB Background: Guidelines recommend a differentiation of difficult-to-treat asthma from severe asthma. However, this might be complex and to which extent this distinction is achievable in clinical practice remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate to which degree a systematic evaluation protocol enables a differentiation between severe versus difficult-to-treat asthma in patients in specialist care on high intensity asthma treatment, i.e. potentially severe asthma.
   Methods: All adult asthma patients seen in four respiratory clinics over one year were screened prospectively for asthma severity. Patients with difficult-to-control asthma according to ERS/ATS criteria (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids/oral corticosteroids) underwent systematic assessment to differentiate severe asthma patients from those with other causes of poor asthma control: objective confirmation of the asthma diagnosis as well as assessment of treatment barriers and comorbidities.
   Results: Overall, 1034 asthma patients were screened, of whom 175 (16.9%) had difficult-to-control asthma. 117 of these accepted inclusion, and completed systematic assessment. Asthma diagnosis was objectively confirmed in 88%. Sub-optimal adherence (42.5%), inhaler errors (31.5%) and unmanaged comorbidities (66.7%) were common. After primary assessment, 12% (14/117) fulfilled strict criteria for severe asthma. Moreover, 56% (66/117) were instantly classified as difficult-to-treat asthma due to poor adherence/inhaler technique. Finally, an 'overlap' group of 32% (37/117) were identified with patients being adherent and displaying correct inhaler technique, but had unmanaged comorbidities -potentially fitting into both the difficult-to-treat and severe group.
   Conclusion: Only a minority of patients with difficult-to-control asthma were found to have severe asthma after primary systematic assessment. Nevertheless, strict categorisation of severe vs. difficult-to-treat asthma seems to pose a challenge.

AB Background: Individuals with obesity are more likely to develop asthma, but the exact mechanism is still uncertain and several hypotheses have been raised, such as the release of inflammatory mediators secreted by adipose tissue.
   Objective: To assess the effects of weight loss in patients submitted to bariatric surgery on pulmonary and systemic inflammation.
   Method: The study evaluated patients undergoing bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) with the diagnosis of asthma, except smokers. The patients were evaluated at the time of entry into a preoperative weight loss group (T1), just before bariatric surgery (T2), six months after surgery (T3), and 12 months after surgery (T4). The following were measured: anthropometric data, dosage of systemic inflammatory markers by means of blood collection, pulmonary inflammatory markers obtained by induced sputum collection, pulmonary function parameters, and asthma activity assessed by a Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire.
   Results: Nineteen patients participated in the study. There were significant reductions in the systemic levels of interleukin (IL)-8 (p = 0.002), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.003), leptin (p = 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (p = 0.007), and significant increase in the systemic levels of IL-6 (p = 0.004) over time and adiponectin in T2 (p = 0.025). In regards to pulmonary inflammation, there were significant reductions in the sputum levels of TNF-alpha (p < 0.001). There was no significant improvement of the pulmonary function parameters (p > 0.05) and significant improvement in asthma activity scores (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Weight loss was associated with significant changes in the systemic and pulmonary inflammatory profiles of individuals with asthma, leading to a better asthma control as a result of an increase in some anti-inflammatory mediators and a reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators.

   ABNORMALITIES; MECHANISMS
AB Background: Previous work suggests that mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have greater lung dysfunction than previously appreciated from spirometry alone. There is evidence of pulmonary microvascular dysfunction in mild COPD, which may reduce diffusing capacity (DLCO) and increase ventilatory inefficiency during exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine if DLCO, pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and membrane diffusing capacity (Dm) are diminished during exercise in mild COPD, and whether this is related to ventilatory inefficiency and dyspnea.
   Methods: Seventeen mild COPD patients (FEV1/FVC: 64 +/- 4%, FEV1 = 94 +/- 11%(pred)) and 17 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Ten moderate COPD patients were also tested for comparison (FEV1 = 66 +/- 7%(pred)). DLCO, Vc, and Dm were determined using the multiple-fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) DLCO method at baseline and during steady-state cycle exercise at 40W, 50%, and 80% of <(V)over dot>O-2peak. Using expired gas data, ventilatory inefficiency was assessed by <(V)over dot>(E)/<(V)over dot>CO2.
   Results: Compared to controls, mild COPD had lower DLCO at baseline and during exercise secondary to diminished Vc (P < 0.05). No difference in Dm was observed between controls and mild COPD at rest or during exercise. Patients with high <(V)over dot>(E)/<(V)over dot>CO2 (i.e. >= 34) had lower Vc and greater dyspnea ratings compared to control at 40W. Moderate COPD patients were unable to increase Vc with increasing exercise intensity, suggesting further pulmonary vascular impairment with increased obstruction severity.
   Conclusion: Despite relatively minor airflow obstruction, mild COPD patients exhibit a diminished DLCO and capillary blood volume response to exercise, which appears to contribute to ventilatory inefficiency and greater dyspnea.

AB Background and objective: No reports exist regarding skeletal muscle involvement in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD). The cross-sectional area of the erector spinae muscles (ESMCSA) reflects physical activity and can be assessed by computed tomography (CT). We investigated the relationship between ESMCSA and physiological parameters and prognosis in MAC-LD patients.
   Material and methods: In this prospective observational study, the ESMCSA was measured on single-slice axial CT images. MAC-LD patients and sex-and age-matched controls (non-MAC-LD participants) were evaluated. We evaluated the relationship between the ESMCSA and physiological parameters and prognosis.
   Results: A total of 260 patients (209 female; median age, 69 years; 190 with nodular/bronchiectatic disease; 74 with cavitary lesions) were enrolled. The ESMCSA was not different between MAC-LD patients and controls. In MAC-LD patients, the ESMCSA was significantly associated with age, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary function, CT severity, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that an ESMCSA < -1 standard derivation (hazards ratio [HR], 2.76; P = 0.047) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality, along with BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) (HR, 3.67; P = 0.02) and presence of cavitary lesions (HR, 5.84; P = 0.001). However, the ESMCSA was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality when current treatment status, % predicted functional vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were added to the analyses.
   Conclusions: Although the prognostic impact was limited, ESMCSA was significantly associated with HRQL and prognostic physiological parameters, such as BMI and pulmonary function.

AB Aim: The study aimed to examine the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition over 13 years (between mean age 30 and mean age 43) and lung function at mean age 50.
   Materials & methods: In a longitudinal observational study LTL was determined twice on a population-based sample of 481 Jewish residents of Jerusalem at mean ages 30 and 43 years. Pulmonary function was determined at mean age 50 years. Multiple linear regression and multivariable ordinal logistic modeling were applied. Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) was used for model selection.
   Results: In unadjusted analysis, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1%) was inversely associated with the LTL attrition rate (standardized beta = -0.110, P = 0.023) but not with the baseline LTL. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC%) was inversely associated with the LTL attrition rate (standardized beta = -0.108, P = 0.026). Multivariable adjustment mildly attenuated the association with the LTL attrition rate (standardized beta = -0.100, P = 0.034 for FEV1% and -0.093, P = 0.042 for FVC%). This would be consistent with a 3.3% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.1-3.4%] decline in FEV1% and a 3.0% (95% CI: 2.8-3.1%) decline in FVC% per year. In linear regression models the LTL-pulmonary function association did not differ by sex, social mobility, pack-years smoking exposure, or level of GlycA, a novel systemic inflammatory marker.
   Conclusions: Greater LTL attrition between mean age 30 and mean age 43 was associated with poorer lung function at mean age 50 years. The availability of longitudinal data on LTL attrition for the first time in the current study strengthens the case for LTL change preceding change in lung function.

AB Rationale: The risk of all-cause mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTMLD) in the United States (US) population is not well established.
   Objectives: This study aims to assess the public health burden of NTMLD in the US by comparing the relative risk of all-cause mortality in the NTMLD population with an age-and sex-matched cohort from the general population.
   Methods: Patients with physician claims for NTMLD (ICD-9 0.031; ICD-10 A31.0) were identified between 2007 and 2016 from a large US national managed care insurance plan covering approximately 15-18 million members annually. A control group with no NTMLD ICD-9 or 10 codes was randomly selected from the general population and matched 3:1 to the NTMLD sample according to birth year, gender, and insurance benefit coverage. The date of first NTMLD diagnosis of each patient was assigned to the matched controls as the index date. The Cox proportional hazard method compared survival between cohorts, adjusting for demographic factors and baseline comorbidities.
   Results: A total of 2005 patients with NTMLD and 6014 controls were identified, with a mean follow-up duration of 3.4 years and 3.7 years, respectively. The NTMLD group had substantially higher proportions of patients with asthma (23.3% versus 3.5%), bronchiectasis (36.5% versus 0.1%), COPD (52.0% versus 5.9%), arrhythmia (22.6% versus 6.5%), coronary artery disease (18.5% versus 6.6%), heart failure (11.9% versus 4.1%), and cancer (18.5% versus 5.0%). The unadjusted rate of all-cause mortality from the index date was 20.7 per 1000 person-years in the NTMLD group vs 5.6 per 1000 person-years in the control group (rate ratio - 3.73; 95% CI: 2.93-4.75). Multivariable Cox regression, adjusted for the above variables as well as all other important baseline covariates, showed a doubling risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.06; CI: 1.52-2.79; P < 0.001) in the NTMLD vs control group.
   Conclusions: All-cause mortality, adjusted for other factors, more than doubled with NTMLD compared with an age-sex-matched control group in a large US national managed care insurance plan.

AB Aim: Biological therapies developed for severe asthma may have a role in COPD patients with asthma features.
   Method: We carried out a prospective, consecutive, cross-sectional analysis of 80 patients with severe COPD GOLD IV/D.
   Results: We studied 80 patients (48.8% female), aged 57.6 +/- 5.1 years, ex-smokers with 35.7 +/- 21.2 pack years, BMI 22.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2), FEV1 of 0.61 +/- 0.2 L (21.1 +/- 5.6% pred), pO(2) 52.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg, and BODE 6.9 +/- 1.7. 68% had > 2 moderate or severe exacerbations annually. 16.1% (5/31) patients showed FEV1 reversibility of > 12% and > 200 ml despite maximal therapy, 33% (15/45) had FENO >= 22.5 ppb, 33% (24/73) had serum IgE >= 100 I.E./ml and there was positive allergen sensitization in 51.5% (35/68). Blood eosinophilia of >= 150 cells/mu l was seen in 47% (35/74). Induced sputum showed eosinophilia of >= 2% in 56% (14/24) with respiratory pathogens in 63.8% (30/47). We identified 12 (15%) patients with asthma-COPD overlap. Of these, 10 (83.3%) had frequent exacerbations and these patients had significantly more severe exacerbations requiring NIV or ICU than those without asthma features (p < 0.005).
   Conclusion: We detected asthma features in a substantial subset of stable patients with severe COPD. Asthma features were associated with more severe exacerbation despite optimal COPD therapy, representing potential candidates for targeted therapy with anti- IgE or anti-IL5.

TI Eosinophilic asthma, according to a blood eosinophil criterion, is

DT Article

   asthma
ID SPUTUM EOSINOPHILS; EXACERBATIONS; INFLAMMATION; INFECTIONS; COUNT
AB Background: Asthma is a syndrome with multiple phenotypes. Peripheral blood eosinophil counts might be the ideal biomarker to identify subjects with eosinophilic asthma. It is available, inexpensive, and it is associated with eosinophilia in sputum.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether blood eosinophilia is associated with asthma severity and to evaluate whether blood eosinophilia is associated with lack of control of asthma symptoms and airway obstruction.
   Methods: Case control study. The cases were subjects recruited from a cohort of patients with severe asthma, in Salvador-BR, demanding continuous inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. There were two control groups: 1) subjects with mild/moderate asthma, 2) subjects with no asthma. Subjects enrolled in the study answered questionnaires, had their blood and stool samples collected, performed spirometry and SPT. We established a cutoff >= 260 cells/mm3 for blood eosinophilia.
   Results: We evaluated 544 subjects in the case group, 452 subjects with mild to moderate asthma and 450 subjects with no asthma. The subjects of the case group had higher odds of presenting the eosinophilic phenotype in comparison to subjects with mild to moderate asthma [OR 1.60 95CI(1.19-2.16)] and no asthma [OR 3.93; 95CI(2.90-5.33)]. The eosinophilic phenotype, according to blood count, is associated with uncontrolled asthma [OR 1.56; 95CI(1.06- 2.28)], but it is not associated with airway obstruction [OR 0.87; 95CI(0.61-1.24)].
   Conclusion: We conclude that the blood eosinophilia is a biomarker associated with asthma severity and poor symptom control, but we found no association with reduced lung function.

   RECOMMENDATIONS; PERFORMANCE
AB Background: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is highly prevalent in COPD and conflicting results have emerged regarding the consequences on exercise capacity in the 6MWT. We sought to examine the ventilatory efficiency and variability metrics as the primary endpoint and aerobic capacity (V'O-2) as the secondary endpoint.
   Methods: Forty subjects were included and submitted to comprehensive lung function tests, detailed pulsed-Doppler echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Four subjects were excluded due to concomitant cardiac disease and two owing to COPD exacerbation.
   Results: Seventeen COPD/LVDD+ and seventeen COPD/LVDD-individuals were closely matched for baseline characteristics. Throughout the exercise, there was no difference between-groups for primary (V'(E)/V'CO(2)slope and V'(E)/V'CO(2)nadir, p > 0.05 for both) or secondary endpoints (V'O-2peak% pred, p > 0.05). Ventilatory variability remained unchanged. However, after very well age- and sex-matched subgroup analysis, five-moderate and three-mild COPD/LVDD + subjects with elevated left ventricular filling pressure (E/e' > 13, n = 8), presented a downward-shifted V'E/V'CO(2)slope (25.7 +/- 5.1 vs 33.4 +/- 7.1, p = 0.031) and V'E/V'CO(2)nadir reduction (29.7 +/- 3.9 vs 36.3 +/- 7.2, p = 0.042) besides significantly better V'O-2peak% pred (92.1 +/- 21.6% vs 75.8 +/- 13.1%, p = 0.045) compared to 8 COPD/LVDD-controls. Ventilatory variability remained once again unchanged.
   Conclusions: COPD/LVDD overlap is not associated with worse exercise tolerance and/or wasted ventilation in excess compared to controls, even when suspected for elevated left ventricular filling pressure. Further studies are warranted to study specifically if augmented pulmonary blood transit time can allow better gas-exchange, thus preserving exercise capacity under specific conditions in COPD patients without heart failure.

AB Background: It is well-documented that the dysregulation of trace elements may be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, the precise changes of trace elements levels in asthma cases remain elusive. We established whether trace elements levels were associated with asthma susceptibility by pooling case-control studies.
   Methods: 34 studies were included. We extracted the standard mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A pooled-analysis was performed.
   Results: No marked difference (95% CI: -1.437-0.218, p - 0.149) of Se level between asthma and controls. Significant difference ( 95% CI: 0.112-1.032, p = 0.015; 95% CI: 0.376-1.331, p < 10(-4)) of Cu level between asthma and controls was noted among overall populations and Asians. No marked difference of Zn level between asthma and controls was observed among overall populations, Asians, Caucasians and Africans. Significant difference (95% CI: -0.567 to -0.2 38, p < 10(-4)) of Mg level between asthma and controls was noted among Asians. Marked difference (95% CI: 0.258-2.864, p = 0.019; 95% CI: 0.270-3.282, p = 0.021) of Fe level between asthma and controls was noted among overall populations and Asians. Age had no impact on the pooled SMDs of Se, Cu, Zn, Mg and Fe between asthma and controls. Sensitivity analyses did not change the overall results. No publication bias was noted for overall populations.
   Conclusions: Alterations of Cu, Mg and Fe levels may be a biomarker of asthma risk among specific populations. Further studies should be performed to clarify the strength of these elements in asthma.

   COPD; HYPERINFLATION; INFLAMMATION; ASTHMA
AB Background: International guidelines recommend simple spirometry for bronchiectasis patients. However, pulmonary pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is very complex and still poorly understood. Our objective was to characterize lung function in bronchiectasis and identify specific functional sub-groups.
   Methods: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive adults with bronchiectasis during stable sate. Patients underwent body-plethysmography before and after acute bronchodilation testing, diffusing lung capacity (DLCO) with a 3-year follow up. Air trapping and hyperinflation were a residual volume (RV) > 120% predicted and a total lung capacity > 120% predicted. Acute reversibility was: Delta FEV1 >= 12% and 200 mL from baseline (FEV1rev) and Delta RV >= 10% reduction from baseline (RVrev). Sensitivity analyses included different reversibility cutoffs and excluded patients with concomitant asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Results: 187 patients were enrolled (median age: 68 years; 29.4% males). Pathophysiological abnormalities often overlapped and were distributed as follows: air trapping (70.2%), impaired DLCO (55.7%), airflow obstruction (41.1%), hyperinflation (15.7%) and restriction (8.0%). 9.7% of patients had normal lung function. RVrev (17.6%) was more frequent than FEV1rev (4.3%). Similar proportions were found after multiple sensitivity analyses. Compared with non-reversible patients, patients with RVrev had more severe obstruction (mean(SD) FEV1% pred: 83.0% (24.4) vs 68.9% (26.2); P = 0.02) and air trapping (RV% pred, 151.9% (26.6) vs 166.2% (39.9); P = 0.028).
   Conclusions: Spirometry alone does not encompass the variety of pathophysiological characteristics in bronchiectasis. Air trapping and diffusion impairment, not airflow obstruction, represent the most common functional abnormalities. RVrev is related to worse lung function and might be considered in bronchiectasis' workup and for patients' functional stratification.

AB Introduction: The cost-effectiveness of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) 62.5 mu g as add-on therapy to other maintenance COPD treatments is unknown.
   Methods: This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of the following in COPD: UMEC + fluticasone furoate/ vilanterol 100/25 mu g (FF/VI); UMEC + fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mu g (FP/SAL); and UMEC + several alternative choices of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta(2)-agonist (ICS/LABA). The model was informed with direct and indirect data from previously published studies, with a UK perspective and a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses were also performed.
   Results: For the lifetime horizon, compared with FF/VI, FP/SAL and ICS/LABAs, addition of UMEC was associated with incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of 4050 pound, 7210 pound and  pound 5780, respectively, and incremental costs per life year gain of 3380 pound, 6020 pound and 4940 pound. All UMEC-containing regimens resulted in numerically lower exacerbation rates versus comparator regimens over a lifetime horizon.
   Conclusions: Addition of UMEC to various ICS/LABA treatments was associated with higher cost than ICS/LABA alone, but was cost-effective in most scenarios.

AB Background: It is unknown whether there is a benefit to initiating triple therapy (TT; inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting beta(2)-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists) promptly (within 30 days) following a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related hospitalization or emergency-department (ED) visit compared with delaying treatment (31-180 days).
   Methods: This retrospective, observational study (GSK: HO-15-15256) used healthcare claims from a commercial and Medicare claims database (January 1, 2008-December 31, 2015). Patients: >= 40 years of age, diagnosed with COPD and no history of TT 12 months pre-index. Patients experiencing a COPD-related hospitalization or ED visit (index) who initiated TT <= 6 months following index were included (January 1, 2009-December 31, 2014). Patients initiating TT <= 30 or 31-180 days following index were included in the Prompt or Delayed cohorts, respectively. All-cause and COPD-related costs (total, medical and prescription), and exacerbations (severe and moderate) per patient per year were determined for 12 months post index. Outcomes were adjusted by cohort, weighted for a balanced distribution of baseline covariates between cohorts using inverse probability weights.
   Results: Overall, 10,902 patients were identified (Prompt: n = 5701; Delayed: n = 5201). Total, medical and prescription all- cause costs were significantly higher in the Delayed versus Prompt cohorts (percent increase: 18.7%, 22.8% and 8.8%, respectively; all p < 0.0001). COPD-related total, medical and prescription costs were 49.3%, 66.3% and 10.3% higher in the Delayed versus Prompt cohorts, respectively (all p < 0.0001). Total and severe COPD-related exacerbation rates were 28.2% and 64.7% higher in the Delayed versus Prompt cohorts (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Prompt use of TT following a COPD-inpatient or ED visit may reduce future costs and subsequent exacerbations compared with delaying the initiation of TT.

AB After ascent to high altitude (>= 2500 m), the inability of the human body to adapt to the hypobaric and hypoxia environment can induce tissue hypoxia, then a series of high altitude illnesses including acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) would develop. Symptoms of AMS include headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting; HAPE is characterized by orthopnea, breathlessness at rest, cough, pink frothy sputum, and results in obvious pulmonary edema that poses significant harm to people; HACE is characterized by ataxia and decreased consciousness, leading to coma and brain herniation which would be fatal if not treated promptly. This review article provides a current understanding of the pathophysiology of these three forms of high altitude illness and elaborates the current prevention and treatment measures of these diseases.

AB Objectives: The study sought to assess the prognostic impact of COPD in patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) on admission. Background: Data regarding the outcome of patients with COPD presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCA is limited.
   Methods: A large retrospective registry was used including all consecutive patients presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT), fibrillation (VF) and SCA from 2002 to 2016. Patients with COPD were compared to patients without COPD applying multivariable Cox regression models and propensity-score matching for evaluation of the primary prognostic endpoint defined as long-term all-cause mortality at 2 years. Secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality at index, at 30 days and after discharge, cardiac death at 24 h, rehospitalization related to cardiac causes and the composite endpoint of cardiac death at 24 h, recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies at 2 years.
   Results: In 2813 unmatched high-risk patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCA, COPD was present in 9%. VF was less common in COPD (28% versus 39%; p = 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression models revealed that COPD was associated with the primary endpoint of long-term all-cause mortality (HR = 1.245; 95% CI 1.001-1.549; p = 0.001), which was also proven after propensity score matching (log rank p = 0.001). The secondary endpoints of all-cause mortality at index, at 30 days, after discharge, cardiac death at 24 h, as well as the composite endpoint of cardiac death at 24 h, recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies were higher in COPD (p < 0.033).
   Conclusion: In high-risk patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCA, COPD was associated with higher long-term all-cause mortality, cardiac death at 24 h and higher rates of the composite endpoint of cardiac death at 24 h, recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies at 2 years.

ID RESPIRATORY SOCIETY STATEMENT; DISEASE; COPD; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT;

AB Introduction: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a core component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) management with well recognized benefits. While suggestions for educational content within pulmonary rehabilitation have been detailed in clinical guidance, it is unclear what educational content is delivered as part of pulmonary rehabilitation, who delivers it, and how it is delivered.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify what educational content is delivered as part of pulmonary rehabilitation, how is this delivered and who delivers it. Databases were searched from 1981 to 2017 using multiple search terms related to "pulmonary rehabilitation" and "education".
   Results: Fourteen studies were identified. This included 6 survey studies, 5 quasi-experimental studies and 3 RCTs. Five key topics that were consistently included within PR programmes were identified as:
   1) Anxiety/depression and stress management.
   2) Early recognition of signs of infection.
   3) Dyspnea and symptom management.
   4) Nutrition.
   5) Techniques using inhalers and nebulizers.
   Broader topics such as welfare/benefits, sexuality, and advance care directives did not frequently feature. Only four studies used tools to measure knowledge or learning pre and post rehabilitation in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the education delivered as part of PR.
   Conclusions: The delivery of education in PR programmes is variable and does not follow suggested educational topics. Education needs to take a patient centered motivational approach to ensure effective delivery. Further research into appropriate educational outcome measures are needed, in order to evaluate the changes in behaviour associated with education.

AB The hallmark of vasculitis is autoimmune inflammation of blood vessels and surrounding tissues, resulting in an array of constitutional symptoms and organ damage. The lung is commonly targeted in the more familiar ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitidies, but large and medium vessel vasculitides, including Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Behcet's disease, and necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis, may also feature prominent pulmonary involvement. Pulmonary manifestations of these conditions include pulmonary arterial aneurysms, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary nodules, and parenchymal infiltrates. An understanding of the diverse manifestations of vasculitis and a high index of clinical suspicion are essential to avoid delays in disease recognition that may result in permanent or life threatening morbidity. In this review, we outline the general clinical manifestations, pulmonary manifestations, diagnostic workup, imaging findings, and treatment of medium, large, and variable vessel vasculitides.

AB Background: Cardiac dysfunction is associated with a higher mortality in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unknown how the heart responds to treatment of COPD exacerbations. We followed cardiac biomarker levels during hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD and hypothesised that these biochemical markers of cardiac dysfunction might be affected the severity and treatment of exacerbations of COPD.
   Methods: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T were measured at admission, 12 h, 72 h, and clinical stability in 176 patients. In a second cohort (n= 93), associations between blood salbutamol concentrations and biomarker changes at 12 h were analysed.
   Results: NT-proBNP increased from a geometric mean of 43 pmol/L at admission to 56 pmol/L at 12 h (p < 0.001), 53 pmol/L at 72 h (p = 0.045), and decreased to 25 pmol/L (p < 0.001) at stability. Troponin T levels decreased at 12 h (p < 0.001), but 15/174 (9%) patients had a clinically significant rise. Nebulised bronchodilator treatment and blood salbutamol concentrations were associated with greater increases in NTproBNP rise at 12 h independently of baseline COPD or exacerbation severity and other treatments (p < 0.05). Nebulised bronchodilator and blood salbutamol concentrations also predicted rises in troponin T in univariate analyses (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: NT-proBNP continues to rise after admission to hospital for COPD exacerbations and a minority of patients have clinically significant rises in cardiac troponins. These rises were associated with nebulised beta(2)-agonist treatment. These findings suggest that high doses of beta(2)-agonists may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction in COPD.

ID OUTCOMES; GUIDELINES; EXPERIENCE; ERA
AB Background: Pregnancy in CF women is no longer an exceptional event, but few information on its effect on clinical status in European CF patients are available. This study describes Italian CF pregnant population, to investigate its effect on CF woman.
   Methods: Data were collected (2010-2015) by the Italian CF Registry. A case-control study was performed between pregnant and never pregnant women.
   Results: A total of 81 pregnant women (aged 18-45ys) were identified with a mean age at pregnancy of 31ys. Median age at diagnosis resulted higher in cases (P = 0.010). A decline from 6 to 12 months before pregnancy to one year after delivery in BMI (P = 0.034), in FEV1 (P < 0.001) and FVC (P < 0.001) was registered among cases. Difference in change between cases and controls was found for the BMI (P = 0.006); weak evidence of difference in FEV1 (p = 0.080) and FVC (p = 0.056) were noted between the groups.
   Conclusion: Data from ICFR show that CF women can become mother with only slight adverse effect on their nutritional status. Further study should be carried out to investigate long term effect of pregnancy on lung function.

AB Introduction: Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) to measure Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is increasingly being used as a secondary endpoint in multicentre bronchiectasis studies. LCI data quality control or "over-reading" is resource intensive and the impact is unclear.
   Objectives: To assess the proportion of MBW tests deemed unacceptable with over-reading, and to assess the change in LCI (number of turnovers), LCI coefficient of variation (CV%) and tidal volume (VT) CV% results after over-reading.
   Methods: Data were analysed from 250 MBW tests (from 98 adult bronchiectasis patients) collected as part of the Bronch-UK Clinimetrics study in 5 UK centres. Each MBW test was over-read centrally using pre-defined criteria. MBW tests with < 2 technically valid and repeatable trials were deemed unacceptable to include in analysis. In accepted tests, values for LCI, LCI CV% and VT CV% before and after over-reading, were compared.
   Results: Insufficient data was collected in 10/250 tests. With over-reading, 30/240 (12%) were deemed unacceptable to include in analysis. In those accepted tests, overall the change in LCI, LCI CV% and VT CV% with over-reading was not statistically significant. When MBW new sites were compared to MBW expert sites, the change in LCI with over-reading was significantly greater in MBW new sites (p = 0.047). Data suggests that over-reading could be important up to at least 12 months post initiation of MBW activity.
   Conclusion: MBW over-reading was important in this study as 12% of tests were considered unacceptable. Over-reading improved test result accuracy in sites new to MBW.

SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE

DT Article
ID CLINICAL SEVERITY; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; MARKER; BURDEN
AB Background: Asthma prevalence continues to increase in low and middle-income countries, presenting challenges in assessing asthma control in resource-poor settings. Previous studies suggest that exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) is higher with asthma severity and lower with treatment. We hypothesized that eCO levels may be elevated in children with asthma, particularly in children with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma in a low-resource setting in Lima, Peru.
   Methods: We compared average eCO levels between 248 children with asthma and 221 healthy controls as well as the odds of asthma by eCO quartiles (0-1, 2, 3, and >= 4 ppm) using multivariable linear and logistic regression. eCO quartiles were also used to compare the odds of partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma (score <= 19 on the Asthma Control Test) in a multivariable logistic regression model.
   Findings: Average adjusted eCO level was 0.56 ppm (95% CI 0.07-1.05) higher in children with asthma. The adjusted odds of asthma were 1.22 (95% CI 0.75-1.97), 1.46 (0.81-2.63), and 1.76 (0.96-3.23) in the second, third, and fourth eCO quartiles compared to the first eCO quartile, respectively. Among children with asthma, the adjusted odds of partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma in those in the second, third, and fourth eCO quartiles, compared to the first, were 1.61 (95% CI 0.74-3.48), 3.66 (95% CI 1.51-8.87), and 2.50 (95% CI 1.06-5.90), respectively.
   Interpretation: eCO may serve as an inexpensive biomarker for asthma control, particularly in low-resource settings.

DT Article

   Hospitalizations
ID READMISSION; HEALTH; RISK
AB Background: Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may suffer episodes of exacerbation (ECOPD) that require hospitalization and worsen their health status, and prognosis. We hypothesized that a detailed interrogation of health-care "big data" databases can provide valuable information to better understand the risk factors and outcomes of these episodes.
   Material and methods: We interrogated four databases of the Catalan health-care system (< 8,000,000 registries) to identify patients hospitalized because of ECOPD for the first time (index event) between 2010 and 2012. Analysis was carried forward since the index event until the end of 2014 or the death of the patient. The two years that preceded the index event were also investigated.
   Results: We identified 17,555 patients, (>= 50 years of age) hospitalized because of ECOPD (ICD9 v.9 codes at discharge) for the first time between 2010 and 2012. In this population we observed that: (1) 23% of patients die within a year after being discharged from their first ECOPD hospitalization; (2) in the remaining patients, allcause mortality was related to the number of re-hospitalizations, particularly with early (< 30 days) readmissions; (3) despite this being a 'respiratory' cohort, prescription and dispensation of drugs for cardiovascular diseases was higher than for obstructive airway diseases; and, finally, (4) lower winter ambient temperatures are associated with hospital admissions for ECOPD particularly in early re-admitters.
   Conclusions: Overall these results indicate under appreciation of the burden of COPD in patients hospitalized for the first time because ECOPD.

AB Although pleural manometry is a relatively simple medical procedure it is only occasionally used to follow pleural pressure (Ppl) changes during a therapeutic thoracentesis and pneumothorax drainage. As some studies showed that pleural pressure monitoring might be associated with significant advantages, pleural manometry has been increasingly evaluated in the last decade.
   The major clinical applications of pleural pressure measurements include: the prevention of complications associated with large volume thoracentesis, diagnosis and differentiation between various types of an unexpandable lung and a possible prediction of the efficacy of chest tube drainage in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax.
   It is well known that the therapeutic thoracentesis might be complicated by cough, chest discomfort, and rarely, by a life threatening condition called reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE). The serious adverse events of thoracentesis are related to pleural pressure drop rather than to the volume of removed pleural effusion. The use of pleural manometry during pleural fluid withdrawal enables the evaluation of the relationship between withdrawn pleural fluid volume, pleural pressure changes and procedure related complications. Pleural pressure measurement is also an important tool to study the different mechanism of pneumothorax complicating the thoracentesis.
   Pleural manometry is critical for measurement of pleural elastance, diagnosis of an unexpandable lung and differentiation between trapped lung and lung entrapment. This usually has significant clinical implications in terms of further management of patients with pleural effusion.
   The paper is a comprehensive review presenting different aspects of pleural pressure measurement in clinical practice.

AB Objective: To evaluate changes in the expression of clock genes and melatonin levels in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) as a potential early stage of synucleinopathies.
   Methods: We assessed the rhythmicity of circadian clock genes using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 24-h blood melatonin profiles using radio-immunoassay in 10 RBD patients and nine age-matched controls.
   Results: The RBD patients did not show circadian rhythmicity for clock genes Per2, Bmal1, and Nr1d1 but the rhythmicity of Per 1 remained, and the amplitude of Per3 was diminished. The 24-h melatonin rhythm did not differ between RBD patients and healthy control subjects. Melatonin profile in RBD patients was delayed by 2 h compared to controls, the habitual sleep phases were phase delayed by about 1 h, however no phase shift occurred in any of the clock genes studied. The control group had stable acrophases of melatonin rhythms of approximately 5 h whereas the RBD patients had a more dispersed range over 11 h.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that RBD could be associated with altered expression of clock genes and delayed melatonin secretion. Thus, we argue that circadian system dysregulation could play a role in RBD. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE REM sleep behavior disorder; Alpha-synuclein; Parotid gland
ID DEPOSITS; IMMUNOREACTIVITY
AB Background: The neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the presence of aggregates of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (pAS) in the nervous system.
   Method: We report a patient with video-polysomnography-confirmed idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder that underwent parotidectomy because of parotid gland cancer. Immunohistochemistry of the gland tissue revealed abundant pAS deposits. One year after surgery the patient was diagnosed with PD. Prompted by this observation we examined the parotid gland in 10 consecutive individuals that underwent elective parotidectomy irrespective of their clinical condition.
   Results: One had PD and another had mild parkinsonian signs plus reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the striatum. Both had pAS deposits in the parotid gland. The remaining eight subjects had no neurological signs and pAS was found in one of them.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that the parotid gland may contain pAS pathology in the prodromal stage of PD and in manifested PD. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   LIFE; DECLINE; DISORDERS; INSOMNIA; IMPAIRMENT; NIGHTMARES
AB Objective: To investigate the associations between sleep disturbances in mid-life and late-life and late-life cognitive status.
   Methods: In four population-based studies (three Swedish studies: H70 study, Kungsholmen Project (KP) and The Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old (SWEOLD); and one Finnish study: Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE)), participants provided self-reports on insomnia, nightmares and general sleep problems. Late-life cognitive status was measured by the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). The associations between late-life sleep disturbances and cognition 3-11 years later were investigated across all studies (n = 3210). Mean baseline ages were 70 (CAIDE, H70 and SWEOLD), and 84 years (KP). Additional analyses examined the association between midlife sleep and late-life cognition using CAIDE (21 and 31 years follow-up, n = 1306, mean age 50 years), and SWEOLD (20-24 years follow-up, n = 2068, mean age 58 years). Ordered logistic regressions, adjusted for potential baseline confounders, were used in the analyses.
   Results: Late-life sleep disturbances were associated with poorer cognition after 3-11 years (fully adjusted beta = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.24 to -0.01). Midlife nightmares and insomnia were also associated with lower MMSE scores (fully adjusted beta = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.49 to -0.07 and beta = -0.20, 95% CI = -0.39 to -0.01), although the latter association was attenuated after adjusting for lifestyle/health-related confounders. Midlife general sleep problems were not associated with late-life MMSE performance.
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbances and midlife nightmares were associated with lower MMSE scores, which suggests that sleep disturbances in earlier life stages can be associated with worse late-life cognition. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID RISK; DURATION; QUALITY; HYPNOTICS
AB Background: Previous studies have investigated the association between sleep duration, insomnia, daytime napping and metabolic syndrome individually, but never conjointly. In addition, the association with sleep medication use has yet to be investigated. We aimed to examine the associations between these sleep-related characteristics and the metabolic syndrome, individually and conjointly, in a population-based cohort.
   Material and methods: We used cross-sectional data of 1679 participants from the New Hoorn study, 52.6% women and age 60.8 thorn 6.4y. Sleep duration, insomnia, and day-time napping were measured using validated questionnaires. The use of sleep medication was documented by the registration of dispensing labels. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to ATP III. Linear and Poisson regressions were used, and all analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education level, job status, smoking, physical activity, depression and BMI.
   Results: In our population-based cohort, 447 (26.6%) persons had the metabolic syndrome. Individual associations showed that, after correction, day-time napping for <= 30 min and >30 min was associated with a prevalence ratio for the metabolic syndrome of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.1-1.5) and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.4-2.2), respectively, compared to participants who did not nap. Sleep duration, insomnia, and sleep medication use were not associated with the metabolic syndrome individually. However, conjointly analyses showed that, after correction, having >= 2 sleep-related characteristics was associated with a PR of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.0-1.8) of having the metabolic syndrome, compared to having no sleep-related characteristics.
   Conclusion: Sleep-related characteristics were associated with a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the general population. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL-THERAPY; QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA;
   CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; PARAMETERS; ADULTS
AB Objective: Insomnia identity refers to the conviction that one has insomnia, which can occur independently of poor sleep. Night-to-night variability in sleep (termed intraindividual variability [IIV]) may contribute to insomnia identity yet remain undetected via conventional mean analyses. This study compared sleep IIV across four subgroups: noncomplaining good sleepers (NG), complaining poor sleepers (CP), complaining good sleepers (CG), and noncomplaining poor sleepers (NP).
   Methods: This study analyzed 14 days of sleep diary data from 723 adults. Participants were classified according to presence/absence of a sleep complaint and presence/absence of poor sleep. A 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed to explore differences on five measures of sleep IIV: intraindividual standard deviation in total sleep time (iSD TST), sleep onset latency (iSD SOL), wake after sleep onset (iSD WASO), number of nightly awakenings (iSD NWAK), and sleep efficiency (iSD SE).
   Results: MANCOVA revealed significant main effects of poor sleep, sleep complaint, and their interaction on sleep IIV. Poor sleepers exhibited greater IIV across all sleep parameters compared to good sleepers. Similarly, individuals with a sleep complaint exhibited greater IIV compared to individuals with no complaint. The interaction revealed that iSD SOL was significantly greater among CP than NP, and iSD NWAK was significantly greater among CG than NG.
   Conclusions: Greater night-to-night variability in specific sleep parameters was present among complaining versus noncomplaining sleepers in good and poor sleep subgroups. These findings suggest certain aspects of sleep consistency may be salient for treatment-seeking individuals based on their quantitative sleep status. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives/background: Objectives were to (1) examine previous night's sleep in relation to next day performance on standardized academic achievement and neurocognitive assessments in adolescents, and (2) explore whether previous night's sleep is differentially associated with testing performance for adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Participants/methods: Participants were 300 adolescents (ages 12-14 years; 55% male). Approximately half (53.6%) were diagnosed with ADHD. Adolescents provided ratings of their previous night's sleep quality, sleep duration, and number of night wakings and were administered standardized tests of processing speed and working memory, as well as word reading, numerical operations, and math fluency academic achievement.
   Results: In analyses controlling for sex, race, medication use, time of testing, and ADHD group status, more night wakings the previous night were associated with significantly lower numerical operations and math fluency achievement scores and marginally lower working memory scores. Previous night's sleep was not associated with processing speed or reading achievement. ADHD status did not moderate sleep in relation to academic/neurocognitive performance. Participants reporting >= 2 night wakings the previous night had slightly over half a standard deviation lower scores on average compared to participants reporting 0 night wakings.
   Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that previous night's wakings are associated with poorer mathematics performance the next day, regardless of ADHD status. This may be due to the detrimental effect of interrupted and fragmented sleep on attention and executive control. These findings have implications for clinicians and educators when considering contextual factors that may impact academic and neurocognitive testing performance. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Using actigraphy to assess sleep and wake rhythms of narcolepsy type 1
   patients: a comparison with primary insomniacs and healthy controls
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Actigraphy; Narcolepsy type 1; Primary insomnia
ID BURDEN
AB Objective/background: It has been shown that actigraphy may have a discriminant function (DS) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 patients (NT1), based on a combination of nighttime and daytime parameters. Here, we aimed to test those findings using another actigraph model with a different clinical sample as control (ie, primary insomniacs, PI), carrying out a secondary analysis of previously collected data.
   Patients/methods: The study sample consisted of 13 NT1 (nine females; mean age 39.38 +/- 11.48), 13 PI (nine females; mean age 38.69 +/- 10.72) and 13 Healthy Controls (HC) (nine females; mean age 38 +/- 10.77). Participants wore the Actiwatch AW64 (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd, Cambridge, UK) around the non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days.
   Results: Significant differences between groups were observed with a higher number of episodes of wakefulness (wake bouts, WB) in PI than HC, a higher fragmentation index (FI) in NT1 than HC and PI, a higher duration of the longest nap (LNAP) in NT1 than HC and PI and higher DS in PI and NT1 than HC. A new DS (NDS), with LNAP and FI as independent variables, was proposed; which was higher in NT1 than HC and PI.
   Conclusions: The present study confirms that actigraphy discriminates NT1 from HC. However, considering PI, a new discriminant function NDS which takes into account LNAP and FI is better for this actigraph model. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Pain intensity as a moderator of the association between opioid use and

ID LOW-BACK-PAIN; SLEEP QUALITY; RISK-FACTORS; DISTURBANCE; COMPLAINTS;
   VETERANS; CRITERIA; THERAPY
AB Objective: Research documenting the impact of opioid use on sleep among individuals with chronic pain has been mixed. This study aimed to determine if pain intensity moderates the association between opioid use and insomnia symptoms among adults with comorbid symptoms of insomnia and chronic widespread pain.
   Methods: Participants (N = 144; 95% female; mean age = 51.6, SD = 11.4) completed assessments of insomnia symptoms, pain and use of sleep/pain medication. Multiple regression was used to determine if pain intensity moderates the association between opioid use (yes/no) sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep quality, or time in bed. Analyses controlled for gender, symptoms of sleep apnea, symptoms of depression, use of sleep medication (yes/no), and use of non-opioid pain medication (yes/no).
   Results: Stronger pain intensity was associated with longer self-reported WASO and worse sleep quality, independent of opioid use. Conversely, opioid use was associated with longer time in bed, independent of pain intensity. Opioid use and pain intensity interacted in the prediction of SOL, such that opioid use (vs. non-use) was associated with longer SOL in the context of mild but not moderate to severe pain intensity.
   Conclusions: Opioid use was associated with more difficulty falling asleep among adults with chronic pain; however, this cross-sectional effect was only significant among those reporting lower pain intensity. Authors speculate that this effect is masked among those with severe pain because the pain-related sleep debt they acquire throughout the night then facilitates sleep onset the next day.

ID CHILD SLEEP; ASSOCIATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; BEDTIME;
   HEALTH; WAKING; RISK
AB Background: Sleep quality in early life has implications for individual and family well-being [19]. Parenting in the early months may be highly influential on infant sleep patterns and trajectories.
   Method: This study used observational and survey data to investigate how sleeping arrangement and two types of nighttime interventions at one and three months (non-distress-initiated and distress-initiated) are associated with infants' sleep development across the first nine months. Distress-initiated interventions were identified as parents' responses to infants' distress signals whereas non-distress initiated interventions were identified as parents' behaviors in response to non-distressed vocalizations or while infants were asleep.
   Results: Analysis from 107 families revealed that infant night wakings decreased over time as expected. The link between early non-distress initiated interventions and rate of change in infant night wakings was significantly moderated by sleep arrangement such that solitary sleeping infants who experienced higher levels of non-distress-initiated interventions showed a less steep decline across time in infant night wakings compared to solitary infants who experienced low levels of non-distress-initiated interventions. Results also showed that higher levels of distress-initiated interventions at one and three months were associated with a steeper decrease in infant night wakings for both solitary and cosleeping infants. Notably, these findings were not replicated when parental interventions as predictors of infant sleep were examined at later points in the first year.
   Conclusions: Results inform conceptualizations of parenting competence in infant sleep contexts during the first few months of life and how best to promote infant sleep regulation across the first year. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sleep habits in infants: the role of maternal education
SO SLEEP MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Pediatric sleep; Sleep habits; Maternal education; Early postpartum
ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; NIGHT; INTERVENTION; ASSOCIATIONS
AB Objective: Sleep disturbances are frequent in infants. Early development of sleep routines has a positive effect on sleep quality. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of maternal education on the development of infants' sleep habits (SHs).
   Methods: This was an experimental, longitudinal study. Postnatal mothers were allocated into two groups: to receive (intervention group, IG), or not receive (control group, CG) information on sleep hygiene. Individual 15-min sessions were provided and a leaflet was handed to the IG. A questionnaire on infants' SHs was applied by telephone/e-mail at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
   Results: At least three questionnaires were answered by 314 mothers. Results were adjusted for maternal age, education, and race. In the IG, infants acquired more independent sleep habits, an effect still present at six months; slept more frequently in their own beds; adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.1-13.5); fell asleep more frequently alone (ORadj, 4.29; 95% CI, 2.4-7.6); fell asleep more frequently in their own beds (ORadj, 6.1; 95% CI, 3.5-10.6) and needed less breast/bottle feeding to fall asleep (ORadj, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6). The autonomy was greater in IG infants after night awakenings; also until six months they went back to sleep more frequently alone (ORadj, 3.88; 95% CI, 2-7.5) and needed less breast/bottle feeding (ORadj, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3). No differences were found regarding the need for light, television or other routines to fall asleep or after night awakenings.
   Conclusion: Maternal education is positively associated with the adoption of autonomous SHs in infants. Early maternal education is an adequate prevention strategy to be considered in neonatal care. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with increased memory problems although the ability to complete daily life activities remains relatively intact. This study examined: (1) if sleep disturbance increased the hazard of MCI; (2) if APOE e4 carriers with sleep disturbance experience an increased risk of MCI; and, (3) if prescription sleep medications provide a protective effect against MCI. We hypothesized that sleep disturbance increases the hazard of MCI, this relationship is stronger among APOE e4 carriers reporting a sleep disturbance. Furthermore, we hypothesized that sleep medications decrease the hazard of MCI.
   Methods: To determine whether sleep medication mediates the risk of developing MCI for individuals with sleep disturbance and/or APOE e4, we analyzed the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. We selected participants with normal cognition at baseline (n = 6798), and conduced survival analyses.
   Results: Our main findings indicated that the hazard of MCI was significantly associated with sleep disturbance. The hazard remained among those who did not use sleep medication. Trazodone and zolpidem users did not have a significant hazard of MCI, but the significant hazard remained for those who did not use these medications. APOE e4 carriers had a significantly higher hazard of MCI. Among e4 carriers who used trazodone or zolpidem, there was not a statistically significant risk of MCI.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated the potential utilization of trazodone and zolpidem in the treatment of sleep disturbance while potentially mitigating the risk of MCI. While trazodone and zolpidem have been shown to positively impact sleep disturbance in individuals with normal cognition, further research should explore these findings given that these medications are potentially inappropriate for older adults.

AB The preference of the sleep/wake cycle can be grouped into categories or chronotypes. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to poor sleep quality which correlates with disease severity. Social jet lag (SJL) is the difference between sleep timing on work and free days and is a marker for circadian misalignment which has been linked to increased inflammation. We investigated whether chronotype, SJL, sleep debt (SD), and food timing were associated with an IBD specific complications and a lower quality of life. Overall, 191 subjects (115 IBD subjects and 76 healthy controls (HC)) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), and a structured Food Timing Questionnaire. Later chronotype (by MEQ) was associated with a worse SIBDQ (r = -0.209; P < 0.05). SJL was increased in IBD at 1.32 h +/- 1.03 vs. 1.05 h +/- 0.97 in HC, P < 0.05, when adjusted for age. SJL (>2 h) was present in 40% of severe/complicated Crohn's patients (fistulizing or structuring Crohn's or history of Crohn's related surgery) compared to only 16% of uncomplicated Crohn's patients (P < 0.05). Sleep debt was increased in IBD subjects compared to HC at 21.90 m +/- 25.37 vs. 11.49 m +/- 13.58, P < 0.05. IBD subjects with inconsistent breakfast or dinner times had lower SIBDQ scores (4.78 +/- 1.28 vs. 5.49 +/- 1.02, P < 0.05; 4.95 +/- 0.31 vs. 5.42 +/- 0.32, P < 0.05 respectively). In summary, later chronotype, and markers of circadian misalignment (social jet lag, sleep debt, and inconsistent meal timing) were associated with IBD disease specific complications and/or lower quality of life.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin capable of producing a variety of toxic effects in human and animals. In this study, the effect of DON treatment on cytotoxicity and apoptotic pathways in piglet hippocampal nerve cells (PHNCs) was determined. The effects of DON on cellular morphology, cell activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, the protein expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the relative expression of key genes related to apoptosis were evaluated. The results indicated that DON significantly inhibited cellular viability and promoted the release of LDH by damaging the membrane integrity of PHNCs, however, the cellular viability was increased and LDH leakage rate were decreased after adding MAPK inhibitors. DON induced PHNCs apoptosis and phosphorylation of MAPK pathway proteins dose-dependently. The ratios of phospho p-JNK/JNK and p-p38/p38 significantly increased with the increase of DON concentration, while the p-ERK/ERK ratio significantly decreased. In addition, DON upregulated the BAX mRNA level, and downregulated the BCL2 mRNA level. Pre-incubation with inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and p38 (SB202190) significantly decreases the BAX/BCL2 ratio. However, pre-incubation with the inhibitor of ERK (U0126), significantly increased the BAX/BCL2 ratio. These data demonstrated that DON induces toxic effects and apoptosis in PHNCs via the MAPK signaling pathway.

AB Zearalenone (ZEN) causes serious diseases in both animals and humans and thereby leads to substantial economic losses. The elimination of ZEN contamination from food and feed is an important concern worldwide. This study aimed to screen a bacterium that can efficiently detoxify ZEN both in vitro and in vivo. A bacterium (designated BC7) with high ZEN-removing capability was isolated from mouldy contaminated feeds and characterized as Bacillus cereus based on biochemical and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses. BC7 could remove 100% and 89.31% of 10 mg/L ZEN in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and simulated gastric fluid (GSF), respectively, within 24 hat 37 degrees C. The effects of BC7 on ZEN detoxification and on the intestinal flora were further evaluated using four groups of mice that were intragastrically administered normal saline, BC7 culture (CFU = 3.45 x 10(8)/mL), ZEN (10 mg/kg BW) or BC7 culture (CFU = 3.45 x 10(8)/mL) + ZEN (10 mg/kg BW) for 2 weeks. ZEN showed distinct reproductive and hepatic toxicity, as characterized by increased weights of the uterus and liver, altered levels of oestradiol (E2) and luteinizing hormone (LH), increased secretion of the liver injury biomarkers alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and abnormal histological phenotypes for the uterus, ovary and liver. However, BC7 could significantly reduce all the above-mentioned adverse effects caused by ZEN with no harmful effect on the reproductive system and liver in mice. Moreover, the addition of BC7 could efficiently renormalize the ZEN-induced perturbation of the gut microbiota and significantly increase the abundance of Lactobacillus to maintain the health of the intestinal flora in mice. In conclusion, Bacillus cereus BC7 could be used as a potential feed additive to efficiently remove ZEN in vitro or in vivo and to normalize the disordered gut microbiota in mice.

AB Patulin often contaminates fruits and fruit-base products, which seriously threats the health of consumers. In this study, ozone was used to degrade patulin in aqueous solution, and investigated the cytotoxicity of patulin after ozone detoxification on human hepatic carcinoma cells (HepG2) using MTT assay and apoptosis assay. Patulin was rapidly degraded from 24.59 mg/L to 9.85 mg/L within 180 s by 10.60 mg/L of ozone at a flow rate of 90 mL/min, and reduced by 59.94%. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of patulin on HepG2 cells was 9.32 mu mol/L after 24 h of exposure, and it showed a dose dependent effect. After 90 s of ozone detoxification, the cell viability of HepG2 cells obviously increased from 42.31% to 93.96%, and the total apoptotic cells significantly reduced from 22.24% to 11.18% after 180 s of ozone treatment. The results clearly show the great potential of ozone in degrading patulin in liquid foods.

AB Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is a diatom species associated with the production of domoic acid (DA), a water soluble neurotoxin that is easily transferred up in the food web, causing devastating effects on top marine organisms and humans. Despite studies on Pseudo-nitzschia are relevant to human health safety, partitioning of marine toxins between intracellular and extracellular fractions are poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the growth rates and DA content, both intracellular and extracellular, of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures at three different light settings (15, 120 and 560 mu mol m(-2) S-1). The optimal conditions for cell growth were observed at 120 and 560 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas DA production was observed in P. multiseries at 15 and 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), ranging between 0.18-2.56 and 0.16-3.5 pg DA cell(-1), respectively. Higher intracellular DA concentrations were found during the senescence phase at low light intensity and during the exponential phase at medium light intensity, while higher concentrations of dissolved DA were found at low and medium light intensities in the senescence phase reaching 3 and long DA mL(-1) respectively. The amount of toxin released into the culture medium represents the most important fraction ranging between 63 and 98% during the exponential phase and nearly 99% during the senescence phase. In contrast, under low light intensity, dissolved DA was detected in the culture medium only during the senescence phase. This study confirms the importance of light intensity on DA production and clearly shows that dissolved domoic acid is an important fraction in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures, suggesting with the careful assumptions of results from static cultures extrapolated to bloom situations that waterborne exposure of marine organism should be considered during blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.

AB This work evaluated the feasibility of using toxoids obtained by gamma radiation in the production of anti venoms in small and large animals. Mixtures of African snake venoms from viperids or elapids were used. The viperid mixture contained the crude venom of five species of the genera Echis and Bids, while the elapid mixture contained the crude venom of six species of the genera Naja and Dendroaspis. The viperid mixture had an LD50 of 1.25 mg/kg in mice, and the elapid mixture had an LD50 of 0.46 mg/kg. Both viper and elapid aqueous mixtures were subjected to Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation in three physical states: lyophilized, frozen and liquid. Radiation doses ranged from 0.5 to 100 kGy. The LD(50)s of the lyophilized and frozen mixtures of both viperid and elapid mixtures remained unaltered with radiation doses as high as 100 kGy; nevertheless, in the liquid state, doses of 3.5 and 5.5 kGy reduced the venom toxicity of both the viperid and elapid mixtures to 7.25 mg/kg and 1.74 mg/kg; less toxic by factors of 5.8 and 3.8, respectively. Groups of four rabbits and three horses were immunized with either irradiated or non-irradiated mixtures. In vitro and in vivo analysis of the rabbit and horse sera revealed that neutralizing antibodies were produced against both irradiated (toxoids) and native venom mixtures. None of the animals used in this study, either immunized with native venom or toxoids, developed severe local effects due to the application of venoms mixtures. Gamma-irradiated detoxified venoms mixtures, under well controlled and studied conditions, could be a practical alternative for the production of polyvalent equine serum with high neutralization potency against snake venoms.

AB Objective: To report the results of functional outcome, dose trend and relationship between onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA) dosage and the severity of disease or time between therapy sessions in patients affected by adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD).
   Patients and methods: Thirty-two patients underwent 193 EMG-guided intracordal injections of a starting dose of 2 MU of onabotA. At enrollment, each subject was administered the VHI. The response was evaluated using a subjective rating scale (0-100% of normal phonation).
   Results: The quality of voice improved significantly after 1 month and stabilized by 3 months. The percentage of normal voice improved 33.34 +/- 11.5% (min 26 - max 68). The functional gain was significantly worse in patients presenting with ADSD associated with dystonias in other body regions (31% vs 45% - p < 0.05). The mean dose employed was 3.64 MU (min 1 - max 6) with a trend of increasing dosages up to the 5th treatment after which the doses stabilized over time. The pre-treatment VHI showed a weakly positive correlation with the cumulative dose at the 5th and 10th injections. Benefit duration and the mean between treatment interval were 103 and 136 days respectively. The correlation between dose and inter-injection time is weakly negative (r = -0.22, p < 0.05), however, this is influenced predominantly by the first-to-second injection. After this initial treatment effect, the correlation becomes weakly positive (r = 0.12).
   Conclusions: Our data confirm the efficacy of onabotA to improve the quality of voice in cases of ADSD. The trial period for optimal dosage lasted up to a mean of five injections. The dosage of onabotA impacted the length of response and was influenced by the severity of ADSD. Finally the efficacy of onabotA did not change significantly after repeated administrations.

AB The beta-strand stem release system of staphylococcal beta-barrel pore-forming toxin gamma-hemolysin was investigated. Mutations at K15 and R16 in the cap domain of Hlg2 decreased hemolytic activity more markedly than their effect on erythrocyte binding. In addition, D122N mutation of LukF prestem lost the activity with Hlg2 R16A, indicating that electrostatic interactions between residues in the Hlg2 cap and prestem of adjacent LukF in the ring-shaped complex might serve as a switch for stem release.

AB An external standard of goniodomin A (GDA) was prepared from a strain of Alexandrium pseudogonyaulax originating from New Zealand and its chemical structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using the GDA standard, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) method in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was developed for separation and quantification of GDA. This method was successfully applied to planktonic field samples collected during an oceanographic expedition conducted with R/V Uthorn along the Danish west coast, Limfjord and Kattegat in June 2016. In addition, this method was used to characterize goniodomin (GD) profiles of 17 A. pseudogonyaulax strains from the coastal North Sea and from Limfjord. Highest GDA levels were found in Limfjord (up to 590 ng NT-1 m(-1)), but GDA was also detected in the North Sea appearing at the latitude of Sylt Island northwards and in Kattegat from the eastern mouth of Limfjord down to the Kiel Bight, but at lower abundances than within Limfjord. This is the first reported detection of GDA in planktonic field samples. Chemical analysis of 17 strains of A. pseudogonyaulax revealed that all strains were producers of GDA (5-35 pg cell(-1)) as well as in most cases minor amounts (0.01-0.07 pg cell(-1), expressed as GDA equivalents) of goniodomin B (GDB).

AB This work aimed to develop and validate a method to detect and quantify protodioscin in Brachiaria grasses using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Samples were extracted by acetonitrile-water 50:50 v/v mixture and ultrasonication. The mobile phase consisted of 5 mM ammonium acetate in water-methanol and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The parameters used to validate the method for determining protodioscin comprised determination of the selectivity, ionization suppression/enhancement (matrix effect), linearity of the calibration curve, the limit of detection (LOD), the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), and the precision and accuracy of the method. The LLOQ of protodioscin was determined as 0.1 mu g mL(-1), and the LOD was 0.03 mu g mL(-1). The developed method was applied for determining protodioscin levels in B. decumbens collected from three pastures where sheep showed clinical signs of photosensitization. The obtained values ranged from 0.71% to 1.12%. Thus, the developed method for determining protodioscin in Brachiaria grasses by LC coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed high accuracy, precision, and sensitivity.

AB This study describes the application of at-line nanofractionation to the screening of snake venoms for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the detection of proteins of interest, and their partial or full identification. A method was developed to identify bioactive peptides in crude snake venoms based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC), with parallel nanofractionation onto 384-well plates and mass spectrometry (MS). Bioactivity assays were based on a resazurin-reduction assay. Accurate masses of the bioactive peptides were determined, and peptides were then identified via nanoLC MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests, allowing full or partial identification of the bioactive proteins. Crude venoms from 41 species were screened for their antibacterial bioactivity. Venoms showing the highest activity were further screened using at line nanofractionation, which resulted in the elucidation of 28 bioactive proteins.

AB Anionic exchange is an effective treatment option for the removal of natural organic matter from surface waters. However, the management of the spent brine regenerant often limits the adoption of this process. The current study reports one year of operation of ion exchange resins under biological mode (BIEX, i.e. without regeneration to promote biofilm growth on the media) compared to the performance of (i) ion exchange with weekly regeneration (IEX), (ii) granular activated carbon under biological mode (BAC) and (ii) granular activated carbon under adsorption mode (GAC). Four parallel pilot filters (GAC, BAC, IEX and BIEX) were fed with a colored and turbid river water without pretreatment. Although IEX provided the best performance (80% DOC removal) throughout the study, BIEX achieved a similar performance to IEX prior to DOC breakthrough (92 days) and subsequently achieved a mean DOC removal of 62% in warm water conditions. The GAC filter was rapidly exhausted (2 weeks) while the BAC filter only provided a 5% DOC reduction. Full nitrification was observed on both the BIEX and BAC filters under warm water conditions (>15 degrees C). After one year of operation, BIEX was successfully regenerated with brine. According to a mass balance, 69% of DOC removal in BIEX was due to ion exchange while we assume the remainder was biodegraded. Operation of ion exchange in biological mode is a promising option to reduce spent brine production while still achieving high DOC removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The formation of odorous aldehydes and N-chloraldimines, and also nitriles, which are potentially hazardous to human health, was investigated in studies of the chlorination of amino acids (AAs) in both operational drinking water treatment plants and laboratory-based experiments. In the drinking water treatment plants studied, the concentration of total free AAs did not significantly change after treatment, even though good removal of DOC was observed. However, free AAs still contributed less than 3% of total nitrogen in the treated drinking waters, and no aldehydes, N-chloraldimines or nitriles of interest were detected in the treated waters, presumably due to the low concentrations of the precursor AAs in these water samples. Laboratory formation potential experiments showed that carboxylic acids can form from the degradation of aldehydes and nitriles. Volatile carboxylic acids could result in odour issues and some carboxylic acids may be of potential health concern. Therefore, carboxylic acids should also be considered as potential by-products of interest in distribution systems with long contact times of >= 7days. A higher proportion of nitrile formation, and promotion of carboxylic acid formation, was observed when the chlorine to AA ratio was greater than 4 compared to when this ratio was 2.8, indicating that the Cl:AA ratio is an important factor in DBP formation pathways. This suggests that results from laboratory formation studies undertaken at these low Cl:AA ratios cannot be directly applied to 'real' water systems, which typically have Cl:AA ratios that are orders of magnitude higher than 4. Laboratory formation potential experiments also showed that the short-term rate of formation of aldehydes and N-chloraldimines was reduced in the presence of ammonia, although formation over longer timescales (e.g. 7 days) was not significantly different between chlorination and chloramination experiments. Therefore, the use of chloramination instead of chlorination does not appear to reduce the formation of these by-products from AAs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been widely used in sludge treatment for biogas recovery, organic fraction stabilization, and sludge reduction. However, after AD, sludge filterability is extremely deteriorated due to the release of biopolymers and the formation of fine particles. AD sludge is generally rich in nutrients, mainly ammonium nitrogen and phosphates, that result from biopolymer degradation. We designed a conditioning process that combines the in-situ crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP), as a skeleton builder, with organic polymer flocculation. We show that crystallized MAP can bind with extracellular polymeric substance fractions to increase sludge floc density. The molecular structure and electrical charge of organic polymers importantly influence sludge particle flocculation and aggregation. We found that cationic polyacrylamides form flocs that aggregate with branching structures which are characterized by a larger size and a more compact structure. Simultaneous crystallization and flocculation produced by a magnesium organic polymer gel improved AD dewaterability more than the separate addition of magnesium ions and organic polymers. The method of sludge conditioning that we propose was tested by extensive use in different AD sludge conditioning protocols. The method reduces the ammonium nitrogen load in AD liquor and increases the suitability of the biosolids for use as land fertilizer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were determined in activated sludge, which was exposed to endogenous conditions for 36 days and contained a wide diversity of organisms across several trophic levels. The aim of this study was to elucidate the fluctuation of delta N-13 and delta N-15 through trophic transfer in the microbial consortia. The sludge was evaluated in view of sludge mass, bacterial community, higher trophic organisms, sludge delta C-13 and delta N-15, and delta N-15 and delta O-18 of nitrate. The results show that the activated sludge became more enriched with N-15 as degradation proceeded. Eventually, the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid concentrations in the activated sludge decreased from 1610 to 710 mg/L and the delta N-15 of the sludge increased from 8.3%o to 10.8%0. In contrast, the delta C-13 values of the sludge were stable. Microscope observations confirmed that consumers such as Rotifera, Tardigrada and Annelida (Aelosoma sp.) were present in the activated sludge for the entire operational period. The abundance of those organisms drastically changed during the operational periods, and the diversity in bacterial community also changed, resulting in community succession. Changes in biotic community, reduction in sludge mass, and increase in delta N-15 of the sludge occurred during the sludge degradation processes. This implies that the sludge degradation was partly caused by the trophic conversion of the sludge-derived nitrogen in the food web. The delta N-15 of the sludge can be used as an indicator of the sludge degradation through trophic transfer in wastewater treatment reactors. These findings provide new insights into understanding trophic transfer during microbial community succession and the effects of the feeding process on sludge degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biodegradation of glyphosate (GLP) and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was numerically assessed for a vineyard and a wheat field in the Po Valley, Italy. Calculation of the Hazard Quotient suggested that GLP and AMPA can pose a risk of aquifer contamination in the top 1.5 m depth within 50 years of GLP use. Numerical results relative to soil GLP and AMPA concentrations, and GLP age, half life, and turnover time show that GLP was equivalently removed through hydrolysis and oxidation, but the latter produced AMPA. Biodegradation processes in the root zone removed more than 90% of applied GLP and more than 23% of the produced AMPA between two consecutive applications. Doubling organic carbon availability enhanced GLP and AMPA biodegradation, especially GLP hydrolysis to sarcosine. This work highlights that GLP and AMPA removal is controlled by soil water dynamics that depend on ecohydrological boundary conditions, and by carbon sources availability to biodegraders.

AB The development of new biomaterials for the remove of organic contaminants from wastewater has attracted much attention over the few past years. One of the most cost-effective approaches is to produce new high value biomaterials from low value solid agricultural biowastes. In this work, sugarcane bagasse and agricultural waste rich in reducing sugars, acted as both a green bioreductant for graphene oxide (GO) and a sustainable supporter for the immobilization of Burkholderia cepacia. Therefore, this new biomaterial which contained both reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and Burkholderia cepacia, was cable of initial adsorption of malachite green (MG) and its subsequent biodegradation. After 60 h, immobilized Burkholderia cepacia degraded more MG (98.5%) than a cell cultured Burkholderia cepacia (87.7%) alone. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that GO was successfully reduced by bagasse and that consequently a composite (B-RGO) was prepared. SEM indicated that Burkholderia cepacia was well immobilized and kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of MG onto the developed composite fitted a pseudo-second order kinetics model (R-2 > 0.99). Biodegradation of MG, was confirmed by the detection of appropriate degradation products such as N, N-dimethylaniline and 4-(Dimethylamino) benzophenone using GC-MS, UV and FT-IR, and via best fit first-order biodegration kinetics. Furthermore, a response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the removal process by varying four independent parameters using a Box-Behnken design (BBD). Optimum MG removal (99.3%) was achieved at 31.5 degrees C, with an initial MG concentration of 114.5 mg L-1, initial pH of 5.85, and an adsorbent dosage of 0.11 g L-1. The excellent removal efficiency indicated that agricultural waste derived reduced graphene oxide bio-adsorbents have significant potential for the removal of dyes such as MG from industrial wastewaters.

AB The removal and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water treatment systems is of interest given the widespread occurrence of CECs in water supplies and increase in direct potable reuse of wastewater. In this study, CEC removal was investigated in pilot-scale biologically-active granular activated carbon (GAC)-sand and anthracite-sand filters under different hydraulic loading rates and influent CEC concentrations over a 15-month period. Eight of the most commonly detected compounds in a survey of CEC occurrence in drinking water were selected for this study: atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, metolachlor, sulfamethoxazole and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). GAC-sand biofilters provided superior CEC removal for all compounds (mean removal efficiencies: 49.1-94.4%) compared to anthracite-sand biofilters (mean removal efficiencies: 0-66.1%) due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation. Adsorption was determined to be the dominant removal mechanism for most selected CECs, except fluoxetine, which had the greatest biodegradation rate constant (0.93 0.15 min(-1) at 20-28 degrees C). The mean removal efficiency decreased by 16.5% when the loading rate increased from 2 to 4 gpm/ft(2) (4.88-9.76 m/h). A significant reduction in CEC removal was observed after 100,000 bed volumes when the influent CEC concentration was low (100-200 ng/L), whereas no significant reduction was observed during spike dosing (1000-3000 ng/L). A regression analysis suggested that biodegradation rate, hydraulic loading rate, influent CEC concentration, throughput, influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and CEC charge are important parameters for predicting CEC removal performance in GAC-sand biofilters.

AB Treatment combining membrane bioreactors (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) is becoming an emerging wastewater treatment strategy. The combined process is capable of producing high quality water potentially reusable; however, diverse compositions of MBR effluents induce several types and degrees of NF membrane fouling that impacts process productivity. Moreover, since MBR effluent composition for one type of wastewater source is variable depending on the MBR efficiency at different periods, downstream NF membrane fouling types and degrees may consequently change over time.
   In that context, the present paper aims at developing effective fouling control strategies of NF membrane in the case of the filtration of MBR effluents taken from a MBR system installed in a French hospital. These effluents were filtrated under various transmembrane pressures, and stable fluxes during these filtrations were determined. Several types and degrees of fouling mechanisms were then identified through surface morphology observation and the analysis of chemical compositions of fouled membranes. The diverse flux behaviour was further associated with the fouling mechanisms and foulant compositions. Based on the study of these mechanisms, the quantitative link between stable fluxes and calcium phosphate concentrations in MBR effluents has been established. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fish manipulation has been used to restore lakes in the temperate zone. Often strong short-term cascading effects have been obtained, but the long term-perspectives are less clear. Fish manipulation methods are far less advanced for warm lakes, and it is debatable whether it is, in fact, possible to create a trophic cascade in warm lakes due to the dominance and high densities of fast-reproducing omnivorous fish. However, removal of benthic feeding fish also reduce disturbance of the sediment, which not only affects the nutrient level but also the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic matter with enhanced water clarity and potentially better growth conditions for submerged macrophytes. We conducted a biomanipulation experiment in one of the basins in Chinese Huizhou West Lake that have remained highly turbid after extensive nutrient loading reduction. Another basin was used as control (control-treatment pairing design). Removal of a substantial amount of plankti-benthivorous fish was followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish. We found strong and relatively long-lasting effects of the restoration initiative in the form of substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in nutrient concentrations, particularly total phosphorus, phyto-plankton and turbidity, while only minor effects were detected for crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low densities before as well as after the restoration. Our results add importantly to the existing knowledge of restoration of warm lakes and are strongly relevant, not least in Asia where natural lakes frequently are used extensively for fish production, often involving massive stocking of benthivorous fish. With a growing economy and development of more efficient fish production systems, the interest in restoring lakes is increasing world-wide. We found convincing evidence that fish removal and piscivores stocking combined with transplantation of submerged macrophytes may have significant effects on water clarity in warm shallow lakes even if the zooplankton grazing potential remains low, the latter most likely as a result of high predation on the zooplankton.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as flame retardants in a variety of products, including textiles. PBDEs are thus exposed to the natural environment, including wastewater, water-bodies and sediments (at different phases of products' lifecycles), where they will interact with other pollutants. Studies on the interactions between organic pollutants and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in natural waters are rare. In this study, we investigated the effects of two common PBDEs-BDE 47 and BDE 209-on the physicochemical properties and colloidal stability of TiO2 NP in simple aqueous media and two natural waters (river water and wastewater). Upon the addition of BDE 47 and BDE 209, the zeta (zeta) potential of TiO2 NP increased in magnitude in artificial waters and in natural waters (river water and wastewater), but the magnitude of influence on the NP's surface charge was specific to each natural water considered. Despite the presence of high content of natural organic matter in river water (DOC = 15.8 mg/L) and wastewater (DOC = 26.1 mg/L), low levels of the PBDEs (e.g. 0.5 mg/L) strongly impacted the surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter of TiO2 NP. Both PBDE congeners suppressed the agglomeration of TiO2 NP in the presence of monovalent and divalent cations, and in both natural waters. BDE 47 exhibited a stronger influence than BDE 209 on the surface charge, hydrodynamic diameter, and agglomeration of TiO2 NP in both artificial and natural waters. As such, the interactions between TiO2 NP and the PBDEs can increase the exposure of aquatic organisms to both pollutants. Infrared spectroscopy showed the importance of the aromatic ether groups in the adsorption of PBDEs to TiO2 NP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of iron-dosing in the sewer system, on wastewater treatment processes, was investigated using laboratory-scale wastewater systems comprising sewers, wastewater treatment reactors, sludge thickeners, and anaerobic sludge digesters. Two systems, fed with real domestic wastewater, were operated for over a year. The experimental system received ferric chloride (FeCl3) dosing at 10 mgFe L-1 in the sewer reactor whereas the control system received none. Wastewater, sludge and biogas were extensively sampled, and analysed for relevant parameters. The FeCl3-dosed experimental system displayed a decreased sulfide concentration (by 4.3 +/- 0.5 mgS L-1) in sewer effluent, decreased phosphate concentration (by 4.7 +/- 0.5 mgP L-1) in biological treatment reactor effluent, and decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas (911.5 +/- 189.9 ppm to 130.0 +/- 5.9 ppm), as compared with the control system. The biological nitrogen removal performance of the treatment reactor, and biogas production in the anaerobic digester were not affected by FeCl3-dosing. Furthermore, the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge was enhanced by 17.7 +/- 1.0%. These findings demonstrate that iron-dosing to sewers can achieve multiple benefits including sulfide removal in sewers, phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal during biogas generation. Therefore, an integrated approach should be taken when considering iron salts usage in an urban wastewater system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Management and treatment of environmental impacts from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a major, worldwide, sustainability challenge. One issue associated with WWTP operation is the potential for groundwater contamination via leaking or infiltration of wastewater, particularly with inorganic nutrients (ammonia and nitrate) as well as persistent organic compounds. Despite the potential for such contamination to create environmental and health risks, conventional methods, such as the assessment of major ions, nutrients, bacteriological indicators and conventional tracers (such as stable and radio genic isotopes) are often unable to provide accurate delineation of multiple potential sources of contamination. This is particularly important for WWTPs which often occur in urban, peri-urban or intensively farmed agricultural areas where multiple potential sources (such as livestock, fertilisers, wastewater irrigation, and domestic septic systems) may contribute similar contaminants. This review explores the applicability of promising novel groundwater tracers, such as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and isotopic tracers, which can be used in conjunction with conventional tracers (i.e. 'co-tracers') to provide a more definitive assessment of contaminant sources, plume delineation and even (potentially) indicating the age of contamination (e.g., recent vs. legacy). The suitability of the novel groundwater tracers is evaluated according to four key criteria: (i). sufficient presence in raw wastewater and/or treated effluents; (ii) diagnostic of WWTP impacts as opposed to other potential off-site contamination sources; (iii) persistence in the subsurface environment; and (iv) amenable to rapid and sensitive analysis. Further analysis of various classes of CECs along with improved detection limits associated with improvements in analytical methodologies should allow for future application of promising groundwater tracers, providing WWTP operators and regulatory authorities a more definitive toolbox with which to assess groundwater contamination associated with site operations. These include: persistent pharmaceuticals and personal care products (carbamazepine, crotamiton, primidone, atenolol and sulfamethoxazole), artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin and cyclamate) and potentially, certain pesticides (atrazine and simazine).

AB During biological wastewater treatment, substrates undergo simultaneous diffusion and reactions inside microbial aggregates, creating microscale spatial substrate gradients and limiting the macroscale reaction rates. For flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, this rate-limiting effect of diffusion is often lumped in model parameters, like the half-saturation coefficients of Monod kinetics in activated sludge models (ASM). Yet, an explicit description of the reaction-diffusion process with biofilm models is more common for aerobic granular sludge. This work investigates whether apparent half-saturation coefficients could have applications for aerobic granular sludge as well and examines the implications of this simplification. To this end, the macroscopic reaction rates predicted with a one-dimensional biofilm (1D) model were fitted with Monod kinetics. The results showed that the macroscale rates could indeed be described using apparent kinetics, at the very least over a time scale where the microbial population distribution stays fixed. However, the coefficients were sensitive to changes in the microbial population distribution, which can be affected by long-term changes in operating conditions. Also the activity of organisms that compete for the same substrates affect the parameter value. Be that as it may, apparent kinetics also depend on the operating conditions for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, but they have still been used successfully for design and optimization. Therefore, the last section of this work illustrates that they may also have applications for aerobic granular sludge. A simple model for ammonium removal using apparent half saturation coefficients for oxygen and ammonium is applied to a full-scale reactor, taking advantage of the batch-wise operation and on-line monitoring data for regular recalibration.

AB The origin and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in porewater of lake sediments is intricate and decisive for fate of pollutants including mercury (Hg). While there are many reports on the relationship between dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and mercury (Hg) concentrations in aquatic systems, there are few in which DOM compositional properties, that may better explain the fate of Hg, have been the focus. In this study, porewaters from sediments of three lakes, Caihai Lake (CH), Hongfeng Lake (HF) and Wujiangdu Lake (WJD), all located in southwest China, were selected to test the hypothesis that DOM optical properties control the fate of Hg in aquatic ecosystems. Porewater DOM was extracted and characterized by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. A two end-member (autochthonous and allochthonous DOM) mixing model was used to unveil the origin of DOM in porewaters of the three lakes. Our results show a higher input of terrestrial DOM in the pristine lake CH, as compared to lakes HF and WJD lakes, which were both influenced by urban environments and enriched in autochthonous DOM. While the relationships between the concentrations of DOC and the different chemical forms of Hg forms were quite inconsistent, we found important links between specific DOM components and the fate of Hg in the three lakes. In particular, our results suggest that allochthonous, terrestrial DOM inhibits Hg(II) availability for Hg methylating micro-organisms. In contrast, autochthonous DOM seems to have been stimulated MeHg formation, likely by enhancing the activity of microbial communities. Indeed, DOM biodegradation experiments revealed that differences in the microbial activity could explain the variation in the concentration of MeHg. While relationships between concentrations of DOC and Hg vary among different sites and provide little information about Hg cycling, we conclude that the transport and transformation of Hg (e.g. the methylation process) are more strongly linked to DOM chemical composition and reactivity.

   membranes: Experimental and CFD investigations of the periodic feed

AB Oily water production is one of the many drawbacks of petroleum and several other industries. Finding effective ways for the treatment of produced water remain one of the main areas of interest in membrane sciences. Albeit the many advantages of membrane technology, they suffer from the unavoidable problem of fouling, which results from the accumulation of dispersed materials at the surface of membranes. Membrane modification and operational optimization have been approached as a potential cure of the problem of fouling. In this work we introduce a new and novel method that minimizes the development of fouling and in the same time utilizes no chemicals (i.e., environmentally friendly). The core of this method is based on alternating the pressure in the feed channel in a periodic manner and is therefore named the periodic feed pressure technique, PFPT. The idea is to make pinned droplets at the surface of the membrane lose essential forces that keep them sticking to the surface. The drag force due to permeation flux and the capillary force due to interfacial tension represents the two forces that largely contribute to the pinning of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane. Other forces including buoyancy and lift forces are generally small to be of significant influence. The idea of the PFPT is, therefore, to eliminate the force due to permeation drag. This is done by setting the transmembrane pressure (TMP) to zero at fixed intervals allowing pinned oil droplets to dislodge the surface. When the TMP is set to zero, permeation flux stops and the force due to permeation drag vanishes. This significantly reduces the overall residence time of pinned oil droplets, minimizing the chance for other oil droplets to cluster and coalesce with pinned ones. The PFPT does not cause any damage to the support layer of the polymeric membrane, which is a drawback of back-flushing methodology. The novel PFPT displays minimal membrane fouling and very similar permeation recovery despite only half the cycle time is in filtration mode. In this work, we show how the permeation flux is recovered and provide comparisons between the PFPT and regular filtration methodology. Furthermore, we compare the overall amount of filtrate at the end of the experiments using both methods. It is interesting to note that, the amount of filtrate using the PFPT is very much comparable to that obtained using regular filtration methodology and even higher. By optimizing the frequency of the cycle and the amplitude of the pressure change, it is possible to customize the PFPT to various membrane technologies and to achieve the highest recovery of the flux. Visual inspections of the membranes post operation and post rinsing indicate that membranes undergoing filtration using the PFPT achieves a very clean surface compared with those undergoing regular filtration processes. This method is a promising solution to membrane fouling that is easy to implement without any additional use of chemicals or equipment. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation is also conducted on microfiltration processes to show why this technique works. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Free-living amoebae are widespread in freshwater ecosystems. Although many studies have investigated changes in their communities across space, the temporal variability and the drivers of community changes across different habitat types are poorly understood. A total of 108 surface water samples were collected on a seasonal basis from four reservoirs and two rivers in Xiamen city, subtropical China. We used high throughput sequencing and qPCR methods to explore the occurrence and abundance of free-living amoebae. In total, 335 amoeba OTUs were detected, and only 32 OTUs were shared by reservoir and river habitats. The reservoirs and rivers harbored unique amoebae communities and exhibited distinct seasonal patterns in community composition. High abundance of the 18S rRNA gene of Acanthamoeba was observed in spring and summer, whereas the abundance was low in autumn and winter. In addition, the abundance of Hartmannella was significantly higher when isolated from reservoirs in summer/autumn and from river in spring/summer. Moreover, the temporal patterns of amoebae communities were significantly associated with water temperature, indicating that temperature is an important variable controlling the ecological dynamics of amoebae populations. However, our comparative analysis indicated that both environmental selection, and neutral processes, significantly contributed to amoeba community assembly. The genera detected here include pathogenic species and species that can act as vectors for microbial pathogens, which can cause human infections. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The estimated domestic usage of DD (a typical nematocide) has been the greatest among all the agricultural chemicals in Japan. DD is involved in a document which is used to establish tap water quality standard in Japan. The document indicates that DD is potentially detectable in raw water for tap waters. DD in raw water will be treated with chlorine at waterworks, which raises concerns about formation of mutagenic chlorination by-products through the treatment. The objective of this work was to identify a mutagenic chlorination by-product by using high resolution mass spectrometers and multivariate analyses. Mutagenicity of the chlorination by-product was evaluated with the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. (E)-1,3-Dichloropropene (DCP) was used as a model compound of DD. The mutagenicity of chlorine treated model aqueous solutions of DD increased with increasing chlorine dosages up to 3.00 mol-Cl-2/mol-DCP. From the chlorine treated aqueous solutions of DD, 1,3-dichloroacetone (DCA) was identified as a major mutagen by a cochromatography with an authentic standard, precursor ion analyses and first generation product ion analyses with the high resolution mass spectrometers. The mutagenicity of DCA against TA100 strain without microsomal activation was 160,000 net revertant colony/mu mol (the toxicity equivalent factor was 0.14). Based on the mutagenicity of the chlorine treated DCP sample, the specific mutagenicity of DCA, and the DCA concentration in the sample, the mutagenic contribution of DCA to the chlorine treated DCP sample was calculated. High contribution (98%) clearly shows that DCA is a major mutagen in the chlorine treated DCP sample. Because the exploration of DCA was performed by using the unrealistic high concentration samples of DCP and chlorine, formation of DCA in the practical concentration samples (0-200 mu g-DCP/L, 0.10 or 1.27 mg-Cl-2/L) was examined. It was proven that DCA formation reaction takes place in the practical concentrations of DCA and chlorine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil columns simulating soil aquifer treatment (SAT), fed with synthetic secondary effluent by intermittent infiltration of flooding/drying cycles, were characterized for nitrogen and organic carbon removal, and microbial ecology and biokinetics. The columns differed in the concentration ratio of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to the summed NH4+, NO2- and organic nitrogen-2 (C/N2) or 5 (C/N5). Chemical profiles along the column demonstrated a preference for COD oxidation over nitrification and coupled denitrification, with higher nitrogen loss (57% vs. 16%) in the C/N5 column. Unexpectedly, significant dominance of the genus Nitrospira over the genus Nitrobacter and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was strongly correlated at column depths where NH4+ removal occurred. Moreover, the Nitrospira profile had the strongest correlation to the profile of NH4+ (positive) and NO3- (negative), strongly indicating complete ammonia oxidation. 16S sequencing analysis of the topsoil in C/N2 vs. C/N5 columns revealed double the abundance of microbial aerobic potential (64% vs. 32%) vs. one-third the denitrification potential (13% vs. 31%). The concentrations and degradability levels of organic carbon were the most influential parameters shaping community structure. Niche differentiation within the biofilm attached to the soil is suggested to have an important role in the process's anoxic activity and nitrogen removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photo-Fenton process is among the most effective advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in urban wastewater treatment and disinfection, but its application as tertiary treatment at full scale has not been a feasible attractive option so far because optimum conditions are typically achieved under acidic pH. In this work a new photo Fenton like process (UV-C/H2O2/IDS-Cu) using iminodisuccinic acid (IDS)-Cu complex as catalyst, was compared to other processes (UV-C/H2O2/Cu, UV-C/H2O2/Fe, H2O2 and UV-C) in urban wastewater disinfection. Since this is the first time that IDS-Cu complex was isolated and used as catalyst, preliminary tests to evaluate the mineralization of a model compound (phenol, 25 mg L-1 initial concentration) in water by UV-C/H2O2/IDS-Cu were carried out. Almost complete mineralization of phenol (95%) was observed after 60 min treatment, being the process more effective than all other investigated AOPs (Fenton and photo-Fenton processes). This process was also proven to be more effective in the inactivation of E. coli (complete inactivation (3.5 log units) in 10 min) at natural pH (7.8 +/- 0.5) in real wastewater, than the other processes investigated. Unlike of what observed for E. coli inactivation, the investigated processes only partially inactivated total bacterial population (from 18% for UV-C to 43% for UV-C/H2O2/Cu), according to flow cytometry measurements. In particular, Cu based photo-Fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells, thus being consistent with the results of E. coli inactivation. It is worthy to note that, as H2O2 was decreased, UV-C/H2O2/Cu-IDS was more effective than UV-C/H2O2/Cu process. Moreover, the formation of small and large clusters decreased in the presence of Cu and Cu-IDS complex, and process efficiency improved accordingly: these results show that Cu based AOPs can more effectively disaggregate clusters, thus making disinfection process more effective than Fe based AOPs.

AB This study investigated the impact of pH on the migration of cadmium(II) ions (Cd2+) in relation to montmorillonite KSF colloids through a water-saturated sand column (WSSC). The sorption isotherms of Cd2+ on colloids and sand at pH values of 3, 6, and 8 were characterized by batch experiments. Cd2+ sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the Freundlich model. In the column experiments, increasing the pH increased the retardation factors and K-F values of Cd2+ both with and without the presence of the colloids. The amount of Cd2+ sorbed onto the montmorillonite KSF colloids in the column effluent increased from 0.29 to 0.97 mg as the pH increased. The colloid increased Cd2+ mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution pH. The increasing level of Cd2+ sorbed on colloids as the pH increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve (BTC) of the total Cd, indicating that the total Cd was controlled by rate-limited reactions. These findings indicate that when the solution pH was greater than the point of zero charge (PZC) of the colloids (pH > 6), the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two-site (TSM) model rather than an equilibrium (CDeq) model. This implies that the PZC of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated Cd2+ transport. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To enhance the advanced oxidation process based on persulfate, CuO was introduced into the Fe2+/PS system to achieve a synergistic effect between Fe and Cu. Results showed that Fe2+ was able to adsorb onto the CuO surface to form Fe(II) and further reduced Cu(II) into Cu(I), which can further release into the solution to participate in oxidation reactions. In this case, SO4- can be generated via Fe2+ and Cu+ reactions with PS and center dot OH from Cu+ reaction with dissolved oxygen (DO). The degradation efficiency of APAP was studied under the optimal condition (initial pH 6.5, PS = 0.8 g L-1, Fe2+ = 0.7 mM, CuO = 0.3 g L-1), and the results indicated that the Fe2+/CuO/PS system can achieve a higher degradation rate of APAP (92% within 90 min) rather than Fe2+/PS and CuO/PS system (79% and 10%). Quenching experiment was performed to verify the active radicals in the Fe2+/CuO/PS system. Sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were generated in the Fe2+/CuO/PS system. Besides, some critical factors, such as Fe2+ concentration, catalyst dosage, PS concentration, initial pH (buffers and nonbuffers), and dissolved oxygen were evaluated in bath experiments. Results indicated that dissolved oxygen was essential in the Fe2+/CuO/PS system. APAP degradation experiments were conducted in surface water, and the intermediates were detected via GC-MS. The results indicated that the Fe2+/CuO/PS system is effective in the treatment of APAP in natural waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For over a century, anaerobic digestion has been a key technology in stabilizing organic waste streams, while at the same time enabling the recovery of energy. The anticipated transition to a bio-based economy will only increase the quantity and diversity of organic waste streams to be treated, and, at the same time, increase the demand for additional and effective resource recovery schemes for nutrients and organic matter. The performance of anaerobic digestion can be supported and enhanced by (bio) electrochemical systems in a wide variety of hybrid technologies. Here, the possible benefits of combining anaerobic digestion with (bio)electrochemical systems were reviewed in terms of (1) process monitoring, control, and stabilization, (2) nutrient recovery, (3) effluent polishing, and (4) biogas upgrading. The interaction between microorganisms and electrodes with respect to niche creation is discussed, and the potential impact of this interaction on process performance is evaluated. The strength of combining anaerobic digestion with (bio)electrochemical technologies resides in the complementary character of both technologies, and this perspective was used to distinguish transient trends from schemes with potential for full-scale application. This is supported by an operational costs assessment, showing that the economic potential of combining anaerobic digestion with a (bio)electrochemical system is highly case-specific, and strongly depends on engineering challenges with respect to full-scale applications.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from a river water source was investigated using ion exchange (IEX), coagulation and membrane filtration. This research linked the variable charge characteristics of the organic compounds present in the source water with removal by IEX and coagulation. The raw water charge density fluctuated considerably (between 5.4 and 10.7 meq mg(DOC)(-1)) and controlled removal of the charge loading. Importantly, charge density was not correlated with the organic carbon concentration. The combined IEX and coagulation process reduced the specific DBP-FP (sDBP-FP) of the final water, with values as low as 18 mu g mg(DOC)(-1) for both haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes. IEX removed a particular fraction of NOM that 1) enhanced coagulation efficiency, providing increased removal of overall DOC; and 2) enabled coagulation to subsequently remove higher levels of specific components of NOM that have a high DBP-FP. The component of NOM removed by IEX that had a positive impact on coagulation was identified to be charged low molecular weight organic compounds of all hydrophobicity levels, resulting in a reduced specific DBP-FP compared to coagulation alone.

AB Transport behaviors of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) were examined in the individual- and co-presence Escherichia (E.) coli and phosphate in heterogeneous sand (uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide-coated sand) columns. The results showed that for the individual presence of phosphate, the degree of nTiO(2) deposition was less in uncoated than in iron oxide-coated sands. In contrast, an opposite trend that greater deposition of nTiO(2) in uncoated than in coated sands occurred in the individual presence of E. coll. These observations are due to the phosphate adsorption changing the charge of NPs and iron oxyhydroxide-coated sand, or the preferential adhesion of bacterial to coated sand. In the copresence of E. coli and phosphate, interestingly, the phosphate level plays an important role in influencing nTiO(2) transport. At a high phosphate concentration (>1.0 mM), the deposition of nTiO(2) with the individual presence of E. coli was stronger than nTiO(2) in the copresence of both E. coli and phosphate, regardless of sand type. The potential mechanism was that phosphate adsorption led to the formation of more negatively charged NPs-bacteria complexes that have higher mobility in sand columns. At a low phosphate level (<= 0.1 mM), a similar observation occurred in uncoated sand. Nevertheless, the deposition of nTiO(2) with copresence of E. coli and phosphate was greater than nTiO(2) with E. coli in oxyhydroxide-coated sand. It was attributed to the formation of large NPs-bacteria-phosphate clusters (less mobile) and the preferential adhesion of E. coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating simultaneously. Taken together, our findings provide crucial knowledge for better understanding the fate, transport, and potential risks of engineered nanoparticles in complicated environmental settings where bacteria and phosphate are ubiquitous.

AB Syntrophic propionate oxidation (SPO) coupled with methanogenesis is often inhibited under high ammonium concentrations in anaerobic digesters. However, the inhibitory mechanism remains poorly understood. We conducted two independent laboratory experiments with a swine manure digester sludge. In experiment I, RNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) was applied to determine the active players of both bacteria and methanogens involved in SPO under different ammonium concentrations (0, 3 and 7 g NE4+-N L-1). In experiment II, the dynamics of the bacterial community under ammonia stress was monitored using the 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR under similar conditions as in experiment I but without the addition of external propionate. An additional higher ammonium treatment (10 g L-1) was applied in experiment II to maximize the ammonia stress. We identified that the Smithella bacteria and the Methanosaetaceae and Methanospirillaceae archaea were the most active players involved in SPO and methanogenesis. We revealed that Smithella, Methanosaetaceae and Methanospirillaceae were moderately and severely inhibited at 3 and 7-10 g NH4+-N L-1, respectively. However, the fermentative bacteria appeared to be more tolerant to ammonia stress. The microbial responses were corroborated with the accumulation of VFAs and the repression of methanogenesis under high ammonium conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB UV/monochloramine (NH2Cl) process has attracted some attention for the elimination of contaminants of emerging concern as a novel advanced oxidation process. However, there is still much uncertainty on the performance and mechanisms of UV/NH2Cl process because of its complexity and generation of various species of radicals, including N-2 center dot, HO center dot, Cl center dot and other reactive chlorine species (RCS). The mechanism and influence factors of degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in the UV/NH2Cl process were investigated, and a synergistic effect was observed. Degradation of CBZ under all investigated conditions followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The corresponding rate constant increased along with the dosage of NH2Cl, and was affected significantly by the presence of bicarbonate and natural organic matter. The process has little pH-dependency, while the specific contribution of RCS and HO center dot changed with solution pH, and RCS always act as a major contributor to the degradation of CBZ. Eleven byproducts of CBZ were identified and their respective evolution profiles were determined. The participation of UV in chloramination can reduce the formation of nitrogenous DBPs, but promote the formation of carbonaceous DBPs. Furthermore, when influent, sand filtered, and granular activated carbon filtered water was respectively used as background, degradation of CBZ was inhibited to different degree and more disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were generated, compared to deionized water. The electrical energy per order for degradation of CBZ in the UV/NH2Cl process was also calculated to obtain some preliminary cost information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, 13 new phenolic halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were discovered and confirmed in chlorinated drinking water using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-tqMS), which have been attracting a growing concern due to their higher chronic cytotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and growth inhibition compared with commonly known aliphatic DBPs. In this study, another 12 new phenolic halogenated DBPs were detected and identified in simulated chlorinated drinking water samples, including two monohalo-4-hydroxybenzaldehydes, two monohalo-4-hydroxybenzoic acids, three monohalo-salicylic acids, and five mono/di/trihalo-phenols. Decomposition mechanisms of these new phenolic halogenated DBPs during chlorination were speculated and partially verified by identifying intermediate products. These new DBPs could undergo hydrolysis, halogenation, substitution, addition, decarboxylation, and rearrangement reactions to form a series of decomposition products, including dihaloacetic acids, 2-halomaleic acids, and a group of new heterocyclic DBPs (trihalo-hydroxy-cyclopentene-diones). A bench-scale ozone-granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment unit was designed and set up in the lab. It was found that ozonation and GAC filtration were effective in reducing dissolved organic carbon levels and aromaticity (DBP precursors) of simulated raw water samples, and thus were effective in decreasing the concentrations of these new phenolic DBPs by 82.5% and 88.6%, respectively. Furthermore, four different treatment scenarios (i.e., ozonation, GAC filtration, ozonation followed by GAC filtration, and GAC filtration followed by ozonation) were evaluated and compared. Results showed that ozonation followed by GAC filtration was most effective in precursor removal and could decrease the level of these new phenolic DBPs by up to 97.3%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Acidification was used to dissolve phosphorus from digested and non-digested sludge from five wastewater treatment plants in order to make phosphorus accessible for subsequent recovery. More phosphorus was dissolved from digested sludge (up to 80%), with respect to non-digested sludge (similar to 25%) and the highest release was observed at pH 2. The acid consumption for digested sludge was higher than for non-digested sludge due to the presence of the bicarbonate buffer system, thus CO2 stripping increased the acid consumption. In all the experiments, the sludge was exposed to acid for 1 h. For the five tested sludge types, 60-100 mmol o-P was released per added mol H2SO4. It was mainly iron and calcium compounds that accounts for the phosphorus release at low pH. The release of heavy metals was in general low (<30%) for all the wastewater treatment plant, as Zn, Cd and Ni showed the most critical release after acidification of non-digested sludge.

AB Solar irradiation of chlorine-containing waters enhances inactivation of chlorine-resistant pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium oocysts), through in situ formation of ozone, hydroxyl radical, and other reactive species during photolysis of free available chlorine (FAC) at UVB-UVA wavelengths of solar light (290-400 nm). However, corresponding effects on regulated disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation and associated dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties remain unclear. In this work, when compared to dark chlorination, sunlight-driven FAC photolysis over a range of conditions was found to yield higher DBP levels, depletion of DOM chromophores and fluorophores, preferential removal of phenolic groups versus carboxylic acid groups, and degradation of larger humic substances to smaller molecular weight compounds. Control experiments showed that increased DBP levels were not due to direct DOM photolysis and subsequent dark reactions with FAC, but to co-exposure of DOM to FAC and reactive species (e.g., O-3, HO center dot, Cl-center dot, Cl-2(center dot-), ClO center dot) generated by FAC photolysis. Because solar chlorine photolysis can enable inactivation of chlorine-resistant pathogens at far lower CTFAC values than chlorination alone, the increases in DBP formation inherent to this approach can likely be offset to some extent by the ability to operate at significantly decreased CTFAC. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that applications of solar chlorine photolysis will require careful attention to potential impacts on DBP formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ceramic membrane bioreactor (MBR) has attracted increasing interest due to its high flux, long membrane life -span and excellent resistance to hash operation conditions. Although ozone has been used for chemical cleaning of ceramic membranes, it is still unclear about the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) generated during on-line chemical cleaning with ozone in the development of membrane fouling in ceramic MBR. This study clearly revealed that the released DOM could considerably induce irreversible membrane fouling, and humic acid like-substances (HAL) with molecular weight (MW) of about 500 Da were mainly responsible for the observed membrane fouling. A strong positive relationship existed between the membrane fouling rate of supernatant and the rejection level of HAL, evidenced by a high correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.99. Meanwhile, the results also showed that biopolymers with MW greater than 10 kDa were easily rejected by the ceramic membranes used, leading to the development of membrane fouling. However, the high ozone concentration helped to reduce the generation of biopolymers. The organic fractions with MW less than 500 Da in the DOM (e.g. building blocks, low -MW acid and low-MW neutrals) could pass through the ceramic membranes used, i.e. their contributions to the observed membrane fouling could be considered insignificant. Consequently, it appeared from this study that membrane fouling associated with the DOM generated by ozone during on-line chemical cleaning should not be ignored in the design and operation of ceramic MBR towards long-term process sustainability.

AB BACKGROUND: Papillary tumors of the pineal region (PTPRs) are malignant World Health Organization grade II/III tumors; however, they may perfectly mimic benign tumors (e.g., pineocytomas [World Health Organization grade I]).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 28-year-old man with a 35-mm tumor of the pineal region. Considering the typical radiological and pathologic presentation, the tumor was first diagnosed as pineocytoma. However, despite first total resection, the tumor recurred after 7 years. The recurrent neoplasm was composed mainly of papillary structures with low-grade atypical cells positive for CKAE1/AE3 and CK18. This categorization led to the final diagnosis of PTPR. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy, which vastly improved his neurologic condition and resulted in significant tumor regression.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case exemplifies that PTPRs can perfectly mimic pineocytomas and simple staining for cytokeratins may warrant correct diagnosis and better treatment.

AB A 64-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of headache. The patient had a history of 30 years of diabetes. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion involving the sphenoid sinus and clivus. Surgery was performed through a transsphenoidal approach. Pathology suggested the diagnosis of the presence of Aspergillus. The patient received voriconazole treatment for 8 weeks, and 3-month follow-up demonstrated no progression. Aspergillus osteomyelitis of the skull base is uncommon, and accurate preoperative diagnosis is difficult. However, when there is a clear history of diabetes, a diagnosis of fungal osteomyelitis should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Collision tumors are defined as coexistence of 2 histologically different neoplasms occurring in the same anatomic location. Such co-occurrence of tumors in the brain is uncommon. To our knowledge, meningioma colliding with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma has not been described previously.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of progressive memory decline and 2 weeks of drowsiness, bradykinesia, and aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneously enhanced mass beside the left frontal cerebral falx resulting in midline shift. The left frontal lobe mass was resected. Pathologic examination showed the tumor consisted of whorled spindle cells and diffuse medium-sized lymphoid cells. The spindle cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and negative for S-100. The lymphoid cells expressed CD3 epsilon. CD56, TIA-1, and granzyme B. Epstein-Barr virus encoded small RNAs were detected by in situ hybridization. No monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected. Four weeks after surgery, the patient was treated with polychemotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate, but he died 2 months later.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a unique brain collision tumor consisting of a meningioma and an extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Diagnosis depends on histopathology. Awareness of this entity is important to distinguish it from other intracranial tumors.

ID SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
AB OBJECTIVE: To report and describe a modified posterior only approach (paraspinal approach) for total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) of lumbar spinal tumors.
   METHODS: From February 2013 to June 2014, 5 patients with lumbar spinal tumors who underwent TES through a posterior-only paraspinal approach were studied retrospectively; operative time, blood loss, complications, neurologic outcomes, and degree of resection were recorded to evaluate the efficacy of this surgical method.
   RESULTS: Patients included 3 men and 2 women with a mean age of 48.4 years (range, 46-52 years). Two lesions were located in L2, 2 lesions were located in L3, and 1 lesion was located in L4. Three patients had solitary metastatic tumors (lung cancer in 2 cases, breast cancer in 1 case), and 2 patients had primary tumors (osteosarcoma and plasma cell tumor). According to the surgical classification of spinal tumors by Tomita et al., 4 cases were type 4 and 1 case was type 1. Mean operative time was 464 minutes (range, 420-510 minutes), and mean blood loss was 1280 mL (range, 1000-1500 mL). One patient had cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and 1 had transient motor weakness because of nerve root traction . Mean follow-up time was 20.6 months (range, 12-30 months), and all patients had improved or stable neurologic function. No local recurrence was observed at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The posterior-only paraspinal approach is a valid alternative for TES of lumbar spinal tumors, especially for overweight or muscular patients.

TI Thoracic Paraspinal Castleman Disease in a Young Mexican-American Man

DT Article
DE Castleman disease; Hematuria; Neurosurgery; Paraspinal; Spine
ID LYMPH-NODE HYPERPLASIA; EPIDURAL MASS; RARE CAUSE; HUMAN-HERPESVIRUS-8;
   MIMICKING
AB BACKGROUND: Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon disorder of deregulated lymphoproliferation with unicentric (UCD) and multicentric forms based on extent of nodal involvement. Gross resection with histopathologic analysis remains the gold standard for diagnosis of UCD and is curative in most cases. Symptomatic paraspinal UCD is a rare presentation with potentially dangerous complications, and its tendency to mimic more common spinal tumors presents a significant diagnostic challenge.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Hispanic man with no past medical history was evaluated for a known left-sided paraspinal mass that was incidentally discovered during an emergency department work-up for hematuria. Computed tomography on initial presentation revealed a 5.3 cm x 3.3 cm x 4.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing left paraspinal mass adjacent to the T11 vertebral body with tonguelike extension into the T11-T12 neural foramen. Although he remained neurologically intact throughout most of the diagnostic work-up, an inconclusive biopsy, worsening hematuria, and late-onset radiculopathy with severe back pain prompted surgical intervention. Microscopic histomorphology was consistent with CD. He continued to have intermittent hematuria and dysuria postoperatively, but repeat computed tomography at 7 months confirmed no recurrence of the mass.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous reports, our case of postcoital hematuria and radiculopathy accompanying a paraspinal thoracic mass in a young Mexican-American man is a unique presentation. Awareness and early consideration of UCD in the work-up of a paraspinal mass may spare affected patients adverse and dangerous sequelae, such as spinal cord compression and excessive intraoperative hemorrhage.

ID MIGRATION; FRAGMENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Sequestered disc fragments may present as a lesion with peripheral enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. When located in the psoas muscle compartment, this finding could mimic an abscess.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of a 52-year-old man who returned from Togo after 2 years of living in precarious conditions. He was afebrile and complaining of lumbar back pain. The magnetic resonance imaging showed L3 and L4 vertebral body enhancement with bilateral psoas lesions in continuity with the disc space, suggesting spondylodiscitis with a differential diagnosis of inflammatory herniated disc. A computed tomography-guided biopsy of the right psoas lesion was performed to rule out spondylodiscitis. Histology was compatible with extruded disc material.
   CONCLUSION: Herniated disc fragments should be considered as a differential diagnosis of psoas abscesses. Coronal plane images may show the continuity of bilateral herniated disc fragments, mimicking psoas abscesses.

AB Low-grade glioma (LGG) usually occurs in young patients who enjoy an active family, social, and professional life. Because awake surgery for patients with LGG has resulted in significant improvement in both functional and oncological outcomes and because the surgery per se is not very expensive, it is currently performed in many countries worldwide. Nonetheless, in addition to the necessity of tailoring the surgical strategy to the patient (e.g., neurological and cognitive status) and tumor (e.g., brain location and volume) characteristics, the legal, cultural, and socioeconomic parameters could also play a key role in the therapeutic strategy. These include clear information to the patient and relatives during the first meeting, the adapted selection of tasks for awake mapping, and active collaboration of the patient throughout the resection and during the early postoperative rehabilitation. In the present study, our goal was to analyze these socioenvironmental aspects, which have been neglected for many decades, in LGG management, with a special emphasis on epilepsy and the awake procedure. These criteria are relevant with respect to the diagnosis, surgery, functional remediation, and long-term follow-up for patients who now benefit from a longer life expectancy. However, although such factors are essential to resume an active life, including returning to work, they vary greatly across countries. Therefore, they should be considered more systematically to allow for greater reproducibility of results of awake surgery worldwide.

DE Glioblastoma; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Unknown etiology
AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the brain. Common radiologic findings using initial computed tomography (CT) reveal an intra-axial lesion with perifocal edema. Here, we present a rare case of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) detected on an initial CT image in a patient without intracranial aneurysm in whom the final diagnosis was glioblastoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the rare case of a 57-year-old man with glioblastoma in the right temporal lobe who presented with a sudden onset of disturbance of consciousness as an initial manifestation. Initial CT of the head revealed a diffuse SAH. Digital subtraction angiography revealed no cerebral aneurysm or dissection of intracranial arteries. The patient was treated for SAH of unknown etiology with conservative therapy, and a repeat digital subtraction angiography demonstrated no vascular disease. Eventually, he was discharged without any neurologic deficit. A follow-up CT of the brain revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ring enhancing lesion in the anterior section of right temporal lobe. The patient was transferred to our department, where he underwent surgical resection, and a pathologic diagnosis of glioblastoma was made.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of glioblastoma mimicking SAH of etiology and recommend including glioblastoma in the differential diagnosis of SAH of unknown etiology.

AB BACKGROUND: We present a case of almost complete bifrontal dural ossification after decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old boy was brought to the emergency room after a severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale/Score 7). Due to rapidly increasing intracranial pressure values (>20 mm Hg) refractory to conservative therapy and in the absence of focal lesions justifying the neurological status, a bicoronal decompressive craniectomy was performed. The patient underwent reconstructive bifrontal cranioplasty with autologous bone 110 days after surgery. Preoperative computed tomography scans showed an abnormal hyperdense layer surrounding both frontal lobes. During the procedure, widespread islets of eggshell-shaped bony tissue were found covering the pericranium and the dura mater. They were laboriously removed from the underlying tissues. Two months later computed tomography scans did not show evidence of calcification at the level of the frontal lobes or signs of bone reabsorption or epidural collections.
   CONCLUSIONS: We focus on the clinical implications of this phenomenon, in terms of its surgical management and how it may influence the timing of cranioplasty. Furthermore, we discuss the main pathophysiologic models described in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND: As a normal variation of the cerebral venous angioarchitecture, developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) represent a rare cause of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Different from mixed vascular lesions, such as capillary malformations, arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, and thrombosis, here we describe the first case of a ruptured hemodynamic aneurysm associated with a DVA and introduce the first use of hybrid operation for the treatment of a hemorrhagic DVA.
   METHODS: A 14-year-old girl suffered from sudden onset of headache, aphasia, and left hemiplegia. On the way of her transfer to our center, she suddenly fell into a coma Computed tomography scan demonstrated an enlarged intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. Angiography revealed a large frontal DVA with an associated hemodynamic aneurysm. Superselective angiog-raphy of left middle cerebral artery confirmed that the aneurysm was located on the turning site of arteriovenous transition. RESULTS: Considering the large hematoma and the possible occlusion of surrounding collecting veins, we attempted transarterial embolization but were unsuccessful. Hematoma evacuation and aneurysm isolation were performed in a hybrid operation room. Intraoperative angiography was used to confirm the location of the aneurysm and to recheck the result. The patient woke up 1 day later and the symptoms were relieved entirely 1 year later.
   CONCLUSIONS: Associated aneurysm may be a cause of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in DVAs and routine imaging monitoring is needed. Hybrid operation is a possible treatment for such complicated mixed lesions in DVA, which proved to be safe and effective in this patient.

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; VENOUS FISTULA; ARTERY; NEUROFIBROMATOSIS;

AB BACKGROUND: A vertebral artery arteriovenous fistula is rare and usually to trauma. Atraumatic cases are quite rare. We reported 2 cases and a review of other reported studies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A spontaneous vertebral-venous fistula is rare, and the 2 cases presented illustrate an underlying spontaneous etiology. The first patient presented with a spontaneous fistula, and the second case occurred in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1. In both cases, the fistulas were diagnosed using computed tomography angiography and treated with occlusion via coil embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Vascular changes are known in patients with neurofibromatosis. A proposed pathogenesis of fistula is that the fragility and defective nature of the arterial wall could be a predisposing factor or it might be congenital. Understanding the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and effective management strategies are important for physicians treating patients with a vertebral artery arteriovenous fistula.

AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia caused by vertedolichoectasia (VBD) is rare and challenging to treat. Some authors have reported techniques for treating trigeminal neuralgia caused by VBD using various kinds of objects including clips, Proline slings, and titanium plates.
   METHODS: Here, we report the effectiveness of cutting and splitting of the tentorium in 3 patients with trigeminal neuralgia.
   RESULTS: The clinical results were good, the pain disappeared in all patients without medication, and no complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases of trigeminal neuralgia caused by VBD, this technique may be as useful as traditional microvascular decompression around the trigeminal nerve root entry zone.

ID ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY
AB BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal androgen receptor blockers like flutamide have been described as an adjuvant treatment for preoperative shrinkage of extensive juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. We present a case of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak due to flutamide-induced tumor shrinkage.
   CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old male with a prior diagnosis of juvenile naso-pharyngeal angiofibroma stage IIIB on preoperative flutamide for 3.5 weeks presented with altered sensorium, meningeal signs, and clear watery nasal discharge consistent with CSF leak. Computed tomogram of the head revealed air in the ventricle and repeat contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed significant tumor shrinkage in the area of the anterior skull base. This patient had an atypical pattern of tumor extension into the anterior skull base through the roof of posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinus, which are inherently weak areas of the skull base, thereby predisposing the CSF leak on tumor shrinkage.
   CONCLUSION: CSF leak is a rare complication following flutamide therapy, especially large areas of the anterior skull base are involved.

DT Review
DE Bone erosion; Chronic spinal epidural hematoma; T2-Weighted images
ID LUMBAR SPINE; SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; ENLARGEMENT; MEMBRANE; STENOSIS; MR
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a potentially devastating problem that requires rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention. A chronic course is rarely seen following SEH, and the clinical characteristics are quite different from acute cases. The epidemiology, clinical history, and radiologic findings of chronic SEH (CSEH) are not well understood, although the detection rate has increased with the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this article was to report 4 cases of surgically confirmed CSEH and clarify the radiologic features and clinical scenarios by reviewing all published cases of CSEH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: All 4 patients presented with gradually worsening radicular pain in the lower extremities. Patients' mean age was 69.5 years (range, 55-85 years). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural mass in the lower lumbar spine that was heterogeneously enhanced after gadolinium administration. The rim of the mass was low intensity on T2*-weighted images. Local erosions of the adjacent cortical bone were seen with computed tomography in all cases. All patients' postoperative courses were satisfactory with complete disappearance of radicular symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: CSEH is a rare disease, and it is difficult to diagnose pre-operatively on the basis of diagnostic imaging. The incidence of a low-intensity rim on T2*-weighted images and bone erosions on computed tomography may help differentiate rare CSEH from other lumbar degenerative diseases and epidural space-occupying masses.

LA English
DT Article
DE Intraoperative angiography; Intraoperative navigation system; M4
   segment; Neurosurgical procedures; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Treating cerebral aneurysms in the M4 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is challenging because they are small and are buried in the brain parenchyma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A right-handed Asian woman in her 80s was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of altered level of consciousness. On admission, her consciousness level on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 7 (E1V1M5), and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intracerebral hematoma in the left temporal lobe. Subsequent 3-dimensional CT angiography showed an aneurysm in the M4 segment of the left MCA. The aneurysm of the patient was clipped safely and effectively because of the navigation system in combination with intraoperative angiography. The navigation system was especially useful for estimating the proximal part of the parent artery at the brain surface, whereas intraoperative angiography was especially useful for confirming that the proximal portion of the parent artery identified by the navigation system was correct.
   CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the importance of choosing the modality of intraoperative imaging according to each characteristic when treating M4 segment aneurysms.

DE Anatomic variation; Exostoses; Fibular nerve; Rehabilitation;
   Ultrasonography
AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to underline that the association L. Sh%Jical examination, electrophysiology, and ultrasound was crucial in identifying the correct disease and atypical characteristics of its presentation, in turn, providing proper information for both surgical treatment and a rehabilitation program. Fibular nerve compression is a common finding in the adult population, and it is more frequent at the fibular head. The clinical picture may be characterized by motor and/or sensory deficits. The same symptoms may sometimes be suggestive of root impairment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 39-year-old man who came to our laboratory with a diagnosis of multimetameric lumbosacral radiculopathy. The patient reported a history of ankle numbness and transient foot drop. Neurophysiologic examination showed peripheral axonal damage at tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. A nerve ultrasound showed the presence of a conflict between a fibular exostosis and the fibular nerve. Furthermore, the fibular nerve presented an anatomic variation supplying the lateral gastrocnemius muscle.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound was crucial in recognizing the cause of the atypical presentation and avoiding a misdiagnosis. Also, it allowed the identification of the appropriate treatment and rehabilitation, as well as preventing irreversible nerve damage. As a result, critical information was presented to the surgeon for surgical treatment.

ID SKULL MASSES; INFANTS; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND: Dermoid and epidermoid cysts are among the most frequent lesions of the scalp in the pediatric population. Optimal management of a suspected dermoid or epidermoid cyst in children is debated: Some authors advocate conservative management on the basis of the benign histology of these entities, while others prefer surgical excision.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to demonstrate that excision of dermoid and epidermoid cysts is a safe procedure and that early surgery is effective in preventing potential complications related to cyst growth.
   METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on patients who underwent surgery for excision of proven dermoid or epidermoid cysts between January 2006 and October 2017.
   RESULTS: In 234 patients, 237 cysts were excised. Mean age at presentation was 26.99 +/- 32.7 months; 48.7% of patients were operated on between 1 and 3 years of age, and 32.9% were younger than 1 year of age. Cysts were more frequently located in the frontal bone than in occipital and supraorbital regions. In 36.28% of cases there was no significant cranial impingement, while 21.94% of the cysts eroded through a partial thickness of the cranium, 12.23% were in the full thickness of the skull, and 0.84% had epidural extension. We identified 22 intradiploic cysts. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant association between frontal and pterional localization and bone erosion. Neither major complications nor cyst recurrence were observed. -
   CONCLUSIONS: Excision of dermoid and epidermoid cysts is a safe procedure for neurosurgeons dealing with this disease, even in young patients. Early resection is recommended due to the potential adverse effects that may occur if these cysts are left untreated.

AB BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a genetic disease that is caused by __don of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. Patients with this syndrome may develop multiple malignant neoplasms including brain tumors. We herein report the first case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which development of supratentorial anaplastic ependymoma led to difficulty in terms of selecting the optimal postoperative therapeutic protocol.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old boy experiencing a convulsive attack was brought to our institute. He underwent surgical tumor resection, and magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed a tumor-like lesion in the right parietal lobe. Although adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after total tumor resection, a focal recurrent lesion appeared soon afterward. We initiated chemotherapy with bevacizumab after resection of the recurrent lesion, but bevacizumab was unable to control tumor progression. At this writing, he remains bedridden and requires tube feeding and artificial ventilation.
   CONCLUSION: Since Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a genetic disease that is caused by mutation of the tumor suppression gene TP53, patients should generally not be treated with radiotherapy or alkylating agents that induce deoxyribonucleic acid damage. However, if the prognostic benefit of post-operative adjuvant therapies is thought to surpass the risk of long-term secondary cancer, it is appropriate to consider these therapies after consultation with the patient and family. Postoperative treatment protocols are controversial, and their role should be further explored in cases of Li-Fraumeni syndrome complicated with malignant gliomas.

ID NEUROCYTOMA; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebellar liponeurocytoma (cLNC) is a rare benign glioneouronal tumor with only similar to 60 cases reported since its first description in 1978. They have occurred largely as sporadic cases; however, familial cases with possible autosomal dominant inheritance have also been reported. Surgical excision has been considered the main modality of treatment, even for recurrent lesions. Uncertainties exist regarding the natural history, long-term outcomes, and optimal postoperative management and follow-up protocols for cLNC in general and multifocal cLNC in particular. Multifocality is exceedingly rare, with only 4 cases reported previously.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of multifocal cLNC in a young women who had presented with progressive cerebellar symptoms of 5 months' duration. Her diagnostic neuroimaging evaluations revealed 2 asymmetric mass lesions (1 on each cerebellar hemisphere). We excised the larger lesion to relieve the mass effect and decided to monitor the smaller lesion radiologically. However, she developed a new lesion during the follow-up period and required adjuvant radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSION: Surgical excision forms the cornerstone of management of cLNCs. However, it is necessary to vigilantly monitor these patients owing to the high recurrence rates of cLNC despite the innocuous histologic features.

ID HIGH-FLOW BYPASS; PATENCY
AB BACKGROUND: A unique case of an internal carotid artery (ICA) giant aneurysm treated by high-flow bypass is presented. This patient had some anatomic variations in the neck region that posed problems for the high-flow bypass, and a new approach to address them is presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year woman presented with diplopia, abducens nerve palsy, severe headache, and disordered consciousness. She had a giant ICA aneurysm (diameter, 32 nun). Although high-flow bypass was considered, this patient had 3 anatomic issues that posed problems: an elongated styloid process, a high carotid bifurcation, and a meandering external carotid artery. Thus, some changes had to be introduced to proceed with the high-flow bypass. A tunnel radial artery (RA) graft was made between the supramandibular and subzygomatic areas, and an ICA-RA-M2 anastomosis was performed. The patient's preoperative symptoms improved gradually after surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography showed good patency of the RA graft and no ischemic change. She was discharged without neurological deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case provided 2 new methods for high-flow bypass: RA graft route and the anastomosis of the ICA in carotid bifurcation. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a high-flow bypass with a tunnel created for the RA graft (supramandibular-subzygomatic route) and an ICA-RA-M2 anastomosis.

AB BACKGROUND: On September 25, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a 17-goal action plan to transform the world by the year 2030, ushering in the Era of Sustainable Development. These Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to continue where the preceding Millennium Development Goals left off, expanding on the Millennium Development Goal successes, and facing the challenges encountered during the previous decade and a half. The current Era of Sustainable Development and its impact on a breadth of neurosurgical concerns provide several unprecedented opportunities to enhance political prioritization of neurosurgical care equity. Neurosurgeons could therefore be well positioned to participate in the leadership of these global health development and policy reform efforts.
   METHODS: Each of the 17 SDGs was reviewed and analyzed for its relevance to the public health aspects of neurosurgery. The analysis was guided by a review of the literature performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the databases of the World Health Organization.
   RESULTS: Among the 17 SDGs, 14 were found to be of direct or indirect relevance to neurosurgeons and neurosurgical care delivery. Results of this analysis are presented and discussed, and recommendations are provided for using this knowledge to inform the emerging discipline of global neurosurgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes to the global neurosurgery movement by providing the socially and globally conscious neurosurgeon with a compass for directing the place of neurosurgery in the international agenda for sustainable development.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been providing many solutions in spine surgery, and several technical variations and instrumentation systems are available. The aim of our study is to investigate the best system to perform a hybrid technique in lumbar spine fusion procedures.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients were enrolled and randomly signed to 1 of the 4 groups reported later. The first step in any case was midline incision, fascia exposure, and, using trocars, intravertebral transpedicle Kirschner wires (KWs) positioning through the fascia. Group definitions were A) KWs were affixed to surgical towels; B) screws with metal extensors were placed and KWs removed; C) screws with plastic extensors (K2M) were placed and those extensors were affixed to surgical towels; and D) screws without extensors or tulips (Nuvasive) were positioned. We locked the system at the end of procedure, after posterior decompression and translumbar interbody fusion cage placement. Procedures' features were rated using properly designed questionnaires by surgeons.
   RESULTS: Metal extensors were rated lower than other systems in any aspect. C and D groups' procedures were higher rated than those in A and B in all examined fields. Furthermore, group D's procedures were reported more comfortable during facetectomy, diskectomy, and cage placement. Surgeons reported Precept Modular (Nuvasive) as the most comfortable and useful system in the hybrid technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: Precept Modular seems to be the most useful system when performing hybrid technique in lumbar fusion procedures. Furthermore, it results in the only one that provides the opportunity to easily and quickly switch from minimally invasive surgery to open surgery, avoiding muscles' injuries.

AB BACKGROUND: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is most often a slowly progressive benign disease in which the normal bone structure is replaced by fibrous and osteoid tissue.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old adolescent, known with FD in the sphenoid bone, suffered an acute decreased visual acuity with papilledema on the left eye. The radiologic images were best compatible with cystic degeneration of the known FD with optic nerve compression in the optic canal. Decompression of the optic nerve was performed through an endoscopic exploration of the left sphenoid sinus. The visual acuity recovered completely.
   CONCLUSIONS: In FD with cystic changes, leading to acute signs of optic nerve compression, early aggressive surgical decompression is strongly recommended. Cystic degeneration of the FD, although rare, should be considered.

AB The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) is a complex nervous collection located at the lumbosacral region below the level of the aortic bifurcation. As a part of the autonomic nervous system, it is an extension of the preaortic plexuses and continues bilaterally as the hypogastric nerves that ultimately contribute to the inferior hypogastric plexus. Although commonly described as a plexiform structure, several morphologic variations exist. Damage to the SHP can occur during anterior and anterolateral approaches to the lumbosacral spine leading to dysfunction of the abdominopelvic viscera. Visceral afferents travel in the SHP and are responsible for transmitting pain. Management therapies such as SHP blockade or presacral neurectomy can reduce pelvic pain caused by cancer and nonmalignant etiologies. This review highlights some of the recent findings regarding the nature of the SHP.

AB BACKGROUND: Direct and/or indirect bypass surgery is established approach for preventing stroke in patients with moyamoya disease. However, conventional indirect revascularization, including encephalo-myo-synangiosis, has some disadvantages associated with the mass effect of the temporal muscle under the bone flap and postsurgical depression in the temporal region. We devised a novel indirect revascularization method, using only the temporal fascia, to address the aforementioned disadvantages.
   METHODS: A skin incision was performed along the superficial temporal artery. The temporal fascia was cut such that the base of the fascia flap was on the posterior side. The fascia and temporal muscles were dissected separately. After turning over the fascia, the muscle was cut such that the base of the muscle flap was on the anterior side. Craniotomy, direct bypass, and encephaloduro-synangiosis were performed conventionally. Only the temporal fascia was used for indirect revascularization and duraplasty. The muscle was replaced in the anatomically correct position after replacing the bone flap.
   RESULTS: We performed the aforementioned surgery on 18 (13 women and 5 men) consecutive patients (21 cerebral hemispheres) enrolled between 2012 and 2016. The average age was 28.7 years. The mean follow-up period was 31.6 months. In 17 patients (94%), the symptoms and cerebral blood flow improved. Digital subtraction angiography showed satisfactory angiogenesis from the temporal fascia. Depression in the temporal region and atrophy of the temporal muscle were negligible.
   CONCLUSIONS: This surgical technique provides good clinical and cosmetic outcomes. It may also be one of the good surgical treatments available for symptomatic moyamoya disease.

ID NATURAL-HISTORY; VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS; ANGIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations that account for 5%-15% of all central nervous system vascular malformations. However, multiple CCMs, which can be sporadic or familial, are rare, with a prevalence of 0.1%-0.5%.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we presented a rare case of sporadic multiple CCMs in an infant, which were accompanied with multiple cavernous malformations of the chest and skin.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCMs were pathologically diagnosed through the total resection of the pineal regional lesion. We also observed a spontaneous regression of the remaining lesions during a follow-up period of 2 years. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CCMs in an infant in the English-language literature.

ID ANGIOMAS; HEMORRHAGE; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal epidural cavernous hemangiomas are rare vascular malformations. Exceptionally, they present with dumbbell-shaped morphology. When they happen, it's mandatory to include their pathology in the differential diagnosis because of their similarity to schwannomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 72-year-old woman with a dumbbell-shaped thoracic epidural cavernous hemangioma. A literature review of diagnostic features and current treatment options are also discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is safe and effective in both improving patient condition and preventing acute hemorrhage that can worsen the outcome, causing neurologic and potentially irreversible deficits. The favorable result we obtained in our patient suggests that surgery should be evaluated as the first option, even in patients with large epidural cavernous hemangiomas.

TI Large Scalp Defect Repair with Flap Reconstruction Using Tissue Expander
   After Combined Bypass in Case of Moyamoya Disease
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Combined revascularization; Moyamoya disease; Scalp flap necrosis;
   Tissue expanders
ID INDIRECT REVASCULARIZATION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Combined revascularization is the preferred surgical management of adult Moyamoya disease. However, postoperative flap necrosis of the scalp is not an uncommon complication. We investigated the role of scalp incision design on the basis of the course of the superficial temporal artery (STA) to prevent postoperative scalp necrosis. The utility of tissue expander in wide scalp defect repair is explored.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 13-year-old female patient underwent STA-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis due to ischemic symptoms. However, she suffered from wide scalp necrosis measuring 10.5 x 10 cm after bypass surgery. Conventional rotational scalp flap reconstruction was impossible due to the wide defect, and therefore split thickness skin graft was considered. However, aesthetic compromise or hair loss is a psycho-logic burden in an adolescent female. Two tissue expanders were inserted under the contralateral normal scalp, and a gradual expansion was achieved by saline infusion for 3 months. Finally, a wide scalp flap, which covered the large defect, was obtained using this procedure. The patient underwent rotational flap advancement and was discharged without any hair loss wound.
   CONCLUSIONS: Miserable scalp flap design results in a large scalp defect during combined bypass surgery. However, tissue expanders aided the reconstruction of a large scalp defect. Reconstruction using tissue expanders and advancement of local rotation flap is recommended in case of large scalp necrosis. The procedure yields cosmetically superior outcomes due to scalp hair conservation and concealment of postoperative scar behind the hair line.

AB The fundamental role of technological instruments in contemporary Neurosurgery is undisputed, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents one of the best examples. The use of a modern high-field magnet and the possibility to match the MRI with an operative microscope and an integrated neuronavigation system has led to successful results in the surgical treatment of different diseases. At our institute, we have performed surgery routinely with the aid of intraoperative MRI over the last 15 years. The aim of this article is to report our experience in the management of neurovascular lesions with the use of this device. We experienced that intraoperative MRI enhanced the surgical experience, leading to an improved postoperative outcome in the treatment of different lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, intracranial cavernous angiomas, and intracranial aneurysms. There are several advantages provided by the use of intraoperative MRI. The use of intraoperative MRI coupled with the planning station and the neuronavigation system allows one to obtain preoperative 3-dimensional reconstructions of the vessels, which aids the definition of the anatomy of each neurovascular lesion. Furthermore, the possibility performing an intraoperative scan allows a comparison with preoperative images and, subsequently, the updating of the surgical strategy. Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging can detect possible territorial ischemia that would be amenable to intensive treatment. Although increased costs, increased surgical times, increased anesthesiology times, and the possible increased risk of surgical infection may represent some major limitation, the use of intraoperative MRI-equipped operative theaters with integrated neuronavigation systems can prove extremely helpful in the management of neurovascular conditions.

DT Article
DE Paradoxical herniation; Sinking skin flap syndrome; Syndrome of the
   trephined
ID CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SINKING SKIN FLAP; CRANIOPLASTY; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Syndrome of the trephined is a unique neurosurgical condition that is seen in patients that have undergone craniectomy. While the symptoms of the condition range from mild to severe, the only definitive treatment for the condition is replacement of the bone flap. This article presents a novel, temporary treatment for syndrome of the trephined in a patient with severe symptoms who was unable to undergo immediate cranioplasty due to infection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old gentleman with a history of trauma resulting in hydrocephalus, craniectomy, and eventually ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement presented with a cranial wound infection requiring removal of his bone flap. While being treated with antibiotics, with his bone flap removed, he developed severe syndrome of the trephined. An emergency bedside procedure was developed and executed to treat his condition.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treating syndrome of the trephined with an external suction device proved useful and lifesaving fort the patient presented. Such a device can be made with common supplies found within any hospital. The technique used to treat the patient is novel and may be useful for others to consider if ever faced with a similar situation.

ID I MALFORMATION; BASILAR IMPRESSION; SYRINGOMYELIA
AB BACKGROUND: Authors analyzed surgical patients with Chiari malformation (CM) associated with cerebellar tonsillar cyst. This association is quite rarely encountered in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We retrospectively reviewed 60 surgical adult patients MRI evaluation who underwent posterior fossa decompression for treatment of CM type I. All surgeries were performed between January 1995 and July 2015. From 60 patients with CM, four cases presented cerebellar tonsillar cysts (male= 2). Basilar invagination (BI) (n = 4) and syringomyelia (n =1) were associated. There were pyramidal signs (n = 4) and low cranial nerves dysfunction (n =1). Radiological evaluation showed T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense image on the cystic tissue (n =4). The surgical technique was suboccipital craniectomy, C1-C2 laminectomy (if needed), y-shaped durotomy, total resection and coagulation/aspiration of tonsils.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present series, we were able to identify 7% of tonsillar - among 60 patients with CM. MRI with Flair and Diffusion sequences should be pre-operatively used for evaluation of tissue characteristics as differential diagnosis of cystic lesion and gliosis. The clinical presentation endorses surgical indication, with a good chance of clinical improvement. This was the first time that the frequency of tonsillar cysts has been evaluated in a series of adult patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic orofacial pain syndrome, which manifests as severe pain in the distribution of any trigeminal nerve branch. Though traditionally responsive to anticonvulsant therapy, TN can become refractory to medications and require surgical intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of V2 TN that was treated with ,imally invasive trigeminal ablation. The patient presented with a 6-year history of type 1 TN and had failed the maximum tolerated doses of carbamazepine and gabapentin. There was no evidence of vascular compression on neuroimaging. After the patient refused stereotactic radiosurgery, she was offered minimally invasive trigeminal ablation. At 5 months postoperatively the patient reported complete alleviation of pain with tolerable sensorineural numbness.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic approach allows for precise targeting of V2, is ideal in patients undergoing targeted neuroablation for pain. This is the first documented case of a transoral endoscopic approach toward ablative V2 TN management.

AB OBJECTIVE: Liponeurocytoma is a rare benign tumor of the central nervous system, which develops mainly in adult patients within the posterior fossa. The World Health Organization has categorized this entity in its last classification of 2016 as a benign grade II tumor. Histopathologic characteristics contain neuronal and variable astrocytic differentiation with foci of lipomatous distinction. Only a few case reports and case series have been reported and the knowledge of this tumor is limited. General treatment guidelines do not exist. The aim of this study was to analyze the literature to create treatment guidelines.
   METHODS: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed to search existing online databases between January 1, 1978 and May 15, 2018.
   RESULTS: A systematic review of the literature found 73 patients (40 female, 33 male) with liponeurocytoma, in 59 of whom (80.8%) the disease occurred in the posterior fossa. The Ki-67/MIB-1 proliferation index was described in 58 patients, showing a mean value of 3.73% +/- 4.01%. Follow-up was performed in 49 patients, with a median length of 52.02 +/- 50.52 months, showing tumor recurrence in 14 patients (28.57%). Tumor recurrence was observed in only 1 patient (1/12, 8.33%) after adjuvant radiotherapy, whereas tumor recurrence was seen in 13/29 patients (44.83%) who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Liponeurocytomas are rare benign tumors, occurring mainly in the cerebellum. The therapy of choice is surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy seems to decrease the risk of tumor recurrence and should be offered to the patient.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial nonskull-based chondrosarcoma is a very rare malignant tumor. In fact, it is difficult to diagnose because of its atypical radiologic and morphologic features. We report a case of an intracranial parasagittal chondrosarcoma in the left parietal lobe accompanied with significant peritumoral edema (an extremely rare phenomenon for this tumor), with a review of the literature, to clarify aspects in the diagnosis of this rare tumor.
   METHODS: A literature search was using PubMed with specific key terms, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. Selected case studies and case series were then compared and summarized them in Table 1. A 59-year-old male patient presented with a history of progressive right hemiparesis and loss of sensation for 45 days.
   RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.8-cm mass arising from the superior sagittal sinus in his left parietal lobe. A left parietal parasagittal craniotomy was performed, and a macroscopically complete excision of the tumor was achieved. The patient recovered well postoperatively. Regular follow-up after 6 months revealed that he had almost recovered full strength to his right limbs, and there was no evidence of recurrence. Intracranial parasagittal chondrosarcoma in the parietal lobe is extremely rare.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although magnetic resonance imaging was performed, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish intracranial chondrosarcoma from meningioma and glioma, especially when the tumor arises from a nonskull base such as the meninges. Some cases could have significant peritumoral edema, although it is extremely rare. Histologic examination may aid in the diagnosis of this tumor. Neurosurgery is the most effective therapy for these tumors. Postoperative radiotherapy needs to be considered when the tumor is incompletely resected, has atypical histology, or is associated with significant peritumoral edema.

ID CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; DYSPHAGIA; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior cervical osteophytes (ACOs) are a common radiologic finding in the elderly; rarely, they can cause dysphagia, dysphonia, and dyspnea. Symptomatic ACOs are most commonly found between C4 and C7 and much less commonly at higher cervical levels. Here, we present a case series, with an example case of a 57-year-old woman with high cervical osteophytes at C1-C2 causing globus sensation, dysphagia, and dysphonia. Additionally, we provide a literature review regarding the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of ACOs, with a focus on management of high ACOs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old smoker with a history of chronic neck pain and previous cervical spinal instrumentation presented with several months of globus sensation, dysphagia, and dysphonia. Imaging revealed 2 large anterior osteophytes at C1-C2. She underwent endoscopic transoral osteophytectomy, with resolution of symptoms. Five other patients are also presented who underwent similar procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACOs are a potential cause of dysphagia, and their diagnosis is best made with computed tomographic imaging and oropharyngeal swallow study. Although high ACOs at C1-C2 are a rare finding, here we show with an exemplary case and small case series that they can be effectively treated with transoral endoscopic osteophytectomy.

AB BACKGROUND: We present a case report of traumatic pseudomeningocele a review of the literature and discussion of the neuro-cytoarchitecture to address the disproportionate weakness of extensor neurons seen in the case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year old man developed profound hand weakness 21 years after a lumbar spinal fracture. An examination revealed bilateral hand weakness affecting the extensors of the hands. Imaging studies revealed an extensive ventral epidural pseudomeningocele extending from the area of the lumbar spinal fracture to the cervical spine posteriorly displacing the spinal cord and the ventral motor roots.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient was successfully treated with a subarachnoid-peritoneal shunt, which completely resolved the epidural pseudomeningocele and resulted in improvement but not resolution of his neurologic deficits.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral fat embolism (CFE) is a rare complication that usually occurs after trauma injury. The incidence of CFE due to aesthetic surgery is extremely rare and can lead to fatal outcome. Due to the rarity of this complication, there is still lack of knowledge and standardization of the treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we reported 6 cases of CFE that occurred in patients who underwent cosmetic surgery. Among 5 patients who had large artery occlusion, 3 patients survived and 2 patients died due to progression of the disease. One patient had the ophthalmic artery occlusion. In addition, embolectomy was performed in 5 patients and 3 patients had decompressive craniectomy following endovascular treatment due to severe brain edema.
   CONCLUSIONS: CFE is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and early surgical intervention can improve the prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: In this study, a historical case series is reported of reaction bonded silicon nitride (Si3N4) implants for anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for a patient population of 30 and surgery levels L3/4, L4/5, and/or L5/S1. Before the study, the only work on Si3N4 as a biomedical material was associated preliminary work, which involved animal trials using a rabbit model. The objective was to undertake the first use of Si3N4 as a biomedical material for humans, as an implant for ALIF.
   METHODS: The Si3N4 implants were prepared by die-pressing silicon powder and reaction bonding in 95 N-2/5 H-2 at similar to 1400 degrees C for similar to 50 hours. The surgeries involved a retroperitoneal approach for L3/4 and L4/5 levels and a transperitoneal approach for L5/S1 level. The patient follow-up involved assessment of radiologic fusion up to 30 years and clinical outcomes to 10 years.
   RESULTS: The reaction bonded Si3N4 implants were found to be biologically safe and to show high fusion rates with minimal subsidence, no abnormal reaction, and no other complications. The primary outcome measure, visual analog scale back pain, improved from a preoperative mean of 8.4 (range, 6-10) to a mean of 3.7 (range, 0-9) at 5 years and a mean of 4.9 (range, 0-9) at 10 years. The Oswestry Disability Index improved from a preoperative mean of 48 (range, 26-84) to a mean of 35 (range, 4-76) at 10 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that Si3N4 is biologically safe in the long-term, with capacity for excellent radiologic osseointegration.

AB BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc (ID) degeneration represents the number one cause for outpatient clinic visits worldwide. Mechanisms are discussed but not yet clearly established. Consequently, back pain management is commonly limited to symptomatic treatment therapies.
   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to evaluate major progress and to unravel the biology and pathology of ID discogenic pain.
   METHODS: The design of this study is a systematic review. A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases, with no time constraints to locate relevant literature. Significant articles (literature reviews, therapeutic essays, clinical-human-research studies, animal research, and laboratory research) on the intervertebral disc were identified and reviewed. The exclusion criteria were the following: case reports and clinical studies with < 10 patients.
   RESULTS: Through a dense review of the literature, the ID is deciphered and described as a fragile anatomic entity. For this systematic review, 132 studies were identified and 79 were retained. The main deterioration and alteration mechanisms that lead to the programmed death of the ID are summarized. In addition, the large variety of biological therapies that override surgical treatment are determined.
   CONCLUSIONS: The degeneration mechanisms of the ID are well defined and decrypted. Although therapies have progressed, none has been effective. The regeneration of the ID remains highly challenging because of the complexity of its natural composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties.

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant meningiomas are rare neoplasms of the central nervous system that occur de novo or rarely as a result of transformation. They have a higher rate of recurrence and metastasis accompanied by a significantly shorter survivorship compared with benign variants. Meningioma cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been previously shown to be associated with resistance and aggressiveness. However, the role they play in meningioma progression is still being investigated.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 29-year-old man who underwent a resection of a grade I meningioma in 2011. The patient had multiple local recurrences of the tumor that showed an aggressive change in behavior and transformation to grade III meningioma, and developed extracranial metastasis to the cervical spine. He underwent multiple operations and received radiotherapy. Analysis of the tissues indicated the presence of CSC markers before metastasis, and showed increased expressions of associated markers in the metastasized tissue. In addition, similar to the patient's profile, the pharmacological testing of a primary cell line retrieved from the metastasized tissues showed a high level of drug tolerance and a diminished ability to initiate apoptosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Malignant progression of grade I meningioma can occur, and its eventuality may be anticipated by detecting CSCs. We performed a comprehensive literature review of relevant cases and discussed the clinical, diagnostic, and management characteristics of the reported cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is a life-threatening syndrome. The usage of a dopamine agonist, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, is considered a predisposing factor for PA, which commonly occurs 1.5 years within commencement.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old female with a >15-year history of cabergoline therapy for pituitary prolactinoma was referred to our department of neurosurgery after complaining of headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and ptosis for 3 days during hospital admission for chemotherapy of chronic myelocytic leukemia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings indicative of PA. As the patient was experiencing thrombocytopenia related to chemotherapy, blood transfusion was preceded, and after a platelet count of 15.0 x 104/mu L was confirmed, transnasal neuroendoscopic surgery was performed 5 days from the onset of symptoms. The majority of the prolactinoma was removed, and the prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus was intentionally left. The postoperative course was generally good. The ptosis and diplopia improved, and the blurred vision resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: PA related to dopamine agonist therapy can occur in cases of elevated bleeding tendency, even in long-term users, suggesting that attention should be paid in the administration of a dopamine agonist in the patient experiencing thrombocytopenia. Surgical intervention should be performed after the preoperative platelet number and adequate response to transfusion are confirmed, and the aggressive removal of prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus should be avoided to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluated the clinical outcomes of skip laminectomy relative to laminoplasty for the treatment of cervical compressive myelopathy.
   METHODS: The Cochrane library, PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched to identify relevant articles published up to March 18, 2018. All values of weighted mean difference (WMD) or odds ratio are expressed as skip laminectomy relative to laminoplasty.
   RESULTS: Four studies comprising 241 patients were included. Skip laminectomy and laminoplasty were comparable in terms of cervical lordotic curvature (weighted mean difference [WMD] -2.37 degrees; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.18 to 1.43; P = 0.22) and range of motion (WMD -2.65 degrees; 95% CI -6.02 to 0.72; P = 0.12). The pooled data revealed that the mean visual analogue scale score for pain of the skip laminectomy group was significantly lower than that of the laminoplasty group (WMD -0.97; 95% CI -1.90 to -0.05; P = 0.04), and the rate of axial pain was also significantly lower (WMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.07-0.93; P = 0.04). The atrophy rates of the deep extensor muscles in the skip laminectomy group (14%) were significantly lower than that of the laminoplasty group (60%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis determined that skip laminectomy was superior to laminoplasty in terms of visual analogue scale score and rates of axial pain and muscle atrophy. These results warrant further confirmation in future research.

AB Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive neoplasm with an extremely poor prognosis. Despite maximal gross resection and chemoradiotherapy, these grade IV astrocytomas consistently recur. Glioblastoma cells exhibit numerous pathogenic mechanisms to decrease tumor immunogenicity while promoting gliomagenesis, which manifests clinically as a median survival of less than 2 years and few long-term survivors. Recent clinical trials of vaccine-based immunotherapeutics against glioblastoma have demonstrated encouraging results in prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival. Several vaccine-based treatments have been trialed, such as peptide and heat-shock proteins, dendritic cell-based vaccines, and viral-based immunotherapy. In this literature review, we discuss the immunobiology of glioblastoma, significant current and completed vaccine-based immunotherapy clinical trials, and broad clinical challenges and future directions of glioblastoma vaccine-based immunotherapeutics.

TI Minimally Invasive Interhemispheric Approach for Giant Olfactory Groove
   Meninagioma: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Interhemispheric approach; Minimally invasive; Olfactory groove
   meningioma; Skull base tumors
AB BACKGROUND: Skull base tumors, such as large ol-factoy groove meningiomas (OGMs), are a challenge for neurosurgeons. However, the tendency to reduce invasive surgeries is gaining more adepts. We describe a minimally invasive interhemispheric approach with a falx window for microsurgical resection of the giant OGM as a technical note.
   METHODS: A minimal medial frontal craniotomy measuring 3-5 cm in size is performed, and an interhemispheric approach is combined with an opening in the falx to improve microsurgical resection of the giant OGM. The technique and more details are described.
   RESULTS: A minimally invasive interhemispheric approach with a falx window was performed in this case. Gross total resection of the OGM was possible with minimal brain retraction. Simpson grade I was achieved, and there was a good outcome on the postoperative recovery period of the patient, with vision improvement, preservation of olfaction, and no other complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive interhemispheric approach with a falx window is effective and safe for giant OGM with a good outcome for the patient. The opening in the falx improves the interhemispheric pathway and allows gross total resection with minimal brain retraction and low morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: The prognosis for World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III meningiomas is worse than for WHO grade I meningiomas. Histopathologic grade should ideally be identified during tumor resection, but current methods are time-consuming and have doubtful reliance. The aim of this study was to evaluate intraoperative flow cytometry (iFC) as a method for providing ultrarapid evaluation of meningioma malignancy.
   METHODS: A total of 117 meningiomas were analyzed iFC during surgery. For each, the malignancy index (MI) was calculated as the number of cells with a greater than normal DNA content as a proportion of the total number of cells. Each specimen was investigated histo-pathologically and was diagnostically graded according to the 2016 WHO grading system. MI results were compared with WHO grades of the meningiomas.
   RESULTS: The automatic measurement of iFC took approximately 9 minutes on average. The difference in MI between grade I and grade II/III meningiomas was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis provided an optimal cutoff MI value of 8.0% for discrimination between grade I and grade II/III groups, with 64.7% sensitivity and 85.0% specificity for grade II/III meningiomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our method of calculating MI with iFC appears to be technically feasible and reliable for ultrarapid evaluation of meningioma malignancy. MI with iFC could potentially enable determination of an optimal treatment strategy during surgery, such as extent of resection of the tumor and management of invaded normal brain or nerves.

TI Post-Traumatic Pituitary Tumor Apoplexy After Closed Head Injury: Case
   Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Endoscopic endonasal approach; Pituitary apoplexy; Traumatic
AB BACKGROUND: Head trauma is a rare inciting factor of pituitary apoplexy (PA); however, there is a clear temporal relationship between trauma and apoplexy, and this is the first reported case of PA after an assault.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of a 63-year-old man who developed PA after sustaining a closed head injury from assault with a metal pole. The patient had a known pituitary tumor for which he had previously declined surgical resection. On initial computed tomography scan, there was no traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was sellar expansion but no obvious sellar hemorrhage. Within 48 hours of admission, the patient was presumed septic after developing altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without gadolinium revealed a poorly enhancing, necrotic, and hemorrhagic pituitary mass, consistent with pituitary tumor apoplexy. After administration of intravenous glucocorticoids, the patient underwent emergent endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor apoplexy. Postoperatively, the patient had neurologic improvement with stable vision.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early and accurate diagnosis is important to allow for timely neurosurgical intervention. Symptoms of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia in a patient with a known sellar mass should raise the suspicion of hypocortisolemia from pituitary tumor apoplexy.

AB BACKGROUND: Ictal asystole (IA) and ictal bradycardia (IB) are mainly seen with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Many patients with these conditions undergo cardiac pacemaker therapy but not epilepsy surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 15-year-old boy with IA and IB secondary to right posterior quadrant epilepsy (PoQE) who underwent right posterior quadrant disconnection, but not cardiac pacemaker implantation. He has remained free from daily epileptic seizures, IA, and IB for more than 6 months postoperatively. This is the first report of a radically treated case with IA and IB caused by PoQE.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both temporofrontal lobe epilepsy and PoQE caused the IA and IB. Because a cardiac pacemaker only addresses arrhythmia, not epileptic seizures, radical treatment for both epilepsy and arrhythmia may be warranted for patients with medically intractable epilepsy.

AB BACKGROUND: Microcatheter entrapment during embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represents a potentially harmful technical complication. Although several techniques have been reported for endovascular catheter retrieval from an Onyx cast, such methods have never been demonstrated with acrylic glues. We report a case of removal of a glued microcatheter from an N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) cast using a microsnare.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: A 26-year-old woman presented with an intracranial hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured right choroidal AVM. A microcatheter used for transarterial embolization was unintentionally glued into the NBCA cast. Because attempts to remove the catheter by simple traction failed, a microsnare was used and allowed withdrawal of the entrapped microcatheter without causing damage to the cerebral vasculature. The patient woke up without clinical sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although it is not recommended as routin practice, snaring a glued microcatheter is feasible and can be used in selected cases as a last resort if thromboembolic complications are feared.

DT Article
DE Aneurysm treatment; Metal allergy; Nickel allergy; Pipeline endovascular
   device
AB BACKGROUND: Metal allergies affect a significant portion of the population; intracranial flow diverters contain many of the most commonly allergenic metals. Prior literature has suggested patch testing for all patients with documented or suspected metal allergies before intracranial flow diverter placement; however, there remains a paucity of reports of patients with documented metal allergies undergoing intracranial flow diversion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 patients with documented nickel allergies, confirmed via patch testing by a board-certified allergist, and unruptured intracranial aneurysms that underwent treatment with the PED. Both patients developed contact dermatitis when a PED was affixed to their skin during their preoperative workup. Follow-up arteriography at 12 and 36 months post PED placement showed no evidence of in-stent stenosis or intimal hyperplasia, and both patients never developed systemic allergic reactions.
   CONCLUSIONS: In 2 patients with known nickel allergies and intracranial aneurysms treated with the PED, there were no clinically or radiographically apparent allergic reactions at greater than 2 years of follow-up.

   OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the clinical efficacy between percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) versus posterior open lumbar microdiscectomy (OLMD) for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive retrieval of related studies in 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library). Randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials reported from January 1990 to December 2017 that compared PELD versus OLMD for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation were acquired. The quality of randomized controlled trials was evaluated by the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group, and the quality of cohort studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcome measurements included preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score of sciatica; the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) before and after surgery; the Excellent and Good outcome rate based on Macnab criteria. The secondary outcome measurements included the incidence of complication, residual disk, recurrence, and reoperation; operation time; hospital stay; and time to return to work. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed each study for quality.
   RESULTS: Nine studies with 1585 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Two were randomized controlled trials and the remaining 7 were retrospective cohort studies. The forest plots showed that no statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of preoperative and postoperative VAS score of sciatica, ODI before and after surgery, the Excellent and Good outcome rate, the complication rate, and the incidence of recurrence and reoperation. However, the PELD group had a higher incidence of residual disk or incomplete decompression than did the OLMD group. In addition, no significant difference was detected in the operation time between the 2 groups, but the PELD group was associated with shorter hospital stay and time of return to work.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present meta-analysis, no significant difference existed in VAS and ODI scores between the 2 surgical procedures, and they were also similar in terms of operation time, complication rate, and incidence of recurrence and reoperation, but PELD showed shorter hospital stay and time of return to work. Thus, under the premise of careful manipulation and complete decompression, we consider that PELD is a relatively more minimally invasive technique, which could be an alternative to OLMD.

DE Aphasia; Epidermoid; Sylvian fissure
ID TEMPORAL-LOBE; DIAGNOSIS; TUMORS
AB INTRODUCTION: Epidermoid cysts within the sylvian fissure are extremely rare. Expressive aphasia and neurocognitive dysfunction because of mass effect have never been reported previously.
   CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss the case of a 53-year-old male who presented with an acute episode of expressive aphasia and vision changes along with progressive headaches and cognitive slowing over the 2.5 years prior to presentation. A detailed neurologic examination revealed subtle conductive aphasia, as well as mild short-term memory dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass consistent with epidermoid cyst within the left sylvian fissure. High-definition fiber tractography showed that the arcuate fasciculus was stretched by the tumor. A left frontotemporal craniotomy allowed for near-total excision of the cyst and led to rapid and complete resolution of symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: Although rare, epidermoid cysts of the dominant sylvian fissure can present with progressive aphasia due to mass effect on the arcuate fasciculus. Despite the long-standing symptoms, surgical resection can lead to their complete resolution.

ID DEVICE
AB BACKGROUND: Bloodless dry fields are indispensable for successful and safe neurosurgical operations using microscopes. Appropriate irrigation and suction systems are needed to obtain clear surgical fields. We invented a novel malleable continuous suction tube to address this need.
   METHODS: We developed a malleable tube (MT) made ultrathin stainless-steel foil (approximate to 5 mu m in thickness, 3.0 mm in diameter, 15 cm in length) contained between ultrafine stainless-steel wire mesh (50 mu m in diameter) woven tubes. The MT was applied in an intraoperative continuous fluid suction system, connecting it to a conventional vacuum system through a device.
   RESULTS: The MT can be placed at any part of the oparative field, preferably close to its edges, without disturbing surgeon manipulation. This continuous suction system has been tested in neurosurgical operations and has shown excellent potential for maintaining the operative field clear and dry without any side effect or trauma on adjacent tissues.
   CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed malleable suction effective for microsurgery.

   FOSSA; BRAIN; DEGENERATION; REMOVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial squamous cell carcinoma (PISCC) is extremely rare, and most cases are caused by malignant changes in an epidermoid cyst or a dermoid cyst. We report a case of intracranial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that arose without a preexisting tumor. In addition, the literature on PISCC is reviewed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20-year-old man presented with a 4-day history of headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a heterogeneous and irregularly marginated solid-cystic lesion in the left lateral ventricle, which enhanced dramatically. The patient underwent removal of the lesion, and a postoperative histologic examination showed SCC. The patient did not undergo postoperative radiotherapy and was admitted to the hospital again 40 days later because of dizziness, right lower extremity pain, and difficulty in bending. Computed tomography showed hydrocephalus. The cerebrospinal fluid examination confirmed an intracranial infection. The patient was discharged after treatment. The patient survived for 9 months from the onset of the disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of PISCC arise from the malignant transformation of epidermoid cysts. However, SCC arising de novo is even less common. Although rare, the malignant transformation of intracranial epithelial cysts has a poor prognosis. Future prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the optimal treatment modality for patients with PISCC.

ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SINUS HISTIOCYTOSIS; MASSIVE LYMPHADENOPATHY;
   FEATURES; CHILD
AB BACKGROUND: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a benign, self-limiting, and nonneoplastic histiocytic proliferative disorder with a poorly defined pathogenesis. Central nervous system involvement is extremely rare, particularly cases with multiple intracranial masses. There is no consensus on optimal treatment and management of RDD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In case 1, a 39-year-old man presented with headaches and paroxysmal convulsions of the limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple solid masses located at the right frontoparietal and left frontal meningeal regions. The masses were surgically removed for staging, and the histologic diagnosis was consistent with RDD. In case 2, a 53-year-old man was admitted with epileptic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple, homogeneously enhancing masses in the left parietal, temporal, and occipital meningeal regions. The largest mass was surgically removed, and histopathologic examination confirmed RDD. In case 3, a 9-year-old girl was admitted with bilateral exophthalmos and incomplete eyelid closure. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed multiple, heterogeneously enhancing masses in the right parietal meningeal region. All masses were surgically removed, and the histopathologic diagnosis was RDD.
   CONCLUSIONS: RDD with multiple isolated intracranial foci is rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis when multiple meningiomas are suspected in children and adults. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging, and definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemical examination. Surgical resection is the most effective therapy for rapid relief of symptoms.

   approach; Surgical technique; Vestibular schwannoma
ID FACIAL-NERVE OUTCOMES; HEARING PRESERVATION; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of vestibular schwannomas (VS) located within the internal auditory canal (IAC) is challenging, especially those located very laterally in the IAC. Various transcranial approaches have been described for resection of intracanalicular VS including retrosigmoid, translabyrinthine, and middle fossa approaches. Each approach has its indications, advantages, and limitations. The middle fossa approach (MFA) is considered by many authors as the gold standard approach for resection of small intracanalicular VS in young patients with serviceable hearing; however, there is often a limitation in complete visualization of the tumor.
   METHODS: The authors present an illustrative case to highlight the technical nuances of complementary use of endoscopy in MFA for complete resection of intracanalicular VS located at the IAC fundus, preserving preoperative hearing status and mainting intact facial nerve function.
   RESULTS: In our experience, the combined use of the endoscope and the microspe as described here and illustrated in our case, improves visualization of the IAC and its contents, improving ressection and outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: MFA allows for a direct yet safe surgical corridor to small intracanalicular VS. The implementation of endoscopy with MFA, especially for VS located laterally in the IAC, allows for better opportunity for complete resection of the tumor with improved preservation of hearing and facial nerve function.

AB BACKGROUND: Venous stenting has become a promising treatment for various sinus stenosis. However, it is not without its own set of risks.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported de novo formation of dural arteriovenous fistula poststenting for venous sinus stenosis in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri. Multiple factors, including subclinical thrombus formation, sinus wall injury by stent placement, and up-regulated inflammatory factors, may contribute to its pathogenesis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that physicians may need to be aware of this rare complication, which can be managed without resumption of pseudotumor cerebri symptoms.

AB An understanding of the anatomy and function of the skull base venous channels is fundamentally important for safe performance of endoscopic surgery for skull base lesions. This review focuses on 4 skull base venous channels-namely, the intercavernous sinuses, basilar plexus, osseous veins, and inferior petroclival vein-because these have been less recognized by neurosurgeons than other major venous channels such as the inferior petrosal sinus. We reviewed the literature concerning these 4 venous channels and discussed their anatomy and function. The literature review was mainly based on an electronic search in PubMed using the following terms: "intercavernous sinus," "basilar plexus," "emissary veins," "diploic vein," "basilar plexus," "intraosseous vein," "inferior petroclival/petro-occipital vein,"and "transclival."A total of 50 articles were included in this review. Detailed anatomic features of the 4 structures have been elucidated in the literature. All of these venous channels run along the skull base and have multiple connections with surrounding venous structures. Because of their location, they occasionally obstruct the surgical view and are sometimes implicated in intraoperative hemorrhage, air embolism during endoscopic skull base surgery, and postoperative hematoma. They usually function as a venous reservoir of cranial venous drainage; however, they are less often directly involved in normal brain perfusion. Knowledge about the functional and morphologic anatomy of the skull base venous channels is important for neurosurgeons to avoid unexpected complications during endoscopic skull base surgery.

TI Transradial Mechanical Thrombectomy for Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery
   Occlusion in a First Trimester Pregnancy: Case Report and Literature
   Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Mechanical thrombectomy; Pregnancy; Transradial access
ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke in pregnancy is a cause of maternal and fetal morbidity. Optimal treatment strategies for stroke in this population are undefined. Thrombolysis is recommended by guidelines should the benefit outweigh uterine bleeding risk. Alternately, data regarding mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is extremely limited. We present a 37-year-old woman in the first trimester that developed recurrent proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion after previous thrombolysis and underwent MT via transradial access. This report of transradial MT represents the first case performed through an extrafemoral route for large vessel occlusion in early pregnancy found in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old gravida 8 para 7 at 9 weeks' gestation presented with left-sided hemiplegia and right gaze preference and underwent successful thrombolysis for a right MCA occlusion. Two days later, she exhibited the same symptoms, and a reoccluded right MCA was identified. Because thrombolysis was unavailable given the recent stroke, the patient underwent emergentMTvia radial access (to minimize fetal radiation exposure) and achieved thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b revascularization without complication to her or her child. At 2-month follow-up, the patient is on anticoagulation and has a healthy pregnancy with only minor left-sided facial weakness.
   CONCLUSIONS: When thrombolysis is contraindicated, thrombectomy should be considered and weighed against risks of fetal radiation exposure and contrast load, especially in early pregnancy. Transradial MT is safe, feasible, and mitigates pelvic radiation. A multidisciplinary approach with obstetrics, stroke teams, and neurointerventionalists is vital for successful therapy.

DE Arachnoid cyst; Neurodegeneration; Optical coherence tomography; Pineal
   region
AB BACKGROUND: Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive high-resolution imaging technique, which is considered a biomarker of neuro-degeneration. Several intracranial lesions can induce retrograde neuro-degeneration which can be assessed using OCT. The cysts of the pineal region are usually asymptomatic and most often are an incidental radiologic finding.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman with an arachnoid cyst of the pineal region who complained of visual symptoms for 3 months. Bilateral macular thinning was demonstrated by OCT both on the pre-operative and postoperative examinations, without any other clinical findings that could explain the results.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the retinal alteration is caused by retrograde neuro-degeneration secondary to the pineal region mass.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for cardiopulmonary support is indicated for refractory respiratory failure but carries a high morbidity and mortality in the neurosurgical setting due to associated risks of intracranial hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 62-year-old man who underwent craniotomy for resection of an esthesioneuroblastoma involving the anterior skull base and extending intracranially, through the cribriform plate into the right epidural space. He developed refractory hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure and circulatory shock in the immediate postoperative period. Our patient was successfully treated with ECMO after other aggressive resuscitative measures proved unsuccessful for several hours. The patient was managed with ECMO for 6 days, after which he was successfully weaned without developing any neurologic complications.
   CONCLUSION: Our case report is significant because it describes the safe of ECMO in a controversial setting because our patient had recently undergone craniotomy. We conclude that in dire circumstances the use of ECMO is appropriate and may be safe even in the setting of recent craniotomy.

TI A Worst-Case Scenario - Undiagnosed Ruptured Arteriovenous Malformation
   Managed with Limited Resources
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE AVM; Clip; Hematoma
AB BACKGROUND: Treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is performed at specialized neurosurgical centers well equipped with microscopes with green filters, neurosurgical catheterization laboratories, and experienced neurosurgical teams. Patients in whom AVMs are diagnosed at smaller hospitals should be referred to such specialized centers. This case report describes the unavoidable worst-case scenario of an emergency unplanned surgical excision of an undiagnosed ruptured AVM with large hematoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with episodes of seizures and sudden loss of consciousness. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5. He had anisocoria. Computed tomography of the head showed right occipital hematoma with mass effect and herniation. Suspected diagnosis was spontaneous tumor or hypertensive bleed. Emergency surgery was performed. Intraoperatively, ruptured AVM was found. After explaining to family members about nonavailability of conventional instruments (i.e., microscope, clips, indocyanine green), we planned for excision of AVM with available resources.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperatively the patient recovered satisfactorily with right-side vision loss. He underwent cranioplasty after 6 weeks. In such a worst-case scenario, remaining calm, following basic surgical steps, using blood transfusion, and employing lateral thinking regarding using available resources can result in satisfactory management of the patient.

TI Intracranial Venous Reflux Caused by Occlusion of the Brachiocephalic
   Vein Mimicking Dural Arteriovenous Fistula
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brachiocephalic vein occlusion; Endovascular treatment; Intracranial
   venous reflux
ID CEREBRAL INFARCTION; DRAINAGE
AB BACKGROUND: High signal intensity of cerebral venous sinuses on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicates high flow of shunt from arterial blood, suggesting dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF). Herein, we describe the cases of 2 patients with intracranial venous reflux caused by brachiocephalic vein occlusion (BVO) mimicking dAVF on MRA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was a 71-year-old woman who had received arteriovenous graft (AVG) surgery for hemodialysis and presented with headache. MRA depicted high signal intensities in the left jugular vein, inferior petrosal sinus, and ophthalmic vein suggesting intracranial dAVF. However, cerebral angiography revealed intracranial venous reflux through the jugular vein caused by BVO. After balloon angioplasty with stenting for BVO, normal venous drainage was restored and her symptoms resolved. Case 2 was a 62-year-old woman who had received AVG for hemodialysis and was hospitalized due to seizure. MRA revealed high signal intensities of the left transverse-sigmoid sinus and jugular vein, and it was suspected that they were associated with BVO. She did not receive immediate intervention because of her septic condition. The patient ultimately died of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Central venous occlusion may occur in patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving AVG for hemodialysis. Intracranial venous reflux resulting from BVO can induce various neurologic disorders including intracranial venous hypertension or hemorrhage. Prompt recognition and implementation of endovascular treatment can be beneficial in cases of symptomatic central venous occlusion.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is usually characterized by diffuse, infiltrative growth and local tumor progression. Extensive leptomeningeal metastases are rarely observed. It is unclear which GBMs are prone to this specific growth pattern and progression, and standardized salvage treatment protocols are unavailable.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 45-year-old man without focal neurologic deficit, a right temporal GBM, IDH-wildtype (biomarkers MGMT promoter methylation negative, Ki-67 proliferation rate 70%) was diagnosed. Gross tumor resection followed by concomitant and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide was performed. Routine follow-up imaging 8 months later showed a right parietal meningeal tumor. Resection confirmed a distant GBM, and next-generation sequencing revealed high tumor mutational burden, high-frequency microsatellite instability, and a pharmacologically targetable KIT mutation. Complete neuraxis imaging revealed multiple contrast-enhancing tumors in the craniocervical junction and levels C7, Th8-Th11, and S1. The craniocervical tumors and the cervical spine from C1-C2 were irradiated as palliative care, and second-line combined chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab was initiated, which was later changed to an immune-checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab owing to tumor progression. Tumor growth was slowed, but the patient eventually developed a progressive paraparesis. Subsequent KIT-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with imatinib was administered for a short time. The patient died 13.8 months after initial diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: High-risk genetic profiles for GBMs prone to develop extensive leptomeningeal metastases need to be identified. Guidelines on preemptive, complete neuraxis imaging in certain patients with GBM as well as treatment guidelines need to be developed.

   TEARS; EFFICACY; DISKECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Incidental durotomy (ID) during surgery for lumbar herniated disks or lumbar spinal stenosis is a serious complication that requires immediate recognition and repair. The incidence of ID during percutaneous endoscopic lumbar decompression has increased along with the demand for endoscopic spinal surgery. The management of ID during endoscopic surgery is more complicated and difficult than management during open surgery. A hemostatic agent, TachoSil (Nycomed, Linz, Austria), is used for control of local bleeding in several types of surgery, but its use in dural repair in endoscopic spinal surgery has not been described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 3 cases in which the double-layer TachoSil packing technique was used in the management of ID during percutaneous stenoscopic lumbar decompression.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report reconfirms the efficacy and utility of TachoSil for IDs that occur during endoscopic spinal surgery and minimally invasive surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use and effectiveness of TachoSil for managing IDs during endoscopic spinal surgery. We hope that other surgeons will find this technique helpful in managing IDs.

   SAFETY POLICIES
AB BACKGROUND: In cranial surgery, different foreign body (FB) materials are used and may be left intentionally or unintentionally in the surgical field after closure, inducing a foreign body granuloma (FBG). This is a rare complication in neurosurgery, but it may be a diagnostic dilemma, with sometimes medicolegal implications.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the English literature between 1965 and 2018 and found a total of 77 articles concerning 100 cases of FBG caused by retained material located within the cranium or surrounding soft tissues.
   RESULTS: There were 60 females and 40 males, with ages ranging from 1 to 77 years. Most initial diagnoses were cranial/intracranial tumors, trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, intracranial aneurysm, hydrocephalus, head injury, infectious disease, and nontraumatic intracerebral hematoma. The interval from the causative surgical operation to presentation of the FBG ranged from 2 weeks to 20 years. Various radiologic modalities were used and histologic study confirmed the presence of FBG in all patients. Intentional FB was used and left in 77 patients, and unintentional FB was found postoperatively in 23 patients. Associated infection was found in 13 patients. Complete recovery was seen in 47.6% of patients with sufficient data.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite being unusual, a retained FBG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient after cranial surgery. A history of surgery, clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and the use of appropriate neuroimaging explorations may provide a correct preoperative diagnosis. In addition, unintentionally retained FBs are preventable errors in the operating room.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study presents information regarding the treatment of fractures and dislocations of the vertebrae, including the use of the oral route for upper cervical fractures, presented in certain chapters of the book titled Kitab al-Umda fi Sina'a al-Jiraha (Ibn al-Quff, thirteenth century AD).
   METHODS: A printed copy of the second volume of the book was studied. Chapters 22 ("On treatment of vertebral fractures") and 33 ("On treatment of vertebral dislocation") of the seventeenth treatise of this book were translated from Arabic into English. Each section is presented (in full text) in the Results section of this article. The findings were compared with the relevant literature and discussed to determine whether Ibn al-Quff presented novel information compared with that presented by his predecessors.
   RESULTS: The writings of Ibn al-Quff regarding vertebral dislocations seem to Summarize information derived from his predecessors. Moreover, he modified certain approaches, previously described for vertebral dislocations, and used them for correcting vertebral fractures. Ibn al-Quff introduced the most novel use of a bridlelike instrument for anterior cervical fracture through the oral route. By introducing the device in the mouth, he described a pushing maneuver to the cervical vertebrae from the ventral site and a simultaneous pulling maneuver by cupping on the neck from the dorsal site.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of the oral route introduced by Ibn al-Quff may be one of the earliest examples of novel, practical, and advanced treatment for cervical vertebral fracture.

ID MECHANICAL THROMBECTOMY; DEATH
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cause of stroke. Medical and neurointerventional strategies, such as in situ thrombolysis, are standard therapies. These techniques are insufficient when clinical deterioration arises from mass-associated effects and transtentorial herniation; in such cases, decompressive hemicraniectomy may be indicated. To the best of our knowledge, the association of open surgical thrombectomy with bilateral decompressive craniectomy has not been reported to date.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented with extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that was resistant to anticoagulation and endovascular therapies. Her clinical condition deteriorated until she became comatose, and bilateral hemicraniectomy combined with open surgical thrombectomy through the superior sagittal sinus was indicated. Computed tomography angiography confirmed postoperative maintenance of sinus permeability. The patient's clinical status improved dramatically, and she had a favorable outcome, including recovery of her functional independence to perform all activities of daily living (modified Rankin Scale score = 0). The follow-up period was 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Open surgical thrombectomy combined with decompressive craniectomy is a lifesaving procedure that can lead to favorable outcome and should be considered for treatment of refractory malignant cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

AB Root metastases of solid organ carcinomas are rare entities. Because of their rare occurrence, they can be confused with nerve sheath tumors, such as schwannomas or neurofibromas, when detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In this paper, we reported a case of a 72-year-old woman with S1 root metastasis originating from lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we reviewed the literature and presented the diagnosis and treatment stages of this pathology. Surgical resection should be the main treatment for symptomatic metastases. Gross total resection of tumors is usually not possible with preservation of neurologic functions. Nerve root decompression, subtotal resection, and adjuvant treatments seem to represent the best treatment option for these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: In the diagnosis of venous stenosis associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, previous studies have identified significant differences when venous pressures are measured under conscious sedation versus general anesthesia. No previous reports have investigated the effect that respiratory parameters may have on cerebral venous sinus pressure and the associated trans-stenosis pressure gradient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were retrospectively identified from a prospective database wherein venous manometry was performed as part of a venous stenting procedure with wave form recording during changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide level (EtCO2). Upon microcatheterization of the superior sagittal sinus after induction of general anesthesia, both patients were noted to have an EtCO2 of 29 mm Hg. After EtCO2 was corrected to 40 mm Hg, repeat venous manometry was conducted, which demonstrated increased SSS venous pressures from 12.6 to 21.1 mm Hg and 18.4 to 30.3 mm Hg in patients 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, the waveform amplitude increased in both patients after EtCO2 correction.
   CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates that EtCO2 changes have an immediate and pronounced effect on venous sinus pressure measurements with waveform changes that may correlate to increased intracranial pressure. These findings underscore the need to perform measurements of venous sinus pressure gradients under normal awake conditions.

   VERTEBROPLASTY
AB BACKGROUND: Kummell disease is defined as avascular necrosis of vertebra, occurs after the delayed posttraumatic osteoporotic vertebral collapse, and mainly occurs in adults older than 50 years of age. We report the first case of refracture of Kummell disease and epidural hematoma followed by paraparesis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old woman with a known case of osteoporotic T12 fracture (3 months back) visited our outpatient clinic complaining of persistent back pain and paraparesis after jerking while getting up from the bed. Her neurology worsened suddenly in the next 2 days. A physical examination revealed grade 3 power in lower extremities with a lower extremity paresthesia and diminished bilateral knee and ankle reflexes. Urinary retention was also present. A plain radiographic examination of her thoracolumbar spine revealed osteoporotic compression fractures with almost 50% reduction in height of the 12th thoracic vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging showed dorsal epidural soft tissue mass that caused posterior compression of the spinal cord at the T12-L3 levels. We performed thoracic lateral retropleural cor-pectomy and cage insertion at T12. Bone cement- augmented pedicle screw fixation was performed at the T10,T11, and L1 levels with laminectomy and decompression of hematoma at the T12, L1, L2, and L3 levels as a stage 1 procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, the possibility of refracture of Kummell disease and spinal epidural hematoma should be kept in mind in patients with osteoporotic fractures. Periodic follow-up and treatment are essential for preventing tragic neurologic impairment.

TI Transsphenoidal Removal of Recurrent Osteoid Osteoma of Clivus
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Clivus; Osteoid osteoma; Transsphenoidal removal
ID SKULL BASE; BONE
AB BACKGROUND: An osteoid osteoma (OO) is a benign bone neoplasm that typically occurs in the long bone diaphysis. We found only 8 cases of OOs of the skull base in the literature, and none of them were located in the clivus.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old female patient with a history of 2 previous transsphenoidal surgeries with partial removal of an OO of the clivus at another hospital, 11 and 4 years ago, presented to our department with recurrent progressive left-sided headache and facial pain over the past 6 months, which were aggravated at night. A new computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed a low-density, well-demarcated area surrounded by a high-density sclerotic bone in the clivus. A total transsphenoidal microscopic removal of the lesion was performed with the use of intraoperative neuronavigation. The patient recovered from surgery without any new deficits, and the headache was relieved during her inpatient hospital stay. A CT scan of the head that was performed 1 day after surgery revealed the complete removal of the lesion. The patient was discharged on day 5 after surgery. A follow-up examination conducted 3 months after surgery showed that the patient still had no headache or any other symptoms. A follow-up CT scan revealed no remnant or recurrent tumor.
   CONCLUSION: The transsphenoidal approach with the use of neuronavigation appears to be a good choice to achieve total removal of an OO of the upper part of the clivus in case of persistent pain and lack of sufficient effect by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

DE Highly upmigrated disc herniation; Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar
   discectomy; Transforaminal isthmus plasty approach
AB BACKGROUND: Highly upmigrated herniation can be difficult to remove using percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and the conventional transforaminal approach. Although many surgeons have constantly explored new techniques and approaches, we still lack a more effective, convenient, and economical technique to treat highly upmigrated herniation. We have described a novel approach, the transforaminal isthmus plasty approach, for PELD to treat highly upmigrated disc herniation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old man with L3-L4 highly upmigrated disc herniation, who had experienced no relief after a long period of conservative treatment, underwent PELD through the transforaminal isthmus plasty approach. The operation was successful, and he experienced significant symptom relief after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transforaminal isthmus plasty approach is an effective and viable alternative approach for PELD to treat highly upmigrated disc herniation.

TI Unusual Intraspinal Migration of Ingested Foreign Body
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Basivertebral vein; Foreign body; Hahn canal; Intraspinal migration
AB BACKGROUND: Accidental foreign body ingestion is a common occurrence; however, extraluminal migration is uncommon. We report for the first time in the literature an unusual migration of an ingested foreign body into the spinal canal through the vertebral body and discuss its possible route of migration.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man presented with throat pain after eating chicken fried rice. Esophagoscopy was normal. A cervical spine radio-graph and computed tomography scan showed the presence of a thin, radiopaque foreign body coursing through the C5 vertebral body and entering the spinal canal. We explored the neck and removed a 3-cm-long copper wire (foreign body).
   CONCLUSIONS: Type, size, and shape of the foreign body determine the course of foreign body migration. A possible route of foreign body migration into the spinal canal is the Hahn canal and basivertebral foramina.

ID INTRACRANIAL PLASMACYTOMA; MULTIPLE-MYELOMA; MENINGIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP) is a plasma cell neoplasm located outside the bone. It is rarely observed in the intracranial area. It is very difficult to diagnose this condition radiologically before surgery. In addition, dural SEP is usually misdiagnosed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of plasmacytoma that presented as altered mental status after head trauma, located in the subdural area. We also describe its differential diagnosis and treatment by total removal and adjuvant radiotherapy. The 66-month follow-up findings showed distant plasmacytoma development, which was treated with radiotherapy alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: Some pathological entities should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute subdural hematomas. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of dural SEP mimicking acute subdural hematoma.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intraosseous lipoma; Pediatric; Repeated relapses; Surgery
ID FRONTAL BONE
AB BACKGROUND: Intraosseous lipomas occurring within the skull are rare. Currently, the known locations include the frontal bone, parietal bone, temporal bone, and ethmoid bone. Thus far, we have found only 12 cases of lipoma at the top of the forehead on the skull, and only 2 cases of recurrent intraosseous lipoma have been reported. The patient with intraosseous lipoma we have described was a 3-year-old boy, the youngest of the 12 known patients with intraosseous lipoma of the skull, and the patient had repeated relapses.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the history of a 3-year-old boy with a giant intraosseous lipoma in his left frontal region when he came to our hospital for treatment. The head computed tomography scan showed a left frontal plate with an oval low density, and the boundary was clear. The lesion affected the normal appearance of the child. He had experienced varying degrees of recurrent growth after 2 operations. At the last follow-up examination, the appearance of the patient had improved greatly.
   CONCLUSIONS: For large intraosseous lipomas occurring in the skull, owing to its special position and the tendency for repeated relapses to develop, extending the excision is an effective surgical approach. For swelling involving a wide range, surgery should involve specialists in craniofacial surgery.

ID SYNDROME PRES; FOSSA TUMOR; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurologic condition that manifests with heterogeneous clinical findings, including altered mental status, seizure, vision loss, and vomiting. It characteristically leads to diffuse subcortical vasogenic edema, most commonly in the parieto-occipital regions. Although frequently reported with conditions such as hypertension, eclampsia, sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, autoimmune diseases, and immunosuppressive therapy, PRES may rarely occur after surgery for posterior fossa tumors. In the postsurgical setting, clinical features of PRES usually develop intraoperatively or in the immediate postoperative period. Delayed presentation months after the surgery has not been reported earlier.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman who underwent surgery for vestibular schwannoma 8 months earlier presented with altered sensorium, generalized seizures, and high blood pressure. Common possibilities were ruled out by clinical history, diagnostic imaging, and appropriate blood tests. Radiologic imaging revealed rapid recurrence of tumor with diffuse subcortical edema involving both hemispheres. The patient showed complete neurologic recovery with antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs.
   CONCLUSIONS: PRES is a rare but important cause of acute neurologic deterioration following posterior fossa tumor surgery. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment often lead to complete neurologic recovery.

   CINGULATE CORTEX; SURGICAL REPAIR
AB BACKGROUND: Cognitive sequelae frequently follow subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and include deficits across multiple domains of executive function. This factor affects overall functional outcomes negatively, especially in younger patients. Several clinical correlates predict development and severity of cognitive dysfunction after SAH. Hypothetical mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in the absence of radiographic lesion include cerebral hypoperfusion and blood breakdown products, resulting in perturbed interneuronal communication and network synchrony, excitotoxicity, and altered microRNA expression.
   METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for articles discussing cognitive outcomes in patients with unruptured and ruptured intracranial aneurysmal disease, sequelae of treatment, and modalities for neuropsychologic testing.
   RESULTS: Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, although capable of preventing SAH, comes with its own set of complications and may also affect cognitive function. Neuropsychological tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental Status Examination, and others have proved useful in evaluating cognitive decline. Studies using functional neurologic imaging modalities have identified regions with altered activation patterns during various cognitive tasks. The sum of research efforts in this field has provided useful insights and an initial understanding of cognitive dysfunction after aneurysm treatment and SAH that should prove useful in guiding and rendering future investigations more fruitful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Development of finer and more sensitive neuropsychological tests in evaluating the different domains of cognitive function after aneurysm treatment and SAH in general will be useful in accurately determining outcomes after ictus and comparing efficacy of different therapeutic strategies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The seizure outcomes for patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) who undergo intervention with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are incompletely understood. We sought to determine, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, the rates of seizure control after SRS for patients with AVM-associated seizures and identify predictive factors.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE databases from January 1987 to January 2018, in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies reporting post-SRS outcomes data for >= 5 patients with AVM-associated seizures were included. The seizure outcomes and factors associated with seizure freedom were evaluated using meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 27 studies, comprising 4826 patients, met the inclusion criteria for analysis. One or more seizures occurred in 1456 of 4826 patients (34.7% [26.0-43.9%]), and the mean follow-up was 48 +/- 7 months. Seizure control (seizure freedom or seizure improvement) was achieved in 910 of 1312 patients (73.1% [66.9-78.9%]). Seizure freedom was achieved in 597 of 1245 patients (55.7% [44.5-66.6%]). Of 259 patients with seizure freedom, cessation of antiepileptic drugs was achieved in 175 patients (67.3% [46.3-85.1%]). AVM obliteration (odds ratio [OR] 4.61; P < 0.001), shorter seizure duration (OR 6.80; P < 0.001), generalized seizure type (OR 2.27; P=0.007), and previous AVM hemorrhage (OR 5.10; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with seizure freedom.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS affords seizure control to the majority of patients with AVM-associated seizures, and approximately two thirds of those with seizure freedom are able cease anticonvulsants. Nidal obliteration appears to improve the likelihood of seizure freedom, and thus remains the primary goal of intervention with SRS.

AB BACKGROUND: Results from studies investigating the effect of contralateral carotid occlusion (CCO) in patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) are variable in the literature. We sought to determine whether CEA or CAS is the optimal revascularization approach for patients with CCO.
   METHODS: This meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A random effects model meta-analysis was conducted, and the I2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed as needed.
   RESULTS: Five retrospective observational cohort studies comprising 6346 patients were included. Patients in the CEA group had a significantly lower risk of 30-day periprocedural mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.71; I-2 = 0%). However, no significant differences were identified in terms of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) between the 2 groups. Subgroup analyses of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients did not yield significant differences for stroke, MI, and death.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CCO can safely undergo both CAS and CEA with similar risks of stroke, MI, and MACE. However, patients treated with CEA have a lower risk of 30-day periprocedural mortality. Future studies can help further clarify the ideal approach for these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is a rare neuralgic pain syndrome amenable to neurosurgical treatments, including nerve section (NS), microvascular decompression (MVD), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, thorough comparisons of the modalities have not been performed to date. The objective of the present study was to compare the pain and complication outcomes after these approaches to GPN.
   METHODS: Searches of 7 electronic databases from inception to June 2018 were conducted following the appropriate guidelines. The incidence rates (IRs) of short-term (<= 3 months) and long-term (>= 12 months) pain relief and complications were extracted and analyzed using a meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to assess for heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: A total of 792 GPN cases managed by NS, MVD, or SRS were described by 6, 11, and 6 studies, reporting outcomes for 282 (36%), 446 (56%), and 67 (8%) cases. The short-term pain relief rate was highest after NS postoperatively (IR, 94%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 88%-98%) and lowest after SRS at 3 months postoperatively (IR, 80%; 95% CI, 68%-96%). The postoperative complication rate was greatest after MVD (IR, 26%; 95% CI, 16%-38%) and lowest after SRS (IR, 0%; 95% CI, 0%-4%). The long-term pain relief rate was greatest after NS (IR, 96%; 95% CI, 91%-99%) and lowest after SRS (IR, 82%; 95% CI, 67%-94%). Statistically significant differences between the approaches were found for each outcome.
   CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical treatment of GPN is frequently performed by 1 of 3 modalities with unique outcomes profiles. NS might provide the most favorable treatment response, with respect to short-and long-term pain relief and postoperative outcomes.

TI Shunt Surgery for Neurocutaneous Melanosis with Hydrocephalus: Case
   Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Hydrocephalus; Neurocutaneous melanosis; Shunt surgery
ID DANDY-WALKER MALFORMATION; MALIGNANT LEPTOMENINGEAL MELANOMA;
   VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNT; ASSOCIATION; COMPLEX; SYRINGOMYELIA;
   DISEASE; ADULT
AB BACKGROUND: Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare phakomatosis characterized by large or multiple pigmented nevi and melanosis of the leptomeninges. It is often complicated by hydrocephalus due to melanotic deposits interfering with cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption in the basal cisterns or causing foraminal or aqueductal obstruction. In 10% of cases, it will be associated with the DandyWalker complex.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 6-year-old girl with multiple congenital hairy nevi presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, headache, and vomiting. Neuroimaging showed a communicating hydrocephalus associated with the Dandy-Walker variant, melanotic deposits in the amygdalae, thalami, and cortical sulci, and abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. After undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure abated. However, she again showed deterioration 1 month postoperatively due to progressive leptomeningeal spread suspicious for malignant degeneration.
   CONCLUSION: The results of the present case and the findings from a review of related data suggest that shunt insertion (ventriculoperitoneal or cystoperitoneal) is an effective palliative measure for patients with neurocutaneous melanosis with associated hydrocephalus. Despite treatment, however, the prognosis of these patients remains poor owing to malignant progression and leptomeningeal spread of lesions, in particular, in cases associated with the Dandy-Walker complex.

AB BACKGROUND: Screw diameters currently available are based on the literature available. No data are available for the safety margin available for C2 pedicle screw placement. The objective of this study was to define the average pedicle size available for placing C2 pedicle screws and to quantify the safety margin available in case of lateral breach of screw.
   METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms of 259 patients (161 men, 98 women) were analyzed to calculate the C2 pedicle width, the area of the transverse foramen (TF) and the vertebral artery (VA), and the occupation ratio (OR) of the VA within the TF. The VA was classified into groups based on its lie within the TF (anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, posterolateral, central, ectatic). The distance which the pedicle screw can breach without encountering the VA was calculated (lateral pedicle to vertebral artery distance [LPVA]). The diameters of the VA and the TF were estimated, and their difference gives the safety margin in case of breach of the lateral cortex of the C2 pedicle.
   RESULTS: The mean mediolateral diameter of the pedicle isthmus, perpendicular to the pedicle axis, in women was 5.3 mm and in men it was 5.8 mm. This difference was statistically significant. In 53.9% (122/226) of patients, the VA was dominant on the left side. The overall mean OR at the C2 vertebral level was found to be 37.3%. The mean LPVA was 0.9 mm, and the average overall safety margin available was 2.5 mm (range, 0.4-5.3 mm).
   CONCLUSIONS: his study describes the relationship of the VA in the C2 TF and the relative risk during pedicle screw fixation.

AB BACKGROUND: The exact mechanism, incidence, and risk factors for cerebral vasospasm after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) continue to be poorly characterized. The incidence of post-traumatic vasospasm (PTV) varies depending on the detection modality.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to shed light on the predictors, associations, and true incidence of cerebral vasospasm after traumatic ICH using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard.
   METHODS: We examined a prospectively maintained database of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to identify patients with ICH secondary to TBI enrolled between 2002 and 2015 at our trauma center. Patients with TBI-associated ICH and evidence of elevated velocities on transcranial Doppler and computed tomography angiograms, confirmed with DSA were included. The diagnostic cerebral angiograms were evaluated by 2 blinded neurointerventionalists for cerebral vasospasm. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine predictors of PTV.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients with ICH secondary to TBI and evidence of vasospasm underwent DSAs. Seven patients (7/20; 35%) with traumatic ICH developed cerebral vasospasm and of those, 1 developed delayed cerebral ischemia (1/7; 14%). Of these 7 patients, 6 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (6/7; 85%). Vasospasm was substantially more common in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale <9 (P = 0.017) than in all other groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: PTV as demonstrated by DCA may be more common than previously reported. Patients who exhibit PTV were more likely to have a Glasgow Coma Scale <9. This subgroup of patients may benefit from more systematic screening for the development of PTV, and earlier monitoring for signs of delayed cerebral ischemia.

AB OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of a dynamic surgical guidance (DSG) probe in the accurate placement of thoracic and lumbar pedicle screws (PSs) in patients with spinal deformity.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 98 patients (104 procedures) with various spinal deformities, who had received posterior instrumentation with PSs inserted using either DSG or the conventional free-hand (FH) technique. A total of 882 PSs were inserted using DSG (DSG group) and 603 using the FH technique (FH group). The DSG probe was preferably chosen for large osteosyntheses and severe deformities. Two neurosurgeons, unaware of the surgical groups, reviewed all the intraoperative computed tomography scans and assessed all the PS placements.
   RESULTS: Of the PSs used, 95.4% in the DSG group and 92.2% in the FH group were correctly placed (P = 0.0136). The difference in screw placement accuracy was greater at the thoracic level (DSG group, 92.5%; vs. FH group, 87.0%; P = 0.0310) than at the lumbar level (DSG group, 98.0%; vs. FH group, 95.4 %; P = 0.0385). Severe (>4 mm) lateral breaches occurred in 24 cases (4.0%) in the FH group but in only 5 (0.6%) in the DSG group (P < 0.0001). No severe medial breach was observed in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite having more patients with severe deformities in the DSG group, PS insertion was significantly more accurate with DSG. This technique also reduced the severe unacceptable lateral misplacement rate (>4 mm) and, consequently, the incidence of intraoperative screw revisions even in patients with severe deformities.

TI The Effect of Preoperative Direct Ligation of Ethmoidal Arteries on the
   Perioperative Outcomes of Large Anterior Skull Base Meningiomas Surgery:
   A Clinical Study

DT Article

ID INTERHEMISPHERIC APPROACH; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior skull base meningiomas often grow to a large size (>= 4 cm) before detection. Their blood supply is mostly provided by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. Because of their vascularity, intraoperative bleeding can be a challenging prospect that increases the risk of perioperative complications. Preoperative ethmoidal arteries ligation has been used to aid in limiting blood loss. Our objective was to assess the effect of preoperative arterial ligation on the perioperative course of large (>= 4 cm) to giant (>= 6 cm) anterior skull base meningiomas.
   METHODS: We retrospectively searched our database for large anterior skull base meningiomas (>= 4 cm). We analyzed differences in intraoperative blood loss, operative time, intraoperative transfusion, and hematologic parameters between patients who did not undergo preoperative ethmoidal arteries ligation (Group 1) and those who did (Group 2).
   RESULTS: Average estimated blood loss (EBL) was 825 ml (Group 1) versus 350 mL. (Group 2) (P = 0.42), decrease in hemoglobin was 4 g/dL versus 3.2 g/dL (P = 0.53), decrease in hematocrit was 12.4% versus 9.6% (P = 0.64), and average operative time was 656 minutes versus 598 minutes (P = 0.58). EBL per volume yielded a ratio of 10.6 mL/cm(3) versus 4.1 ml/cm(3) (P = 0.06).
   CONCLUSIONS: Ethmoidal arteries ligation may have a benefit in large-to-giant anterior skull base meningiomas surgery. Our results showed a decrease in EBL and lesser decrease in pre- and postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels as compared with cases in which no vascular ligation was performed when corrected for tumor volume.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the long-term clinical and radiologic findings of cases diagnosed with spinal concussion and to describe the spinal cord injuries that are detected in the later course.
   METHODS: Data obtained from 91 cases, who had been diagnosed with spinal concussion, were retrospectively evaluated. These were placed in 2 groups according to the type of trauma (axial forces or vertical forces). Magnetic resonance imaging scans taken >6 months after the trauma were inspected.
   RESULTS: Axial and vertical forces result in different types of spine injuries. The effect of vertical forces on the spinal cord can involve longer segments and the effect of axial forces remains limited to a few segments. Vertical forces usually result in the development of syringomyelias in the late period, whereas axial forces may cause cavitation and stretch injuries to the spinal cord.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with spinal concussion manifest complete recovery in the early period after the trauma, findings related to the spinal cord may appear in the later course. The direction of the forces that the spinal cord is subjected to may result in different cord injuries in the late period.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spine (C-spine) injuries cause significant morbidity and mortality among elderly patients. Although the population of older-adults >= 65 years in the United States is expanding, estimates of the burden and outcome of C-spine injury are lacking.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2001-2010 was analyzed. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes identified patients with isolated C-spine fractures (ICF) and C-spine fractures with spinal cord injury (CSCI). Annual admission and mortality rates were calculated using U.S. Census data.
   RESULTS: A total of 167278 older adults were included. Median age was 81 years (interquartile range = 74-86). Most patients were female (54.9%), had Medicare coverage (77.6%), were treated in teaching hospitals (63.2%), and had falls as the leading injury mechanism (51.2%). ICF occurred in 91.3%, whereas CSCI occurred in 8.7% (P< 0.001). ICF was more common in >= 85-year-old patients and CSCI in 65- to 69year-old patients (P < 0.001). The most common injured C-spine level in ICF was the C2 level (47.6%, P < 0.001) and in CSCI was C1-C4 level (4.5%, P < 0.001). Overall, 15.8% underwent C-spine surgery. Hospitalization rates increased from 26/100,000 in 2001 to 68/100,000 in 2010 (similar to 167% change, P< 0.001). Correspondingly, overall mortality increased from 3/100,000 in 2001 to 6/100,000 in 2010, P < 0.001. In-hospital mortality was 11.3%, was strongly associated with increasing age and CSCI (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In summary, C-spine fractures among U.S. older adults constitute a significant health care burden. ICFs occur commonly, C2-vertebra fractures are most frequent, whereas CSCIs are linked to increased hospital-resource use and worse outcomes. The incidence of C-spine fractures and mortality more than doubled over the past decade; however, proportional in-hospital mortality is decreasing.

AB OBJECTIVES: The need for lumbar- lumbosacral fusion _.gery has increased in the recent decade. Although this type of surgical approach has been reported to provide better improvement in low back pain compared with conventional conservative treatments, the ratio of failure varies between 5% and 30% in different studies.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted through screening patient files between January 2013 and January 2016. Preoperative and postoperative neurologic examination, Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and medical and surgical treatments of 66 patients were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The data from these 66 patients was included in this study. Of the patients, 28 were male and 38 were female. Mean age was 58.3 years for male and 60.1 years for female subjects. Mean duration of follow-up was 15 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study has revealed that lumbosacral fusion surgery increases sacroiliac joint degeneration. We consider that magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography for detection of early stage sacroiliac joint degeneration.

   FIXATION; VERTEBRA; HYBRID
AB BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has established new techniques to reduce curve severity and shifted to include the regular use of pedicle screws. Few studies have focused on this evolving trend in AIS correction surgery. In this study, we investigated how the operative approach, instrumentation, and surgical techniques have changed over the past 15 years and to quantify the related improvements in AIS surgical treatment.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a prospective AIS registry in a single center. Patient data were reviewed from January 2001 to December 2015. The age and surgical case distribution were recorded for each year. Trends in classification use, instrumentation types, levels of fusion, and surgical approaches were analyzed by year. The major Cobb angles and correction rates were compared between different instrumentations and surgical approaches.
   RESULTS: A total of 2530 patients with AIS (83.0% female) were included, with a mean age of 15.14 years. Most patients underwent surgery at 14 years of age (473 patients, 18.7%), followed by 15 years of age (468 patients, 18.5%). In our center, the classification of patients with AIS shifted from the King classification to the Lenke classification in 2005. The major baseline Cobb angle of the entire cohort averaged 50.99 and this mean Cobb angle decreased to 14.41 after surgery. The correction rates for the first 3 years (2001-2003) were less than 70%, whereas the correction rates for the rest of the years were all greater than 70%. In addition, significantly higher correction rates were observed in patients with Cobb angles <90' (72.93% vs. 55.61%, P < 0.001). A total of 218 anterior-only surgeries and 109 combined anteroposterior surgeries were performed; the remaining 2205 surgeries were performed with a posterior-only approach. The use of anterior-only and anteroposterior approaches trended to decrease after 2005. The correction rate of anterior-only approaches was significantly greater than posterior-only and anteroposterior approaches (77.86%, 72.51%, and 59.37%, respectively). In patients corrected with a posterior-only approach, the screw-hook hybrid construct was used in 342 patients, whereas the all-pedicle-screw construct was used in 1835 patients. The shift from hybrid to all-screw construct occurred in 2006. In patients with thoracic AIS, the correction rate was significantly higher in the allscrew group (73.26% vs. 67.76%; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Consistent improvement of major curve correction has been achieved by the spine community over 15 years. After stabilized coronal correction and fewer fusion levels, the next steps in this evolution are the restoration of sagittal profiles, especially the hypokyphosis seen in patients with Lenke 1, the posterior minimally invasive approach, and a fast-track return to activity.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The inframeatal area represents a challenging region for skull base surgeons. Various surgical corridors have been described to access this area and frequently are used in combination. Recent studies describe the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) as an established route for midline regions, particularly medial to the internal carotid arteries (ICA). We sought to evaluate the accessibility, maneuverability, and freedom of movement of the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach to the inframeatal region.
   METHODS: An EEA combining a middle and an inferior transclival corridor with an infrapetrous and a supra-condylar lateral expansion was performed in 5 embalmed human cadaveric heads. The area of exposure and the surgical freedom to access the inframeatal area were calculated. The angle of attack and distances from the lacerum segment of the ICA to several anatomical targets also were measured. Our database was searched to select clinical case examples.
   RESULTS: The EEA provided an exposure area of 101.26 +/- 16.66 mm(2) and an area of surgical freedom of 1208.50 +/- 507.01 mm(2). The angles of attack in both the sagittal and axial planes were wider at the lacerum segment of the ICA and narrower at the dural entrance zone of cranial nerves VII/VIII. Three chondrosarcomas are presented as case illustrations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The EEA is a feasible route to the inframeatal area. This approach provides a safe working corridor for lesions in this region, as shown by the anatomical and clinical findings presented here. Comparative studies and large case series are warranted to further establish its clinical value.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery (MAS) allows for an early return to systemic and radiation therapy in patients with cancer, leading to its increasing usage in the treatment of spinal metastases. Systematic examination of surgical indications resulted in the development of an algorithm for implementation of MAS in the treatment of spinal metastases. The objective of the present study was to evaluate a spine tumor MAS treatment algorithm using patient-reported outcomes for patients with cancer undergoing treatment of spinal metastases.
   METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of patients who had undergone spinal percutaneous instrumented stabilization with the addition of MAS spinal cord or nerve root decompression and/or kyphoplasty when indicated at a tertiary cancer center from December 2013 to August 2016. Validated patient-reported outcome measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-spine module, were used. The patient-reported outcome measures were collected and compared at baseline, 3 months, and long-term follow-up (range, 4.5-12 months).
   RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included. MAS resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the severity of pain and improved activity, ability to work, and enjoyment of life (P < 0.001). The improvement was reported at the short- and long-term follow-up points.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present our treatment algorithm for MAS implementation in the treatment of thoracolumbar spinal metastases. Prospectively collected data have demonstrated that using this algorithm, MAS surgery for the treatment of spinal metastases results in significant decreases in pain severity and symptom interference with daily activities.

AB BACKGROUND: Tumor recurrence or incomplete resection in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) is relatively common. However, predictive factors of tumor recurrence in NFPAs are not well established. We evaluated possible factors related to tumor recurrence in a large cohort of NFPAs at a single pituitary neurosurgery center.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of medical records of patients with NFPAs treated by transsphenoidal surgery between 2000 and 2014.
   RESULTS: Among the participants, 210 were female A total of 14.1% had giant adenomas. Null-cell pituitary adenomas (n = 239; 58.9%) were the most frequent, followed by silent gonadotroph adenomas (n = 112; 27.3%). Null-cell adenomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.008) and silent gonadotroph adenomas were more frequent in men (P = 0.004). Recurrence was not related to sex or age. Tumor recurrence occurred more often among silent corticotropic adenomas and giant adenomas (hazard ratio 2.45; P < 0.0001 and hazard ratio 2.35; P = 0.001, respectively). Silent thyrotrophic adenoma presented a comparable frequency of recurrence of silent corticotropic adenomas, despite having borderline significance (P = 0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: NFPA tumors have a high heterogeneous hormonal profile and may have prognostic importance. Silent corticotropic adenomas and giant adenomas present a high rate of recurrence.

AB INTRODUCTION: Although the indication of endoscopic approaches for anterior skull base meningiomas (ASBM) has been progressively refined, there remains a paucity of data on recurrence rates after resection. To analyze and compare recurrence rates of ASBM resected through endoscopic endonasal (EEE) versus transcranial (TCA) approaches.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients submitted to the EEE or TCA approach for ASBM resection from May 2006 to January 2016 in our center. Clinical, radiological, and pathology data were retrieved for analysis. Tumor size, location, surgical technique, extent of resection, and tumor grade were assessed. The 2 groups were compared to identify predictors and differences regarding tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (17 olfactory groove meningioma [OGM] and 35 tuberculum sellae meningioma [TSM]) were included; 26 (6 OGM and 20 TSM) underwent EEE and 26 (13 OGM and 13 TSM) TCA, with a mean followup of 41 months. Gross total resection was achieved in 38 (73%) patients (18 [69%] in EEE and 20 [77%] in TCA). Eight (15%) patients presented with recurrence: 5 (19%) in the EEE group and 3 (11.5%) in the TCA group without a statistical difference (P = 0.69). Among the recurrences, gross total resection had been achieved in 1 case of each group. In the EEE group, 1 patient underwent TCA for a recurrent tumor and another patient was referred for radiosurgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown an overall similar recurrence rate of ASBM regardless of the technique used. However, the analysis of larger series with longer followup is necessary to clearly define the indications and to fully validate the efficacy of EEE.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze outcomes and prognostic factors of sinonasal nonsalivary non-intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (n-ITAC.)
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 22 consecutive patients with n-ITAC was performed.
   RESULTS: Average follow-up time was 77 months. The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival were 95.2%. The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival were 100% for pT1, pT2, and pT3 tumors and 83.3% for pT4a and pT4b tumors; 100% for G1 tumors and 87.5% for G3 tumors; and 100% for tumors with negative surgical margin and 50% for tumors with positive surgical margin. Stage, grade, and surgical margins were independent prognostic factors. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed for high-grade and high-stage tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by radiotherapy has remained a mainstay for management of n-ITAC, and the endoscopic transnasal approach, when correctly planned and indicated, is the surgery of choice. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended in cases of high-stage (T3 and T4) and high-grade tumors. n-ITAC is associated with a favorable outcome. High grade, pT4 stage, and positive surgical margins are independent negative prognostic factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation of the suhthalamic nucleus (STN) is advocated in patients with advanced Parkinson disease. Intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER) and stimulation or imaging are applied to confirm electrode targeting. The study objective was to evaluate which intraoperative electrophysiologic marker, MER, stimulation, or local field potentials (LFP) was the most predictive of the clinical efficacy.
   METHODS: Efficacy was determined with lateralized motor scores of Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in 36 patients (OFFdrug/ON-stimulation 1 year after surgery vs. OFF-drug before surgery). Trajectory lengths in STN were determined from MER. Stimulation was increased up to the thresholds of first decrease, of complete suppression of rigidity, and of excitation of pyramidal motor tract. beta oscillations (11-31 Hz) were computed from LFP of the electrode macrocontact. Univariate and multivariate analyses were computed.
   RESULTS: Motor improvements were linked to trajectory lengths in STN (R-2 = 0.17; P > 0.005). No significant relationship was found for thresholds of first decrease or suppression in rigidity or for motor tract excitation (R-2 < 0.03, P > 0.05). Motor improvements were most linked to beta oscillation increases (R-2 = 0.57, P < 0.005, linear regression; R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.0001, post hoc sigmoid regression). beta oscillations appeared more predictive than length (beta: t = 5.4, P < 0.001; length: t = 2.70, P < 0.03). improvements were also slightly predicted by preoperative scores (R-2 = 0.13; P < 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Motor improvements emerged as most related to beta oscillations, before trajectory length within the STN, whereas stimulation thresholds of rigidity or of motor tract excitation failed to show any relationship. The study encourages LFP measurement to confirm STN electrode location.

ID PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: The Barrow Innovation Center comprises an educational program in medical innovation that enables residents to identify problems in patient care and rapidly develop and implement solutions to these problems. Residents involved in this program noted an elevated risk of iatrogenic spinal cord injury during posterior cervical and thoracic procedures. The objective of this study was to describe this complication, and a novel solution was developed through a new innovation training program.
   METHODS: A case report demonstrates the risk of iatrogenic spinal cord injury during posterior cervical decompression and fusion. Solutions to this problem were developed at the innovation center via an iterative process of prototype creation, cadaveric testing, and redesign. Patent law students who partnered with the center wrote and filed a provisional patent protecting the novel prototype designs.
   RESULTS: The concept of a protective shield for the spinal cord was developed, and within only 6 weeks the devices were provisionally patented and used in the operating room. This device was named the Myeloshield. Initial clinical experience indicates that the Myeloshield can be used without impeding the flow of surgery and has the potential to prevent iatrogenic spinal cord injury; this experience is presented through 2 case reports demonstrating the use of Myeloshields in the operating room.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates how programs like the Barrow Innovation Center can provide neurosurgery residents with a unique educational experience in medical device innovation and intellectual property development and can serve as an avenue of surgical quality improvement and problem solving.

AB BACKGROUND: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), patients with diabetes (DP) show a poorer outcome compared with patients without diabetes (NDP). This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of factors associated with unfavorable outcome in DP receiving MT for stroke of the anterior circulation.
   METHODS: This study included 317 of 498 consecutive patients who received interventional treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the terminal internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery, including 46 DP. The study data included pre- and posttreatment stroke computed tomography, including perfusion data, collateral status, treatment data including treatment times, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, cerebrovascular events, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and medication. Neurologic status was assessed at baseline (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]/ modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) and after 90 days (mRS 90).
   RESULTS: Compared with NDP, DP showed a significantly poorer outcome (mRS90 >2) (P < 0.05). Collateralization and infarct core size did not differ between groups, whereas the penumbra was significantly smaller in DP than in NDP (P < 0.05). The poorer mRS90 outcome (mRS90 > 2) in DP was associated with poor collaterals (P = 0.01) and hyperglycemia on admission (P < 0.05). Shorter time to reperfusion was associated with favorable mRS90 in the NDP (P < 0.001) but not the DP (P = 0.49) group. In uni-variate logistic regression, the following parameters were significantly associated with mRS90: diabetes, hyperglycemia at admission, time to reperfusion, and the NIHSS score (P < 0.05 each). In multivariate analyses and partition regression models of all variables, DP with admission hyperglycemia (>= 132 mg/dl) and older age (>= 66 years) showed a particularly poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The main factors for an unfavorable outcome of DP after MT are admission hyperglycemia, age, and NIHSS score.

AB BACKGROUND: The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) was designed to predict risk for cardiac events after noncardiac surgery. However, there is a paucity of literature that directly addresses the relationship between RCRI and noncardiac outcomes after posterior lumbar decompression (PLD). The objective of this study is to determine the ability of RCRI to predict noncardiac adverse events after PLD.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used to identify patients undergoing PLD from 2006 to 2014. Multivariate and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify associations between RCRI and postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 52,066 patients met the inclusion criteria. Membership in the RCM = 1 cohort independently predicted unplanned intubation, ventilation >48 hours, progressive renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis, septic shock, and readmission. Membership in the RCRI =2 cohort independently predicted for superficial surgical site infection, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, ventilation >48 hours, bleeding transfusion, progressive renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, UTI, sepsis, septic shock, and readmission. Membership in the RCRI =3 cohort independently predicted unplanned intubation (odds ratio [OR], 11.8), ventilation >48 hours (OR, 23.0), acute renal failure (OR, 84.5), and UTI (OR, 3.6). RCRI had a poor discriminative ability (DA) (area under the curve = 0.623), and American Society of Anesthesiologists status had a fair DA (area under the curve = 0.770) to predict a composite of noncardiac complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: RCRI was predictive of a wide range of noncardiac complications after PLD but had a diminished DA to predict a composite of any noncardiac complication than did American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Consideration of the RCRI as a component of preoperative surgical risk stratification can minimize patient morbidity and mortality after lumbar decompression.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior lumbar fusion (ALF) is performed by both neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons. The aim of this study was to determine differences between the 2 surgical subspecialties in terms of patient selection and postoperative outcomes after ALF.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing ALF in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2010 to 2014 was performed. Univariate analyses were performed to identify differences in baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, operative characteristics, and 30-day postoperative outcomes between neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether surgical subspecialty was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: The study included 3182 patients, with 1629 (51.2%) neurosurgery patients and 1553 (48.8%) orthopaedic surgery patients. A greater proportion of neurosurgery patients were >65 years old, were being treated with preoperative steroids, had cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities, and had an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification III or higher. ALF procedures performed by neurosurgeons more frequently involved use of intervertebral devices and bone graft. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, ALF procedures performed by neurosurgeons were independently associated with a higher risk of reoperation (odds ratio = 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.56; P = 0.042) and urinary tract infection (odds ratio = 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.68; P = 0.043).
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to differences in baseline patient demographics and comorbidities and operative characteristics, ALF performed by neurosurgeons had a higher risk of 30-day reoperation and urinary tract infection compared with ALF performed by orthopaedic surgeons.

TI Predictors of Surgical Site Infection After Nonemergent Craniotomy: A
   Nationwide Readmission Database Analysis

   RATES; IMPACT; 30-DAY; CARE; UNDERINSURANCE
AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical site infections (SSIs) carry significant patient morbidity and mortality and are a major source of readmissions after craniotomy. Because of their deleterious effects on health care outcomes and costs, identifying modifiable risk factors holds tremendous value. However, because SSIs after craniotomy are rare and most existing data comprise single-institution studies with small sample sizes, many are likely underpowered to discern for such factors. The objective of this study was to use a large hetereogenous patient sample to determine SSI incidence after nonemergent craniotomy and identify factors associated with readmission and subsequent need for wound washout.
   METHODS: We used the 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database cohorts to discern for factors predictive of SSI and washout.
   RESULTS: We identified 93,920 nonemergent craniotomies. There were 2079 cases of SSI (2.2%) and 835 reoperations for washout (0.89%) within 30 days of index admission and there were 2761 cases of SSI (3.6%) and 1220 reoperations for washout (1.58%) within 90 days. Several factors were predictive of SSI in multivariate analysis, including tumor operations, external ventricular drain (EVD), age, length of stay, diabetes, discharge to an intermediate-care facility, insurance type, and hospital bed size. Many of these factors were similarly implicated in reoperation for washout.
   CONCLUSIONS: SSI incidence in neurosurgery is low and most readmissions occur within 30 days. Several factors predicted SSI after craniotomy, including operations for tumor, younger age, hospitalization length, diabetes, discharge to institutional care, larger hospital bed size, Medicaid insurance, and presence of an EVD. Diabetes and EVD placement may represent modifiable factors that could be explored in subsequent prospective studies for their associations with cranial SSIs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Memory complaints are common in patients after brain tumor, but is difficult to map memory functions during awake surgery, to preserve them. Thus we analyzed one of the largest data sets on clinical, surgical, and anatomical correlates of memory in patients with brain tumor to date, providing anatomical hotspots for short and long-term memory functions.
   METHODS: A total of 260 patients with brain tumor (130 high-grade gliomas; 76 low-grade gliomas [LGG]; 54 meningiomas) were tested on 2 commonly used short-term memory (Digit Span Forward and Corsi Spatial Span) and 2 long-term memory tasks (Narrative Memory and Delayed Recall of Rey Figure). Patients were evaluated before and immediately after surgery and (for LGG) after 4 months and data analyzed by means of analysis of covariance and the voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping technique.
   RESULTS: As expected, patients with high-grade gliomas were already impaired before surgery, whereas patients with meningioma were largely unimpaired. Patients with LGG were unimpaired before surgery, but showed significant performance drop immediately after, with good recovery within few months. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analyses identified specific anatomical correlates for verbal memory tasks, whereas visuospatial tasks provided good sensitivity to cognitive damage but failed to show anatomical specificity. Anatomical hotspots identified were in line with both previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical studies on other neurological populations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Verbal memory tasks revealed a set of specific anatomical hotspots that might be considered "eloquent" for verbal memory functions, unlike visuospatial tasks, suggesting that commonly used spatial memory tasks might not be optimal to localize the damage, despite an otherwise good sensitivity to cognitive damage.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients who have had microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery often report sensory discomfort around the surgical area. In most cases, injury of the lesser occipital nerve (LON) is responsible for this postoperative complication. This study aimed to explore an effective method to protect the LON and reduce postoperative discomfort.
   METHODS: Doppler was used to determine the course of the occipital artery (OA) and the incision. Direct LON identification and a novel crutchlike incision were performed from January 1, 2016, to February 1, 2017, to reduce postoperative sensory disturbance. Postoperative sensory disturbance was evaluated and retrospectively analyzed compared with previous linear incision cases (from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015). Anatomic information at the lateral occiput was measured and recorded.
   RESULTS: The difference in the amount of postoperative sensory disturbance at 3-month follow-up was significant (P = 0.008). Sensory disturbance was significantly lower in patients who had crutchlike incision (P = 0.002) and patients with direct LON identification (P = 0.035) compared with the previous linear incision cases. The distance from OA to the projection of the transverse sinus was 3.2 +/- 0.6 cm at the mastoid groove and 2.5 +/- 0.4 cm at a site 0.5-1.0 cm from the mastoid groove.
   CONCLUSIONS: A crutchlike incision at the mastoid groove superior to the OA reduced the incidence of postoperative sensory disturbance and OA injury. The mastoid groove and OA are simple landmarks for determination of the incision in microvascular decompression.

AB OBJECTIVE: Embolic occlusions of the common carotid artery (CCA)/internal carotid artery (ICA) and intracranial artery occlusions in acute ischemic stroke are associated with high morbidity and can benefit from endovascular therapy. However, the optimal endovascular strategy for these conditions is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the pass-thrombectomy-protective thrombectomy (double PT) technique and the clinical outcome of treated patients.
   METHODS: We collected data on embolic occlusion of CCA/ICA and intracranial artery occlusion in our prospective stroke registry database between January 2015 and February 2017. Clinical and angiographic data were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical outcome was evaluated at 3 months (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score), and an mRS score of 2 or lower was defined as a good clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 7 patients with tandem occlusion were included, with a mean age of 66 years. The median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 20, and 6 of 7 patients (85.7%) underwent successful recanalization. The median reperfusion time of the affected intracranial artery was 61 minutes. The rate of good clinical outcome was 42.9% (3/7), the mortality rate was 14.3% (1/7), and the embolic event rate was 14.3% (1/7) when the proximal clot was retrieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The double PT technique is feasible and safe in treating initial embolic tandem occlusion of the CCA/ICA.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sublaminar polyester tension bands on the biomechanics of the motion segments proximal to a long fusion construct.
   METHODS: This was a human cadaveric biomechanical study. Pure moments of 4 Nm and 8 Nm were applied to the native spine and the instrumented spine, respectively (n = 8). The test conditions included native spine (T7-L2), fused (T10-L2), fused + bilateral tethers tensioned to 250 N at T9-T10 (tethers 250 N), fused + tethers tensioned to 350 N (tethers 350 N), fused (T11-L2) + tethers tensioned to 250 N at T9-T10 and 350 N at T10-T11 (2-level tethers), fused (T10-L2) + hand-tied suture loop through the spinous processes at T9-T10 (suture loop), and fused (T10-L2) with the T9-T10 interspinous and supraspinous ligaments cut (cut ISL/SSL).
   RESULTS: The flexion range of motion (ROM) at T9-T10 of the fused spine, loaded at 8 Nm, increased to 162% of the native spine loaded at 4 Nm. The average flexion ROM at T9-T10 for tethers 250 N, tethers 350 N, 2-level tethers, suture loop, and cut ISL/SSL were 85% (P < 0.0001), 70% (P < 0.0001), 93% (P < 0.0001), 141% (P = 0.13), and 177% (P = 0.66) of the native spine at 4 Nm, respectively (P values vs. fused).
   CONCLUSIONS: Sublaminar polyester bands can modulate the biomechanical flexion ROM as a function of the band pretension and provide a more consistent and tunable technique than hand-tying a suture loop between the spinous processes.

AB BACKGROUND: More recent studies have focused on clinical outcomes of operative versus nonoperative treatment in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD). However, scientific support for ASD surgery is weak. We compared outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment of ASD with minimum 2-year follow-up in a meta-analysis.
   METHOD: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, from the earliest available date of indexing through May 10, 2018, were searched for studies evaluating outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment of ASD. Two authors performed data extraction independently. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
   RESULTS: Four comparative studies were identified. Postoperative back pain numeric rating scale and leg pain numeric rating scale scores were significantly lower with operative treatment compared with nonoperative treatment (P < 0.00001, weighted mean difference [WMDJ = -2.76 [ - 3.45, -2.07] vs. P < 0.0001, WMD = -2.31 [-3.33, -1.28]). Postoperative Oswestry Disability Index and Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire scores were significantly better with operative treatment compared with nonoperative treatment (P < 0.00001, WMD = -10.96 [- 13.56, -8.36] vs. P< 0.00001, WMD = 0.68 [0.48, 0.87]). The complication rate of operative treatment was 17%-71.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that operative treatment has been demonstrated to significantly reduce disability and pain and to improve clinical outcomes compared with nonoperative treatment. Further large, multi-center, well-designed studies are necessary to substantiate our results.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery for brain metastases aims to reduce mass effect and achieve local control through maximizing resection. There is increasing recognition that awake craniotomy (AC) is especially relevant for resection of brain metastases in eloquent areas. This study seeks to examine the neurologic outcomes of using AC for brain metastases resection.
   METHODS: A systematic search for studies examining the role of AC in patients with brain metastases was conducted via PubMed without limitations on the year of publication, language, or study design, using the following search terms: (cerebral OR brain) and (metastases OR tumor) and (awake OR intraoperative OR eloquent OR supramarginal). Studies were included if patients underwent AC for resection of brain metastases and data on pre-and postoperative neurologic function were available.
   RESULTS: Seven studies published between 2001 and 2017 with 104 patients who underwent 107 ACs were identified. Gross total resection was achieved in 61% of patients, supramarginal resection was achieved in 32%, and subtotal resection was achieved in 7%. Immediately after operation, 73% of patients experienced no change or improvement in neurologic outcomes, whereas 27% experienced worsening. In the long term, 96% of those with postoperative worsening of function experienced improvements in neurologic function.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most patients experienced improvements in neurologic function immediately after AC, and most patients that experienced short-term worsening of neurologic function after the procedure showed excellent recovery. AC should be considered as a technique to optimize outcomes in brain metastases in eloquent areas.

AB OBJECTIVE: Helicopter transport may shorten transportation times for emergent neurosurgical intervention. The usefulness of helicopter transport after spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is not well studied. This study seeks to clarify factors that are associated with urgent surgical intervention in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage following helicopter transport.
   METHODS: Records were reviewed for patients with spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage transported by helicopter to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center between January 2008 and December 2011. Records were evaluated for factors associated with emergent tertiary-level care intervention during the first 24 hours of admission.
   RESULTS: A total of 107 patients met inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 67.2 years. At presentation, 79 (75.24%) were hypertensive, 22 (21.57%) had an increased international normalized ratio, and 47 (45.19%) were intubated. Thirty-three patients (30.8%) underwent 1 or more neurosurgical interventions within 24 hours of arrival, with an additional 6 (5.6%) patients undergoing neurosurgical intervention after 24 hours after admission. On univariate analysis, age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and clot volume were significant predictors of neurosurgical intervention within 24 hours of interfacility helicopter transport. A lobar clot, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and presence of >1 cm of midline shift were also associated with neurosurgical intervention within 24 hours. On multivariate analysis, younger age, GCS score of 3-8, and lobar hemorrhage were independent predictors of neurosurgical intervention within 24 hours.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of patients did not undergo any surgical intervention during the first 24 hours of admission after interfacility helicopter transfer. Factors associated with urgent neurosurgical intervention included younger age, low GCS score, and presence of lobar hemorrhage.

AB OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas frequently occur in elderly patients, and surgical treatment is hazardous owing to multiple comorbidities. We report a series of elderly patients who were treated with surgical removal of meningiomas and compare them with a group of younger patients with similar tumors.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of elderly patients with symptomatic skull base meningiomas and a matched control group of younger patients was performed. Medical records, operative reports, radiologic examinations, and follow-up data were reviewed. Main outcome measures were morbidity, mortality, and Simpson grade.
   RESULTS: The study included 46 patients (23 elderly [age >65 years], 23 younger [age <65 years]). Average age was 71 years in elderly patients and 48 years in younger patients. Mean follow-up period was 32 months and 49 months, respectively. Radical removal (Simpson grades I and II) was observed in 83% and 91%, respectively. Mortality was 8% and 4%, respectively. Definite cranial nerve lesions occurred in 8% and 26%, respectively; cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred in 12.5% and 4%, respectively; hemiparesis occurred in 4% of patients in both groups. Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5 was obtained in 87% and 65.2%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with symptomatic skull base meningiomas should be considered for surgical treatment owing to acceptable morbidity and mortality compared with younger patients. Previous comorbidities and involvement of neurovascular structures are important factors in the decision regarding extent of surgical resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose the present study was to assess for gender-based differences in the usage and cost of maximal nonoperative therapy before spinal fusion surgery in patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: A large insurance database was queried for patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis undergoing index lumbar decompression and fusion procedures from 2007 to 2016. This database consists of 20.9 million covered lives and includes private or commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Only patients continuously active within the Humana insurance system for >= 5 years before the index operation were eligible. Usage was characterized by the cost billed to the patient, prescriptions written, and number of units billed.
   RESULTS: A total of 4133 patients (58.5% women) underwent 1-, 2-, or 3-level posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. A significantly greater percentage of female patients used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P < 0.0001), lumbar epidural steroid injections (P = 0.0044), physical and/or occupational therapy (P < 0.0001), and muscle relaxants (P < 0.0001). The total direct cost associated with all maximal nonoperative therapy before index spinal fusion was $9,000,968, with men spending $3,451,479 ($2011.35 per patient) and women spending $5,549,489 ($2296.02 per patient). When considering the quantity of units billed, women used 61.5% of the medical therapy units disbursed despite constituting 58.5% of the cohort. When normalized by the number of pills billed per patient using therapy, female patients used more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and muscle relaxants.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that gender differences exist in the use of nonoperative therapies for symptomatic lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis before fusion surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patients with large and giant intracranial aneurysms (lAs) can experience neurological deterioration within 6 months after successful flow diverter (FD) placement. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether the occurrence of neurological deterioration can he linked to IA expansion within 6 months after FD treatment.
   METHODS: From 2010 to 2016, 45 FD procedures were performed in 44 patients with a large or giant IA. From this group, we selected all patients (14 patients with 15 lAs) with neurological deterioration within 6 months after FD treatment. All these patients had undergone follow-up imaging studies within the same period. The patients were then divided into 2 groups, those with mass effect-related and those with ischemia-related symptoms. The volumes of all treated lAs were determined through manual segmentation of the available pre- and postoperative imaging studies to determine IA expansion after FD treatment. To rule out false-positive findings, we only considered an IA volume increase of >20% after FD treatment as a true IA volume increase.
   RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 6 !As increased in volume and 9 lAs did not. More patients presenting with mass effect-related symptoms showed IA expansion (6 of 10 lAs) compared with patients presenting with ischemia-related symptoms (0 of 5 lAs; Fisher's exact test, 2-sided; P = 0.044).
   CONCLUSION: The volume of large and giant lAs can increase in the first 6 months after FD treatment. More patients presenting with mass effect-related symptoms showed IA expansion than patients with ischemia-related symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be treated with either endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) found that endovascular coiling provided lower mortality rates at 1-year follow-up, starting a trend toward the endovascular treatment approach for SAH. Subsequently, specific procedural indications have driven an approach to SAH management involving a patient-specific procedural choice. The present study evaluates whether specific indications for these procedures have eliminated the differences in risk-adjusted mortality and in-hospital complications from SAH in a large nationally representative set of hospitalizations from 2013 to 2014.
   METHODS: All cases of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage were queried from the National Inpatient Sample using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition. These patients were assigned to cohorts based on whether they were treated by surgical clipping or by endovascular coiling. Subsequent univariate and multivariate analyses were used to characterize and compare demographics, in-hospital complications, and total charges between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: In 2013 to 2014, 6555 patients hospitalized for SAH underwent surgical clipping and 15,350 underwent endovascular coiling. The patients undergoing coiling were older (55.3 vs. 54.1, P = 0.02) and had lower severity scores (3.24 vs. 3.44, P < 0.0001); however, they had higher average risk of mortality scores (2.96 vs. 2.44, P < 0.0001) and longer lengths of stay (19.0 vs. 17.8 days, P = 0.009) than did those undergoing surgical clipping. Multivariate logistic regression analysis comparing clipping to coiling showed no differences in rates of complication (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-1.13), death (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.57-1.05), or total charges (-$3282, 95% CI: -$8376-$14,941) between both cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about overzealous use of endovascular coiling in treating SAH after the ISAT stemmed from a lag in condition-specific indications. The allure of endovascular coiling stems from its noninvasiveness and initial results; however, in the years after ISAT, evaluation of SAH conditions led to more patient-specific indications for SAH. The results presented here suggest that more rigorous procedural selection has allowed for an optimization of outcomes for the 2 procedures.

AB BACKGROUND: Successful endovascular management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) requires timely access to substantial resources. Prior studies suggest an association between time to treatment and patient outcome. Patients treated at safety-net hospitals are thought to be particularly vulnerable to disparities in access to interventions that require substantial technologic resources. We hypothesized that patients with aSAH treated at safety-net hospitals are at greater risk for delayed access to endovascular treatment.
   METHODS: Adults undergoing endovascular coiling procedures between 2002 and 2011 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were included. Hospitals in the quartile with the highest proportion of Medicaid or uninsured patients were defined as safety-net hospitals. A multivariate model including patient-level and hospital-level factors was constructed to permit analysis of delays in endovascular treatment (defined as time to treatment >3 days).
   RESULTS: Analysis included 7109 discharges of patients with aSAH undergoing endovascular coil embolization procedures from 2002 to 2011. Median time to coil embolization in all patients was 1 day; 10.1% of patients waited >3 days until treatment. In multivariate analysis, patients treated at safety-net hospitals were more likely to have a prolonged time to coil embolization (odds ratio = 1.32, P < 0.01) compared with patients treated at low-burden hospitals.
   CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for patient and hospital factors, individuals with aSAH treated at safety-net hospitals from 2002 to 2011 were more likely to have a delay to endovascular coil embolization than individuals treated at non-safety-net hospitals. This disparity could affect patient outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord ischemia is a serious and catastrophic clinicopathologic condition. Despite studies reported over the last 20 years, alternative and efficient treatment options remain unclear. We examined the neuroprotective effects of vigabatrin on a spinal ischemia-reperfusion model.
   METHODS: We divided 24 New Zealand rabbits into 4 groups (control, ischemia reperfusion, and low-dose and high-dose vigabatrin). The control group underwent only abdominal surgery, whereas an abdominal aortic cross-clamp model of spinal ischemia was performed in the other groups. Clips were removed after 30 minutes and 50 and 150 mg/kg vigabatrin was administered intraperitoneally to the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. Neurologic examination was performed for 48 hours, after which the rabbits were sacrificed and a blood sample obtained. Biochemical examination of malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, total nitric oxide, and glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activities in plasma and tissue sample, and histopathologic examination of the spinal cord were performed and statistical results compared between the groups.
   RESULTS: Low-dose vigabatrin had statistically significant effects of neuroprotection on spinal ischemia. Although high-dose vigabatrin had similar effects, the results were not statistically significant for all parameters of biochemical analysis. In addition, histopathologic examination showed some toxic effects of high-dose vigabatrin.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroprotective effects of vigabatrin are shown. For clinical use, further studies are needed.

TI Persistent Disparities in Survival for Patients with Glioblastoma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Neuro-oncology; Surgical outcomes; Survival analysis
ID MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION; TEMOZOLOMIDE; MUTATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain cancer in adults. Recent efforts have elucidated genetic features of tumor cells and thus enhanced our knowledge of GBM pathophysiology. The most recent clinical trials report median overall survival between 14 and 20 months. However, population level outcomes are quite variable and there is a paucity of such data within the literature.
   METHODS: Three hundred seventy-two patients with GBM were diagnosed in the Canadian province of British Columbia between January 2013 and January 2015 and 278 patients had surgery. Of these, 268 had surgery in British Columbia and we have performed a retrospective review of their survival outcomes.
   RESULTS: Our results indicate a median age of 61.8 years at time of diagnosis, with a slight preponderance of male patients. The median overall survival was 10 months for patients in our cohort. As expected, patients older than the age of 65 and those with worse initial Karnofsky Performance Status scores had a poorer prognosis. Moreover, we have found extent of resection, treatment strategies, and treatment location affect overall survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights factors that affect patient survival after surgery in British Columbia. Our data are gathered within a single-payer, high-resource setting which removes possible con-founders in outcome analysis. We find persistent differences in overall survival when compared with clinical trials and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Further efforts should ensure access to the gold standard of care. All neuro-oncology centers should analyze the real-world outcomes of their local glioblastoma treatment strategies. Knowledge of the variance from expected and comparative results are fundamental for appropriate patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a fatal diffusely infiltrating glioma. Because of its rarity, only scarce evidence is available regarding outcome predictors and the proper management of GC.
   METHODS: Reported studies of patients with histologically confirmed GC were systematically reviewed and individual patient-level data (n = 523) extracted. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were fit for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
   RESULTS: The median OS and PFS were 13 and 10 months, with 5-year rates of 18% and 13%, respectively. Age >= 65 years at diagnosis (hazard ratio for OS [HROS], 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-3.31), high-grade tumor (HRPFS for grade III, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.02-2.40; HRPFS for grade IV, 1.74; 95% CI, [0.98-3.10), GC type II (H-ROS, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.12-1.98; HRPFS, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.04-2.34), more central nervous system (CNS) regions involved (HROS, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18), focal neurological deficits (HROS, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07-1.86), cerebellar symptoms (HRPFS, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.42-3.39), more symptoms at presentation (HROS, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), Karnofsky performance scale score <70 (HROS, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.73-7.39; HRPFS, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.39-14.4), magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement (HROS, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.96; HRPFS, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.18-2.55), symmetric bilateral CNS invasion (HROS, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.96), and high proliferation index (Ki-67 >5%; HROS, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.11-4.86) were independent predictors of poor outcomes. In contrast, seizure occurrence (HROS, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-1.00; HRPFS, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.95), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation (HROS, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49), and O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation (HROS, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.59) were associated with prolonged survival. Chemotherapy and surgical resection were associated with improved outcomes, but radiotherapy, whether monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy, was not superior to chemotherapy alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study to date on GC, we have identified clinical, imaging, and molecular outcome predictors that are similar to other gliomas and highlight the beneficial effect of chemotherapy and surgical resection, when feasible, on outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Current guidelines prescribe emergent decompression of acute subdural hematomas (aSDHs) with width 10 mm or larger or midline shift 5 mm or larger. A subset of patients who meet these criteria, including those with high Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and coagulopathy because of medication or multiple medical comorbidities, may be treated conservatively until the hematoma can be removed by burr hole drainage. We present a series of conservatively managed surgical patients with aSDH, examining their hospital course and outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients were included who met guidelines for surgery on admission but who had decompression delayed until it could be accomplished by burr hole drainage. Charts were reviewed for presentation, computed tomography scan findings, and outcomes. Patients were classified according to outcome and whether their eventual surgery was scheduled or emergent.
   RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included with a mean age of 70.2 years. Average GCS score at presentation was 14.6 +/- 0.6. Most patients were using some form of blood-thinning medication at presentation (72.2%). Admission CT scan revealed aSDH with a mean width of 13.6 mm and midline shift of 6.6 mm. Average total length of stay was 28.4 +/- 17.0 days, of which 14.2 +/- 9.2 days were spent in the intensive care unit. Outcomes were generally acceptable, with an average Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge of 3.8 +/- 1.4. There were only 2 deaths, neither of which was related to the initial trauma or a neurologic process.
   CONCLUSIONS: Delayed treatment of aSDH by burr hole drainage is an effective option in certain patients who are suboptimal craniotomy candidates. Acceptable outcomes may be achievable with this conservative approach, when applied in appropriate patients.

   OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the indications of revision for vagal nerve stimulation at a single institution in an adult population with drug-resistant epilepsy.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database who underwent vagal nerve stimulator implantation for drug-resistant epilepsy during 1992-2017. Patients receiving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) implants were monitored throughout their perioperative and postoperative course and were classified according to type of seizure at the time of diagnosis and indications for VNS revision. In addition, response to dysfunctional VNS devices or adverse effects were noted.
   RESULTS: Most patients receiving VNS implants were given a diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPSs) before implantation (95.1%). Other epileptic conditions identified requiring implantation included generalized seizures, generalized-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, CPS or generalized seizures, and tuberous sclerosis (with generalized characteristics). High lead impedance was the most common indication for revision (5.6%), whereas device ineffectiveness leading to continued seizures was the most common indication for removal (2.3%). Infection, lead fracture, and dual- to single-pin lead battery changes occurred at an incidence of 1.9%, requiring either implant removal or revision. Other events that occurred, albeit rarely, included skin extrusion (0.5%), postoperative hematoma (0.5%), and implant rejection (0.5%) necessitating removal.
   CONCLUSIONS: VNS implantation in adults was shown to be a well-tolerated procedure. In addition, indications for revision or removal of the VNS device was low in this population with lead fracture rates lower than the incidence reported in pediatric population literature.

AB OBJECTIVE: Microsurgical clipping ut aneurysms demands precise spatial understanding of aneurysm morphology and vascular geometry. We analyzed the impact of preoperative three-dimensional (3D) angiographic imaging on clinical and angiographic outcome after clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical clipping during the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage between 2010 and 2017. Surgical planning was made based on two-dimensional (2D) or 3D angiographic images. We retrospectively compared complication rates, morbidity, and angiographic outcome between these 2 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 157 patients (mean age: 54.8 +/- 13.1 years) were included in the study. Preoperative 3D angiographic imaging was available for 117 cases. The rate of procedure-related ischemia was significantly lower in the 3D group (16.2%) than in the 2D group (35.0%; P = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, 2D imaging alone remained as independent factor for subsequent brain ischemia (odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2-6.6; P = 0.018). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale <= 2) was more often attained in the 3D group (70.0%) than in the 2D group (41.9%; P = 0.002). The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.967).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our study, accurate operation planning using 3D angiography was associated with a lower ischemic complication rate after clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, which may potentially influence clinical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe longitudinal image changes in supratentorial hemispheric meningiomas based on magnetic resonance imaging after preoperative embolization using calibrated microspheres.
   METHODS: A total of 14 patients with symptomatic supratentorial meningiomas were included in a prospective, mono-centric, mono-arm study. Magnetic resonance imaging changes on diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast susceptibility-perfusion-weighted imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence T1-weighted postcontrast sequences 6 and 48 hours after embolization were evaluated and correlated with angiographic and clinical data.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63 +/- 12.7 years with an equal female/male ratio. Twelve meningiomas were World Health Organization grade I and II tumors. After embolization, baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (901 +/- 166 mm(2)/s) decreased significantly within 6 hours (696 +/- 115 mm(2)/s, P = 0.0008) as well within 48 hours (752 +/- 134 mm(2)/s; P = 0.0147). Baseline mean ratio of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)(tumo)(r)/rCBV(white)( matter) (3.67 +/- 1.83) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF)(tumor)/rCBF(white matter )(2.89 +/- 1.57) significantly decreased after embolization within 6 hours (rCBV(tumor)/rCBV(white)( matter) of 1.45 +/- 0.9; P = 0.0007, rCBF of 1.16 +/- 0.68; P = 0.0029) and 48 hours (rCBV of 1.50 +/- 1.07; P = 0.0009, rCBF(tumor)/rCBFwhite matter of 1.19 +/- 0.8; P = 0.003). The viable enhanced baseline mean tumor volume (54.3 +/- 34.9 mm(3)) was sustainably and significantly diminished within 6 hours (26.6 +/- 20.8 mm(3); P = 0.02) and 48 hours (29.7 +/- 22.5 mm(3); P = 0.035) after embolization. There was a good correlation between angiographic devascularization rate and the embolized tumor volume at 6 hours (r = 0.7; P = 0.03) and 48 hours (r = 0.78; P = 0.041).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative meningioma embolization with calibrated microspheres is safe and effectively induces a significant and sustainable tissue transformation over 48 hours.

   CLASSIFICATION; MALFORMATIONS; EMBOLIZATION; EXPOSURE; DRAINAGE
AB OBJECTIVE: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are abnormal direct shunts between the occipital or meningeal artery and a meningeal vein or dural venous sinus. Treatment strategies include endovascular, microsurgical, stereotactic radiosurgical, or combined interventions. With few previous reports focused on dAVF treatment in a hybrid operating room (hOR), the authors reviewed their 6-year experience in this unique setting for these complex fistulas.
   METHODS: Patients with complex cerebral dAVFs underwent endovascular and microsurgical treatment in the hOR. In this retrospective review, 8 consecutive patients with cerebral dAVFs (Borden type 2 or higher) underwent endovascular and microsurgical treatment. Demographic characteristics, symptoms related to the dAVF, preoperative angiographic features, preinterventional therapies, intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (iDSA), and postoperative clinical and radiologic findings were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Of these 8 patients, 5 patients underwent multiple embolizations (up to 3) and hybrid procedures, with no procedure-related complications. After microsurgical resection, iDSA revealed remnants of the fistula, which was then immediately re-resected, in 2 patients. At closing of the hybrid procedure, iDSA revealed no fistula remnants in 7 patients (88%). At mean follow-up examination (58 months), 5 patients (62%) had cure of the dAVF, confirmed by noninvasive angiography. Two patients (25%) experienced a recurrence of the dAVF within 5 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our hybrid techniques achieved high rates of dAVF obliteration, with all 8 patients achieving good or excellent outcomes and symptom relief. Angiographic follow-up within 6 months after the hybrid procedure is recommended for all patients even when intraoperative findings do not show remnants.

AB BACKGROUND: Limited data have been reported showing whether the second-generation Wallis interspinous spacer improves function after lumbar spine decompression or discectomy.
   METHODS: We evaluated Wallis interspinous spacer placement in patients with low back pain or sciatica secondary to a confirmed diagnosis of primary lumbar disc herniation. The patients were treated from July 2008 to July 2011 at 1 institution. Of the 77 patients, 40 allocated to undergo posterior lumbar discectomy with Wallis implantation and 37 without Wallis implantation. The primary outcomes were the visual analog scale score, Japanese Orthopedics Association score, and Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcomes were the intervertebral disc height, range of motion of the operated segments, complications, and operating time.
   RESULTS: At 3 years, the improvements in the primary outcomes were not different between the 2 groups (P> 0.05). The disc height was significantly greater in the Wallis group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Two patients in the Wallis group and three patients in the control group underwent further surgery to treat repeated prolapse of the index segment or an adjacent segment. No significant difference was found in the complication rate between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that discectomy combined with Wallis implantation was not beneficial for pain relief or lumbar function improvement compared with lumbar discectomy alone. Although the Wallis implant was associated with maintenance of the intervertebral disc height and limited range of motion of the spine, it is probably incapable of preventing recurrent herniation or adjacent segment degeneration.

   CRANIECTOMY; MULTICENTER; SURGERY; LIFE; DETERIORATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCI) is life threatening. It is associated with a mortality as high as 80%, and survival often at the expense of serious disability. Limited success of medical therapies has resulted in decompressive craniectomy (DC) being increasingly used as a treatment for MCI, although evidence of its efficacy is inconclusive. In this study, the efficacy of DC in improving survival, or survival free of severe disability, was assessed.
   METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to approximate the efficacy of DC for treating MCI, considering age and time to surgery. A systematic literature review was conducted on Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases to August 1, 2018. Death and severe disability at 3, 6, 12, and 36 months follow-up were assessed, comparing best medical therapy with DC.
   RESULTS: 18 studies were eligible for inclusion and represented 987 individuals who received DC. Nine of these were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 374 DC). Early DC (<48 hours from onset of stroke) reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11, 0.29; P < 0.00001) but not unfavourable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] >4) (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.47, 4.11; P = 0.56) at 12 months follow-up. This survival benefit was maintained regardless of age.
   CONCLUSION: Early DC reduces mortality but does not appear to improve favourable outcomes in patients younger or older than 60 years after MCI. RCTs incorporating quality of life assessments are warranted for MCI patients, in addition to defining the optimal timing and benefits of DC in older patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to comprehensively assess the prevalence and distribution of thoracic disc herniation (TDH) or thoracic hypertrophied ligamentum flavum causing stenosis (HLFS) by magnetic resonance image (MRI) in patients with back or leg pain.
   METHODS: The study participants included 2212 patients who underwent MRI evaluation for back or leg pain. The prevalence and distribution of TDH or thoracic HLFS were assessed using lumbar MRI with cervicothoracic sagittal images. The presence of TDH or HLFS and the clinical parameters such as age, sex, lumbar surgical need, and thoracic operation were retrospectively reviewed. Logistic regression analysis of the data was followed.
   RESULTS: The prevalence rates of TDH and thoracic HLFS in all patients were 6.5% (145/2212) and 19.0% (421/2212), respectively. The prevalence of TDH was demonstrated as a relatively even distribution across age groups, higher in male participants (8.0%) than in female participants, and more frequent in patients with lumbar surgical lesions (8.2%) than without surgical lesions. Whereas, the prevalence of thoracic HLFS tended to increase with age, was higher in female participants (21.6%) than in male participants, and had no association with presence of lumbar surgical lesions. The most frequently involved segments of TDH and HLFS were T8/9 and T10/11, respectively. Six of 145 patients with TDH and 15 of 421 patients with HLFS underwent surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TDH had a significant association with the presence of lumbar surgical lesions and no association with age. The prevalence of thoracic HLFS had a strong association with age and no association with lumbar surgical lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of indirect decompression after lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is widely acknowledged; however, its details remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of indirect decompression just after LLIF cage placement but just before posterior instrumentation, using intraoperative computed tomography myelogram (iCTM).
   METHODS: Fifty-three levels from 28 patients undergoing LLIF with iCTM, were included in this retrospective study. Radiographic parameters were obtained from preoperative computed tomography myelogram and iCTM. Segmental correction, cross-sectional areas of the spinal canal, and bilateral foramen were compared preoperatively and intraoperatively to assess the neural decompression just after LLIF cage placement. Canal stenosis status during axial computed tomography myelogram was classified into 3 grades according to modified Schizas's grading to determine the necessity of additional posterior decompression procedures. The Oswestry Disability Index was obtained before and 3 months after the operation.
   RESULTS: Significant improvements in all radiological parameters of segmental correction, cross-sectional areas of the spinal canal, and bilateral foramen were observed just after LLIF cage placement. However, 11 (21%) levels had insufficient neural decompression status with iCTM grade (10 central canal and 1 lateral recess stenosis), requiring further direct posterior decompression. The difference in the improvement of Oswestry Disability Index between the decompression and nondecompression group was not significant, suggesting the validity of our decision.
   CONCLUSIONS: Detailed evaluation with iCTM revealed that adequate indirect decompression with LLIF was not always obtained, validating the intraoperative decision of further posterior decompression. This procedure, LLIF with iCTM, may reduce the risk of unnecessary direct decompression and reoperation after insufficient indirect decompression.

AB OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the cement distribution patterns and further investigate associations between cement distribution patterns and the occurrence rates of recompression in cemented vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
   METHODS: Two hundred twenty-four patients with a mean age of 71.9 years were enrolled and treated with single-level PVP between June 2012 and July 2015. The mean follow-up time was 16.5 months. Data from medical records and radiographs were collected and analyzed. Cement distribution patterns were divided into 4 cement distribution patterns extending from the traditional 2 patterns: interlocked solid pattern (LS) and uninterlocked solid pattern (ULS); contiguous trabecular pattern (CT) and discontiguous trabecular pattern (DCT). Differences in treatment efficacy and the occurrence rates of recompression in cemented vertebrae were compared for both groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-squared test.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent PVP developed recompression in cemented vertebrae. Recompression in cemented vertebrae was significantly more frequent in the ULS and DCT groups than in the LS and CT groups (P < 0.05 or 0.001), with the Visual Analogue Scale score at the time of final follow-up was also significantly higher in the ULS and DCT groups (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations were found between cement distribution patterns and recompression in cemented vertebrae, which affected the clinical outcome in patients after PVP. A higher incidence of recompression in cemented vertebrae was seen in patients with treated vertebrae exhibiting ULS pattern or DCT pattern.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, full-endoscopic lumbar decompression has shown encouraging clinical outcomes. However, there are no reports as to whether sufficient lumbar decompression through full-endoscopic procedures can be achieved. The purpose of this study is to investigate the radiologic outcomes of percutaneous biportal endoscopic decompression compared with those of conventional microscopic decompressive surgery.
   METHODS: A case-control prospective study was carried out. Patients were classified into 2 groups regarding the operation method (microscope group and endoscopic group). The cross-sectional area of the dura was measured both preoperatively and postoperatively at 5 axial cuts of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images in all subjects. In addition, clinical outcomes using visual analog scale for back and leg pain and Oswestry Disability Index were analyzed. Radiologic and clinical results were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were enrolled in the study. Forty-two patients were assigned to the microscope group and 46 patients were assigned to the endoscopic group. Postoperatively, the dura was significantly expanded in each group (P < 0.05). Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved after surgery in both groups (P < 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference of dura expansion between the 2 groups (P> 0.05). Immediate postoperative pain score was significantly greater in the microscope group than in the endoscopic group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Full-endoscopic lumbar decompression using percutaneous biportal endoscopic approach is a safe and effective treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis. Decompression can be achieved with the percutaneous endoscopic technique at a similar rate to that achieved by the microscopic approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: Resection of epidural thoracic spine tumors is uniquely challenging owing to the dangers posed by the surrounding anatomy and the unforgiving nature of the thoracic spinal cord. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative risk factors for 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing resection of these tumors.
   METHODS: Adults who underwent laminectomy for excision of thoracic spine tumors from 2011 to 2014 were included. The demographic data and medical comorbidities and major morbidities and mortalities within 30 postoperative days were collected and assessed using multivariate binary logistic analysis.
   RESULTS: The database search yielded 616 patients, of whom 232 (37.7%) were female. Overall, complications within 30 days of surgery occurred in 322 patients (52.3%). Of the 616 patients, 64 (10.4%) died within 30 days of surgery. Smoking history was associated with significantly greater 30-day morbidity (P = 0.019), as was preoperative anemia for females (P = 0.003) and preoperative hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.0001), with the need for preoperative blood transfusion also leading to greater morbidity (P = 0.001). The presence of preoperative dyspnea and congestive heart failure increased the risk of complications (P = 0.001). Preoperative hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-7.0), dependent functional status (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.7-7.6), and bleeding disorder (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.5-20.1) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, nonthrombotic pulmonary complications, and blood transfusions were common postand perioperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Excision of epidural thoracic spinal tumors carries a high complication rate. The present series has revealed distinct preoperative and postoperative factors that contribute to 30-day morbidity and mortality for tumors in this region, many of which are amenable to careful preoperative management.

AB BACKGROUND: Pseudoarthrosis after spinal fusion is an important cause of pain, neurologic decline, and reoperation.
   METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases were queried in New York, California, Florida, and Washington for adult patients who had undergone new spinal fusion from 2009 to 2011. In accordance with the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project methods series and analysis guidelines, generalized linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the odds of experiencing postoperative pseudoarthrosis as a function of multivariable patient characteristics, comorbidities, and surgical approach.
   RESULTS: Of the 107,420 patients who had undergone cervical fusion, 1295 (1.2%) developed pseudoarthrosis requiring reoperation. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors included posterior (odds ratio [OR], 4.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.92-5.10) and combined (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33-2.36) approaches, fusion of >= 9 vertebrae (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.38-4.68), smoking (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.34), and long-term steroid use (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.18-3.00). Of the 148,081 patients who underwent thoracic or lumbar fusion, 2665 (1.8%) developed pseudoarthrosis. Posterior (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51-0.56) and combined (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.40-0.54) approaches resulted in reduced rates. Fusion of 4-8 verte- brae (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39-1.67), >= 9 vertebrae (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.49-2.34), hypertension (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-128), sleep apnea (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72), smoking (OR, 1.22,; 95% CI, 1.12-1.33), and long-term steroid use (OR, 1.53, 95% CI, 1.08-2.18) resulted in increased rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly associate several diagnoses with the development of pseudoarthrosis. However, further prospective studies are warranted to establish causation.

AB OBJECTIVE: A reliable, noninvasive method to differentiate high-grade glioma (HGG) and intracranial metastasis (IM) has remained elusive. The aim of this study was to differentiate between HGG and IM using tumoral and peritumoral diffusion tensor imaging characteristics.
   METHODS: A semi-automated script generated volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) for the tumor and a peritumoral shell at a predetermined voxel thickness. ROI differences in diffusion tensor imaging-related metrics between HGG and IM groups were estimated, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, total fiber tract counts, and tract density.
   RESULTS: The HGG group (n = 46) had a significantly higher tumor-to-brain volume ratio than the IM group (n = 35) (P< 0.001). The HGG group exhibited significantly higher mean fractional anisotropy and significantly lower mean diffusivity within peritumoral ROI than the IM group (P < 0.05). The HGG group exhibited significantly higher total tract count and higher tract density in tumoral and peritumoral ROls than the IM group (P < 0.05). Tumoral tract count and peritumoral tract density were the most optimal metrics to differentiate the groups based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Predictive analysis using receiver operating characteristic curve thresholds was performed on 13 additional participants. Compared with correct clinical diagnoses, the 2 thresholds exhibited equal specificities (66.7%), but the tumoral tract count (85.7%) seemed more sensitive in differentiating the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tract count and tract density were significantly different in tumoral and peritumoral regions between HGG and IM. Differences in microenvironmental interactions between the tumor types may cause these tract differences.

AB BACKGROUND: The impact of obesity on global spinopelvic alignment is poorly understood. This study investigated the effect of body mass index on achieving alignment targets and compensation mechanisms after corrective surgery for adult spinal deformity (ASD).
   METHODS: Retrospective review of a single-center database. Inclusion: patients >= 18 years with full-body stereographic images (baseline and 1 year) and who met ASD criteria (sagittal vertical axis [SVA] >5 cm, pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis [PI-LL] >10 , corona' curvature >20 degrees or pelvic tilt >20 degrees). Patients were stratified by age (<40, 40-65, and >= 65 years) and body mass index (<25,25-30, and >30). Postoperative alignment was compared with age-adjusted ideal values. Prevalence of patients who matched ideals and unmatched (undercorrected/overcorrected) was assessed. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores, alignment, and compensatory mechanisms were compared across cohorts using analysis of variance and temporally with paired t tests.
   RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included (average age, 62 years; &b% female). After corrective surgery, obese and overweight patients had more residual malalignment (worse PI-LL, T1 pelvic angle, pelvic tilt, and SVA) compared with normal patients (P < 0.05). In addition, obese and overweight patients recruited more pelvic shift (obese, 62.36; overweight, 49.80; normal, 31.50) and had a higher global sagittal angle (obese, 6.51; overweight, 6.35; normal, 3.40) (P < 0.05). Obese and overweight patients showed lower overcorrection rates and higher undercorrection rates (P< 0.05). Obese patients showed worse postoperative HRQL scores (Scoliosis Research Society 22 Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale-leg) than did overweight and normal patients (P< 0.05). Obese and overweight patients who matched age-adjusted alignment targets for SVA or PI-LL showed no HRQL improvements (P> 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: After surgery, obese patients were undercorrected, showed more residual malalignment, recruited more pelvic shift, and had a greater global sagittal angle and worse HRQL scores. The benefits from age-adjusted alignment targets seem to be less substantial for obese and overweight patients.

AB BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is associated with intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture.
   METHODS: We used an observational cohort study design. Age, sex, admission systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aneurysmal rupture, apolipoprotein (APO)-A1, APO-B, HDL, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, cholesterol, and aneurysm location and size were recorded. Aneurysms <8 mm were categorized as small.
   RESULTS: The data from 581 patients with intracranial aneurysms were analyzed. The predictive factors for small size of aneurysms were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.630; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.428-0.927; P = 0.019) and higher HDL (OR, 0.327; 95% CI, 0.159-0.672; P = 0.0002). In the subgroup of male patients, lower HDL was the only risk factor for large size (P = 0.015). The predictors of aneurysmal rupture were small size (OR, 0.875; 95% CI, 0.842-0.910; P = 0.000), higher HDL (OR, 3.716; 95% CI, 1.623-8.509; P = 0.002), no coronary artery disease (OR, 4.736; 95% CI, 1.528-14.681; P = 0.007), lower APO-Al (OR, 0.202; 95% CI, 0.064-0.641; P = 0.007), and higher admission SBP (OR, 1.024; 95% CI, 1.015-1.032; P = 0.000). An HDL/aneurysm size ratio >0.31 was associated with a 46.2-fold increased likelihood of aneurysmal rupture (OR, 46.214; 95% CI, 13.386-159.548; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The HDL level was inversely associated with intracranial aneurysm growth, especially in men. Higher HDL levels and small aneurysm size contributed to a greater risk of aneurysmal rupture. An HDL/size ratio >0.31 was a valuable predictor of intracranial rupture.

AB BACKGROUND: Total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) significantly decreases the rate of local recurrence and provides long-term survival in patients with malignant tumor of the spine. This procedure can be performed through a posterior-only approach. However, TES for lower lumbar spine through a posterior-only approach is technically challenging.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 9 patients with solitary metastatic tumors of the fourth lumbar spine who underwent TES in a posterior-only approach from June 2012 to December 2015. This series included 5 female and 4 male patients, with a mean age of 54.1 years. Endpoints included length of surgery, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale for pain, instrumentation failure, perioperative complications, local control rate, and overall survival.
   RESULTS: All patients underwent TES and circumferential reconstruction of the involved level. Average operative time and estimated blood loss were 282 minutes and 2421 mL, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 41.2 months. We encountered nerve roots stretches in all patients during the surgeries. Three patients experienced acute lower-extremity neurologic dysfunction, but the symptoms were significantly alleviated in 4 weeks postoperatively and fully resolved within 6 months. Five patients showed no evidence of disease at the latest follow-up. Three patients died of metastasis and systemic failure. One patient developed new metastases and was alive with disease. Titanium mesh cage subsidence was observed in 3 patients, hut no implant failures or related clinical symptoms were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: TES for the fourth lumbar spine in a posterior-only approach is feasible. Although the surgery is challenging, long-term oncologic and neurologic outcomes are satisfying.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most difficult-to-treat form of stroke and accounts for about 10%-30% of all strokes worldwide. Hematoma expansion (HE), which occurs in one third of patients with ICH, is strongly predictive of worse prognosis and potentially preventable if high-risk patients are identified in the early phase of ICH. We summarized data from recent studies on HE prediction and classified those potential indicators into 2 categories: 1) clinical and laboratory and 2) radiographic. Therefore, we aimed to identify the accuracy of 1, that is, the value of combining predictors in predicting HE of ICH in basal ganglia.
   METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical database of Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital for patients with ICH aged >18 years between January 2015 and January 2018. As inclusion criteria, we defined 1) ICH diagnosed on noncontrast computed tomography (CT); 2) noncontrast CT performed on enrollment within 6 hours after onset of symptoms; 3) follow-up CT scan performed within 24 hours after the baseline CT scan; and 4) all of the primary hematoma was located in the basal ganglia. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the potential HE predictors, and then receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the L (the value of combining predictors) of imaging markers and clinical factors in predicting HE.
   RESULTS: Of the 99 patients with HE, island sign was present in 48.48% (48/99) of patients and blend sign was present in 34.34% (34/99) of patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified time to baseline CT scan (odds ratio [OR] 1.574; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.205-2.054; P = 0.001), baseline hematoma volume (P = 0.001), presence of island sign (OR 11.247; 95% CI 4.701-26.909; P = 0.000), presence of blend sign (OR 3.104; 95% CI 1.425-6.765; P = 0.004), anticoagulants use or international normalized ratio >1.5 (OR 2.755; 95% CI 1.072-7.082; P = 0.035), and intraventricular hemorrhage (OR 2.351; 95% CI 1.066-5.187; P = 0.034) as independent predictors of HE. The sensitivity and specificity of L (value of combining predictors) were 88.89% and 80.84%, respectively; the area under the curve was 0.918.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that the ability of L to predict HE was much more excellent than these 6 predictors alone. L showed a high association with HE, with an accuracy of 91.8%, and was a reliable value of combining predictors in terms of predicting HE. L may serve as a promising, noninvasive tool for clinical therapeutic strategy.

TI Cell-Free Oxyhemoglobin in Cerebrospinal Fluid After Aneurysmal
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Biomarker and Potential Therapeutic Target
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Biomarkers; Delayed ischemic neurologic deficits; Hemoglobin;
   Intracranial hemorrhage; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is often complicated by the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurologic deficits (DIND), which impairs the clinical outcome of patients. The release of oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) from lysing erythrocytes into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may critically contribute to the development of DIND.
   METHODS: Ventricular CSF of 18 high-grade (Fisher 3 and 4) aSAH patients was sampled daily from external ventricular drains between days 0 and 14 after bleeding. CSF was spectrophotometrically analyzed with precise quantification of cell-free oxyHb levels.
   RESULTS: OxyHb levels in CSF showed a delayed peak reaching the highest levels in the high-risk period for developing of DIND between days 3 and 14 after aneurysm rupture. Patients with DIND had a significantly higher cumulative oxyHb exposure within the first week after bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: OxyHb levels in CSF may be useful as a biomarker to predict DIND in aSAH patients. The contribution of oxyHb in CSF to the pathogenesis of DIND should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target.

AB BACKGROUND: It remains controversial whether primary brainstem hemorrhage (PBH) should be managed conservatively or treated promptly by surgical evacuation of the hematoma. In the present study, we discuss 5 cases of PBH that were treated surgically and the ability of surgical management to improve postoperative functional outcomes.
   METHODS: The 4 patients with pontine and medullary hemorrhage underwent surgery via the lateral or midline suboccipital and trans-rhomboid fossa approach in the half-sitting position. The patient with a midbrain hemorrhage underwent surgery via the subtemporal approach in the supine lateral position. We analyzed the postoperative functional outcomes 1 week after surgery and the modified Rankin scale scores 6 months after discharge.
   RESULTS: Three patients with disturbance of consciousness experienced improvement in their level of consciousness. Four patients with hemiparesis improved in motor function. Oculomotor nerve function improved in 2 of 3 cases. Facial nerve function improved in 2 of 2 cases. Spontaneous respiration improved in 1 patient. The postoperative modified Rankin scale scores improved in all 5 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the good results with these 5 patients with PBH, this surgical strategy could be encouraged with exclusion criteria for early initiation of rehabilitation strategies. We hope to increase our number of patients to accumulate further evidence.

AB OBJECTIVE: The blood-brain harrier (BBB) of patients with moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) is unstable, which may contribute to transient neurologic symptoms (INS) after direct bypass surgery. However, BBB-related proteins have never been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perioperative serum levels of biomarkers representing BBB function in MMA patients based on the hypothesis that postoperative hemodynamic change may disrupt the BBB.
   METHODS: A total of 12 hemispheres in 11 patients with MMA were prospectively examined. Direct revascularization surgery was performed for all cases. The serum levels of tight junction (occludin and claudin 5), adherens junction (vascular endothelial - cadherin) proteins, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were measured quantitatively 1 day before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 4, and 7.
   RESULTS: Successful patency of the direct bypass was achieved in all. The serum level of occludin was significantly increased on postoperative day 1, and the levels in 2 cases with TNS were markedly elevated over 10-fold higher than baseline. Furthermore, the postoperative MMP-9 levels were significantly elevated on each day. On the other hand, there was no significant fluctuation in claudin 5, vascular endothelial-cadherin, and MMP-2 level.
   CONCLUSIONS: Marked changes in biomarkers representing the tight junction of the BBB were observed. These preliminary results suggest that marked hemodynamic change and TNS in some patients are associated with disruption of the BBB after direct bypass surgery for MMA.

ID ULTRASOUND; REGISTRATION; DATABASE; TUMORS; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Unreliable neuronavigation owing to inaccurate patient-to-image registration and brain shift is a major problem in conventional magnetic resonance imaging-guided neurosurgery. We performed a prospective intraoperative validation of a system for fully automatic correction of this inaccuracy based on intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-to-ultrasound registration.
   METHODS: The system was tested intraoperatively in 13 tumor resection cases, and performance was evaluated intraoperatively and postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Intraoperatively, the system was accurate enough for tumor resection guidance in 9 of 13 cases. Manually placed anatomic landmarks showed improvement of alignment from 5.12 mm to 2.72 mm (median) after intraoperative correction. Postoperatively, the limitations of the current system were identified and modified for the system to be sufficiently accurate in all cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Automatic and accurate correction of spatially unreliable neuronavigation is feasible within the constraints of surgery. The current limitations of the system were also identified and addressed.

ID NEUROVASCULAR COMPRESSION; HYPERTENSION; NUANCES
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression is the most effective treatment for hemifacial spasm. However, when encountering hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery (VA), the procedure is more challenging and requires complicated operation techniques. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of this group of cases and investigated reasonable transposition procedures for different anatomic classifications.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 117 cases that underwent their first microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm between June 2010 and December 2016, which had all associated with vertebral artery compression diagnosed by preoperational radiology examination. The study first classified offending vessels into 3 types according to operative anatomy and designed personalized decompression management according to different forms of neurovascular conflict. Curative effects and complications were assessed.
   RESULTS: The offending vessels were artificially divided into 3 types according to both arterial pattern and compression direction: 1) ipsilateral VA plus anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the ventrolateral direction in 72 (61.5%) cases; 2) ipsilateral VA plus posterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the caudal-medial direction in 31 (26.5%) cases; 3) bilateral VA compressing the facial nerve in 14 (12.0%) cases. We selected corridors to expose the neurovascular conflict site between the suprafloccular-transhorizontal fissure approach and subtonsillar-transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. The methods of decompression consist of anteromedial and posterolateral transposition by using biomedical glue- coated Teflon sling. Sufficient decompression of the offending vessels was safely performed in all cases. All cases had total relief of symptoms immediately after their operations. Follow-up periods ranged from 16-90 months, and total recovery occurred in 110 cases (94.0%). In 7 cases (6.0%), 90% recovery occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy and comprehensive recognition of anatomic features of the offending vessels are crucial for the management of hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery compression. Appropriate approaches combined with the biomedical glue-coated Teflon sling transposition technique can allow adequate mobilization of the vertebral artery and bring complete postoperative symptom relief for most cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)/hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is radiologically difficult to distinguish from meningioma, especially angiomatous meningioma. This study aimed to detect texture parameters to distinguish SFT/ HPC from angiomatous meningioma using magnetic resonance imaging texture analysis with commercially available software.
   METHODS: We retrospectively investigated textural parameters in 43 newly diagnosed SFTs/HPCs, angiomatous meningiomas, and other World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningiomas treated at Keio University Hospital. For T1 contrast-enhanced, T2, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images, texture analyses were performed. Regions of interest were drawn manually with reference to the greater signal on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. ADC values and texture parameters, including kurtosis, skewness, and entropy, were evaluated and compared between these 3 groups.
   RESULTS: The mean ADC value was significantly high in angiomatous meningioma, compared with SFT/HPC and other WHO grade I meningioma. ADC entropy was highest in SFT/HPC, followed by angiomatous and other WHO grade I meningioma. T2 skewness was significantly high in SFT/ HPC, compared with angiomatous and other WHO grade I meningioma. T1 contrast-enhanced skewness was significantly low in angiomatous meningioma, compared with other WHO grade I meningioma. Mean ADC value distinguished SFT/HPC from angiomatous meningioma with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 62.5% and specificity of 62.5%. ADC entropy distinguished SFT/HPC from angiomatons meningioma with a PPV of 100% and specificity of 100%. ADC skewness distinguished SFT/HPC from angiomatous meningioma with a PPV of 66.7% and specificity of 71.4%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging texture analysis was useful for distinguishing SFT/HPC from meningioma, especially angiomatous meningioma.

AB OBJECTIVE: We elucidated the clinical and radiological characteristics and analyzed the risk factors for hemorrhage and poor outcomes of cerebral venous malformations (CVMs) in a northern Chinese population.
   METHODS: We included 60 consecutive patients with CVM patients in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2011 to February 2018. The clinical manifestations, radiological characteristics, management, and outcomes were elucidated and analyzed. The patients were followed up for 5-64 months (median, 26). Poor outcomes included repeat bleeding, secondary infarction, severe disability (modified Rankin scale score >= 3), and death.
   RESULTS: Infratentorial CVMs were more prone to intracranial hemorrhage (75% vs. 28.6%; P< 0.001), dizziness (37.5% vs. 10.7%; P = 0.017), and focal neurological deficits (65.6% vs. 25%; P = 0.002) than were supratentorial CVMs. Supratentorial CVMs were more prone to seizure (32.1% vs. 0%; P = 0.001) than were infratentorial CVMs. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the major risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage in CVMs were infratentorial lesions (P = 0.003) and complicated cavernous angiomas (P = 0.016). Compared with conservative treatment, resection of hematoma or cavernous angiomas with CVM preservation did not increase the risk of poor outcomes (P = 0.646). However, CVM resection significantly increased that risk (odds ratio, 44.0; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that conservative treatment of CVMs results in a relatively good prognosis. For those complicated by hemorrhage or cavernous angiomas requiring surgical interventions, the integrity of the CVM should be preserved, irrespective of the treatment. In exceptional cases, before CVM resection, the CVM drainage should be comprehensively evaluated.

ID SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LANGUAGE

AB BACKGROUND: The connection between the ventrolateral frontal and temporoparietal cortices has an important role in language function on the language-dominant side and spatial awareness on the nondominant side. However, the laterality of these pathways remains controversial. We investigated the laterality of this connection using corticocortical-evoked potentials (CCEPs).
   METHODS: From April 2014 to March 2016, 27 patients who had undergone frontotemporal craniotomy were enrolled. With the patients under general anesthesia, subdural electrodes were placed on both frontal and temporoparietal areas intraoperatively. Alternating 1-Hz electrical stimuli were delivered to the pars opercularis and pars triangularis with a stimulus intensity of 10 mA. CCEPs were obtained from temporoparietal areas by averaging the electrocorticogram time-locked to the stimulus onset. The amplitudes and latencies of the CCEP N1 components were compared between the dominant and nondominant sides.
   RESULTS: The median amplitudes of the CCEPs were 335.1 mu V (range, 60.2-750) and 125.65 mu V (range, 55.1-634) on the dominant and nondominant sides, respectively. The CCEP amplitudes were significantly larger on the dominant side than on the nondominant side (P = 0.013). In contrast, the median latency was 27.8 ms (range, 19.3-36.6) on the language-dominant side and 28.9 ms (range, 8.9-38.5) on the nondominant side. The latencies were not significantly different between the 2 sides (P = 0.604).
   CONCLUSIONS: The CCEP amplitudes were significantly larger in the dominant hemisphere. These findings can lead to better hypotheses regarding the relationship between language functions and the development of the network connecting the frontal and temporoparietal cortices.

ID BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS; CITATION IMPACT; H-INDEX; PRODUCTIVITY;
   PERFORMANCE; RANKING
AB BACKGROUND: The use of bibliometrics to evaluate authors, institutions, and journals faces significant challenges in comparing biomedical specialties because of marked differences among fields. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of specialty field and physician numbers on bibliometric parameters.
   METHODS: For this bibliometric analysis, data from MDLinx.com and SClmago Journal & Country Rank for 2016 were used to rank the journals. The 2015 Physician Specialty Data Report provided the number of specialists in specific fields. We assessed the means for bibliometric parameters across medical and surgical specialties.
   RESULTS: A total of 904 journals within 25 medical and surgical specialties were identified. Medical specialty journals had higher average total citations than did surgical specialty journals (8360 +/- 16082 vs. 6217 +/- 8743; P = 0.01). Medical specialties with the highest impact factor were oncology (7.8 +/- 20.7), psychiatry (4.6 +/- 4.0), and neurology (4.4 +/- 4.1), whereas surgical specialties were led by urology (2.9 +/- 3.3), cardiothoracic surgery (2.9 +/- 2.7), and general surgery (2.6 +/- 1.7). Impact factor and Eigenfactor score (a measure of both journal citations and caliber) were strongly correlated (r = 0.84, P = 0.0001). Comparison of impact factor per total physicians in the specialty suggested that top-ranked specialty journals were in allergy/immunology, pulmonology, and cardiothoracic surgery. Mean Eigenfactor score per total physicians showed that top journals were in cardiothoracic surgery, rheumatology, and pulmonary medicine.
   CONCLUSIONS: Journal bibliometrics, which may strongly influence professional advancement and grant funding, show dramatic differences in ranking after accounting for specialty and physician population. Improved analysis and understanding of available bibliometrics, including their limitations, are necessary to appreciate their role in measuring scholarship.

ID MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; ACINETOBACTER-MENINGITIS; COLISTIN; INFECTIONS;
   MANAGEMENT; CATHETERS
AB BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has resulted in difficult-to-treat ventriculitis/ meningitis (VM). We used a meta-analysis to study the role of intraventricular (IVT) antibiotic administration as an adjunct (IVT plus intravenous [IV]) to the classic intravenous antimicrobial therapy (IV-only) in the management of VM in terms of infection control, functional outcome, microbial eradication, complications, cost-benefit analysis, infectious mortality, and overall mortality.
   METHODS: The electronic search focused on adult neurosurgical cases complicated by gram-negative VM and was limited to studies comparing IVT plus IV and IV-only. The quality of the overall body of evidence was assessed according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). The pooled estimates for each question were summarized as odds ratios (ORs) and visualized using forest plots. Every outcome was stratified according to carbapenem resistance.
   RESULTS: Eleven studies with 348 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. No evidence was found for infection control, functional outcome, or complications. For the remaining items evaluated, the overall quality of the best available evidence was low. IVT plus IV treatment was statistically superior to IV-only therapy in eradication (OR, 10.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-38.65), infectious mortality (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.03-0.36), and overall mortality (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.60) in the management of carbapenem-resistant pathogens only.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined IVT plus IV treatment did not prove superior to standard IV-only treatment in the management of VM. Nevertheless, weak evidence showed that IVT treatment might serve as an adjunct in the management of carbapenem-resistant pathogens.

AB BACKGROUND: A recent trend has occurred of increased awareness and an emphasis for teaching nontechnical skills (NTSs) in the world of surgery. Although neurosurgery has incorporated simulation-based training as a part of the training curriculum in the United Kingdom, it has yet to formally introduce NTS training. The present study, therefore, queried both neurosurgical trainees and tutors regarding how much they valued NTSs and their development.
   METHODS: We performed a questionnaire-based, mixed-methods study to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of both neurosurgical trainees and tutors regarding NTSs across neurosurgical centers in the United Kingdom in 2015.
   RESULTS: The trainees valued NTSs and their development more than did their tutor counterparts (P < 0.05, z-testing). This was evident from both the quantitative results and the qualitative data gained from the questionnaire Various areas for potential improvement of the curriculum were also identified.
   CONCLUSION: The results of the present study highlight importance of NTS development in neurosurgery. These results could act as a good starting point for further larger scale similar studies and discussion on curriculum committees.

ID BREAST MASSES; RISK-FACTORS; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Shape and density of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are associated with a higher risk of poor treatment outcome. However, methods of assessment for the features are still inconclusive. Therefore, we decided to measure ICH shape irregularity using shape factors to achieve objective results.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 48 patients with spontaneous ICH confirmed by head computed tomography (CT) scan. We obtained detailed medical history and blood test results from medical records. On admission patients were assessed using Glasgow Coma Scale score, and on discharge patients were assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. GOS score of less than 3 was defined as poor outcome. For each slice of CT scan with visible ICH, we extracted its contour and calculated the fractal dimension (FD), compactness (C), and Fourier factor (FF). We also calculated the circle factor (CF), which was defined as the contour perimeter/perimeter of the biggest circle that can be inscribed into the contour, and density heterogeneity, defined as the variance of pixel density.
   RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (58.33%) had poor treatment outcome. Those patients had significantly higher C (0.71 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.09; P < 0.01), FD (1.42 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.27 +/- 1 0.09; P < 0.01), and CF (3.591 +/- 0.92 vs. 2.631 +/- 0.63; P < 0.01). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FD (odds ratio, 4.176; 95% confidence interval, 1.551-15.577; P = 0.012) remained independently associated with higher risk of poor treatment outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Each of the shape descriptors, except FF, was associated with treatment outcome after ICH. FD can be used as an independent predictor of outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on clinical outcomes in patients with low grade glioma (LGG).
   METHODS: In a retrospective propensity-matched cohort study, we compared patients with LGG based on whether they underwent fMRI as part of preoperative assessment. Twelve patients with LGG who underwent preoperative fMRI were selected, and a contemporaneous group of 12 control patients with LGG who did not undergo fMRI were matched to the fMRI group based on age, sex, and 1p/19q status.
   RESULTS: fMRI group subjects tended to have more aggressive surgeries (67% resection, 33% biopsy) than the control group (33% resection, 67% biopsy). There were no significant differences in outcomes between the 2 groups. Time between clinical assessment and surgery tended to be longer in the fMRI group (6.3 +/- 4.2 weeks) than in the control group (2.7 +/- 2.2 weeks). Extent of resection was similar between the 2 cohorts. fMRI group subjects had lower preoperative functional status and tended to have a greater postoperative functional status improvement than control group subjects. Mean survival was not significantly different (fMRI group 5-year survival: 88.9%, control group 5-year survival: 61.1%).
   CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the impact of preoperative fMRI in patients with LGG in this propensity-matched cohort study. This study has not demonstrated any significant difference in outcomes between the fMRI and control groups; however, there were nonsignificant trends for patients who underwent fMRI to undergo more aggressive surgical interventions and have a greater postoperative functional status improvement.

AB OBJECTIVE: In deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, acute high blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. To minimize pain and hypertensive conditions, sufficient local anesthesia is mandatory. We evaluated whether local instillation of anesthetics (LA) or a scalp block (SB) is superior concerning intraoperative hemodynamics and analgesia.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative cardiovascular parameters and perioperative medication in 47 patients (LA = 29, SB = 18) undergoing DBS surgery. Primary study end points were intraoperative systolic BP and heart rate. Secondary end points were use of intraoperative antihypertensives and perioperative analgesics.
   RESULTS: Patients who had SB showed lower mean systolic BP and heart rate compared with patients who had LA. Patients who had LA required more antihypertensive medication to stabilize BP. BP was higher, particularly during the first 90 minutes of surgery, in patients who had LA. Thereafter, more antihypertensives were necessary to achieve sufficient BP control in the LA group. The dose of analgesics did not differ significantly between both groups during and after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SB might be superior to LA for DBS surgery with respect to BP control and hemodynamics. The need for analgesics does not differ substantially between both anesthetic treatment options.

ID ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL APPROACH; TRANSCRANIAL APPROACH; OUTCOMES; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Although there are several surgical approaches for the treatment of tuberculum sellae (TS) meningiomas, clear indications for non-large TS meningiomas are still lacking.
   METHODS: Our case series included 20 patients with TS meningiomas (<3 cm). We classified the tumors into 3 groups based on their radiologic relationship with the optic chiasm: type I, tumor with intact optic chiasm; type II, tumor with superiorly deviated optic chiasm; and type III, tumor with posteriorly deviated optic chiasm. Clinical outcomes, radiologic findings, and surgical approaches for the removal of each tumor type were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Resections using a pterional approach, interhemispheric approach, and an endoscopic endonasal approach were performed in three groups of 6, 7, and 7 patients. The rate of total tumor resection was equivalent across approaches, whereas postoperative visual dysfunction was observed in 1 patient (7.69%) undergoing a transcranial approach. Our evaluation of the sphenoid sinus shape across radiographs revealed that the patterns of bony wall elongation attached to these tumors significantly differed among tumor types, indicating that tumor origin and growth direction might affect the patterns of optic chiasm deviation. In addition, selective elongation of the TS provided a favorable surgical corridor for an endoscopic endonasal approach, especially in type II tumors. These results indicate that this tumor classification influenced surgical approach selection for non-large TS meningiomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: The aim of surgery is maximal tumor resection without causing visual dysfunction. The classification proposed here may predict surgical risk associated with meningioma resection and further inform the selection of a surgical approach.

   DEATH; MANAGEMENT; PHASE
AB OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a well-accepted treatment option instead of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in cases of obstructive hydrocephalus. A sufficient flow from the ventricles to the basal cisterns requires perforation of the arachnoid membranes in the retroclival region. This point is critical to achieve an optimal outcome. The complex arachnoid relations were investigated in the retroclival region from the viewpoint of ETV, and anatomic landmarks were defined for subarachnoid dissections.
   METHODS: Sixty fresh human cadaveric specimens were dissected under macroscopic, microscopic, and endoscopic control. The recordings of 100 operated cases of ETVs were analyzed to ascertain the clinical-anatomic relevance.
   RESULTS: The Liliequist membrane complex and the anterior pontine membranes are located just above and parallel to both sides of the basilar artery. The basal attachment of these membranes forms an inverted U-shaped, white-grey thickening on the outer arachnoid. We refer to this structure as the clival line. During ETV, if arachnoid dissections were performed ventrally to the clival line, the outer arachnoid was opened; this resulted in a limited flow to the subarachnoid spaces (ventriculosubdural). If the perforation on the arachnoid membranes was dorsal to the clival line, the prepontine cistern could be directly reached through the Liliequist membrane complex.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient arachnoid dissection is essential for a successful ETV. The clival line is an important landmark that helps to perform the subarachnoid dissections correctly and achieve an undisrupted cerebral spinal fluid flow between the ventricles and the basal cisterns.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce our technique and results of retropleural/peritoneal lateral pediculectomy for the decompression of thoracolumbar fractures and reconstruction using an expandable titanium cage and circumferential fixation at a single stage.
   METHODS: Eighteen patients who had single unstable, burst thoracolumbar fracture were treated by this technique between January 2014 and December 2016 (T12: n = 9, L1: n = 7, L2: n = 2). They were reviewed retrospectively in terms of radiologic outcomes (computed tomography [CT] scan and radiograph), clinical outcomes, and complications. The results were compared with another cohort of thoracolumbar fractures treated by posterior-only surgery.
   RESULTS: There were no radiologic complications implying pseudoarthrosis or instrument failure on the postoperative 6-month CT scan. There was also no neurologic deterioration or infection during the same period. Two patients (11.1%) of iatrogenic injury and 1 patient of trauma-related injury of the dura were secured without any delayed complications. Three patients (16.7%) with transient weakness in left hip flexion immediately after operation were observed and recovered within 2 weeks in all cases. Six patients (33.3%) complained of dysesthesia and/or hypoesthesia on the incision site.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we suggest lateral pediculectomy as a distinct anatomic landmark to access and remove bony fragments effectively and safely in unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. This provides a more straightforward access to the burst fragment and helps the surgeon to make better intraoperative decompression strategies. Moreover, this circumferential instrumentation with anterior support and fusion revealed better restoration of the thoracolumbar spine alignment compared with posterior-only surgery, with acceptable complications rates.

DT Article
DE Brain abscess; Infection; Secondary brain abscess
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral abscesses after brain surgery are rare but severe and life-threatening complications. We sought to analyze the clinical aspects of those patients and thereby reveal risk factors and the relevant aspects for their future therapy.
   METHODS: We identified 44 patients (23 male, 21 female) undergoing surgery or frameless stereotactic drainage at our center from March 2009 to January 2018. We conducted 12,101 cranial surgeries during that time.
   RESULTS: The mean age was 55 years (range 21-82 years). The median duration between brain surgery and the after brain abscess was 1.5 months (range 1-23 months). Previous brain surgeries were emergency procedures in 27% of the cases. The frequency of surgery type was as follows: tumor resection (61%), craniotomy for traumatic brain injury (16%), aneurysm surgery (7%), biopsies (5%), hemicraniectomy after malignant cerebral infarction (5%), and other. We performed 1.3 surgeries per patient followed by antibiotic treatment for 4 weeks (= median) according to the respective germ spectrum. The germ entity was successfully identified in 39 patients (89%). In 18 cases (41%), we identified Staphylococcus aureus. In total, 20.5% of the patients died during the follow-up period. The mortality rate for patients with isolated bacteria was 18% compared with 40% for patients without isolation of specific microorganisms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Secondary brain abscess is a rare complication and occurs mainly in patients with tumors and patients receiving emergency surgery. In total, 41% of the patients suffered from a S. aureus infection. Isolation of the responsible microorganisms is often possible and leads to improved outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to compare the accuracy and safety of TiRobot system-assisted with those of fluoroscopy-assisted cortical bone trajectory screw placement in lumbar spinal surgery.
   METHODS: We included 58 patients who required instrumentation in a retrospective matched-cohort study. The primary outcome measures were the accuracy of screw placement using the modified Gertzbein-Robbins scale and the incidence of proximal facet joint violation. Secondary outcome measures included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, radiation exposure, and complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 231 screws were placed (TiRobot group [RG], 86 screws; fluoroscopy group [FG], 145 screws). In the RG, 87.2% of the screws had perfect positions (grade A). The remaining screws were grade B (8.1%) and C (4.7%). In the FG, 66.9% of the screws had perfect positions (grade A). The remaining screws were grade B (20.0%), C (9.0%), and D (4.1%). The proportion of clinically acceptable screws (grade A or B) was greater in the RG than in the FG. In the RG, the most common direction of screw deviation was cephalad endplate and was the vertebral cortex in FG. No difference was found in facet joint violation between the 2 groups. The operative time and blood loss were slightly greater in the RG than in the FG. No statistically significant difference was found in the postoperative hospital stay between the 2 groups. The mean cumulative radiation time was greater for the RG than for the FG, but the radiation exposure to the surgeon was significantly lower in the RG than in the FG.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted screw placement is more accurate and safe compared with fluoroscopy-assisted placement for lumbar spinal cortical bone trajectory instrumentation.

DT Review
DE Football; Neuroimaging; Radiology; Sport-related concussion
ID CONCUSSION; HISTORY; MEMORY; ASSOCIATION; INTEGRITY
AB BACKGROUND: Lasting neuroimaging changes after participation in American football are an increasing public health concern. The clinical relevance of imaging findings remains unknown.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed with the following inclusion criteria: football players, brain imaging >= 2 years from previous concussion or retirement, and sample size >= 5. Studies were assessed for 1) methodology (control selection, type I error, and recall bias), 2) imaging outcomes, and 3) number of significant statistical comparisons.
   RESULTS: Sixteen studies (all cross-sectional studies) met the inclusion criteria. Highest level of play included high school (n = 1), college (n = 3), and professional (n = 12). Thirteen of the 16 studies made a total 456 comparisons of brain activity, of which 171 were statistically significant (38%). Nine of 16 studies (56%) had appropriate controls, and 5 of 16 studies (31%) appropriately accounted for type I error. To obtain player concussion history, all studies (16/ 16) had recall bias or unclear methodology. Imaging outcome measures included structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (29.2%), diffusion tensor imaging (25%), radioactive tracer uptake on positron emission tomography (16.7%), patterns of connectivity on functional MRI (fMRI) (12.5%), transcranial magnetic stimulation (8.3%), arterial spin labeling MRI (4.2%), and metabolic changes on H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (4.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Long-term neuroimaging findings in American football players are heterogeneous in both methodology and findings. Understanding the clinical importance of statistically significant findings is complicated by methodological limitations and study design. Further research is required to correlate imaging findings with clinical outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Schwannoma comprises approximately 25% of all spinal tumors, but there is little information published in the literature regarding this subject. Our aim in this study was to discuss diagnostic and prognostic factors for spinal schwannoma.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to analyze the clinical and immunohistochemical data of patients with spinal schwannoma surgically treated in our center between 2005 and 2013.
   RESULTS: A total of 524 patients with spinal schwannoma were included in the study. The mean follow-up period was 58.3 months. Forty-eight patients developed recurrence, and 26 died. Findings from the statistical analyses suggested duration of preoperative symptoms, Sridhar classification, tumor size, bone damage, Ki67 labeling index, and S100 expression were different between benign schwannoma and the malignant subtype. Recurrence was associated with resection mode, segments of involvement, pathology grade, CD57 expression, Ki67 labeling index, and 5100 expression. The overall survival was closely related with recurrence, location in sacrum, pathology grade, Ki67 labeling index, and P53 expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the benign subtype, malignant schwannoma has a shorter duration of preoperative symptoms, larger tumor size, greater Sridhar classification, and poorer prognosis. Total resection can significantly reduce recurrence but not guarantee a better survival, which is associated location and pathology grade. A Ki67 labeling index >5% was not only an index for malignant subtype but also a prognostic indicator for recurrence and poor survival. Moreover, S100-negative was a prognostic indicator for recurrence, whereas P53-positive was associated with a poor prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between blood-brain barrier disruption and transient neurologic deficits (TNDs) after neuroendovascular interventions (NEIs) using postcontrast T2/FLAIR (pcFLAIR) imaging.
   METHODS: This is a prospective study of 41 consecutive patients undergoing flow diversion therapy for unruptured aneurysm treatment. Patients underwent postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours of the procedure, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and pcFLAIR sequences. Regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for developing TNDs.
   RESULTS: In total, 13 patients (31.7%) developed neurologic complications ranging from visual field defects to dense hemiplegia. All deficits were transient, resolving spontaneously within 72 hours. Five of 13 patients (38.5%) with TNDs had presence of lesions on DWI whereas the remaining 8 patients (61.5%) did not. In contrast, all patients who developed TNDs had leptomeningeal enhancement on pcFLAIR imaging, and no patient with normal pcFLAIR imaging developed TNDs. Regression analysis revealed the extent of pcFLAIR enhancement is associated with development of postprocedure neurologic deficits (P < 0.0001). Video electroencephalography monitoring was performed in 4 symptomatic patients manifesting severe deficits. In all instances electroencephalography demonstrated ipsilateral hemispheric slowing and eventual resolution corresponding to ensuing clinical improvement Only 1 of these 4 patients presented with a lesion on DWI.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study challenges conventional dogma that TNDs are ischemic in etiology and suggests blood-brain barrier impairment may be a potential alternative mechanism. These findings are applicable to stroke and other reversible neurologic diseases.

AB BACKGROUND: Use of short-segment or long-segment fusion is controversial in treatment of adult lumbar degenerative scoliosis (ALDS). The aim of this study was to explore efficacy and feasibility of precision treatment of ALDS with selective nerve root block.
   METHODS: From January 2014 to January 2016, a retrospective study of 23 patients with ALDS treated with precision short-segment surgery with at least 2-year follow-up was performed. Fixation segment was determined by selective nerve root block. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up. Radiographic measurements included Cobb angle of lumbar curve, lumbar lordosis, sacrum slope, and pelvic tilt. Radiographic evaluation of fusion integrity was performed based on Bridwell interbody fusion grading system at final follow-up.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 25.2 +/- 1.4 months. Average lumbar curve was 21.6 degrees +/- 7.4 degrees preoperatively and 11.2 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees at final follow-up (P < 0.01), with correction rate of 48.1%. Lumbar lordosis changed from -37.1 degrees +/- 12.9 degrees to -42.1 degrees +/- 10.5 degrees at final follow-up (P< 0.01). Mean visual analog scale back pain scores decreased from 6.0 +/- 1.8 preoperatively to 1.5 +/- 0.8 at final follow-up (P < 0.01), and mean visual analog scale leg pain scores decreased from 8.1 +/- 0.6 preoperatively to 1.3 +/- 1.3 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). Oswestry Disability Index score improved from 60.9% +/- 15.7% preoperatively to 22.1% +/- 11.6% at final follow-up (P < 0.01). All patients achieved grade I fusion at final evaluation. One patient (4%) needed further surgical intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Precision treatment of ALDS with selective nerve root block can achieve favorable clinical outcomes and good fusion with less surgical injury and low complications. Deformity correction is limited, which requires further study.

AB OBJECTIVE: Using three-dimensional (3D) printing to create individualized patient models of the skull base, the optic chiasm and facial nerve can be previsualized to help identify and protect these structures during tumor removal surgery.
   METHODS: Preoperative imaging data for 2 cases of sellar tumor and 1 case of acoustic neuroma were obtained. Based on these data, the cranial nerves were visualized using 3D T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence and diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking. Mimics software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the skull base regions surrounding the tumors, and 3D solid models were printed for use in simulation of the basic surgical steps.
   RESULTS: The 3D printed personalized skull base tumor solid models contained information regarding the skull, brain tissue, blood vessels, cranial nerves, tumors, and other associated structures. The sphenoid sinus anatomy, saddle area, and cerebellopontine angle region could be visually displayed, and the spatial relationship between the tumor and the cranial nerves and important blood vessels was clearly defined. The models allowed for simulation of the operation, prediction of operative details, and verification of accuracy of cranial nerve reconstruction during the operation. Questionnaire assessment showed that neurosurgeons highly valued the accuracy and usefulness of these skull base tumor models.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D printed models of skull base tumors and nearby cranial nerves, by allowing for the surgical procedure to be simulated beforehand, facilitate preoperative planning and help prevent cranial nerve injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: The A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) trial has received fierce criticism, including considerable selection bias, poor generalizability, questionable clinical practices (only 15.8% underwent surgical resection, the gold standard for arteriovenous malformation [AVM] treatment), and short follow-up (33 months) for a disease process that carries a life-long risk. In this study, we sought to present our own experience treating unruptured brain AVMs to provide supporting evidence of the ARUBA trial criticism.
   METHODS: All cases of treated brain AVMs from 2004 to 2017 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed and included in the analysis if they met ARUBA trial inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was symptomatic stroke or death. Secondary outcomes included AVM obliteration, long-term clinical impairment (modified Rankin Scale score >1), and new major or minor postoperative deficit.
   RESULTS: Of the 245 reviewed cases, 86 met the ARUBA trial criteria. Treatment included microsurgical resection alone (2.3%), preoperative embolization followed by microsurgical resection (62.8%), stereotactic radiosurgery alone (10.5%), embolization followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (15.1%), and embolization alone (9.3%). The primary outcome was met in 8.3%, new perioperative major and minor complications occurred in 5.8% and 12.8%, and long-term clinical impairment in 4.5%. AVM obliteration was observed in 92.4% overall and in 100% of patients who underwent surgical resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The criticism of the ARUBA trial is warranted, as our study found that treatment of unruptured brain AVMs has an acceptable safety profile when approached in a multidisciplinary manner at an experienced institution, using surgical resection as the primary treatment modality when applicable.

ID OCCLUSION; STENOSIS; SAFETY
AB OBJECTIVE: Proper treatment for chronic occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) has not been determined. Endovascular recanalization may cause arterial injury and distal embolism. Hybrid recanalization for chronic occluded ICA was performed, and its safety and effectiveness were estimated.
   METHODS: From March 2011 to March 2017, 21 patients were treated by hybrid recanalization with >1 year of follow-up. The ICA was totally occluded from the cervical segment to the cavernous, ophthalmic, or supraclinoid segment. Clinical characteristics, treatment strategy, recanalization rate, and main adverse events were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Initial recanalization was achieved in 15 patients (71.4%). Successful revascularization was more likely if the ICA was occluded with the plaque at the carotid bifurcation and the thrombus anterograde to the cavernous segment. There was no carotid dissection or intracranial hemorrhage. There were no new post-procedural neurologic deficits. Among 14 patients who underwent successful recanalization with follow-up, 1 patient had a repeat occlusion and another experienced about 50% restenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid recanalization by carotid endarterectomy and arterial angioplasty is a safe treatment method for chronic totally occluded ICA. Recanalization was more likely to be successful if the ICA was occluded by the plaque at the carotid bifurcation with the thrombus anterograde to the cavernous segment than if the artery was occluded by the plaque at the ophthalmic or supraclinoid segment with the thrombus retrograde to the cervical segment.

ID COMPLICATIONS; SPINE; INJURY
AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize the learning curve for a single surgeon during his initial phases of performing minimally invasive surgery oblique lumbar interbody fusion.
   METHODS: This was a prospective analysis of 49 consecutive patients who underwent a single-level minimally invasive surgery oblique lumbar interbody fusion performed by a single surgeon. Patients were divided into group A (first 24 patients) and group B (25 patients after initial 24 patients). The following data were compared between the 2 groups: surgical time, estimated blood loss, radiograph exposure time, clinical and radiographic results, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. The learning curve was assessed using a logarithmic curve-fit regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Average operative time was significantly longer in group A compared with group B. Compared with group B, group A had significantly more x-ray exposure time. Perioperative complications included thigh numbness and pain in 8 cases, psoas and quadriceps weakness in 3 cases, sympathetic nerve injury in 2 cases, and paralytic ileus in 1 case. All complications were transient and resolved within 3 months. The incidence of complications was 37.5% in group A and 20.0% in group B. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were basically identical in the 2 groups at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery oblique lumbar interbody fusion presents a learning curve to the practicing spine surgeon with regard to operative time, x-ray exposure time, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Close attention to detail can minimize complications that may be associated with the learning curve.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of patients with lumbar disc herniation with bi-radicular symptoms undergoing percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF).
   METHODS: From January 2008 to January 2016, 89 consecutive patients with lumbar disc herniation with biradicular symptoms were treated with PELD or MIS-TLIF. The data were collected prospectively for analysis including clinical and radiographic results after revision surgery and complications.
   RESULTS: During the follow-up period, the postoperative data between the 2 treatment groups showed no significant difference in the mean total postoperative visual analog score for leg pain and the Japanese Orthopedic Association and Oswestry disability index scores. In the MIS-TLIF group, the recovery rate and satisfaction rate were higher than those in the PELD group, and the difference was statistically significant. The only postoperative factor that was significantly different was postoperative back pain, which was lower in the MIS-TILF group. The other significant differences between the 2 treatment groups were associated with the complications such as intervertebral infection and adjacent segment disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both PELD and MIS-TLIF, as treatments for lumbar disc herniation with biradicular symptoms, showed favorable clinical outcomes. Compared with MIS-TLIF, PELD had the following advantages: 1) it is performed under local anesthesia and 2) there is rare possibility of "fusion disease," such as ASD. However, the PELD is also revealed several problems, including a relatively lower success rate and satisfaction, a relative higher rate of postoperative long-term chronic low back pain and the possibility of recurrence, despite the low incidence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To observe coronal imaging changes associated with recollapse of injured vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic thoracolumbar fracture (OTLF).
   METHODS: Fifty-four cases were retrospectively divided into 2 groups according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) classification of thoracolumbar fracture: group A, type A1 fracture (n = 26); group B, type A3.1 fracture (n = 28). Visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, local scoliotic Cobb angle, and coronal wedge angle of the injured vertebrae were observed preoperatively, on postoperative day 3, and at final follow-up.
   RESULTS: The average follow-up time was 19.17 +/- 6.30 months. At final follow-up, the visual analog scale score and the Oswestry Disability Index score were significantly greater in group B than in group A (both P < 0.05). At final follow-up, loss of correction of scoliotic Cobb angle and coronal wedge angle was significantly higher in group B than in group A (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty was effective in both type A1 and type A3.1 OTLF. However, coronal imaging changes after percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty were more obvious in type A3.1 OTLF than in type A1. Moreover, clinical outcomes in type A3.1 OTLF were slightly inferior to those in type A1.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical benefits of emergent single burr hole evacuation technology in traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) with cerebral herniation cases.
   METHODS: We conducted a review comparing patients with ASDH with cerebral herniation who underwent single burr hole evacuation followed by decompressive craniectomy and intracranial hematoma removal surgery (n = 45, group A) and those who underwent decompressive craniectomy and intracranial hematoma removal surgery after rapid infusion of mannitol 250 mL (n = 53, group B) in our institution. Pre- and postoperative assessments included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), activities of daily living (ADLs), and common complication incidences.
   RESULTS: At 1 and 6 months after operation, the median GCS score of group A was significantly higher than group B (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively). After 6 months, the GOS score and ADLs between the 2 groups had significant differences (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the 2 groups in the common complication incidences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Emergent single burr hole evacuation in combination with decompressive craniectomy surgery is a useful treatment for ASDH with cerebral herniation, which can achieve reduction of intracranial pressure as soon as possible and improve the prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) was added to grade III glial tumors as a distinct entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system. We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed 55 pathologically confirmed PXA cases according to the newest WHO classification to better clarify the clinical, molecular, and prognostic features of this rare neoplasm.
   METHODS: In total, 55 pathologically confirmed PXA cases according to the newest WHO classification were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. After sequencing for BRAF, TERT, IDH1/2, and H3F3A, survival analysis was performed to determine the factors affecting survival.
   RESULTS: The patients with BRAF V600E mutations were generally younger than those without it, although not statistically significant (27.9 +/- 15.4 years and 37.1 +/- 17.0 years, respectively, P = 0.054). TERT promoter mutation frequency in PXA was lower than in patients with anaplastic PXA although not statistically significant (4.4% and 28.6%, P = 0.083). One instance of PXA with IDH2 mutation, and no IDH1 and H3F3A mutations were found. In terms of prognosis, patients with anaplastic PXA had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with patients with PXA. The subgroup with gross total resection had a longer median OS (not reached vs. 60.0 months, P = 0.0221) and PFS (not reached vs. 60.0 months, P = 0.0232) compared with patients with PXA with subtotal resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The identification of BRAF V600E, TERT, and IDH2 mutations in PXA expands our molecular understanding of PXA. Patients with PXA with gross total resection achieve good outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Use of Surpass flow diverter (FD) device in the treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysm has not been well studied and reported in the literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were treated by Surpass FD placement at our hospital between June 2016 and March 2018. Detailed analysis of medical records was performed to obtain patient age, gender, clinical history, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, results of radiographic and procedural details including technical success and complication, clinical outcome, and follow-up angiographic results.
   RESULTS: Our search identified 16 patients with 16 aneurysms who were treated with Surpass FD, of which 13 aneurysms (81%) were in the anterior circulation and 3 (19%) were in the posterior circulation. Aneurysm size ranged from 1.1 to 16 mm, with a mean of 4 mm. The mean delay between subarachnoid hemorrhage and endovascular treatment was 5 days (range, 3-20 days). Only 1 Surpass FD was used in each patient, ranging in size from 3 x 25 mm to 4 x 50 mm. Fifteen patients (94%) achieved favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1) at 3 months. One patient died of invasive fungal infection. Angiographic follow-up results were assessed by O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale in 15 surviving patients and showed a grade D result (no filling) in 13/15 aneurysms (87%) at 3 and 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: A Surpass FD device is a feasible option for the treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms that are difficult to treat by conventional clipping and coiling; however, larger and comparative studies with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy.

AB BACKGROUND: Sex has been known to significantly affect postoperative complications and length of stay after elective anterior cervical fusions. Current evidence on lumbar spine surgery is limited.
   METHODS: The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes 22612, 22630, and 22633 to identify patients undergoing posterior lumbar fusions. A total of 23,615 patients were included in the final cohort.
   RESULTS: Out of 23,615 patients, 10,810 (45.8%) were men and 12,805 (54.2%) were women. After controlling for demographic, comorbidities-specific, preoperative, and operative differences between the 2 groups, female sex was found to be an independent risk factor significantly associated with a length of stay longer than 3 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.51; P < 0.001), occurrence of any complication within 30 days (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.47; P < 0.001), wound complications (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.74; P < 0.001), urinary tract infections (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.79-2.83; P < 0.001), 30-day reoperations (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; P = 0.025), 30-day readmissions (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.31; P = 0.015), and nonhome discharge (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.69-1.98; P < 0.001). Interestingly, the only adverse outcome associated with male sex was renal complication (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.43-3.65; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to literature on cervical fusions, we found that female sex was independently tied to an increased risk of adverse outcomes after elective posterior lumbar fusion. The results from the study suggest that women may benefit from close surveillance during the postoperative period to minimize risk of complications and subsequent resource utilization in this group.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study provides a systematic review anti meta-analysis of psychiatric disorders caused by craniopharyngiomas and the hypothalamic alterations underlying these symptoms.
   METHODS: We investigated a collection of 210 craniopharyngiomas reported from 1823 to 2017 providing detailed clinical and pathologic information about psychiatric disturbances, including 10 of our own series, and compared the hypothalamic damage in this cohort with the present in a control cohort of 105 cases without psychiatric symptoms.
   RESULTS: Psychiatric disorders occurred predominantly in patients with craniopharyngiomas developing primarily at the infundibulotuberal region (45%) or entirely within the third ventricle (30%), mostly affecting adult patients (61%; P < 0.001). Most tumors without psychic symptoms developed beneath the third ventricle floor (53.5%; P < 0.001), in young patients (57%; P < 0.001). Psychiatric disturbances were classified in 6 major categories: 1) Korsakoff-like memory deficits, 66%; 2) behavior/personality changes, 48.5%; 3) impaired emotional expression/control, 42%; 4) cognitive impairments, 40%; 5) mood alterations, 32%; and 6) psychotic symptoms, 22%. None of these categories was associated with hydrocephalus. Severe memory deficits occurred with damage of the mammillary bodies (P < 0.001). Mood disorders occurred with compression/invasion of the third ventricle floor and/or walls (P < 0.012). Coexistence of other hypothalamic symptoms such as temperature/metabolic dysregulation or sleepiness favored the emergence of psychotic disorders (P < 0.008). Postoperative psychiatric outcome was better in strictly intraventricular craniopharyngiomas than in other topographies (P < 0.001). A multivariate model including the hypothalamic structures involved, age, hydrocephalus, and hypothalamic symptoms predicts the appearance of psychiatric disorders in 81% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniopharyngiomas primarily involving the hypothalamus represent a neurobiological model of psychiatric and behavioral disorders.

DT Article
DE 3-Dimensional imaging; Anatomy; Brain; Endoscopy; Lateral ventricles;
   Sella turcica; Skull base
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional images have become an important tool in understanding surgical anatomy. This paper describes a simple method for obtaining endoscopic 3-dimensional anatomic images for teaching purposes.
   METHODS: This method uses a single endoscope that provides regular, two-dimensional images. Obtaining the three-dimensional image requires the superposition of two similar hut slightly different images of the same object. The set of images, one mimicking the view of the left eye and the other mimicking the view of the right eye, constitute the stereoscopic pair of images obtained with the endoscope. To construct 3-dimensional images, the distance between the pictures must approximate the interpupillary distance.
   RESULTS: The technique involves fixing the endoscope in position using a self-retracting arm and placing the specimen on a simple sliding tray with an adapted millimeter scale to control the distance between the pictures. The initial still image is captured and the tray on which the specimen sits is shifted up to 3-4 mm laterally to capture the second image. As a general rule, one can calculate the distance between the pictures by moving the specimen laterally 1/30 of the distance between the lens and the object. Images captured are processed using anaglyphic technique for printing and horizontal-vertical polarization of light for presentation to larger audiences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Images produced in this way may aid in the understanding of the depth of different structures and ease of learning curve for the use of the endoscopy in neurosurgery.

ID EXTRACRANIAL-INTRACRANIAL BYPASS; MODEL; ANEURYSMS; SURGERY; DISEASE;
   REVASCULARIZATION; TURKEY
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular anastomosis is an essential procedure in neurosurgery, but the opportunity to perform the surgery has gradually decreased for neurosurgeons. Therefore, training is necessary for obtaining and maintaining the skills required for the procedure. We describe the detailed anatomy of cervical and femoral regions in rats and discuss the advantages for practicing microvascular anastomosis.
   METHODS: Cervical regions of Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected under intraperitoneal anesthesia. The stepby-step anatomic description was documented using a high-resolution charge-coupled device image sensor and recording systems. Using this model, temporal occlusion time and patency were measured, and these measures were compared between the trainee and trainer groups. The number of times the training needs to be completed to attain competency in the bypass procedure was estimated.
   RESULTS: After exposing the carotid triangle, a half-ring was created by end-to-side anastomosis. Anastomosis was performed at the common carotid artery using the contralateral side of the carotid artery as a graft. The cutoff value for the temporal occlusion time was 79.3 minutes in the receiver operating characteristic curve based on a target temporal occlusion time for beginners determined during the training.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using a living animal model, a trainee has the opportunity to learn not only anastomotic techniques but also hemostatic control as well as overcoming mental strain during surgery. Living animal models are important in training because the fidelity of a living animal model is superior to nonliving models.

AB BACKGROUND: Subcortical motor mapping is crucial to ensure preservation of motor tracts during resections of tumors. Continuous dynamic mapping using a modified monopolar suction probe is a novel and effective way of achieving this goal. We describe our experience using this technique.
   METHODS: Forty patients were operated on between June 2017 and February 2018. Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) and direct cortical strip (DCS) motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were monitored. Subcortical stimulation (SCS) mapping was attempted in all cases by adapting the technique using a monopolar suction stimulator. Neurologic outcomes and extent of resection were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Motor fibers were between 0 and 7.6 mm away from the tumor boundaries in 26 patients. TES MEP were monitored in all patients. DCS MEPs were attempted in 31 and successfully monitored in 26 patients. SCS using the monopolar suction probe worked in all patients except one. SCS elicited no responses at 15-mA motor thresholds in 16 patients. The motor threshold ranged from 3 to 10 mA in the remainder. Overall, MEP changes were noted in 5 patients. Ten patients experienced neurologic worsening (6 transient, 3 prolonged, and 1 delayed). There was no permanent deficit at 3 months. DCS MEPs predicted neurologic worsening better than did TES MEPs. Radical resections were achieved in 68%. Neuromonitoring inputs resulted in premature termination of resection in 14 patients (35%). Radical resections (near-total resections) were still achieved in 8 of the 14 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Continuous dynamic subcortical mapping is a reliable method to map the motor tracts. This process is crucial to correctly identify truly eloquent tumors and tailor the surgical procedure as per planned goals, maximizing the resections with acceptable morbidity.

AB OBJECTIVE: Visual field (VF) outcomes are commonly reported in neurosurgical case series; however, substantial variability can exist in VF testing and outcome reporting. We aimed to evaluate the challenges of VF testing and to develop detailed recommendations for VF outcome reporting by analyzing results from an ongoing, multicenter study of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.
   METHODS: VF testing results were collected during a prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluating patient outcomes after transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (TRANSSPHER). Two independent ophthalmologists reviewed reliability and outcomes of all VF studies. Preoperative and postoperative VF studies were evaluated individually and as preoperative/postoperative pairs.
   RESULTS: Suboptimal perimetry field settings were reported in 37% of VF studies. Automated reliability criteria flagged 25%-29% of VF studies as unreliable, whereas evaluation by 2 independent ophthalmologists flagged 16%-28%. Agreement between automated criteria and raters for VF reliability was inconsistent (K coefficients = 0.55-0.83), whereas agreement between the 2 raters was substantial to almost perfect (K coefficients = 0.78-0.83). Most patients demonstrated improvement after surgery (rater 1, 67%; rater 2, 60%), with substantial rater agreement on outcomes for paired examinations (K coefficient = 0.62).
   CONCLUSIONS: VF outcome studies demonstrated significant variability of test parameters and patient performance. Perimetry field settings varied among patients and for some patients varied preoperatively versus postoperatively. Reliance on automated criteria alone could not substitute for independent ophthalmologist review of test reliability. Standardized guidelines for VF data collection and reporting could increase reliability of results and allow better comparisons of outcomes in future studies.

TI Utility of Early Postoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging After
   Glioblastoma Resection: Implications on Patient Survival
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

ID ADJUVANT TEMOZOLOMIDE; RADIOTHERAPY; CONCOMITANT; SURGERY; EXTENT
AB BACKGROUND: The standard of care for glioblastoma is surgical resection followed by combination temozolomide and radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used preoperatively for tumor resection planning. In some instances, MRI is also obtained postoperatively to assess for any complications and to determine extent of resection. There is some question whether early routine postoperative imaging of patients after tumor resection is beneficial to long-term outcomes, especially with the increased scrutiny of increasing health care costs.
   METHODS: In this study we retrospectively analyze patients with glioblastoma treated at our institution, comparing the difference in overall survival and treatment regimens between patients who had early postoperative MRI versus patients who did not.
   RESULTS: We determine that in our cohort of 125 patients, those with early postoperative MRI had no statistically significant overall survival difference compared with patients with no early postoperative MRI (P = 0.996). The median survival for the group with postoperative MRI was 378 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 242-443 days), and the median survival for the group without postoperative MRI was 308 days (95% CI, 203-445 days). Early postoperative MRI also did not significantly alter therapeutic regimens.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although early postoperative MRI may not significantly affect patient overall survival from a statistical standpoint or therapeutic regimens, this type of imaging may be important to hone resident and attending skill. We encourage other institutions to perform similar analyses to determine the overall survival benefit of early postoperative imaging after glioma resection for patients with glioblastoma.

ID QUALITY
AB BACKGROUND: This analysis provides an overview of neurosurgery residency programs in Latin America; it evaluates strengths, weaknesses, and limitations within the Latin American Federation for Societies in Neurosurgery countries. Considering the shared cultural background between these neighboring countries and globalization of neurosurgical education, similarities in training characteristics and equal opportunities are expected. However, program differences are inevitable and should be investigated to promote collaboration and homogenization of training.
   METHODS: A 39-item survey was distributed to 970 neurosurgeons and residents in Latin America to assess aspects including working conditions, teaching, research, training, educational opportunities, and socioeconomics.
   RESULTS: In total, 276 neurosurgeons (28%) from 16 countries completed the survey. The average participant's age was 37 +/- 7 years, and the average duration of residency programs was 5 +/- 1 years. Trainees participated in around 5-10 cases during the typical 80-100 work hour week. Only 5% of survey respondents had a day off after a night shift, and 60% worked at least 3 night shifts per week. Only 34% had a mentorship program, Morbidity and mortality conferences were reported by 57% and research activities were compulsory in 45%. Satisfaction with evaluation methods was reported in 29%, although 96% reported satisfaction with their training programs overall.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to review neurosurgical training in Latin America's. Suggested areas of improvement include regulation of working hours, implementation of mentorship programs and standardized examinations, protected research time, increased support for conferences, and more opportunities for exchange rotations that will potentially bolster collaboration between programs.

AB BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effectiveness of recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMPs) in reducing the demand for opioids after surgery. We investigated the association between rhBMP use and the likelihood of achieving opioid independence and changes in opioid demand in the first postoperative year.
   METHODS: Using the Multi-Payer Claims Database from 2007 to 2010, patients aged >20 years who had undergone a degenerative disc disease-indicated lumbar fusion procedure and had >= 1 opioid prescription in the 3 months before surgery were identified. Propensity score matching (1:1) of rhBMP-exposed and rhBMP-unexposed patients was used to mitigate confounding. The outcomes of interest were opioid independence and decreases in opioid doses in morphine equivalent units, assessed at 3-6 and 9-12 months after the procedure. Logistic regression and analysis of covariance models were used.
   RESULTS: The data from 318 patients were analyzed. Most patients were women (61%) and aged <65 years (68%). Few had achieved opioid independence at 3-6 (n = 71; 22.3%) or 9-12 (a = 115; 36.2%) months post-operatively. During the 3-6-month window, the rhBMP group reduced their opioid use rates (estimated mean difference. -28.4 vs. -19.5; P = 0.69) and achieved opioid independence (21.4% vs. 23.3%; odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.56; P = 0.74) at rates that were statistically comparable to their matched comparators. Similar patterns were observed during the 9-12-month window.
   CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to suggest that rhBMP use during spinal fusion procedures is associated with either the discontinuation or decrease of opioid analgesic therapy. The continued opioid use after surgery warrants further clinical and research attention.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal human brain tumor, with the worst prognosis. The aberrant microenvironment, enhanced by the activation of proangiogenic mediators such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and their downstream effectors, sustain GBM malignancy. Proangiogenic signaling represents an attractive chemotherapeutic target. Recent evidence suggests a therapeutic benefit from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA) intake in reducing risk and cancer progression.
   METHODS: In the present study, human primary GBM- endothelial cells (ECs) were used to ascertain whether ASA could inhibit angiogenesis and improve cell sensitivity to drugs. The impact of ASA was observed by measuring cell viability, tube-like structure formation, migration, VEGF production, and proliferative, proangiogenic, and apoptotic modulators expression, such as HIF-1 alpha/VEGF/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/(VEGFR)-1/VEGFR-2, Ras/ mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling axis, and Bcl-2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ratio. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of ASA alone or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), bevacizumab (BEV), and sunitinib (SUN).
   RESULTS: Our data reported that ASA affected GBM-EC viability, tube-like structure formation, cell migration, and VEGF releasing in a dose-dependent manner and that combined treatments with TMZ, BEV, and SUN synergized to counteract proangiogenic cell ability. mRNA expression analysis displayed a marked effect of ASA in reducing VEGF, VEGFR-1, HIF-1 alpha, RAS, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, AICT, and BCL-2, as well a combined anticancer effect of ASA together with TMZ, BEV, and SUN. Levels of HIF-1 alpha, VEGFR-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and BCL-2 protein expression confirmed a positive trend.
   CONCLUSIONS: ASA and antiangiogenic therapies showed synergetic anticancer efficacy in human primary GBM-ECs. Thus, the combination of conventional chemotherapy with ASA may offer a new strategy to counteract tumor malignancy.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs) are challenging to treat given their close proximity to the brain stem, greater propensity for rupture, and greater rates of morbidity and mortality than other brain arteriovenous malformations. The present investigation sought to describe and characterize the features of these rare and unique lesions.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of CAVM cases treated at 2 tertiary medical centers was performed. Patients surgically treated at institution 1 from September 1999 to February 2013 and institution 2 from October 2008 to October 2015 were included.
   RESULTS: A total of 120 patients had been treated. Of the 120 patients, 85 (70.8%) had initially presented with hemorrhage, 45 (37.5%) of whom experienced hemorrhage requiring emergent surgery. A favorable neurological outcome was observed in 76 patients (63.3%; modified Rankin Scale score <3). The perioperative mortality was 2.5% (n = 3). The long-term mortality rate was 7.5% (n = 9). The mean follow-up time was 1.82 years. On average, the patients with large CAVMs (>= 3 cm; P <= 0.001), who had received embolization before surgery (P = 0.04), did not have an associated aneurysm (P <= 0.001), or had a residual CAVM after surgery (P = 0.008) were significantly younger. Female patients had fewer CAVMs with deep venous drainage (54.3% vs. 72.3%; P = 0.049), experienced decreased mortality (1.4% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.003), and were less likely to have worse neurological status after treatment (P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: CAVMs are rare lesions that exhibit unique disease characteristics. Although most patients will experience a favorable outcome, CAVMs frequently present with hemorrhage, result in high rates of morbidity and mortality, and characteristically differ depending on patient age and gender.

AB OBJECTIVE: Female sex is a well-known risk factor for aneurysm formation. Although the role of the ovaries and estrogen in aneurysm development has been supported, other organ-hormone pairs unique between sexes also may be implicated. In this study, we aimed to determine whether intracranial aneurysms microsurgically clipped in patients with previous hysterectomies exhibit any unique aneurysm characteristics from those without hysterectomies.
   METHODS: Solitary aneurysms microsurgically treated by the senior author (M.T.L.) were included from a database of patients treated between January 2010 and April 2013 at a tertiary academic medical center. Only female patients and patients equal or older in age to the youngest patient in the hysterectomy group were included in the control group. Patient and aneurysm characteristics were compared using the chi(2) test for categorical variables and the independent t test analysis for continuous variables.
   RESULTS: A total 233 patients were included in the study. Forty-three patients (19%) had undergone a previous hysterectomy; none had oophorectomies recorded. No difference in mean age (P = 0.89), hypertension (P = 0.38), alcohol use (P = 0.87), tobacco use (P = 0.22), or aneurysm location (P = 1) existed. However, patients in the hysterectomy group more often presented in a good neurologic condition before surgery (88% vs. 74%, P = 0.04) and had fewer large aneurysms (8% vs. 24%, P = 0.03). Also, fewer presented with a ruptured aneurysm (28%) then the nonhysterectomy group (51%) (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Female patients with a surgical history of a hysterectomy have a lower rate of large aneurysms, present in better neurologic condition, and are less likely to present with a ruptured aneurysm than females without a hysterectomy.

   ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; NEUROSURGICAL MANAGEMENT; RECURRENT ANEURYSMS;
   NATURAL-HISTORY; EMBOLIZATION; SAFETY; EFFICACY
AB BACKGROUND: Occasionally, previously coiled aneurysms will require secondary treatment with surgical clipping, representing a more complicated aneurysm to treat than the naive aneurysm. Patients who initially presented with a ruptured aneurysm may pose an even riskier group to treat than those with unruptured previously coiled aneurysms, given their potentially higher risk for rerupture. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes of patients who undergo microsurgical clipping of ruptured previously coiled cerebral aneurysms. In addition, we present a thorough review of the literature.
   METHODS: A total of 53 patients from a single institution who initially presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and underwent surgical clipping of a previously coiled aneurysm between December 1997 and December 2014 were studied. Clinical features, hospital course, and pre-operative and most recent functional status (Glasgow Outcome Scale score) were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The mean time interval from coiling to clipping was 2.6 years, and mean follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 0.1-14.7 years). Five patients (9.8%) presented with rebleed prior to clipping. Most patients (79.3%, 42/53) experienced good neurologic outcomes. Most showed no change (81%, 43/53) or improvement {13%, 7/53) in functional status after microsurgical clipping. One patient (2%) deteriorated clinically, and there were 2 mortalities (4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical clipping of previously ruptured, coiled aneurysms is a promising treatment method with favorable clinical outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Decompressive craniectomy may be used as a primary or secondary treatment for intracranial hypertension and is clearly associated with reduced mortality. The removed bone flap is usually preserved in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue or in the bone bank. The aim of this study was to describe an option for preserving the bone flap after decompressive craniectomy using bone flap preservation in the skull subcutaneous tissue in subgaleal space over the pericranium contralateral to the craniectomy site.
   METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study including patients with severe traumatic brain injury from 2014 to 2016. There were 23 patients who had their bone fragments preserved below the scalp in the subcutaneous tissue for analysis. The following results were analyzed: surgical site infection, bone flap resorption during the period of preservation, and patient discomfort.
   RESULTS: Five patients died of systemic infectious complications, and the remaining patients underwent cranioplasty a mean 118 days after craniectomy. There were no surgical wound infections, macroscopically evident bone absorption, or site discomfort in any of the patients during a period of 18 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: This variant of the bone flap preservation technique has been shown to be satisfactory as an option for routine use.

TI Risk Factors for Dropping Out of Neurosurgical Residency Programs - A
   Survey Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Education; Residency; Survey; Training
ID ATTRITION; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION
AB BACKGROUND: Resident education has to adapt to a changing health care environment. Although aspects such as working hours and attrition rates have been studied in detail, data about the residents' perspective, especially in European countries, are underrepresented in the scientific literature. The aim of this study was to assess and report aspects of neurosurgical education in German-speaking countries and to identify risk factors for quitting or changing the neurosurgical residency program.
   METHODS: We conducted a nonanonymous online survey among neurosurgical residents in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Log-binomial regression models were calculated to further assess risk factors.
   RESULTS: Of 201 residents who responded to the survey, 37.3% (n = 75) dropped out of neurosurgical training programs, including 20 residents (10%) who ultimately quit neurosurgery and changed to another specialty. Only female gender (relative risk, 2.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.78) and starting residency in a city one studied or grew up in (2.38; 1.01-5.62) were significant risk factors. Residents who had close supervision at work (0.39; 0.17-0.89), who observed the residency program for >3 days before applying (0.54; 0.31-0.95), who had well-defined guidelines within the program (0.57; 0.35-0.92), and who were working in a university hospital (0.41; 0.26-0.64) were significantly less likely to quit or change their program.
   CONCLUSIONS: The high attrition rate, especially among female residents, in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland should encourage program directors to specifically address the issues reported by this survey during interviews and to further improve their residency program accordingly.

DT Article
DE MIB index; Recurrence; Sporadic vestibular schwannomas
ID MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REMOVAL
AB OBJECTIVE: Nearly 9.2% of vestibular schwannomas (VS) recur. We evaluate the association of cell proliferative markers like MIB with recurrence in VS.
   METHODS: Retrospective data of 144 consecutive patients who underwent surgical excision for sporadic VS between January 2010 and July 2015 were collected. Comparison between groups based on recurrence of VS was done.
   RESULTS: The average age of the study population was 43.95 +/- 12.86 years with 77 (53.5%) men. The average maximal diameter of VS was 40.25 +/- 723 mm. Gross total resection was done in 52 (36.1%) patients. While near total resection was performed in 81 (56.3%) patients, the remaining 11(7.6%) patients underwent a subtotal resection. The mean follow-up period was 37.99 +/- 10.09 months (24-60). Recurrence of VS was observed in 18 (12.5%) patients.
   There was no difference between the groups for diameter of the tumor (42.22 +/- 8.04 vs. 39.64 +/- 7.00 mm; P = 0.191). The average MIB index value was higher in patients with recurrence of tumor at follow-up (4.78 +/- 5.77 vs. 1.89 +/- 1.48 mm; P < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups for extent of resection or postoperative complications. MIB was the only significant predictor for recurrence (beta = 1.355 (1.07-1.78; confidence interval 95%); P = 0.031). On receiver operating characteristic curves, a cutoff value of 3.5% for MIB showed a specificity of 84.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: MIB index >= 3.5% is associated with recurrence in VS. Maximal diameter of the tumor and extent of resection are perhaps not associated with recurrence of VS.

AB OBJECTIVES: Osteoporotic spine fractures (OSFs) with delayed neurologic compromises (NCs) have been increasingly reported. Although several studies have addressed that the pathologic mechanism of NC involves nonunion and segmental instability, the risk factors remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the radiologic and clinical features of OSFs with delayed NC.
   METHODS: Thirty patients with delayed NC (group 1) were matched in a 1-to-1 format with 30 patients without delayed NC (group 2) by age, bone mineral density, body mass index, and medical treatment for osteoporosis. Clinical and radiologic parameters were assessed to determine the risk factors related to delayed NC. Clinical outcomes were also compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Neurologic compromises were presented as myelopathy in 20 patients and radiculopathy in 10 patients. Initial kyphotic angle (KA) and height loss (HI) were significantly greater in group 1 (21.6 +/- 12.9 degrees vs. 10.5 +/- 8.6 degrees, P = 0.0001 for KA; 55.8% +/- 15.2% vs. 19.9% +/- 10.9%, P = 0.0001 for HI). Fracture instability with intravertebral cleft, posterior wall involvement, midportion type of magnetic resonance classification, thoracolumbar level, and aortic calcification were significantly correlated with delayed NC. In multivariate analysis, initial HL (hazard ratio = 1.24; P = 0.012) and midportion-type fracture (hazard ratio = 14.9: P = 0.03) were the independent risk factors related to delayed NC. In addition, clinical outcomes at the last follow-up were significantly better in group 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Initial HL and midportion-type fracture were correlated with delayed NC following OSFs. Moreover, pre-existing stenotic lesions might be associated with delayed NC.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) and motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring according to 2 different warning criteria during 6 months from intramedullary spinal ependymoma surgery.
   METHODS: Twenty-six patients who underwent intramedullary spinal ependymoma surgery with intraoperative monitoring from January 2010 to June 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. We examined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictable value, negative predictable value, and diagnostic odds ratio of SSEP and MEP monitoring for each extremity according to 2 warning criteria: 50% decline and all-or-none. The postoperative motor deficit was evaluated using the Medical Research Council scale. The postoperative neurologic deficit was followed up during 6 months.
   RESULTS: Eighty-six extremities were evaluated. The success rates of SSEP and MEP monitoring were 84.9% and 83.7%, respectively. Indeterminate cases were 1 in SSEP and 6 in MEP. All-or-none criterion in SSEP and MEP monitoring showed greater specificity, positive predictable value, and diagnostic odds ratio than 50% decline criterion during 6 months. The validity of SSEP was high in the upper extremity, whereas that of MEP was high in the lower extremity. During the follow-up, 37 of 38 extremities (97.4%) and 18 of 29 extremities (621%) showed improvement in sensory and motor deficit, respectively. Seven indeterminate cases also showed good clinical outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many false-positive and false-negative results of SSEP and MEP monitoring occurred during the immediate postoperative period. All-or-none criterion was more beneficial for assessing postoperative neurologic status than 50% decline criterion. This trend was maintained until 6 months after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has redefined the treatment paradigm for cerebral metastases. The benefits of SRS after surgical resection of a metastatic brain tumor have been well-defined. However, it is unclear whether preoperative SRS can improve the outcomes in select patients. The present study examined the safety and efficacy of preoperative neoadjuvant SRS (NaSRS) for the treatment of cerebral metastases.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 12 patients treated at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All patients underwent NaSRS, followed by surgical resection of a cerebral metastasis, from 2011 to 2015. Recurrence and overall survival were characterized using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses.
   RESULTS: The mean age was 57.5 years (range, 39-69). The median follow-up period was 13 months (range, 1-22.6). The median maximum tumor diameter was 3.66 cm (range, 2.19-4.85). The 6- and 12-month local control rates were 81.8 % and 49.1%, respectively. The distant disease control rates were 72.7% and 14.5% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Overall survival was 83.3% and 74.1% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Two patients developed leptomeningeal disease at a mean of 11.3 months. A trend toward increased local failure was seen with larger tumor volumes and diameters (P = 0.06).
   CONCLUSIONS: NaSRS is a promising new approach for the treatment of select cerebral metastases that require surgical intervention. The approach is safe and effective at achieving local control. Further randomized studies with larger patient cohorts are necessary to determine whether the long-term outcomes are improved.

AB BACKGROUND: Neuronavigation is widely used for intracranial neurosurgical procedures and is commonly based on the standard reference array being fixed to the headholder. Some cases require the reference array to be attached directly to the head. The aim of this cadaveric study was to compare operational accuracy of a headmounted reference array with the standard headholder-based system.
   METHODS: Navigation accuracy was evaluated with 10 cadaveric specimens. Each specimen was prepared with 8 titanium microscrews that served as reference points on the external skull, and computed tomography was performed. Registration of all specimens was done using surface matching with infrared laser on three-dimensional reconstructed high-resolution computed tomography. In all 10 specimens, the head-mounted reference array and headholder-based system were compared by 10 repetitive measurements. The deviation was evaluated for each screw and compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test between groups and screws. A Bland-Altman plot was generated for comparison.
   RESULTS: A total of 1600 measurements were conducted. Mean deviation was 1.97 mm (95% confidence interval, 1.90-2.03 mm) with the head-mounted reference array and 2.10 mm (95% confidence interval, 2.04-2.18 mm) with the headholder based system. There was no significant difference between methods in 9 of 10 specimens. In 1 specimen, the head-mounted array was superior. The deviation in either method showed a significant correlation, indicating high pertinence for registration (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Navigation with the head-mounted reference array demonstrated comparable accuracy to the headholder-based system and can be used without reduced accuracy. Careful registration is mandatory.

AB BACKGROUND: The most commonly performed nerve transfers in upper trunk (UT) or partial brachial plexus injuries (BP1s) include the spinal accessory nerve to suprascapular nerve, Oberlin, and, lately, radial nerve (RN) (branch to triceps) to axillary nerve (AN) transfers. Routinely, the former 3 procedures are performed through an anterior approach (supraclavicular plus infraclavicular), while the triceps branch of the RN-AN transfer has been performed through a posterior approach with the patient in either the prone or semilateral position, which requires a separate incision in the posterior arm. The aim of the present study was to report the outcomes for 4 cases of quadruple nerve transfers performed for UT BPI using an all-anterior approach.
   METHODS: The functional outcomes of 4 consecutive cases of UT BPI treated using an all-anterior approach were analyzed in terms of improvement in motor power and range of motion at the shoulder and elbow joints.
   RESULTS: The mean age was 27.5 years (range, 16-40). All had sustained injuries from road traffic accidents. The mean injury to surgery interval was 4.5 months (range, 3-6). Of the 4 patients, 2 each had pre- and postganglionic injuries. All 4 patients had 0 of MO power in shoulder abduction and external rotation, and elbow flexion. At a mean follow-up of 28.6 months, the average shoulder abduction was 157 degrees, with an average of 82 degrees of external rotation. The mean elbow flexion was 104 degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique appears to be feasible, with good-to-excellent outcomes achieved without requiring a separate posterior arm incision for the RN-AN transfer.

AB BACKGROUND: Very little is known about the incidence of in-stent stenosis after flow diverter treatment of intracranial aneurysms. We sought to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of in-stent stenosis at angiographic follow-up after Pipeline embolization device (PED) placement using quantitative measures.
   METHODS: The clinical and radiological records from all patients undergoing PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms at a major U.S. academic center from March 2013 to July 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. A modified version of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy criteria was used to quantify the degree of stenosis on the most recent postprocedural angiogram. The percentage of stenosis was calculated as 1 - (narrowest vessel diameter/ maximal midstent diameter within the artery) at the first follow-up angiogram. The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were additionally searched from inception until April 2018 for the rates of in-stent stenosis after flow diversion.
   RESULTS: A total of 155 patients (mean age, 58.3 years; 30 males) with 162 aneurysms underwent treatment with the PED at our institution. In-stent stenosis was detected in 12 patients (7.1%) at 6 months. The mean percentage of stenosis was 39.7%. All 12 patients remained asymptomatic, except for 1 who developed hemiplegia secondary to an unrelated ischemic stroke. The aneurysm occlusion rates at 6 months were comparable between the stenosis and nonstenosis cohorts (76.9% and 71.6%, respectively). Within the stenosis cohort, further follow-up angiograms after 6 months were available for 6 patients, of whom 3 (50%) had either complete resolution or improvement. Of the 43 included studies, 28 reported on the use of the PED, with 2448 patients. The mean reported rate of in-stent stenosis after PED placement was 8.8% (range, 0%-39%).
   CONCLUSIONS: In-stent stenosis remains a rare complication of PED placement for intracranial aneurysms. When occurring, it appears to largely be self-limiting, with a benign clinical course.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application and therapeutic effects of debridement from a single posterior approach for bone grafting and internal fixation treatment of lumbosacral tuberculosis.
   METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2016, 96 patients with lumbosacral tuberculosis were treated by single posterior debridement and internal fixation with bone graft. Among these patients, there were 9 cases involving the L3-L4 segment, 57 involving L4-15, and 30 involving 15-S1. Interlaminar debridement was applied in 60 cases and transforaminal debridement was applied in 36 cases. Evaluation of therapeutic effects included the Prolo scale and visual analogue scale. The kyphotic angle and height loss of the vertebral body in the affected region of the lumbosacral segment were measured radiologically.
   RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12-24 months. In the interlaminar group, the mean preoperative, postoperative, and final kyphotic angles were -24.1 +/- 5.5, -34.6 +/- 5.6 degrees, and -32.1 +/- 5.1 degrees, respectively. In contrast, those in the transforaminal group were -25.1 +/- 5.9 degrees, -35.0 +/- 6.6 degrees, and -33.3 +/- 5.9 degrees, respectively. There was significant improvement of the postoperative angle compared with the preoperative angle. The result of the modified Prolo scale was 93.8%. According to the visual analogue scale, the preoperative and postoperative scales were 7.8 and 2.7, indicating a significant alleviation of pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Debridement from single posterior approach is an effective technique for the internal fixation of lumbosacral regional spinal tuberculosis. An appropriate selection of indications, careful evaluation of radiology, and thorough debridement were the key to a successful operation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the novel polymethyl methacrylate-augmented bone cementinjectable cannulated pedicle screw (CICPS) in patients with thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures (AO type A) associated with osteoporosis.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 28 patients treated for osteoporosis-related thoracolumbar vertebral body compression fracture at our facility between 2011 and 2015. Treatment involved posterior thoracolumbar fusion or lumbar fusion using CICPS. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated using visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores, degree of fracture reduction, and correction of kyphosis. The safety of CICPS was mainly assessed in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes were also assessed.
   RESULTS: All 28 patients had severe osteoporosis. The visual analog scale score at final follow-up (0.50 +/- 0.69) was significantly (P< 0.001) lower compared with before surgery (4.93 +/- 1.30). The Oswestry Disability Index score had also decreased from 57.39% +/- 14.46% to 6.83% +/- 15.38% at final follow-up (P < 0.001). Radiologic evaluation of vertebral height and Cobb angle showed good fracture reduction and satisfactory correction of kyphosis (preoperative vs. final follow-up P < 0.001). There were no instances of screw loosening or symptomatic complications except for a few cases of cement leakage from CICPS (10.3%; cement leakage most common in AO type A3.3).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of CICPS and polymethyl methacrylate is an effective and safe surgical technique for management of osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures (AO type A), with good clinical outcomes and low complications rates.

AB BACKGROUND: The internal maxillary artery (IMA) is a reliable donor for extracranial-intracranial high-flow bypasses. However, previously described landmarks and techniques to harvest the IMA are complex and confusing and require extensive bone drilling, carrying significant neurovascular risk. The objective of our study was to describe a minimally invasive technique for exposing the IMA and to assess the feasibility of using the IMA as a donor for anterior-circulation recipient vessels using 2 different local interposition vessels.
   METHODS: Via a minimally invasive technique, the IMA was harvested in 10 cadaveric specimens and a pterional craniotomy was performed. Two interposition grafts-the superficial temporal artery (STA) and middle temporal artery-were evaluated individually. Transsylvian exposure of the second segment of middle cerebral artery (M2), the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, and the proximal postcommunicating anterior cerebral artery segment was completed. Relevant vessel calibers and graft lengths were measured for each bypass model.
   RESULTS: The mean caliber of the IMA was 2.7 +/- 0.5 mm. Of all 3 recipients, the shortest graft length was seen in the IMA-STA-M2 bypass, measuring 42.0 +/- 8.4 mm. There was a good caliber match between the M2 (2.4 +/- 0.4 mm) and STA (2.3 +/- 0.4 mm) at the anastomotic site. The harvested middle temporal artery was sufficient in length in only 30% cases, with a mean distal caliber of 2.0 +/- 0.7 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the technical feasibility of IMA as a donor for an extracranial-intracranial bypass to the second segment of the anterior cerebral artery, M2, and the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. However, IMASTA-M2 was observed to be the most suitable bypass model.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is the leading cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The pathomechanisms of IA are poorly understood but can be related to arterial tortuosity resulting from underlying systemic factors leading to arterial wall weakening. We aimed to analyze the tortuosity of the intracranial artery in a cohort with IA, hypothesizing that the tortuosity of intracranial arteries differs depending on the characteristics of the IA.
   METHODS: Patients with saccular IA were consecutively enrolled. Clinical factors and vascular tortuosity of the right and left middle cerebral arteries and basilar artery (BA) of all patients with IA were compared according to the characteristics of the IA: 1) ruptured versus unruptured, 2) multiple versus single, and 3) large (>5 cm) versus small (<= 5 cm). Unruptured !As were comparatively analyzed according to aneurysm size and aspect ratio, whereas ruptured IAs were analyzed according to aneurysm size.
   RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five patients were enrolled (mean age, 59 years; 712% women). The tortuosity of the BA was higher in the large IA group (5.63 +/- 6.26; n = 133; P = 0.009), large unruptured IA group (6.64 +/- 6.32; n = 53; P = 0.039), and large ruptured IA group (5.50 +/- 6.52; n = 80; P = 0.033) compared with the small IA, small unruptured IA, and small ruptured IA group. In multivariate analysis, increased BA tortuosity was significantly associated with large IAs (beta = 1.066; P = 0.008), unruptured large IAs (beta = 1.077; P = 0.033), and ruptured large IAs (beta = 1.686; P = 0.025).
   CONCLUSIONS: The BA tortuosity was higher in patients with large IAs, which may represent an imaging biomarker of aneurysm growth.

AB OBJECTIVE: Studies on resuming anticoagulation after burr-hole drainage for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) are limited. To evaluate the safety for early warfarin resumption after burr-hole drainage, we conducted a retrospective matched cohort study.
   METHODS: Between January 2008 and April 2015, 36 patients with warfarin-related unilateral CSDH and 151 patients with ordinary unilateral CSDH were enrolled in this study. Patients taking warfarin were managed homogeneously according to the study protocol, and the usual dosage of warfarin was resumed within 2 or 3 days of burr-hole drainage to reach a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.1. The primary outcome, defined as recurrent CSDH requiring repeated burr-hole drainage within 3 months of the initial surgery, was compared between the two groups.
   RESULTS: The primary outcome was observed in 4 (11%) of the 36 patients taking warfarin and in 18 (12%) of the 151 ordinary patients. After propensity score matching, the primary outcome was observed in 3 of 33 patients (9%) in the matched warfarin cohort and 11 of 74 patients (15%) in the matched ordinary cohort. When the results were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation, no significant difference was observed in the rate of recurrent CSDH between the 2 groups (P = 0.411). In addition, we found that recurrent CSDH was not related to postoperative international normalized ratio levels (P = 0.332).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was no definitive association between postoperative early warfarin resumption and the recurrence rate of CSDH. Patients with warfarin-related CSDH and a strong indication for anticoagulation can be managed by resuming warfarin within 3 days of burr-hole drainage.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of statins and diabetes on angiographic and clinical outcomes in aneurysms treated with pipelines has not been adequately reported. Our aim is to assess the effect of concurrent statin medications and diabetes mellitus (DM) on aneurysm occlusion status and outcomes in patients treated with the pipeline embolization device.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of our institution's database of aneurysms treated with the pipeline embolization device between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. We collected data about statin therapy status and intensity, and identified patients with a documented history of DM. Our primary outcome was aneurysm obliteration seen on digital subtracted angiography or magnetic resonance angiography at last follow-up.
   RESULTS: We identified 151 patients with 182 aneurysms for this cohort, with a median radiographic follow-up time of 7.2 months (6.1-14.5). Thirty-nine patients were taking statins, and 112 patients did not receive statins. Log-rank tests revealed no statistically significant difference in occlusion rates between patients with and without statin therapy (P = 0.30). A history of DM was documented in 11 patients, with 14 aneurysms in total; 140 patients with 168 aneurysms had no history of DM. Similarly, there were no differences in occlusion rates between the diabetic and nondiabetic groups in multivariate analysis (P = 0.24). Only 2 patients showed significant in-stent stenosis on angiographic follow up, and both were diabetic.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis did not identify a statistically significant association between statin therapy or DM and higher occlusion rates or better outcomes after pipeline embolization. Diabetic patients may have a theoretic risk of significant in-stent stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: The case fatality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is 50% because of the initial hemorrhage or subsequent complications, such as aneurysmal rebleed or delayed cerebral ischemia. One factor that might influence the initial brain damage or subsequent complications is the use of antiplatelet medication before the initial hemorrhage. The goal of this survey was to assess the different management options of patients with aSAH with antiplatelet use before the initial hemorrhage.
   METHODS: An anonymous survey of 11 multiple choice questions about management of patients with aSAH with antiplatelet use before the initial hemorrhage was distributed to the international panel of attendees of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies annual meeting in Venice, Italy, October 1-5, 2017.
   RESULTS: A total of 258 completed surveys (54%) were returned. In about 80% of the surveys, the departments of neurosurgery and neurology were responsible for acute management of patients with aSAH, whereas in 15% the intensive care unit was responsible. Department guidelines were present in 32%. In 65%, the responders always stopped the antiplatelet agent at admission, and in 4.3% thrombocytes are always transfused. When a guideline is present, the neurospecialists consider thrombocyte transfusion more often (83% vs. 65%, respectively; P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our survey among mainly European neurosurgeons shows that there is a significant variability in the management of patients with aSAH who have been using antiplatelets before the initial hemorrhage. These findings emphasize the importance of the development of evidence-based guidelines for management of patients with aSAH and antiplatelet use before the initial hemorrhage.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of and characterize risk factors for cerebrospinal fluid leak and symptomatic pseudomeningocele (CSFL/SP) after intradural spine surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected and consecutive series of patients undergoing intradural spine surgery by the senior author (A.D.L.) was conducted over a period of 20 years.
   RESULTS: Data on 460 surgeries performed on 430 consecutive patients were gathered. The incidence of CSFL/SP formation was 2.8% (n = 13). Of the 13 cases complicated by CSFL/SP, 4 were successfully managed nonoperatively (4/13, 31%); 9 postoperative CSFL/SP required surgical repair (9/13, 69%), making for an overall postoperative surgical repair rate of 1.9% (9/460). Factors significantly related to development of postoperative CSFL/SP on the Fisher exact test were surgery located at the craniocervical junction (risk ratio [RR] 2.7, P = 0.03) and use of any external cerebrospinal fluid drain (any drain: RR 2.5, P = 0.02; lumbar drain specifically: RR 2.6, P = 0.02), the latter finding most likely being attributable to selection bias. No significant difference was observed between primary dural closure and closure incorporating the use of one or more dural repair adjuncts. In addition, the total number of dural repair adjuncts used did not significantly influence the development of postoperative CSFL/SP.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest series of intradural spine surgeries focusing specifically on the risk factors for and management of CSFL/SP. Although craniocervical junction surgery and use of external cerebrospinal fluid drain were associated with CSFL/SP, type of closure and type/number of dural substitutes were not.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on intra- and perioperative complications associated with working channel endoscopic spine surgery.
   METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of a multi-institutional patient cohort operated on by surgeons within the Endoscopic Spine Study Group between May 2010 and June 2017.
   RESULTS: Our study cohort consists of a total of 553 consecutive cases with an average age of 57 years. The most common procedure was an endoscopic discectomy (n = 377, 68%) followed by foraminotomy (n = 156, 282%), unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (n = 55, 9.9%), and lateral recess decompression (n = 29, 5.2%). Overall, the rate of intra- and perioperative complications was 2.7%. There were 3 durotomies (0.54%), 2 epidural hematomas (0.36%), 2 patients developed a complex pain disorder (0.36%), 4 recurrent disc herniations within 3 months (1.1%), 4 systemic complications (1.1%), and no wound infections. No risk factors were identified with regards to age, sex, approach, or number of segments.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic spine surgery is associated with a favorable rate of intra- and perioperative complications compared with reported rates of minimally invasive or traditional open spine surgeries. Our report proposes safe and effective strategies for management of these complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether extended lesionec_Ay is needed for patients with cerebral cavernous malformations presenting with epilepsy as compared with lesionectomy.
   METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web Science, Clinical Trials and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed for pertinent English-language studies from 1967 to 2017. Eligible studies were selected according to uniform inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: Seven studies including 245 patients (107 receiving extended lesionectomy, 138 receiving lesionectomy) were selected. Meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare extended lesionectomy with lesionectomy. Pooled analysis demonstrated that seizure outcome was not statistically significantly improved in patients who underwent extended lesionectomy compared with lesionectomy (odds ratio = 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.51; P = 0.44; l(2) = 15%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Extended lesionectomy does not contribute to better seizure control for patients with cerebral cavernous malformations with epilepsy. Resection of the lesion and surrounding hemosiderin is sufficient for patients with cerebral cavernous malformations presenting with epilepsy.

AB BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the factors associated with de novo brain cavernoma formations after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and confirmed whether developmental venous anomaly (DVA) presented with a cavernoma and whether the cavernoma was included in the GKRS target location.
   METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2008, 95 patients underwent radiosurgery for brain cavernoma at our institution. Of these, 15 with multiple cavernomas related to familial cavernoma or with a history of surgical treatment for cavernoma were excluded. A total of 80 patients (44 men and 36 women; average age, 39.4 years) with sporadic cavernoma were retrospectively analyzed by considering the patient characteristics, including sex, age, target volume, radiation dose, clinical symptoms, cavernoma location, radiosurgery complications, and morphology of DVA.
   RESULTS: The average target volume, mean radiation dose, and mean target percentage were 1019.2 mm(3), 13.7 Gy, and 51.1%, respectively. Nineteen patients showed cavernomas associated with DVA; of these, de novo cavernoma formations were noticed in 4 patients at a median of 49.5 months after undergoing GKRS. All de novo cavernomas were related to the presence of DVA and were located near the brainstem or cerebral peduncle. De novo cavernomas occurred when DVAs were not included in the GKRS-target location.
   CONCLUSIONS: All de novo cavernomas were located near the brainstem or cerebral peduncle, and they occurred in the presence of DVAs. The presence of DVA in the radiosurgery target location might be potentially an important factor associated with de novo cavernoma formation.

AB OBJECTIVES: Determining the value of the computed tomographic black hole sign in predicting postoperative rehemorrhage in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS).
   METHODS: Two hundred ninety-five patients with spontaneous ICH underwent stereotactic MIS within 24 hours after admission. Ninety-eight patients (33%) demonstrated a black hole sign on initial computed tomography (CT). Postoperative rehemorrhage occurred in 68 patients (named the rehemorrhage group, including patients with and without black hole sign) and the other 227 patients (non-rehemorrhage group) did not show rehemorrhage. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the values of the black hole sign.
   RESULTS: Postoperative rehemorrhage occurred in 57 of the 98 (58.2%) patients with the black hole sign, and in 11 of the 197 (5.58%) patients without the black hole sign. In the rehemorrhage group, 39 patients (57.4%) were found to have the black hole sign. However, only 59 patients (25.99%) from the non-rehemorrhage group showed the black hole sign. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the black hole sign for predicting postoperative rehemorrhage were 57.4%, 74%, 39.8%, and 85.3%, respectively. The odd ratio for the black hole sign, the hematoma irregularity, and the CT value for predicting the postoperative rehemorrhage were 10.501, 9.631, and 4.750, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The black hole sign on initial CT could predict the postoperative rehemorrhage following the minimally invasive procedures.

TI Neuroendoscopic Resection of Trigeminal Schwannoma in the
   Pterygopalatine/ Infratemporal Fossa via the Transnasal Perpendicular
   Plate Palatine Bone or Transnasal Maxillary Sinus Approach
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

   Trigeminal schwannoma
ID ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL APPROACH; TRANSMAXILLARY APPROACH
AB BACKGROUND: Both the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) and the infratemporal fossa (ITF) lie outside the midline of the skull base. Lesions in the PPF or ITF include trigeminal schwannoma (trigeminal schwannoma, TS), which originates from the second or third branch of the trigeminal nerve (maxillary nerve or mandibular nerve). Due to their typically deep anatomic location, lesions in the PPF or ITF can be difficult to treat using traditional surgical approaches. In recent years, because of their advantages, which include the fact that they allow the problem to be observed close up, neuroendoscopic techniques are increasingly being applied in skull base surgery, especially in treatment of lesions around the midline of the base of the skull. This study aims to 1) evaluate the neuroendoscopic treatment of lesions in PPF or ITF via the transnasal palate bone perpendicular plate or transnasal maxillary sinus approach and 2) analyze the clinical significance of this approach.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 3 cases of PPF TSs and 1 case of ITF TS treated between January 2015 and May 2017. All of the cases underwent neuroendoscopic resection of TSs located in the PPF via the nasal perpendicular plate palatine bone (or nasal maxillary sinus) approach.
   RESULTS: Two cases of PPF TSs were characterized by a thin palate bone perpendicular plate due to oppressed absorption of the tumor. Therefore the endoscopic transnasal palate bone perpendicular plate approach was employed. Additionally, 1 case of PPF TSs and 1 case of ITF TS were resected via the transnasal maxillary sinus approach. All 4 patients received total resection under endoscopy and recovered well after their respective operations without cerebrospinal fluid leakage, although 1 patient experienced postoperative dry eye symptoms and 1 other patient showed no improvement in facial numbness before and after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopic surgery performed via the transnasal perpendicular plate palatine bone or transnasal maxillary sinus approach has its own unique advantages in removing TSs in PPF and in ITF: Notably, the tumor can be exposed and dealt with under direct vision, which prevents damage to important structures, such as the internal carotid and maxillary nerves, while at the same time helping to achieve total removal of TSs. Furthermore, by adopting this approach versus traditional skull base surgery, postoperative trauma can be reduced significantly, which should be advocated for in this time of minimal invasive surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore influence of reduction of slippage on radiologic parameters, clinical outcomes, and perioperative complications in treatment of grade II/III lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: We divided 156 patients with grade II/III spondylolisthesis into 2 groups with preoperative balanced or unbalanced pelvis. We further divided each group into group A with postoperative grade I or less slippage and group B with persistent grade slippage postoperatively. Outcome scores were measured for clinical evaluation. Radiologic parameters included pelvic incidence, sacral slope, pelvic tilt, and lumbar lordosis.
   RESULTS: In group A patients with preoperative balanced pelvis, lumbar lordosis significantly decreased from 60.2 degrees +/- 10.6 degrees to 50.9 degrees +/- 9.8 degrees after operation (P < 0.05). In group A patients with preoperative unbalanced pelvis, pelvic tilt decreased from 29.1 degrees +/- 8.6 degrees to 24.1 degrees +/- 9.1 degrees , and sacral slope increased from 36.1 degrees +/- 9.0 degrees to 41.3 degrees +/- 8.4 degrees, significantly (P< 0.05). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between group A and B in postoperative visual analog scale for low back pain (1.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9), Oswestry Disability Index (13.8 +/- 8.7 vs. 18.1 +/- 7.6), and EuroQol-5 dimensions (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.681 +/- 0.11) scores in patients with preoperative unbalanced pelvis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with grade II/III lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis, if postoperative slippage was grade I or less, pelvic tilt and sacral slope could be corrected corrected more effectively, and better clinical outcomes would be obtained for cases with preoperative unbalanced pelvis. In cases with balanced pelvis, lumbar lordosis could be better corrected by the same degree of reduction, although clinical outcomes would not be influenced significantly. Perioperative complications would not be influenced by reduction of slippage.

ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; REDEFINING HYPOTENSION; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; MORTALITY;
   COHORT
AB BACKGROUND: Hypotension, a risk factor for increased mortality following traumatic brain injury (TBI), is traditionally defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg. We aimed to redefine hypotension and determine its optimal threshold in patients with TBI.
   METHODS: We identified patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 on admission) between 2004 and 2015 using data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank. Our endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between SBP on admission and in-hospital mortality, with hospitals considered as a random effects variable. We also conducted analyses stratified by age (<= 60 years and >60 years) to determine age-specific optimal levels of SBP.
   RESULTS: A total of 12,537 patients (5665 patients <= 60 years old and 6872 patients >60 years old) were eligible for the analyses. Overall, SBP of 110 mm Hg was the optimal threshold for hypotension, and adjusted odds ratio and C-statistic for mortality at SBP <110 mm Hg on admission were 1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.42-1.76, P < 0.001) and 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.79), respectively. Stratified analyses showed that optimal thresholds for hypotension in patients <= 60 years old and >60 years old were 100 mm Hg and 120 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for hypotension in patients with severe TBI should be redefined and modified by age, and patients <= 60 years old should be considered hypotensive hypotensive at SBP <100 mm Hg, whereas in older patients, SBP <120 mm Hy should be diagnosed as hypotension.

AB OBJECTIVE: Various approaches are advocated for symptomatic thoracic disc herniation (TDH). The aim of this series is to demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and results of posterior transfacet or transpedicular approaches for excision of all types of extradural TDH. We report a consecutive series of patients undergoing posterior approach surgery for TDH.
   METHODS: Twenty-four patients (17 women, 7 men) underwent surgery at 25 disc levels. Mean age was 56.3 years (range, 23-79 years). A posterior transfacet or transpedicular approach was used. Patients presented with myelopathy (n = 21, 88%), radiculopathy (n = 8, 33%), sphincter dysfunction (n = 16, 67%), and axial back pain (n = 10, 43%). Preoperative imaging revealed 7 (30%) central, 14 (61%) calcified, and 10 (43%) large disc herniations. The mean follow-up period was 6.0 months (range, 2-36 months).
   RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent unilateral approach surgery (5 transfacet and 13 transfacet plus transpedicular), and 7 patients required bilateral approach laminectomy for unilateral (n = 4) or bilateral (n = 3) discectomy. One patient required unplanned reoperation for resection of residual disc. Average operative time was 95 minutes (range, 40-175 minutes). Mean hospital stay was 4.9 days (range, 2-35 days). There were no major complications. Postoperative Frankel scores were maintained or improved in all patients at last review.
   CONCLUSIONS: TDH including large central calcified discs can be safely removed through posterior transfacet or transpedicular approaches with reduced morbidity in comparison with more invasive anterior approaches. Careful microsurgical technique and use of specialized instruments are important for successful excision of TDH from a posterior approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Reperfusion time influences patient outcome in mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion. We analyzed anatomic features that could be used to make preoperative and intraoperative decisions to minimize revascularization time.
   METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively maintained database for patients with stroke evaluated from February 2015 to July 2016. Patients received a score based on bovine arch, aortic arch, and internal carotid artery dolichoarteriopathy (B.A.D. score), which we correlated with procedural times and outcomes. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of procedural times, revascularization, complications, and outcome. Relevant variables were assessed via multivariate regression.
   RESULTS: We identified 61 patients (31 men) who underwent transfemoral thrombectomy. Mean puncture to reperfusion time was 46 minutes. Age >75 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-13.54; P = 0.027) and high B.A.D. score (OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.17-5.57; P = 0.019) were significant predictors of puncture to reperfusion time >40 minutes. Mean puncture to first-pass time was 24 +/- 142 minutes. Age >65 years (OR = 4.68; 95% CI, 1.07-20.55; P = 0.041) and high B.A.D. score (OR = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.18-6.85; P = 0.020) were independently predictive of time to first pass >20 minutes. Lower scores predicted higher Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score (OR = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.81; P = 0.033). Higher scores predicted hemorrhagic transformation (OR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.19-12.29; P = 0.024) and modified Rankin Scale score >4 (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.15-7.92; P = 0.025) after thrombectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bovine variation, aortic arch type, and internal carotid artery dolichoarteriopathy are associated with increased revascularization time and poor outcomes in thrombectomy. We developed the B.A.D. score to predict reperfusion time and outcomes, demonstrating need for preoperative anatomic evaluation to guide treatment.

ID MYERS-BRIGGS TYPE; INDICATOR
AB BACKGROUND: In the neurosurgery residency, inherent personality traits can play a significant role in the adaptability and success of the resident physician.
   METHODS: The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has been used extensively in the business and administrative world. As a quality improvement effort to promote self-reflection, personal and professional improvement among both faculty and resident members of a department of neurosurgery at a tertiary care academic medical center, a group learning exercise was implemented using the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator.
   RESULTS: All residents (11/11) and 85% of faculty (11/13) participated in the exercise. INTJ ("Mastermind," "Scientist") was the most commonly represented (36.4% compared with 2.1% in the general population; P < 0.001). ENTJ ("Field Marshall," "Executive") was present in 18/0 compared with 1.8% of the general population (P < 0.001). Thus, the 2 most common types (__NTJ) were present in 54.4% of our department compared with 3.9% of the general population (P< 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Personality typing can be used to gain valuable insight into the composition of neurosurgery residency cohorts and resolve conflicts arising from personality differences within these groups as well as within the larger hospital setting.

AB BACKGROUND: Top performing neurosurgeons and elite athletes require years of sacrifice, discipline, and dedication to their art to be finely attuned to their physical abilities and limitations, and a singular mental focus to reach their full potential under moments of pressure.
   METHODS: We outline strategies and techniques commonly used by high-performance athletes and how they may be applied to neurosurgery to achieve the highest possible surgeon preparation, patient outcomes, and career longevity.
   RESULTS: Further investigation and integration of well-established cognitive psychology applications to surgical performance is needed. These principles are broad-reaching and may be applied to the training of our residents, our own daily routine, and as a life philosophy to enhance the longevity of our careers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining peak performance for a neurosurgeon may prove to be more challenging than that of the elite athlete.

AB PURPOSE: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effect of quantitative enlargement of spinal canal by anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   METHODS: Forty-three patients with OPLL who underwent ACAF were enrolled. According to the use of a curvature ruler (CR), patients were divided into group A (CR used, n = 21) and group B (CR not used, n = 22). The average follow-up was 9.5 months. The occupation rate (OR) of the spinal canal and the curvature of the cervical plate were recorded. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores were analyzed, and the recovery rate (RR) was calculated. Surgical complications were also investigated.
   RESULTS: The OR of the spinal canal in group A decreased from 66.7% +/- 12.8% to 19.1% +/- 10.9% after surgery (P < 0.05). In group B, the preoperative and postoperative OR was 63.9% +/- 11.7% and 21.2% +/- 8.7%, respectively (P< 0.05). Patients in group A had higher agreement of the curvature of the cervical plate between preoperative planning and post-operative measurement. The RR of JOA scores in group A was 73.7% +/- 19.7%, higher than in group B (70.9% +/- 7.3%, P > 0.05). Further comparison between the 2 groups, excluding those patients with OR <50%, showed that both JOA score and RR in group A were higher than in group B at the final follow-up (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative enlargement of the spinal canal by ACAF may provide a positive and favorable effect on enlarging the spinal canal and achieving better neurologic recovery for the treatment of cervical OPLL with myelopathy. CR can facilitate the achievement of better and more quantitative spinal canal enlargement.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate hemodynamic changes in moyamoya disease (MMD) via two-dimensional cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics.
   METHODS: In 18 patients with MMD and 10 healthy control subjects, phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging was performed to quantify flow rate of main supplying arteries, including internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and vertebral arteries. Mean flow rate in these vessels was adopted as the patient-specific boundary condition for computational fluid dynamics simulation of the circle of Willis in MMD and control groups. Pressure drop in both ICAs and their difference, wall shear stress and secondary flow in the carotid siphon of ICAs, and flow rate and size of posterior communicating arteries (PComAs) were compared between MMD and control groups. Four patients with MMD underwent follow-up scans for longitudinal comparison.
   RESULTS: Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data revealed significantly different flow rate in the left ICA and right vertebral arteries between MMD and control groups. Computational fluid dynamics simulation demonstrated similar wall shear stress and similar secondary flow of both ICAs but significantly higher pressure drop in left ICA, higher pressure drop difference between left ICA and right ICA, and higher flow rate in PComAs in patients with MMD compared with control subjects. Significantly increased size of left PComA in patients with MMD was also found. Follow-up results confirmed that the combination of pressure drop difference, flow rate, and size of PComAs can potentially assist long-term prognosis after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pressure drop difference, flow rate, and size of PComAs can be used to evaluate impairments in cerebrovascular reserve and indicate long-term prognosis in MMD.

AB BACKGROUND: In recent years, increasing numbers of cervical disease cases have been treated with zero-profile devices in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Its short-term efficacy has been widely recognized; however, the evidence for long-term efficacy remains insufficient. The present study assessed the mid-term and long-term efficacy of zero-profile compared with cage and plate structures in ACDF by analyzing the clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of cervical diseases with a minimum 2 years of follow-up.
   METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive database or platform search in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the PRISMA guidelines and identified 10 reports, with 772 patients (375 in the zero-profile group and 397 in the cage and plate group) that met our inclusion criteria. All patients had been followed up for >= 2 years. Two of us used a standardized data collection form to extract relevant data and check its accuracy independently.
   RESULTS: The zero-profile group had statistically significant (P< 0.05) less intraoperative blood loss, improved postoperative C2-C7 Cobb angle, and decreased incidence of postoperative dysphagia and adjacent segment degeneration compared with the cage and plate group. The operative time, postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, Neck Disability Index score, and bone fusion rate showed no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The zero-profile and cage and plate structures achieved comparable mid-term and long-term clinical and radiological outcomes in ACDF. In addition, the zero-profile group showed reduced intraoperative blood loss, improved postoperative C2-C7 Cobb angle, and decreased incidence of dysphagia and adjacent segment degeneration complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: Postoperative C5 palsy is a well-known complication after cervical decompression with either a posterior or an anterior approach. Its cause has been discussed more regarding the posterior approach. The main hypothesis is that postoperative spinal cord shift causes root traction and palsy. However, the pathogenesis in anterior cases has not been fully described. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the risk factors for C5 palsy in the anterior approach through our C5 palsy cases.
   METHODS: A total of 149 surgical patients with an anterior cervical lesion were treated by a specific spinal surgeon under consistent same treatment strategy. Of these patients, 88 who satisfied the evaluation criteria were enrolled. Postoperative C5 palsy was defined as postoperative weakness of the deltoid with or without weakness of the biceps brachii. Risk factors of C5 palsy were extracted from clinical backgrounds, surgical approaches, and radiologic findings from patients with palsy.
   RESULTS: Four sides of 3 individuals (4.6%) who underwent multiple corpectomy developed C5 palsy. All paralyses became evident several days after the surgery and recovered. Older age, multiple corpectomy, postoperative spinal cord shift, and foraminal stenosis of C4-5 and C5-6 were statistically extracted as causative factor of C5 palsy. In the patients with palsy, distortion of the anterior nerve root as a result of a residual vertebral spur was observed with anterior spinal cord shift after anterior corpectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multiple corpetthooy for patients with longer anterior lesions and locally developed kyphosis is related to a larger postoperative cord shift, which can cause the occurrence of C5 palsy. Moreover, C4-5 or C5-6 foraminal stenosis can accelerate tethering of the C5 or C6 nerve root. Older patients undergoing multiple corpectomy are susceptible to these risks of palsy. Appropriate patient selection and sufficient additional foraminotomy should be considered for extensive anterior lesions and locally developed kyphosis to avoid postoperative C5 palsy.

AB BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGF receptor expression in the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) differs from that in the tumor core (TC) of glioblastoma. To date, no comparative study has investigated the expression of immunosuppressive cells in the PBZ and TC of glioblastoma.
   METHODS: In 10 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we used immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of VEGF-A, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), Foxp3, CD163, CD4, and CD8 to assess the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
   RESULTS: The number of Foxp3(+) and CD163(+) cells was significantly greater in the TC than in the PBZ and correlated with greater expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and VEGF-A in the TC than in the PBZ. The number of CD8(+) T cells was lower in the TC than in the PBZ, and the TC had more PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells compared with the PBZ. These results suggest that the hypoxic condition could be associated with PD-1 expression on lymphocytes, the distribution of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports the first clinicopathologic features of the differences in immunosuppressive cells and the expression of immune checkpoint molecules between the TC and PBZ of glioblastoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: In combined revascularization surgery for patients with moyamoya disease, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) during the postoperative acute phase is a rarely observed but severe complication. Its clinical features remain unclear because of its low incidence rate. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of immediate postoperative ICH.
   METHODS: The frequency, onset timing, and hematoma location of patients who demonstrated immediate postoperative ICH were investigated in 201 consecutive surgeries performed in 134 patients. Associations between immediate postoperative ICH and demographics, clinical presentation type, perioperative blood pressure (BP), and neuroimaging data were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Postoperative ICH was observed in 6 cases (2.99%; mean age, 46.0 +/- 1 7.6 years). The onset timing of ICH was within 24 hours after surgery in most patients (83.3%). Hematomas were located at the subcortical lesion beneath the anastomosed cortex (n = 5) and caudate head (n = 1). Three cases (50.0%) required hematoma evacuation. A higher age at surgery was associated with postoperative ICH (P = 0.046). In adult cases (132 surgeries, 65.7%), hemorrhagic presentation at onset (P = 0.0027) and an increase in BP from pre- to postoperative stage (systolic BP increase: P = 0.0058, diastolic BP increase: P = 0.0274) were significantly associated with postoperative ICH.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that older patients, with hemorrhagic presentation and greater postoperative BP increase, should be carefully managed to avoid postoperative ICH. Immediate hematoma evacuation may be effective in preventing devastating outcomes after postoperative ICH.

AB BACKGROUND: The evolution of neurosurgery in our center comprises 2 active phases separated by a decadelong latent phase. This study evaluates our experience in the renaissance phase using 1025 cases. We identify paradigms that predict progress under existing practice conditions.
   METHODS: A prospective observational study was undertaken of all freshly operated patients from 2009 to 2016. Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital institutional review board. Data of enrolled patients were acquired and analyzed using SPSS software for Windows version 21. Inferences were evaluated using a 95% level of significance. Major and intermediate cases were included, whereas bedside cases as well as patients operated on elsewhere were excluded.
   RESULTS: Of 5132 patients treated, 3033 had surgical lesions, 1129 (33.2 +/- 2.7% confidence limit [CL]) were operated on, and 1025 satisfied the study criteria. The unmet surgical load (66.1%) was significant (chi(2) = 10.9; degree of freedom = 1; P = 0.001). The most common diseases treated were neurotrauma in 438 patients, congenital malformations in 268, and tumors in 170. The mean annual operative rate was 125 +/- 5.7 patients (95% CL). Cases showed significant variability using 1-way analysis of variance (F = 13.77; P = 0.03). Residency training was a positive influence on surgeons' operative rate (chi(2) = 7.59; P = 0.02). The mean complication rate was 10.3% +/- 2.9%, and the mortality was 5.5% +/- 1.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found a large unmet neurosurgical load. To resolve this situation, we recommend an increase in the number of training programs for neurosurgery residency. As neurosurgery units evolve, their progress may be evaluated using the NESCAPE (Neurosurgery Care Phase Evolution) paradigm.

TI Anatomic Understanding of Posterior Quadrant Disconnection from

   Intraoperative Photographs
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

   Posterior quadrant disconnection
ID HEMISPHERECTOMY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior quadrant disconnection is a surgery for refractory unilateral temporoparieto-occipital epilepsy to limit propagation of epileptic discharges. As incomplete disconnection can lead to residual seizures, detailed procedures are presented using a cadaveric brain, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and simulation models, and intraoperative photographs.
   METHODS: A formalin-fixed adult cadaveric brain was dissected to show each step in posterior quadrant disconnection. Using 3D preoperative planning software, we reconstructed 3D models of operative views from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Intraoperative photographs were taken from the case of a 7-year-old girl with temporoparieto-occipital epilepsy.
   RESULTS: Frontotemporoparietal craniotomy was performed. The Sylvian fissure was widely dissected, and the insular cortex was exposed. The temporal stem was disconnected along the inferior peri-insular sulcus. The disconnection was extended from the limen insulae to the atrium of the lateral ventricle. The fibers between the head of the hippocampus and the amygdala were disconnected. The parietal lobe was disconnected along the postcentral sulcus, and the disconnection was connected to the atrium of the lateral ventricle. At the medial surface of the parietal lobe, the disconnection was continued to the corpus callosum. The splenium of the corpus callosum was disconnected via the medial wall of the lateral ventricle. The fornix was divided in the atrium of the lateral ventricle. After these steps, disconnection of the unilateral tempoparieto-occipital lobe was achieved while preserving the arteries and veins.
   CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of views from cadaveric brain, 3D reconstruction and simulation models, and intraoperative photographs facilitates a clearer anatomic understanding of posterior quadrant disconnection.

   thrombectomy; Stroke
ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; SEGMENT
AB BACKGROUND: We sought to examine the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusions in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (MT).
   METHODS: Two-hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion treated with MT were analyzed to identify all patients with acute ACA occlusion who underwent MT. The primary end point was defined as achieving a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score >= 2b The secondary end point included the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: Nine patients with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 24 presented with acute ACA occlusion. The median time from onset to recanalization was 229 minutes. The ACA occlusion was a primary embolic occlusion in 5 patients, secondary to an interventional maneuver in 4 patients. Recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction >= 2b) was achieved in 9 of 9 patients (100%) without procedural complications. All patients had a 90-day mRS score >= 3, and 2 patients had an mRS score of 6. Two patients developed hemorrhagic infarction, and 1 patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although MT can be considered in patients with ACA occlusions, our data suggest that future clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of MT for ACA occlusions. Unfavorable outcomes in our study were considered to occur because of a larger infarct volume due to internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and anterior cerebral artery territory infarction. The time from onset to recanalization was longer because MT was performed for occlusions of multiple arteries.

DE Fluoroscopy; Occupational hazard; Radiation; Spine surgery; X-ray
ID RESIDENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopy use in spine surgery is increasing owing to the increasing popularity of minimally invasive techniques. The effectiveness and safe distance for protective barriers might have been commonly misrepresented. The present study evaluated x-ray propagation and the efficacy of protective barriers in the setting of spine surgery.
   METHODS: A high-accuracy radiation dosimeter was to measure x-ray exposure in an experimental setting replicating the spine surgery setup. Radiation was measured at different angles and distances from the x-ray source with and without protective barriers such as lead gowns and glass.
   RESULTS: The radiation values return to baseline at 14 ft (4.3 m) in front of the x-ray source and 8 ft (2.4 m) behind it. Protective barriers with a 0.5-mm lead-equivalence reduced radiation exposure to baseline at 6 ft (1.8 m) and were 20% effective at 2 ft (0.6 m) from the emitter.
   CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons who wear lead gowns fluoroscopy could still be exposed to <80% of the radiation produced. Safe distances from fluoroscopy machines might be much farther than commonly believed. Alternatives to reduce the use of fluoroscopy for intraoperative imaging should be explored.

AB INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiology of normal-pressure hydrocephalus and the correlation with its symptomatology is not well understood.
   OBJECTIVE: To monitor and evaluate the enlargement patterns of the ventricular system for each ventricle and its correlation with the presenting symptoms.
   METHODS: Bilateral kaolin injection into the subarachnoid space overlying the cranial convexities was done in 18 adult rats. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an 11.7-T scanner 15, 60, 90, and 120 days after injection. Volumes of the ventricular system were measured for each ventricle and correlated with biweekly behavioral findings.
   RESULTS: There was a progressive increase in the ventricular volume for the lateral ventricles since day 15 in the kaolin-injected animals. There was a nonsignificant trend in volume growth for the third ventricle, but its enlargement was synchronous with the lateral ventricles. No significant change for the fourth ventricle. No symptoms were detected in the first 60 days. Association was found between the ventricular volume and locomotor changes. In addition, the odds of locomotor symptoms increased by 3% for every additional cubic millimeter of volume in the left (P< 0.001) and right (P = 0.023) ventricles, and for the total magnetic resonance imaging volume by 1% (P = 0.013).
   CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of the lateral ventricles maintained similar proportions over time, accompanied by a synchronous third ventricular expansion with less proportion and a nonsignificant fourth enlargement. Lateral ventricles enlarged most in those animals that were to develop late locomotor deterioration. Further research using this animal model combined with different radiologic imaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging and perfusion studies, is recommended.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical, radiologic, and functional outcomes of a 1-stage posterior treatment versus a 2-stage posterior-anterior treatment in patients with pyogenic thoracic spondylodiscitis.
   METHODS: A 1-stage posterior debridement, stabilization, and fusion with titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or mesh cage through a dorsolateral approach was performed in group A. A 2-stage procedure with initial posterior stabilization and debridement and second-stage fusion with a PEEK cage or mesh cage was performed with an anterior approach in group B. Clinical outcomes included Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and visual analog scale score. Radiologic outcomes included fusion rate and kyphotic angle correction. Secondary variables included pathogens, complications, blood loss, and operative time.
   RESULTS: One-level spondylodiscitis was treated surgically in the thoracic spine of 47 patients: 25 patients in group A and 22 patients in group B. The most frequent segment was T12-L1 (27%). There was a significantly longer operative time and greater blood loss (P > 0.001) in group B. At last follow-up, sagittal profile reconstruction was significantly better (P > 0.05) in group B. Both groups showed similar radiologic results with fusion in 92% of cases. Improved clinical outcomes, pain, and quality of life were achieved in both groups with no significant differences between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Better reconstruction of the sagittal profile was achieved in the posterior-anterior-treated group, but this did not affect the clinical outcome. No significant differences were found in the clinical and functional outcomes between the 2 groups. Posterior-anterior combined treatment should be considered in cases of large anterior defects if a posterior reconstruction is inadequate.

This study focused on the different temporal changes in ICP, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure at the early stage of aSAH, throughout aneurysm embolization, and their effects on improvement in angiographic perfusion patterns.
   METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with aSAH were evaluated who underwent coiling and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Diagnostic angiography was performed to confirm the presence and location of the vascular lesion. The transit time of the capillary filling phase was defined as a surrogate of cerebral perfusion. Capillary filling transit times were compared before and after CSF drainage. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify associations between different physical parameters and capillary filling transit times.
   RESULTS: By univariate analysis, average capillary transit time before CSF drainage had a significant correlation with initial ICP (P = 0004, R-2 = 0.398) but not systemic pressure (mean arterial pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure). Improvement in capillary filling pattern (i.e., a decrease in angiographic capillary transit time after CSF drainage) was seen in patients with high initial ICP and correlated with ICP difference after ventricular drainage (P = 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Using multivariate regression analysis, improved control in postprocedural ICP levels significantly correlated with angiographic evidence of improved cerebral perfusion (P = 0.0243).
   CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing ICP by CSF drainage strongly correlated with improved cerebral microcirculation after aSAH. Further development of ICP control protocols that can provide better ICP management of patients with aSAH is warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: For cases of cervical osteomyelitis that require surgery, concern has continued regarding instrumentation owing to the potential for bacterial seeding of the hardware. We performed a systematic review of the current data.
   METHODS: A search was performed using Medline, Embase, and Ovid for articles using the keywords "cervical osteomyelitis/spondylodiscitis" and "fusion" or "instrumentation" reported from 1980 to 2017. Prospective or retrospective studies describing >= 2 patients with cervical osteomyelitis were included in the analysis; non-English reports were excluded. Individual patients were excluded from the final analysis if they had previously undergone spinal instrumentation.
   RESULTS: A total of 239 patients from 24 studies met our criteria. Surgical approaches were classified as anterior-only, combined anteroposterior, and posterior-only for 64.8%, 31.9%, and 3.3% of the patients respectively. Of the patients treated using an anterior-only approach, 76.5% had received anterior plating and 85.3%, a cage or spacer implants. Of the patients who had undergone combined approaches, 85.1% underwent circumferential fixation and 14.9%, anterior debridement with posterior instrumentation. The follow-up period ranged from 6 weeks to 11 years (mean, 31.0 months). All the studies reporting the fusion rates, except for 1, reported a 100% fusion rate. The reported rates of pain improvement and neurologic recovery were favorable. The incidence of hardware failure and wound complications was 4.6% and 4.0%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite placing instrumentation during active infection, the rates of hardware failure and wound complications were comparable to those of elective cervical spine procedures. These results suggest that surgical intervention with instrumentation is a safe treatment option for patients with cervical spine osteomyelitis.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous infarction (CVI) is a rare vascular disease most commonly caused by cerebral venous thrombosis that leads to hemorrhage or infarct formation. A rabbit model of CVI was established by placing a recoverable epidural sacculus to research effects of increased pressure on CVI.
   METHODS: Rabbits were randomly divided into the following groups: A, CVI; B, 0.2-mL epidural sacculus placed on the basis of CVI; C, 0.4-mL. epidural sacculus; D, 0.6-mL epidural sacculus; E, sham operation. Two sacculus-release groups were then added, 8 hours (group F) and 24 hours (group G), on the basis of group D. Brain water content, extent of cerebral infarction, hemorheology indexes, D dimer, and fibrinogen were observed at 8, 24, and 48 hours after surgery.
   RESULTS: Brain water content was higher in groups A-D compared with group E with the exception of the 24-hour A group. Brain water content was significantly lower in sacculus-release groups compared with the 48-hour D group. Extent of cerebral infarction in group D was significantly higher at 24 and 48 hours compared with groups A and E. Extent of cerebral infarction in sacculusrelease groups was significantly lower compared with group D at 48 hours. Hemorheology indexes and fibrinogen were significantly higher in group D compared with groups A and E at corresponding time points and increased with increasing intracranial pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the rabbit model of CVI, degree of brain edema, extent of cerebral infarction, hemorheology indexes, and fibrinogen increased as intracranial pressure gradient increased, which may promote formation of a hypercoagulable state. Early removal of intracranial hypertension reduced degree of edema and extent of cerebral infarction in rabbits.

AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas are the 2 of the most common brain neoplasms in adults. However, distinguishing solitary metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas on conventional magnetic resonance imaging remains particularly challenging. Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (CE-FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing between metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with metastatic brain tumors and 14 patients with glioblastomas underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CE-FIESTA before surgery. First, 1 neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon classified the CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma by consensus. Next, the 2 neuroradiologists performed an observer performance study comparing tumor shape classification (smooth or irregular margins), a classic imaging finding, with the CE-FIESTA classification of the peritumoral brain parenchyma.
   RESULTS: The CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma were classified as follows: type A, no hyperintense rim; type B, partial hyperintense rim; and type C, extended hyperintense rim. With regard to the diagnosis of metastatic brain tumors, the observer performance study demonstrated that the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of an extended hyperintense rim classification (type C) on CE-FIESTA images were 95.3%, 85.7%, and 93.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the CE-FIESTA classification was significantly higher than that of the tumor shape classification.
   CONCLUSIONS: CE-FIESTA images may provide useful information for distinguishing metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas, especially when focusing on differences in the peritumoral brain parenchyma.

ID ALIGNMENT; PARAMETERS; LORDOSIS; BALANCE
AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze postoperative changes in cervical alignment in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with different curve patterns.
   METHODS: Radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed in 43 patients with AIS with right thoracic major curve versus 39 with major lumbar curve with a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Radiographic parameters analyzed in this study included cervical sagittal parameters (cervical lordosis [CL], T1 slope, T1 slope minus C2-C7 lordosis, T1-spine, T1 pelvic angle, and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis) and spinopelvic sagittal parameters obtained from radiographs. Paired t tests were used for comparison with 0.05 as a statistically significant threshold.
   RESULTS: At baseline, larger CL (5.69 degrees vs. - 5.12 degrees, P = 0.002) and smaller T1 slope minus C2-C7 lordosis (9.26 degrees vs. 17.09 degrees , P = 0.001) was noted in patients with lumbar-curve adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (l-AIS), whereas preoperative thoracic kyphosis (TK) was not different between the 2 groups. When the immediate postoperative sagittal profiles were compared between the 2 groups, larger TK (23.72 degrees vs. 18.86 degrees, P = 0.009) and more obvious CL (7.26 degrees vs. -2.60 degrees, P = 0.001) were noticed in the L-AIS group. During the follow-up, larger TK and CL were still maintained in the L-AIS group. In addition, a significant correlation was found between the improvement of CL and TK restoration in patients with L-AIS (r = - 0.473, P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between the improvement of CL and TK highlight the importance of restoration of patients with normal TK or AIS. Reciprocal changes in cervical alignment may happen if the TK was also simultaneously restored in patients with AIS. For patients with different curve patterns, the cervical sagittal parameters tend to be similar during follow-up.

ID ALIGNMENT; BALANCE; VOLUNTEERS; DEFORMITY; POSTURE
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to acquire the whole sagittal spine parameters and investigated the acceptable chin-brow vertical angle (CBVA) for neutral position radiography in an asymptomatic Chinese population.
   METHODS: The parameters measured in 257 asymptomatic volunteers included CBVA, occipital slope, orbital tilt, occipital incidence, C0-C2 Cobb angle, C2-C7 Cobb angle, C1-C7 Cobb angle, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis and absolute rotation angle, cervical tilt, cranial tilt, T1 slope, and thoracic kyphosis, and others. We used Pearson correlation analyses to find relationships between CBVA and other variables. The subjects were divided into 5 groups according to the CBVA percentile: group A, 0%-20% CBVA; group B, 20%-40% CBVA; group C, 40%-60% CBVA; group D, 60%-80% CBVA; and group E, 80%-100% CBVA. We used analysis of variance to analyze differences among the 5 groups.
   RESULTS: Orbital tilt, Occipital incidence, C1-C7 Cobb angle, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis, and cranial tilt all increased with increasing CBVA (P < 0.001). The occipital slope, C2-C7 Cobb angle, C2-C7 absolute rotation angle, cervical tilt, T1 slope, and thoracic kyphosis decreased with decreasing CBVA (P < 0.05). No correlations between other sagittal parameters and the CBVA were found. A slight deviation was found in groups B-D, with a greater deviation in groups A, C, and E.
   CONCLUSIONS: An acceptable range of -1.5 degrees to 5.8 degrees is recommended for the CBVA for cervical radiography in the neutral position. When spinal surgeons evaluate the cervical plane, the effects of the CBVA deviation on cervical curvature must be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: The role of the extent of surgical resection (EOR) in clinical outcomes for patients with low-grade glioma requires further examination. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the association between variable degrees of EOR and clinical outcomes for patients with low-grade glioma.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and searched databases for reports of low-grade glioma EOR. Eligible studies compared patient outcomes, including >= 2 categories of EOR (biopsy, resection of any extent, subtotal resection [STR], or gross total resection [GTR]). Treatment effects were evaluated using pooled estimates, mean differences, or risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random effects modeling.
   RESULTS: Our literature search yielded 60 studies with 13,289 patients. Pooled estimates of overall survival (OS) showed an increase from 3.79 years in the biopsy group to 6.68 years in STR to 10.65 years in GTR. OS was favorable with resection of any extent compared with (mean difference, 3.24; 95% CI, 0.64-5.84; P = 0.015). Pooled estimates of seizure control showed an improvement from 47.8% with biopsy to 54.2% with STR and 81.0% with GTR. Compared with STR, GTR delayed malignant transformation (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.93; P = 0.032), without increasing postoperative mortality (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.07-1.97; P = 0.250) or morbidity (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.65-2.28; P = 0.540).
   CONCLUSION: Among patients with low-grade gliomas, greater degrees of safe EOR were associated with longer OS and progression-free survival, better seizure control, and delayed malignant transformation, without increasing mortality or morbidity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the heterotopic ossification (HO) between cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) with fixed- and mobile-core prosthesis and to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent CDA in our institute. Patients were divided into a fixed-core group (Prodisc-C and Discover disc) and mobile-core group (Bryan and Prestige-LP disc). HO was assessed based on the McAfee classification. The visual analogue scale, Neck Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. In addition, radiographic assessments included cervical sagittal alignment (C2-C7 angle), segmental angle, and range of motion of the index level.
   RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were included with a minimal follow-up of 24 months. There were 137 patients in mobile-core group (Prestige-LP, 102; Bryan, 35) and 81 patients in the fixed-core group (Discover, 43; and Prodisc-C, 38). The mean follow-up time was 46.8 months. At the final follow-up, the overall incidence of HO was 39.9%. The incidence of HO in the fixed-core group was significantly greater than that in the mobile-core group (50.6% vs. 33.6%, P = 0.013). However, there were no significant differences in visual analogue scale, Neck Disability Index, or Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores, C2-C7 angle, segmental angle, or range of motion of the index level between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The fixed-core prosthesis had a greater incidence of HO than mobile-core prosthesis after CDA. However, both CDA with fixed- and mobile-core prostheses obtained good clinical outcomes and maintained cervical sagittal alignment.

AB BACKGROUND: The island sign is a novel imaging predictor for early hematoma growth, implying multifocal active bleeding. The prognostic value of the island sign for long-term outcome in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains unrevealed. The aim of this study is to investigate associations between the island land and longterm prognosis in patients with ICH.
   METHODS: Both clinical characteristics and radiologic parameters were retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records. According to the initial and follow-up computed tomography scans of patients, hematoma expansion and the island sign were determined independently with 2 experienced physicians. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations of hematoma expansion, 1-year poor outcome, and 1-year death on other clinical variables.
   RESULTS: A total of 322 patients were included, and 126 of them presented with early hematoma expansion, with 81 exhibiting the island sign. There were 116 patients who died, and 157 patients with ICH had poor outcome at the first year after onset. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, hematoma size, and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and island sign were strongly associated with long-term poor outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The island sign is an easy-to-use and novel imaging marker which predicts both early hematoma expansion and long-term poor prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: A ketogenic diet (KD) improves cellular metabolism and functional recovery after moderate-tosevere traumatic brain injury. Here, we evaluated the changes of neurochemical metabolites after KD therapy for repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBl) and its possible role in neurodegeneration.
   METHODS: Postnatal day 35 rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, control, and KD groups. Rats in control and KD groups were given 3 rmTBl by a fluid percussion traumatic brain injury device 24 hours apart. All rats were killed at 7 days after the last injury. The ipsilateral cortex were analyzed with hematoxylin and eosin staining; betahydroxybutyrate was measured; conventional magnetic resonance imaging and the dry-wet weight method were used to assess the brain edema; changes of neurochemical metabolites were assessed using the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), choline compound (Cho)/Cr, and NAA/Cho with magnetic resonance spectroscopy; the effect of KD therapy on neurodegeneration was evaluated with double immunofluorescence staining of lba-1/beclin-1; behavioral outcome was assessed with beam walk/ beam balance tests.
   RESULTS: KD significantly elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, and there was no brain edema associated with rmTBl and KD therapy; behavioral assessment showed KD therapy significantly improved motor performance; magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that rmTBl reduced the ratio of NAA/Cr and had no effect on the ratios of Cho/Cr and NAA/ Cho whereas KD increased the ratio of NAA/Cr; double immunofluorescence staining showed KD therapy could significantly decrease microglial beclin-1 expression in the ipsilateral cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the effect of KD on metabolic status and its possible role in preventing neurodegeneration in adolescent rats after rmTBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a new posterior fusion technique composed of bilateral C1 titanium cables and C2 pedicle screw-rods for treatment of atlantoaxial instability not suitable for C1 screw placement.
   METHODS: A study was conducted of 18 patients with atlantoaxial instability who had C1 broken screw trajectory or anatomic anomalies. All patients underwent posterior fixation with bilateral C1 titanium cables and C2 pedicle screws. The follow-up period was a minimum 1 year. Clinical outcomes measurements included visual analog scale score for neck pain assessment, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for neurologic status and function. According to preoperative computed tomography (CT) reconstruction and CT angiography, the patients selected in this study were not suitable for C1 screw placement. Postoperative plain radiographs and CT reconstruction were performed to evaluate the reduction, bony fusion, and implant position. All outcomes were evaluated at each follow-up.
   RESULTS: The average clinical follow-up period was 24 months (range 12-36 months). All patients had complete neck pain relief at postoperative 6 months. Their neurologic symptoms had improved significantly at 1-year follow-up. Radiologic outcomes indicated good bony fusion and construction stability in all patients without implant failure at the last follow-up. No neural or vascular complications related to this technique were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Posterior atlantoaxial fixation using C1 titanium cables and C2 pedicle screw-rod construct appears to be an effective and safe technique for treatment of atlantoaxial instability, which could he an alternative method for cases unsuitable for C1 screw placement when using C1-C2 screw fixation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) bifurcation angles with hemodynamic stresses for aneurysm initiation.
   METHODS: Forty patients with or without anterior communicating artery aneurysms were enrolled, and 3 patients with ACA bifurcation angles of 169.0 degrees, 136.9 degrees, and 73.2 degrees, respectively, were entered into computational fluid dynamics analysis for hemodynamic stresses.
   RESULTS: Larger bifurcation angles had a larger direct flow impinging zone and larger peak pressure area. In the direct flow impinging center, the total pressure was the highest, whereas the other stresses were the lowest. As blood flowed distally, the total pressure decreased rapidly, whereas all other parameters increased quickly to their peaks. The hemodynamic peak distance was decreased as the bifurcation angle became narrower. The total pressure summit and the peak hemodynamic stresses all decreased with the decrease of bifurcation angles. The distance between the hemodynamic peaks was the smallest at 73.2 degrees compared with larger angles. A significant (P < 0.01) positive linear correlation existed in the ACA bifurcation angle with the distance between hemodynamic stress peaks or in the ACA branch diameter with the distance from the direct impinging center to the ipsilateral hemodynamic stress peak. The hemodynamic stresses on the aneurysm dome were significantly (P < 0.001) smaller than at the aneurysm initiation site.
   CONCLUSIONS: Larger bifurcation angles may lead to abnormally enhanced hemodynamic stresses, enlarged zones of direct flow impingement, and increased distance between hemodynamic stress peaks to damage the vascular wall for aneurysm initiation on the bifurcation apex wall.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior percutaneous endoscopic cervical foraminotomy and diskectomy has remarkably evolved with successful results. Although percutaneous endoscopic cervical diskectomy (PECD) has gained popularity, the risk of surgical failure may be a major obstacle to performing PECD. We analyzed unsuccessful cases requiring reoperation. The objective of this article was to find common causes of surgical failure and elucidate the limitations of the conventional PECD technique.
   METHODS: Surgery-related complications were reviewed from the initial 252 cases of a single surgeon. The patients had cervical disk herniation or radiculopathy and underwent percutaneous endoscopic surgical management. We investigated clinical outcomes and complications. A retrospective review was performed on all patients who had undergone PECD between April 2013 and April 2016. Unsuccessful PECD was defined as a case requiring reoperation within 6 weeks after primary surgery. Chart review was done, and pre-, intra-, and postoperative radiographic reviews were performed. All unsuccessful PECD cases were classified according to the type of herniated disc, location of herniation, extruded disk migration, working channel position, and intra- and postoperative findings.
   RESULTS: The mean operative time was 89.4 minutes (range, 60-180 minutes). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 20.3 mL (range, 10-800 mL). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 1 patient and healed well. The followup period ranged from 24 to 60 months. The mean score on the visual analog scale improved from 8.67 + 1.30 preoperatively to 7.83 +/- 1.40 at 1 month postoperatively to 1.67 +/- 1.30 at the final follow-up (P < 0.05), with a recovery rate of 67.9% +/- 21.2%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should be aware of the specific complications for the PECD approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty is a routine procedure, but it carries a significantly higher complication rate over standard clean cranial surgery. Surgical site infection is the most common but severe complication. Risk factors for surgical site infection are still debated.
   METHODS: A retrospective survey of 155 patients (>= 16 years old) who exclusively underwent customized titanium cranioplasty from April 2014 to January 2017 was performed. Preoperative clinical parameters, surgeon's hemostasis technique, temporalis dissection, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative catheter duration and drainage, postoperative hemorrhage and extradural fluid collection (EDFC), and prophylactic antibiotics were recorded and compared between patients with superficial surgical site infection (sSSI) and patients with non-sSSI.
   RESULTS: Overall sSSI rate was 10.3%. Binary logistic analysis showed excessive hemostasis on scalp (odds ratio = 10.302, P = 0.000), presence of postoperative EDFC (odds ratio = 12.740, P = 0.003), and postoperative drainage >277 ml (odds ratio = 10.302, P = 0.000) were independent risk factors for sSSI. Patients who received excessive hemostasis had a longer operative time (P = 0.000). A flaccid cranial defect was a protective factor for postoperative EDFC (odds ratio = 0.130, P = 0.044), whereas presence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt could induce EDFC formation (odds ratio = 9.598, P = 0.020). Postoperative subgaleal drainage was correlated to the size of cranial defect (standardized beta = 0.347, P = 0.000). Timing of cranioplasty and use of prophylactic antibiotics were not related to sSSI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should lower the hemostasis standard for cranioplasty, as this would promote wound healing and reduce operative time, which subsequently decreases SSI rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracranial stenting as a rescue therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) after stentriever thrombectomy failure.
   METHODS: Patients who received intracranial stenting as a rescue therapy for AIS after failure of stent retrieval with or without concomitant treatment between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Recanalization results and outcome at 3 months were assessed, and perioperative complications related to the procedure were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 193 patients with AIS received stent retriever thrombectomy. Initial successful recanalization with stent retriever was achieved in 125 patients. Among the 68 patients with stent retrieval failure, 47 patients received stent placement as rescue therapy, and successful recanalization was achieved in 38 patients. The rate of successful recanalization, favorable outcome at 90 days, mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were comparable between the stenting group and no-stenting group; however, the time from groin puncture to recanalization was significantly longer in the stenting group (P = 0.03). Compared with anterior circulation stroke, the rate of stent placement was significantly greater (P = 0.041) and the intracerebral hemorrhage rate was lower in the patients with posterior circulation stroke who received stent placement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial stenting as a rescue therapy for AIS after failure of Solitaire retrieval stent is feasible and safe. AIS of posterior circulation showed greater intracranial stent placement than anterior circulation.

AB Pumped thermal electricity storage (PTES) using packed bed is an attractive large-scale energy storage technology. The performance of conventional PTES is limited by the existing technology of compressor, such as low isentropic efficiency and cannot bear high temperature. In this work, a high temperature PTES (HT-PTES) based on an additional electric heater is proposed to enhance the energy storage capacity of PTES. Waste heat, which produced due to the irreversibility of heating, compression and expansion process of both PTES and HT-PTES, is recovered by the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to generate power. Air and argon (Ar) are investigated as working fluid for PTES and air is selected due to its high thermal performance and economy. Five types of PTES combined with ORC system namely, PTES, HT-PTES, PTES + ORC, HT-PTES + ORC and HT-PTES + parallel ORC are investigated based on transient analysis method. The simulation results show that combined with ORC is an effective approach to improve the round trip efficiency (RTE) of both PTES and HT-PTES. In the five types of combined systems, the HT-PTES + parallel ORC is considered as a more promising large-scale energy storage technology which advantages can be illustrated as follows: (1) it with an acceptable RTE of 47.67%, which is 5.68% higher that of HT-CAES and is only 2.46% lower than the maximum RTE of the five types; (2) it shows an appropriate operating pressure, which are 1.05 MPa for HT-PTES subsystem and 12.20 MPa for ORC subsystem (significantly lower than that of 31.2 MPa for ORC in the HT-PTES + ORC); (3) it presents a considerable energy storage density of 218.69 MJ/m(3), which is more than twice that of PTES + ORC (88.14 MJ/m(3)).

AB Multi-Source Systems combining renewable energy sources with diesel generators have been widely adopted in isolated sites. The economic and ecological aspects are very important for analyzing and evaluating such systems. In this paper, an optimization approach that includes the former aspects has been proposed. This approach takes into account the changes in the fuel cost over a lifecycle and the minimization of the greenhouse gas emission. The proposed method is based on three main steps. At first, a fuel cost progression model over a period of 40 years has been developed. Second, due to the complexity of such systems and in order to simplify the modeling, meta-models have been extracted by using the Design of Experiments technique. Finally, Single Objective and Multi-Objective Optimization of the system based on economic and ecological criteria have been performed. The obtained results show that, changes in fuel costs have a significant influence on the sizing of the system. Indeed, the increase in fuel cost can lead to an increase of 18% in the design cost. The best solution on Pareto's curve was found with a reduction rate in the fuel consumption between 30 and 35%. Furthermore, the optimization algorithm favors the introduction of renewable sources.

AB As a passive energy technology, the earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) can greatly contribute to reducing the energy consumption of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. In a traditional EAHE, the cooling/heating effect is achieved through the charging/discharging process of soil sensible heat. However, this process is detrimental to fully develop its potential. Considering that the phase change-based thermal energy storage technology has outstanding advantages in this regard, a new system named phase change material (PCM)-filled EAHE is proposed to overcome this deficiency. To study the cooling performance of this new system, a three-dimensional numerical model based on the effective heat capacity method has been built in ANSYS FLUENT and validated using an indoor test rig, which was filled with some laboratory-prepared shape stabilized PCM. Then comparative studies between the PCM-filled EAHEs and the traditional one are conducted under Chongqing (China) summer condition. The results indicate that, at the daily maximum outdoor temperature, the outlet temperature of the PCM-filled EAHE, which employs the laboratory-prepared shape-stabilized PCM, is approximately 0.83 C lower than that of the traditional EAHE. Therefore, this PCM-filled EAHE can achieve an improvement of 20.24% in cooling capacity compared to the traditional one.

AB The selection of working fluids other than air is a key issue in improving the efficiency of new thermodynamic cycles intended for low-to-moderate temperature small power plants. The aim of this paper is to study whether the low efficiency typical of small turbomachinery is still a problem when using alternative fluids. Based on a new design of power cycles named balanced hybrid Rankine-Brayton cycles, five different fluids were selected as potential working fluids: carbon dioxide, propane, isobutane, pentafluoroethane and sulfur hexafluoride. Dimensional analysis was used to compare the performances of a micro-scale centrifugal compressor working in homologous points where the efficiency variation depends only on the Reynolds-number (Re). The influence of Re on efficiency was calculated by means of four different methods for comparative purposes. Numerical simulations were also carried out in order to validate the methodological approach proposed. The results show the efficiency variations as a function of Re for increasing fluid densities. All the non-conventional fluids studied provide better performance in terms of efficiency than air. Particularly, isobutane and propane have been identified as potential working fluids candidates for the aforementioned innovative power cycle.

AB In this paper, a new exact method has been presented to extract physical parameters of single diode equivalent circuit modelling a photovoltaic solar module operating at standard test conditions. The method uses four equations, three are linking output current to output voltage in short-circuit, maximum power and open-circuit points, the fourth equation is the first derivative of output power with regard to output voltage in maximal power point. According to this method, we used ideality factor eta as variation parameter and solved the system of four nonlinear equations to get values of photocurrent I-ph, saturation current I-s, series resistance R-s and shunt conductance G(p). We then varied ideality factor to minimize root mean square error and maximize the coefficient of determination. We assumed series resistance and shunt conductance constant, and derived analytical expressions describing effects of module temperature and incident solar irradiance on photocurrent, on ideality factor and also on saturation current using both temperature coefficients available as well as irradiance coefficients extracted from module datasheet. We considered standard test conditions numerical values of physical parameters as initial conditions and determined numerical models for I-ph(T,G), eta(T,G) and I-s(T,G). We also derived new mathematical expressions of maximum power point voltage and module efficiency. We tested these numerical models as well as mathematical expressions derived on Kyocera KC200GT and Shell SQ80 photovoltaic solar modules under different conditions of module temperature and incident solar irradiance and found good agreement between experimental and forecasted characteristics.

AB The transportation of thermal energy is essential for users who are located far away from heat sources. The networks connecting them achieve the goal in efficient heat delivery and reasonable cost, especially for the users with large heat demands. However, it is difficult to satisfy the heat supply of the detached or emergent users with the existing pipelines. Therefore, a promising alternative, called mobilized thermal energy storage (M-TES), was proposed to deliver the heat flexibly without the restriction of networks. In this paper, a review of studies on M-TES is conducted in terms of materials, containers and economic evaluation. The potential candidates of materials, such as sugar alcohols, hydrated salts, alkalies and zeolite are reviewed and compared based on their thermophysical properties, price, advantages and disadvantages. Various containers, including the shell-and tube, encapsulated, direct-contact, detachable and sorptive types, are discussed from the aspects of configuration, performance and utilization. Furthermore, the studies on the economic evaluation of M-TES systems are summarized and discussed based on the analysis of the economic indicators, including initial cost, operating cost, revenue, subsidy and energy cost. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for developing M-TES are presented.

AB The recent boom in distributed generation together with decreases in the cost of technology has resulted in photovoltaic energy becoming the most widely used means of producing electricity in buildings.
   Analysing this technology requires models that use the data available in the manufacturers' catalogues to study energetic and economic impact of the different commercial solutions available. Furthermore, if the model is to be integrated into a complex simultaneous simulation algorithm for different solutions, it should have a low computational cost.
   The electricity output of photovoltaic modules is characterized by the I-V response according to the ambient temperature. A review of the literature leads to the conclusion that existing models are difficult to parameterize using the data available in the technical product datasheets.
   This study presents an explicit, simplified model to determine the characteristic I-V curve of photovoltaic modules by means of a direct link with the data available in the catalogues of manufacturers.
   The model's validity and quality of results it provides have been tested on a sample of 259 modules of different brands, sizes and technologies, as well as under varying operating conditions.
   The explicit model proposed is highly accurate, easy to reproduce, and can be adapted to the parameters found in most manufacturers' catalogues.

The exergy loss during the day time comprises the exergy destruction in the main components of the SS like basin plate, brine water, glazier plate and insulation material. The hourly convective, evaporative and radiative heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) with and without micro/nano particles were determined. The exergy destruction in various components of the SS have been analyzed and a solution was suggested. Results revealed that the exergy of evaporation, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of MSSs were higher than that of the classical one. The daytime energy efficiencies of MSSs with graphite and CuO were 41.18% and 38.61%, respectively, but for the CSS was only 29.17%. The diurnal productivity of the MSSs was increased by 41.18% and 32.35% for graphite and CuO, respectively, compared with CSS. Moreover, the diurnal exergy efficiencies of MSSs were 4.32% and 3.78% for graphite and CuO respectively, while exergy efficiency for CSS was 2.63%. Furthermore, the costs of water production were found to be approximately 0.20, 0.21 and 0.24 RMB/L (1 RMB = 0.15 US $) when using MSS with CuO, MSS with graphite and CSS, respectively.

AB Reusing as many existing heat exchangers as possible is one of the most important strategies in retrofitting of heat exchanger networks, which can reduce investment costs and increase heat recovery in the process industry. However, the performance degradation of the existing heat exchangers due to the rough increase or decrease of the heat exchange area during the reuse of the heat exchanger seriously affects the effective implementation of the heat exchanger network retrofit scheme. To fully evaluate the performance of a heat exchanger network, a new methodology for heat exchanger network retrofit is proposed in this work. The performance simulation is introduced into heat exchanger network retrofit model to reassess the performance of reused heat exchange units. The temperature distribution and heat load distribution in the network are corrected. So the performance indicators of the retrofitted network can be accurately evaluated and then the optimal decision can be made. Genetic algorithm is adopted for the optimization of the proposed retrofit problem. Case studies show that the proposed retrofit method can achieve energy saving of 7-59% with a relatively short payback period of investment, and energy recovery of the retrofitted network can reach 59-79%.

AB This experimental work evaluates the potential of 1-octanol, di-n-butyl ether and three intermediate blends as substitutes of the diesel fuel to be used in compression ignition engines. For this purpose, performance and engine-out emissions measurements have been done in a single-cylinder engine of 0.39 L displacement and 15:1 compression ratio at four engine operating conditions representative of the new European driving cycle (NEDC) driving cycle. The tests have been done keeping constant the NOx emissions and combustion center for all the fuels at each operating point. To achieve this, the exhaust gas recirculation rate and the start of injection timing were modified simultaneously for each fuel tested, while the rest of the engine settings were kept constant. All the biomass-derived fuels have the same oxygen content but substantially different cetane number and volatility.
   The results show that, for the same NOx levels, all the fuels allow a substantial reduction of the soot emissions versus diesel due to both the higher oxygen content in the fuel molecule and/or the extended mixing time achieved because of the lower fuel reactivity. In terms of efficiency, all the alternative fuels improve the fuel-to-work conversion efficiency. This benefit comes from decreasing the heat transfer in a greater way than the exhaust losses increase. Moreover, in general terms, all the fuels promote a reduction of the combustion losses to halve of those found with diesel.

AB The results of digital and continuous rate shaping strategies are discussed for a low temperature combustion diesel engine. The outcomes show a high potential of these injection schedules for the management of the trade-off between engine out emissions, fuel consumption and combustion noise. However, a weak point has emerged concerning the high value of the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective pressure. This is due to instability of the mass that is injected in a multiple injection when the injection shots are closely coupled.
   An innovative closed-loop control strategy of the injected mass is developed for multiple injections. Pressure time histories, measured along the rail-to-injector pipe, are used to infer the instantaneous mass flow-rate entering the injector. This flow-rate is integrated between two optimized time instants and the thus calculated fuel mass results to correlate well with the injected mass.
   The new control strategy has been implemented in rapid prototyping hardware and tests have been performed at the hydraulic rig. The prototypal fuel injection system controls the injected mass with an accuracy of 2 mg over the entire dwell time range. A significant improvement has been observed, compared to state-of-the-art injection systems, in the stability of the injected mass for the closely coupled injections.

AB Use of an efficient cooling system is critical from the performance viewpoint of solar thermoelectric generation (STEG) systems. This study proposes the use of spray cooling as an effective technique for use in applications involving STEG systems. A mathematical model has been established to analyze STEG systems from the perspective of net generating efficiency and output power. Results demonstrate that compared to water-cooling, use of the spray-cooling technique results in enhanced generating efficiency, especially under high concentration ratios, owing to inherent advantages, such as high heat transfer performance, low power consumption, and no contact resistance. At a concentration ratio of roughly 200, the net generating efficiency when using spray cooling was observed to be 31.3% higher compared to that achieved when using water cooling. Under conditions of fixed module parameters and structure, there exist optimum values of the spray flow rate and concentration ratio that result in maximization of the net generating efficiency of STEG systems. This maximum efficiency of 13.203% occurs at a concentration ratio of 165 and corresponding flow rate of 0.35 L.min(-1), at ZT = 1. Additionally, the net generating efficiency can be further enhanced by reducing the temperature of cooling water. The structural parameter gamma is proposed to characterize the geometry of the thermoelectric module. As observed, there exists an optimum value of gamma as well that tends to maximize the net generating efficiency of the system. Moreover, this optimum value of gamma gradually increases with increase in concentration ratio. Results also demonstrate that optimum values of the spray flow rate and concentration ratio follow an approximately linear increase with increase in the ZT value of STEG modules.

AB A novel strategy using the Sobol'-Simulated Annealing algorithm was proposed to reduce the number of optimization steps and guarantee the accuracy of a molten salt solar power tower plant design. The new method combined the Sobol' method and the Simulated Annealing algorithm for global sensitivity analysis and global optimization, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the high-dimension global optimization problem was transformed into several low-dimension global optimization problems by parameter decoupling. In order to obtain the global minimum levelized cost of electricity of the solar power tower plant, these low-dimension models were successively optimized by utilizing the Simulated Annealing algorithm. A reference case study of the solar power tower plant with 2650 heliostats was conducted. The heliostat field, receiver, thermal storage system and power block were designed as a function of 12 parameters. It was demonstrated that the parameters related to the heliostat field and receiver were almost independent. The minimum levelized cost of electricity of 22.22 (sic)/kWh(e) was obtained. Furthermore, a comparison with the global algorithm and local algorithm showed that the novel method could reduce the number of optimization steps by approximately 75% compared with that of the global algorithm. A much more accurate optimal design than that of the local algorithm can be achieved herewith.

AB In this paper the authors develop a decision tool that is based on real options analysis and that supports flexibility investment decisions concerning upgrades of conventional lignite-fired power plants. The value of the power plant is influenced both by technical and economic variables, the latter including subsidies. The four-step approach proposed allows to determine the optimal operation strategy in light of electricity and fuel price developments, to simulate the expected project value, to determine the expected changes of the project value over time, and finally to derive the optimal management (investment/disinvestment) decision. For the case of an existing lignite-fired power plant in Germany, we find that the plant can only be operated profitably without any modifications until the end of its technical lifetime if current government subsidies persist. In the absence of subsidies, however, it is preferable to stop operation immediately. The analysis also shows that profitable investments in a number of flexibility retrofit measures are possible, the ranking of which depends, however, on the costs and benefits related to the retrofitting measures, as well as their implementation time.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for simulating engine/vehicle responses of a non-stationary test cycle by means of few steady-state operating modes, which can greatly reduce testing costs and time. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the application of a mapping from the engine working region to a square domain, which allows testing any design of experiments (DoE) regardless of the testing cycle, vehicle or engine. In this new working space (mapped region) it is easy to apply a DoE that satisfies optimality conditions. The validation of the methodology is based on experimental data obtained from the New European Driving Cycle. Firstly, the methodology consists in determining which representative responses can be instantaneously and/or cumulatively approximated via a low degree polynomial function (smooth surfaces) and, secondly, in performing a DoE analysis in the mapped working region where the points defining each DoE are placed. An approach function for each response is developed based on DoE tested points. Subsequently, this model allows simulating vehicle responses during the transient test. For the studied validation case, results show that main engine performance responses can be instantaneously and cumulatively predicted with high accuracy by means of a DoE with few runs. On the other hand, this analysis reveals a cumulative predicted response of confidence for regulated exhaust emissions, but not for the instantaneous values. These findings support future studies to determine the optimal DoE which minimizes testing time and costs with a satisfactory and accurate estimation of engine responses.

AB Thermal analyses of 284 repetitive single crystallization events were carried out. In particular, the isothermal liquid-to-crystal transformation kinetics of Poisson-distributed and non-Gaussian shaped exothermic DSC signals are calculated individually and by superimposition. It is found that modes of impingement for anisotropic growth, random and regular dispersions fail to accurately predict the growth exponent if a single crystal or a low number of crystals are growing. Non-stationary effects are evident at low and large crystal fractions which diminish when virtual signals of multiple crystallization events are superimposed. The results show that the precise analytic formulation to calculate the degree of transformation relies on an ensemble of crystals growing simultaneously. Where this is not the case, as in glass-forming liquids cooled from above liquidus temperature, the proper approach is to use a time-averaged signal of repetitive crystallization runs.

AB We have investigated the occurrence of the sometimes observed grain boundaries, as initial seed is extended to form line in laser-fabricated single-crystal architecture in glass (SCAG). In particular, for Sb2S3 SCAG in Sb-S-I glass as a model system, grain boundaries are formed during the transition from laser-written initial seed dot to crystal line. Such grain boundaries during the growth of Sb2S3 crystals occur in 16SbI(3)-84Sb(2)S(3) glass, whereas they are absent in Sb2S3 glass. We correlate this difference in tendency to form multiple grains with the relative glass forming ability i.e. the dynamics of nucleation and crystal growth as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). On the basis of this understanding, methods to minimize the appearance of grain boundaries in the transition region are suggested.

AB The ALaE glass with eutectic composition (76.2 mol% Al2O3, 23.8 mol% La2O3) and the ALaP glass with LaAl2O3 (lanthanum-aluminium perovskite) composition (50 mol% Al2O3, 50 mol% La2O3) were prepared by combination of sol-gel Pechini method and flame synthesis in the form of glass microspheres (diameter approximate to 10 mu m). The prepared glasses were characterized by OM, SEM, XRD and DSC. The prepared samples contained only completely re-melted spherical particles. However, more detailed study by SEM revealed small fraction of crystalline microspheres. Traces of crystalline LaAlO3 were detected in X-ray powder diffraction patterns of both glasses. DSC analysis in the temperature range 35-1200 degrees C with heating rates 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 degrees C/min was performed in nitrogen atmosphere to study the thermal behaviour and crystallization kinetics of prepared glasses. In the DSC curve of the eutectic ALaE glass recorded at 10 degrees C/min two exothermic effects were observed at 920 and 936 degrees. Only one exothermic effect at 868 degrees C was present in the DSC curve of the ALaP sample with perovskite composition. The high-temperature X-ray powder diffraction analysis was carried out in the temperature interval 25-1200 degrees C. For both compositions formation of LaAlO3 as the main crystalline phase was observed in the whole measured temperature range. In order to study the crystallization kinetics, the DSC curves were transformed into dependence of fractional extent of crystallization, alpha on temperature. The JMAK model was found suitable for description of crystallization kinetics of both studied systems. The kinetic parameters (A, E-app and m) were calculated for this model and crystallization mechanisms have been proposed.

AB The effect of a post-synthesis thermal treatment on CoCr2-2 Psi Al2 Psi O4 (0.0 <= Psi <= 1.0) ceramic pigments synthesized by Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS) has been studied. As-synthesized SCS pigments were treated at two different calcination temperatures (800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C) to study changes in mineralogy, microstructure and thermal behaviour, as well as their effect over the colouring power.
   Spinel-type Fd-3m crystalline structure was developed in all cases. Nevertheless, crystallinity parameters were highly affected by both analysed processing parameters: composition (Psi) and post-synthesis calcination temperature (T-c). A Cr(III) enrichment along with T-c increase favoured ion rearrangement to promote sample crystallization and crystallite growth. Fast kinetics of SCS makes Al-rich spinels with transition metals difficult to be synthesized. The application of a secondary thermal treatment resulted in a favourable evolution towards a well-crystallized structure. Lattice parameter did not seem to be affected by T-c, although it evolved indeed with composition. From a microstructural point of view, as-synthesized pigments were foamy, with a very low bulk density and nanometric grain size. After the thermal treatment, larger grain sizes were obtained, especially for the samples richer in Al and treated at higher T-c.
   All pigments developed intense colours in a transparent glaze without showing heterogeneities, indicating a stable behaviour against glazing process. Glaze colour evolved from green to perfectly blue shades, indicating an important dependence on composition. Nevertheless, colouring power seemed to be rather affected by calcination process.

AB Glasses with compositions of 21Gd(2)O(3).63MoO(3)-(16-x)B2O3-xTeO(2) (mol%) (x = 0, 2, 4, 8) were prepared using a conventional melt quenching technique, and the crystallization behavior of ferroelastic beta'-Gd-2(MoO4)(3) crystals was examined to clarify the mechanism of self-powdering phenomenon and to design bulk crystallized glasses. It was found that the self-powdering phenomenon appeared significantly during the crystallization at temperatures near the crystallization peak temperature, but the phenomenon is suppressed in the crystallization at temperatures much higher than the glass transition temperature. It was also found that the substitution of TeO2 for B2O3 in the base glasses suppresses the self-powdering phenomenon and consequently bulk crystallized glasses were obtained in the glass with x = 8 mol%. The densities at room temperature of the base glasses are d = 4.755-4.906 g/cm(3), being much higher than the value of d = 4.555 g/cm(3) for beta-Gd-2(NoO4)(3) crystal. It is proposed that the stresses in the inside of crystals induced by large density differences (i.e., large molar volume differences) between the glassy phase and crystals might be relaxed effectively in the glasses containing TeO2 with weak Te-O bonds and fragile character.

AB In the present study, crystallization behavior of tungsten molybdenum tellurite glasses was investigated by non isothermal methods using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Thermal properties of glasses were investigated to calculate the values of glass transition temperature (T-g), crystallization temperature (T-c/T-p), temperature difference (Delta T), thermal stability (S), glass transition activation energy (E-g) and fragility parameter (m). Average cross-link density ((n(c)) over bar) values were calculated for the physical investigation of the glasses. The crystallization kinetics was studied at different heating rates and the values of Avrami constant (n) and morphology index (m) were calculated from the Ozawa equation and the activation energy of crystallization (E-c) was determined using the modified Kissinger equation. The crystallized and/or transformed phases and their morphologies were determined by XRD and SEM analysis. Studied glass compositions were found to be thermally stable, resistant to crystallization and therefore suitable for opto-electronic applications.

AB Tb3+-doped BaF2-Al2O3-B2O3 glass and glass-ceramic were synthesized, and the luminescence properties were investigated for potential applications in radiation measurements. The glass-ceramic can be obtained by heat treating the glass, and it includes BaAlBO3F2 crystalline phase in glass matrix. The photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield is higher for glass than glass-ceramic. The reason can be due to the difference of the number of F- and O2- ions surrounding Tb3+ activator ion. The lifetime of PL is slightly shorter than that of scintillation suggesting energy transfer process from the host to Tb3+ is involved. The time-response of scintillation has significantly slow rise feature possibly due to excited state absorption. Both glass and glass-ceramic show efficient optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) with equivalent sensitivities despite the large difference of PL efficiency. The latter observation suggests that the glass-ceramic includes large number of OSL active centres than glass. The OSL dynamic range was confirmed to be at least 10(1)-10(4) mGy.

AB Oxyfluoride lead-based and lead-free germanate glasses were heat-treated in order to fabricate transparent glass ceramics. Cubic beta-PbF2 nanocrystals are well formed during crystallization of lead germanate glass. The up conversion luminescence spectra of Er3+ ions in lead germanate glass-ceramic system are enhanced significantly due to partial incorporation of the optically active ions into fluoride crystalline phase. These effects are not significant in oxyfluoride lead-free germanate glass after heat treatment process. The crystallization of barium gallo-germanate glass with BaF2 is more complex and the presence of four crystalline phases BaF2, BaO, Ba3Ga2Ge4O14 and GeO2 was verified by X-ray diffraction measurements.

AB We examined the optical and luminescence properties of BaO-TiO2-SiO2 (BTS) glasses and BTS glass-ceramics (GCs). The 40BaO-20TiO(2)-40SiO(2) (BTS40) GC obtained by heat treatment at glass transition temperature (T-g) + 50 degrees C exhibited bulk crystallization, whereas surface crystallization was obtained for the 33.3BaO-16.7TiO2-50SiO(2) (BTS50) and 30BaO-15TiO(2)-55SiO(2) (BTS55) GCs by the same heat treatment. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation spectra changed depending on the chemical composition. After crystallization, the peaks of the PL and the scintillation spectra were blue-shifted, indicating the local coordination change of the Ti species. A large enhancement of X-ray induced scintillation was observed in the BTS40 system, though the precursor BTS40 glass exhibited lower scintillation intensity despite its higher effective atomic number (Z(eff)). Since the volume fraction of Ba2TiSi2O8 crystallites in the BTS40 GC is higher than the other GCs, the enhancement in scintillation intensity reflects an increase in number density of emission centers in Ba2TiSi2O8 crystallites after crystallization.

AB The crystallization mechanism of LaF3 in sol-gel oxyfluoride glass-ceramics in the system SiO2-LaF3 has been studied using DTA, XRD, FTIR, HRTEM and NMR. Based on classical calculations of non-isothermal DTA curves involving Ozawas's plots, a diffusion-controlled process should be responsible for the fluorides crystallization similarly to that obtained for melt-quenching oxyfluoride glass-ceramics. Therefore, an increase of the crystal size and fraction is expected when increasing the time and/or temperature of the treatment. Nevertheless, XRD, FIR, HRTEM and NMR demonstrated that neither bigger crystals nor higher crystal fraction are obtained for treatment times longer than 1 min at 550 degrees C. However, further heat treatment causes that the structural order of the crystals is lost. On the other hand, typical fluorides crystallization temperatures (similar to 300 degrees C) in sol-gel materials are much lower than T-g of the matrix (similar to 1130 degrees C) thus being very different to what observed for oxyfluoride glasses prepared by melt-quenching. The proposed crystallization mechanism is a fast process that occurs when crystallization temperature is reached. This behavior is explained as a chemical reaction from the xerogels, followed by the fast precipitation of the nanocrystals without energy barrier. The nanocrystals are unstable in the surrounding SiO2 matrix for aging at crystallization or higher temperatures. These treatments lead to a dissolution process, favored by the compositional gradient between matrix and crystals, which drive the material to reach the equilibrium.

AB Crystallization behavior of Na2FeyMn1 - -yP2O7 glass prepared by conventional melt-quenching method was examined. And its electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties are also examined. Less than y = 0.25 layered type triclinic phase formed as main phase by heat-treatment at crystallization temperature. The other composition triclinic beta phase mainly precipitated. By further heat-treatment up to 650 degrees C, crystalline phase completely transformed to beta phase in all composition. For the reversible discharge capacity of Na2FeyMn1 - yP2O7 increased by increase of the FeO substitution in both glassy state and glass-ceramics. It is found that Mn3+ /Mn2+ redox reaction in Na2Fe0.25Mn0.75P2O7 glass-ceramic cathode is activated and higher voltage plateau appeared at 3.8 V.

AB Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) draining into the perimedullary venous system are rare and potentially life-threatening lesions often presenting as a myelopathy. The early and proper diagnosis of this rare disease is challenging because the symptoms are nonspecific. Acute clinical deterioration in patients with spinal DAVFs treated with steroid administration has been described. Here we report a case of cervical myelopathy caused by intracranial DAVF with acute worsening after steroid administration. The lesion was successfully treated with endovascular Onyx embolization.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Editorial Material
DE Anatomical variant; Aneurysm; Balloon; Coil embolization; Duplicated
   middle cerebral artery
AB A duplicated middle cerebral artery (dMCA) is a rare anatomical variant that can be associated with aneurysm formation and rupture. The dMCA arises from the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery, with the caudal trunk supplying the temporal lobe and the cranial trunk supplying the frontal lobe and the lenticulostriate perforators. Previous reported cases were all treated with open surgical clipping with or without cerebral revascularization to reconstruct the dMCA. We present a rare case of a young woman with a ruptured dMCA (subtype B) aneurysm. We have demonstrated the unique anatomical relationship among the dMCA, internal carotid artery, and the anterior choroidal artery. Understanding and preserving the dMCA anatomy is essential in such cases to prevent ischemic complications. This was achieved endovascularly by balloon remodeling and coil embolization of the aneurysm in this location.

ID CHILDHOOD NARCOLEPSY; DISORDERS; LAUGHTER; FEATURES; ONSET
AB Objective: Although being the most specific symptom of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), cataplexy is currently investigated by clinical interview only, with potential diagnostic pitfalls. Our study aimed at testing the accuracy of an automatic video detection of cataplexy in NT1 patients vs. non-cataplectic subjects undergoing a standardized test with emotional stimulation.
   Methods: Fifteen drug-naive NT1 patients and 15 age-and sex-balanced non-cataplectic subjects underwent a standardized video recording procedure including emotional stimulation causing laughter. Video recordings were visually inspected by human scorers to detect three typical cataplexy facial motor patterns (ptosis, mouth opening and head drop), and then analysed by SHIATSU (Semantic-based HIearchical Automatic Tagging of videos by Segmentation using cUts). Expert-based and automatic attack detection was compared in NT1 patients and non-cataplectic subjects.
   Results: All NT1 patients and none of the non-cataplectic subjects displayed cataplexy during emotional stimulation. Automatic detection correlated well with experts' assessments in NT1 with an overall accuracy of 81%. In non-cataplectic subjects, automatic detection falsely identified cataplexy in two out of 15 (13.3%) subjects who showed active eyes closure during intense laughter as a confounder with ptosis.
   Conclusions: Automatic cataplexy detection by applying SHIATSU to a standardized test for video documentation of cataplexy is feasible, with an overall accuracy of 81% compared to human examiners. Further studies are warranted to enlarge the range of elementary motor patterns detected, analyse their temporal/spatial relations and quantify cataplexy for diagnostic purposes.

AB Background: No studies have examined the associations between the numbers of teeth and sleep disturbance. Therefore, we examined the associations between the number of teeth and sleep duration in older people, considering the evidence linking fewer teeth and sleep apnoea through changes in jaw position.
   Methods: For this study we used information from a sample of 23,444 cohort participants, randomly selected from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study 2010 (N = 169,215). The outcome variable was self-reported sleep duration (h/day), and the explanatory variable was self-reported number of teeth (0, 1 -9, 10-19, >= 20). We treated age, sex, body mass index, educational attainment, annual equalized household income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, activities of daily living, presence of diabetes, and smoking status as covariates. Multinomial logistic regression was used among the 20,548 eligible participants with all necessary information.
   Results: The mean age was 73.7 (standard deviation = 6.13) years. Most participants (28.1%) reported sleep duration of 7 h, while a small proportion of the participants reported short (<= 4 h, 2.7%) or long (>= 10 h, 4.7%) sleep duration. The proportion of edentulous participants was 14.7%. Taking the 7-h sleep duration as the reference category, edentulous participants (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.90) or one to nine teeth (RRR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.02-1.63) had a significantly higher relative risk ratio for short sleep, independent of covariates. Furthermore, they had a higher relative risk ratio for long sleep duration (RRR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.40-2.19; RRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.21-1.81, respectively).
   Conclusions: Compared to people with 20 or more teeth, older adults with fewer than 10 teeth have higher risks for short and long sleep durations. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nightmares are a common sleep disorder, defined as highly disturbing mentation which usually awakens the individual from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. While nightmares are mainly a REM sleep phenomenon, Picard-Deland et al., (2017) recently showed an association between nightmare recall and sleep spindles, which are a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) oscillatory feature. Their results pointed to fewer slow spindles and a higher oscillatory frequency for fast spindles among frequent nightmare recallers compared with controls. To test the suggestion that nightmares stem from changes to emotional neural circuits arising in early childhood (Nielsen, 2017), including early changes in sleep spindles (Scholle et al., 2007), we investigated if the spindle features of early-onset nightmare recallers (ie, recalling nightmares since childhood) (N = 22), differed from those of late-onset nightmare recallers (ie, since adolescence or adulthood) (N = 11), or from those of controls (N = 23). A retrospective analysis of the sleep spindles of 56 participants who had undergone a polysomnographically-recorded morning nap revealed that Early starters uniquely exhibited lower slow spindle densities in five of six derivations (all p < 0.045) and higher fast spindle frequencies in all six derivations (all p < 0.015). These results add precision to previously reported findings for Nightmare recallers: spindle differences are shown to hold only for Early starters. The lifelong occurrence of nightmares may be closely tied to disruptions in the normal development of spindle generation processes occurring early in development. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: To evaluate endothelial function in a large cohort of children clinically referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and to identify risk factors contributing to the presence of endothelial dysfunction (ED).
   Methods: Habitually snoring children (age range, 3-11 years) were recruited. All participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG). Endothelial function test used peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) to derive the reactive hyperemia index (RHI). Subjects were then divided into mild OSA, moderate-severe OSA and primary snorers (PS), according to their obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI).
   Results: A total of 355 subjects were recruited. There were no differences in age, gender, or BMI z score among the three groups. Both mild and moderate-severe OSA groups had lower RHI than PS (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed that RHI was positively correlated with age (r = 0.17, P = 0.002), BMI z score (r = 0.14, P = 0.008) and oxygen saturation nadir (r = 0.15, P = 0.006), but negatively correlated with oxygen desaturation index (ODI3%; r = -0.19, P = 0.001) and respiratory-related arousal index (ArI-resp) (r = -0.24, P < 0.001). In stepwise regression analysis, age, BMI z score, and ArI-resp were independently associated with endothelial function (r = 0.34, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Children with OSA are at increased risk for abnormal endothelial function than habitually snoring children. Furthermore, in addition to age and BMI, which are well-established factors affecting endothelial function, both intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation during sleep also emerge as candidate risk factors contributing to endothelial dysfunction in snoring children.

AB Objective: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.
   Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM.
   Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: It is well recognized that the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Different treatment possibilities comprise surgery, mandibular advancement, pulmonary rehabilitation, and oropharyngeal and facial exercises (PR program). However, these treatments showed inconsistent results. The purpose of the study was to compare the short-term effects of CPAP and the combination of PR program with CPAP on OSA severity, ventilatory functions, and changes in body characteristics in a newly diagnosed patient.
   Methods: This study was a single-center, two-arm, parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. Forty patients with OSA (20 men, 20 women, aged 54.2 +/- 6.8 years) with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea were randomized to CPAP and CPAP thorn PR. The PR group underwent six weeks of 60-min twice-weekly individual PR programs. The primary outcome measure was apnea/hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The secondary outcome measures were a percentage of total sleep time with oxygen saturation below 90%, body mass index (BMI), vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (% of predicted), neck, waist, and hip circumferences.
   Results: Five patients with OSA did not complete the program. The comparison between baseline and final assessment was made in 15 patients in the CPAP thorn PR group and 20 patients in the control group with CPAP only. Although OSA severity was controlled with CPAP treatment in both groups, a significant reduction of neck, waist, and hip circumferences, BMI, and improvement of pulmonary function were confirmed only in the CPAP thorn PR group after treatment.
   Conclusion: Treatment with CPAP combined with the PR program improved OSA patients to a greater extent than only CPAP. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/background: Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and promoting individual health. This study aimed to investigate the trends of sleep duration in Korean adults.
   Patients/methods: We collected data from individuals who were adults (>= 18 years) and participated in three cycles (2007-2009, 2010-2012, and 2013-2015) of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) for the analysis of self-reported sleep duration pattern. A total of 51,545 adults (21,937 men and 29,608 women) were included.
   Results: Sleep duration decreased among both men and women from 2007 to 2009 KNHANES to 2013-2015 KNHANES. Sleep duration differed by age group and sex. Moreover, sleep duration declined among middle-aged (30-49 years old) and older (50-64 years old) men and young (18-29 years old) and middle-aged (30-49 years old) women, although not among older and elderly women.
   Conclusions: The young and middle-aged adult groups (18-49 years old) showed a significant decline in sleep duration in the KNHANES 2007-2015. Crown Copyright (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and clinical effects of a lifestyle-integrated exercise, namely zero-time exercise (ZTEx), on improving insomnia in inactive adults with insomnia disorder.
   Methods: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 37 physically inactive adults (mean age: 49.9 years; SD: 13.6 91.9% female) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of insomnia disorder recruited from the community were randomly assigned to ZTEx training or sleep hygiene education (SHE) groups. Subjects in the ZTEx group (n = 18) attended two 2-hour training lessons to learn ZTEx which they then practiced daily for eight weeks. Subjects in the SHE group (n = 19) attended two lessons of the same schedule and duration. The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
   Results: The ZTEx group had lower ISI scores than the SHE group, with a large between-group effect size of 0.93-1.10 at weeks two, four, six, and eight, but the difference became non-significant at week eight, suggesting a loss of efficacy two months after the training. For secondary outcomes, no significant between-group differences were found in sleep parameters by sleep diary or objective actigraphy. The adherence to the ZTEx training course was satisfactory, with 83% of the group completing two sessions and 78% continuing to practice ZTEx for five days or more per week during the eight-week intervention period.
   Conclusion: The simple and brief ZTEx training showed high acceptability and exercise compliance and the first evidence of efficacy in reducing insomnia severity in inactive adults with insomnia disorder. Confirmatory trials with longer follow-up are justified.

AB Objective: The distinctive clinical finding of Type 1 narcolepsy compared to Type 2 is the presence of cataplexy. Several neuroimaging studies have also reported abnormalities in narcolepsy patients with or without cataplexy. However, there are conflicting results to differentiate them. In this study, we aimed to clarify the white matter changes in narcolepsy patients both with and without cataplexy and compared them with healthy adults to evaluate microstructural differences in the brain.
   Methods: Eleven narcolepsy patients with cataplexy (NC), 12 narcolepsy patients without cataplexy (NOC) and healthy age-and gender-matched controls (N = 16) were studied. Whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained and tract-based spatial statistics were used to localize white matter abnormalities.
   Results: Compared with the healthy controls, both NC and NOC patients exhibited significant fractional anisotropy (FA) decreases in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral thalami, the corpus callosum and left anterior-medial temporal white matter. Compared with the controls, the NC patients' FA values were also decreased in the midbrain. No significant correlations were found between FA values and clinical-polysomnographic variables.
   Conclusion: This DTI study has demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the midbrain-brainstem regions as a distinctive finding of narcolepsy patients with cataplexy. Involvement of bilateral temporal lobes with greater changes on the left lobe is also a supporting finding of patients with cataplexy. DTI changes in the midbrain-brainstem and bilateral temporal lobes can be signs of different pathological mechanisms in these patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Near-total absence of REM sleep co-occurring with normal cognition: an
   update of the 1984 paper
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEPRIVATION
AB Background: REM sleep (REMS) is considered vital for supporting well-being and normal cognition. However, it remains unclear if and how decreases in REMS impair cognitive abilities. Rare case studies of patients with REMS abolishment due to pontine lesions remain sporadic, and formal evaluation of cognitive status is lacking. In 1984, Lavie and colleagues described the case of Y.C. - a man with a pontine lesion and near-total absence of REMS who led a normal life. Here, we set out to re-evaluate this individual's REMS status 30 years after the original report, and formally assess his cognitive abilities.
   Methods: Four whole-night polysomnographic sleep recordings were conducted to evaluate sleep architecture. Sleep scoring was performed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines. Cranial Computed Tomography (CT) imaging was performed, as well as formal neuropsychological testing to evaluate cognitive functions.
   Results: Y.C. averaged 4.5% of sleep time in REMS, corresponding to the 0.055 percentile of normal values for his age. Furthermore, residual REMS episodes were short and only occurred towards the end of the night. CT imaging revealed damage and metallic fragments in pons, cerebellum, and thalamus. Neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated average to high-average cognitive skills, normal memory, and motor difficulties including speech and left hand dyspraxia.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the only case where REMS loss resulting from pontine lesion was re-evaluated after many years. We find a near-total absence of REMS with no signs of significant compensation throughout adult life, along with normal cognitive status. The results provide a unique perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the functional role of REMS in supporting cognition. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Perinatal risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE OSAS; Sleep disordered breathing; Perinatal factors; Preterm births
ID CESAREAN-SECTION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ASSOCIATION; DELIVERIES; COHORT
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.
   Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS.
   Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.57-4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83). Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not significantly associated with OSAS in children.
   Conclusion: Perinatal risk factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

AB Study objectives: we performed a meta-analysis to assess the usefulness of HLA testing for Narcolepsy diagnosis in four major ethnical groups: Asians, Afro-Americans, Amerindians and Caucasians.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for articles in English and French published before October 2017 on HLA class II alleles in Narcolepsy. We included case-control studies, cross-sectional and retrospective cohort studies with patients diagnosed following the International classifications of sleep disorders (1990-2012) and ethnically matched controls. Following PRISMA guidelines, two investigators independently extracted data according to the inclusion criteria listed in PROSPEROCRD42017058677. A third researcher was consulted for discrepancies. We extracted and pooled adjusted OR using random-effect models. We verified the strength of the association between HLA-DQB1*06:02 and the worldwide distribution of Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2); furthermore, we pooled the OR measuring the association between HLA-DQB1*06: 02 and NT1, NT2 and hypersomniacs.
   Results: We identified 511 titles. Of these, 12 case-control studies were included, for a total of 2077 NT1 patients, 235 NT2 patients, 161 hypersomniacs and 7802 controls. In the population-stratified analysis, HLA-DQB1*06: 02 conferred an increased risk for NT1 (OR: 24.1, IC: 14.6-39.5, p < 0.001) and NT2 (OR: 3.9; IC: 2.2-6.8, p < 0.001). For NT1 the pooled estimated positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+) was 5.94 (IC: 3.71-9.51) and the negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-) was 0.23 (IC: 0.16-0.33); for NT2 LR+ was 3.35 (IC: 2.08-5.38) and LR-0.72 (IC: 0.63-0.81). Moreover, for hypersomniacs LR+ was 1.436 (IC 0.668-3.089) and LR-0.903 (IC 0.714-1.142).
   Conclusions: Our data support the preponderant role of HLA-DQB1*06: 02 in susceptibility to NT1/NT2 across all ethnicities. HLA-DQB1*06: 02 negativity should make clinicians cautious in excluding other diagnoses. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   NOCTURIA; QUALITY; AGE
AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between a low libido and objective sleep parameters as well as mood disturbances in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).
   Methods: We enrolled 436 untreated patients who were newly diagnosed with OSA (all male, mean age 42.8 years). Patients completed the Symptom checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Patients were divided into low-libido and normal-libido groups according to their response to the statement "Loss of sexual interest or pleasure" on the SCL-90-R.
   Results: Approximately 23% of patients reported a low libido. Patients with a low libido were older (47.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 41.4 +/- 11.1 years; p < 0.001), had more nocturia (33.3% vs. 16.6%; p < 0.001), higher BDI (9.0 (5.0-14.0) vs. 5.0 (2.0-9.0); p < 0.001) and BAI score (11.0 (6.3-16.8) vs. 5.0 (2.0-10.0); p < 0.001). These patients had a lower non-REM sleep stage 3 (N3) % (0.1 (0-4.0) vs. 2.3 (0.1-7.9); p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that older age and higher BDI score were independent factors associated with a low libido.
   Conclusions: Men with untreated OSA suffered from a low libido. Older age and depressed mood were the most important factors of low libido in middle-aged men with OSA. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ojective: To investigate cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic functions in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) during wakefulness compared to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy subjects.
   Methods: Drug-naive iRBD patients, PD patients and healthy controls underwent cardiovascular function tests including head-up tilt test (HUTT), Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, hand grip, and cold face. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed in the frequency domain using an autoregressive algorithm in the rest supine condition and during HUTT. Sudomotor function was assessed through Sudoscan.
   Results: Fourteen iRBD patients, 17 PD patients and 12 healthy controls were included in the study. In the supine resting condition, the baseline values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were comparable in all groups. At Valsalva maneuver, iRBD patients and PD patients showed an overshoot which was significantly lower than controls. In addition, iRBD patients showed a significant reduction of sinus arrhythmia at deep breathing compared to controls. Cardiovascular responses to cold face were similar in the three groups while isometric handgrip was significantly reduced in PD patients with respect to healthy subjects. Spectral analysis of HRV showed no significant differences among iRBD, PD patients and controls in the supine resting condition; whereas during HUTT the low-frequency (LF) component of HRV was significantly higher in controls with respect to iRBD and the high-frequency (HF) component was significantly higher in iRBD patients compared to controls. In addition, a significant increase in the LF/HF ratio in healthy subjects was detected compared to iRBD. Finally, four out of 14 iRBD patients (29%) and nine of 17 PD patients (53%) had a sudomotor dysfunction.
   Conclusions: Our findings obtained in de novo iRBD and PD patients indicate that some alterations of the autonomic nervous system are shared by both groups of patients, reinforcing the close link between the two pathologies, and show an autonomic fragility during wakefulness in iRBD that mainly arises under stress conditions.

   PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Background: The joint effect of daytime naps and night sleep on the risk of stroke has not been clarified. Our research aimed to verify this relationship based on data from a large sample-sized cross-sectional study and a cohort study.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study included 7887 subjects, aged 20-74 years. Using stratified random sampling, 1928 individuals were selected for the cohort study. We then followed up with these individuals for an average of 4.94 years and collected detailed sleep information with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Serum fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and high density lipoprotein were analyzed, and anthropometric measurements were taken. Interaction and joint analyses were performed.
   Results: Consistent with the results in the cross-sectional study, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) of stroke were 1.94 (1.21-3.13) and 2.24 (1.05-4.79) for daytime napping >= 1 h and nighttime sleeping >= 9 h in the cohort study. For no naps combined with <7 h of nighttime sleeping, the HR (95%CI) was 2.61 (1.17-5.82). For >= 1 h of naps combined with <7 h, 7-8 h, 8-9 h, and >= 9 h of nighttime sleeping, HRs (95% CI) were 2.16 (1.03-4.51), 2.36 (1.07-5.20), 2.41 (1.11-5.20) and 3.37 (1.05-10.81), respectively.
   Conclusions: Individuals with 7-8 h of night sleep combined with no daytime naps or less than 1 h of daytime napping were at low risk of stroke; nighttime sleeping >= 9 h combined with daytime napping >= 1 h and night sleep <7 h combined with 0 or >1 h daytime napping was associated with high risk of stroke.

AB Objectives: Chronic pain, with or without an identified diagnosis or cause, is widespread and commonly associated with sleep disturbances. However, research has often used poor quality measures of sleep and focused on specific pain conditions, thereby limiting its reliability and applicability to the wider CP population. This study meta-analysed the findings from studies that used objective polysomnographic measures of sleep or examined diagnosed sleep disorders in people with CP.
   Methods: Three databases were searched (PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase; inception to June 2017) for case-controlled polysomnography studies and studies that reported the prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders in adults with CP. Hedge's g effect sizes and prevalence rates were calculated using the data from 37 studies.
   Results: Polysomnographic measures of sleep onset latency and efficiency, time awake after sleep onset and awakenings were all significantly worse in those with CP when compared to healthy controls (large effects). Total sleep time, light sleep duration (NREM 1), number of stage-shifts, respiratory-related events and periodic limb-movements were also worse for those with CP, albeit to a lesser extent (small to medium effects). The pooled prevalence of sleep disorders in CP was 44%, with insomnia (72%), restless legs syndrome (32%) and obstructive sleep apnea (32%) being the most common diagnoses.
   Conclusions: Objective polysomnographic measures indicate that individuals with CP experience significant sleep disturbances, particularly with respect to sleep initiation and maintenance. Clinically diagnosed sleep disorders are also very prevalent. It is imperative that sleep disturbances and disorders be assessed and treated in conjunction with the CP.

AB Objective: Most previous studies have concluded that decreased cognitive function and performance due to ultra-short acting hypnotics do not persist after 6-9 h post-administration. This study examined the effects of ultra-short acting hypnotics on cognitive function and performance 12 h after administration, ie, a time considered sufficient for the effects of hypnotics to disappear.
   Methods: Thirteen healthy young male volunteers (mean age, 23.4 +/- 3.2 years) participated in this study. Participants attended three sessions of polysomnography (PSG) recording preceded by oral administration of placebo for the first session, and 5 mg zolpidem or 0.25 mg triazolam for the second and third sessions, in a double-blinded, randomized manner at intervals of at least five days. A cognitive test battery was administered following each session, consisting of a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), which reflects alertness and sleepiness, digit symbol substitution test (DSST), which reflects attention and working memory function, and assessment of subjective sleepiness and mental condition using a visual analog scale (VAS).
   Results and Conclusions: The administration of hypnotics significantly increased total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep stages 2 and 4, and significantly decreased wake after sleep onset and sleep stage 1. PVT parameters were not affected by the administration of hypnotics, but DSST score was significantly lower, and "subjective alertness," "vigor," and "sadness" significantly deteriorated, after administration. In conclusion, while objective sleepiness disappeared 12 h after the administration of ultra-short acting hypnotics, their effects to decrease cognitive function persisted even after 12 h post-administration.

AB Background: There are several studies that have focused on the relationship between sleep duration and depression, however, only a few prospective studies have centered on the bidirectional relationship between them. This four-year longitudinal study aimed to identify the association between sleep duration and depression in community-dwelling mid-age and elderly individuals.
   Methods: 10,704 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were included for baseline and four-year follow up. Of these individuals, 7866 and 2956 were used to identify the effects of sleep duration on onset and recurrent depression respectively. 4504 individuals with normal sleep duration at baseline were included to examine the effects of depression on changes of sleep time. The 10-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD-10) was used to access depressive symptoms, as well sleep duration was self-reported.
   Results: Participants with short sleep duration (<5 and 5-6 h) had a higher risk of depression onset (OR 1.69 [1.36-2.11], 1.48 [1.19-1.84]) and recurrent depression (OR 1.44 [1.12-1.86], 1.32 [1.00-1.74]) compared to participants with normal sleep durations (7-8 h). Long sleep durations (>9 h) had no significant risks for depression. Males and the elderly (over 60 years-old) were more sensitive to short sleep durations and experienced a higher incidence of depression. Individuals with depression were more likely to have short sleep durations instead of long ones (RRR 1.20 [1.02-1.43]).
   Conclusions: The present study identified the bidirectional relationship between sleep duration and depression. Short sleep durations were a risk factor for the onset and recurrent depression. Conversely, depression induced short sleep durations rather than excessive sleep durations. Future studies need to focus on identifying the mechanism between sleep duration and depression, and develop additional evidence-based cost-effective interventions to prevent depression and sleep problems.

AB Business cycles modify firms' incentives to innovate and the direction of innovation. By introducing a new measure of patent unconventionality this paper explores the impact of the business cycle on firms' technological search strategies. We find that during upturns firms generate inventions characterized by a higher level of technological unconventionality. We also find that financially resilient and diversified firms produce more unconventional patents. While patent unconventionality is associated with technological impact and market value, firms extract more value by investing in unconventional inventions in downturns.

AB How do the effects of cognitive openness and structural openness on the research impact of business scholars vary over their careers? By analysing a longitudinal sample of 35,296 scholars who published in business and management journals, we show that the cognitive openness and the structural openness of business scholars have non-linear relationships with their research impact. In particular, we found that, whereas moderate levels of cognitive openness and structural openness are desirable for increasing young scholars' citations, a high level of cognitive openness and a low level of structural openness contribute to senior scholars' citations. This study contributes to our understanding of different search behaviour across business scholars' career paths and its implications for scholars' research impact.

AB The occurrence of protein aggregation during bioprocessing steps such as purification, formulation and fill-finish, impacts yield and production costs, and must be controlled throughout the manufacturing process. Understanding aggregation mechanisms and developing mitigating strategies are imperative to ensure the clinical efficacy of the protein drug product and to reduce costs. This commentary reflects on recent progress made in the field of monoclonal antibody (mAb) aggregation with considerations on current and emerging measurement techniques, the use of novel excipients for preventing aggregation, interfacial phenomena and prediction of aggregation rates. The future direction of research is discussed based on academic and industrial perspectives.

AB This work investigates the impact of nanoparticle (NP) composition and effectiveness of cryo-/lyo-protectants in a freeze drying process, which was employed to convert liquid dispersions of polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) NPs into completely redispersible powders. PEC NPs, with and without peptide, were produced by complex coacervation. The cryo-/lyo-protectants investigated were mannitol, trehalose (TRE) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The solid state of lyophilised powders was studied by thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Cytotoxicity studies were done by MTS assay and flow cytometry. The presence of a cryoprotectant was essential to achieve a successful powder reconstitution. The concentration of TRE was optimised for each type of PEC NPs. Protamine- and hyaluronate-based NPs reconstituted better than chitosan- and chondroitin sulphate-based NPs, respectively. PEG polymers were found to be more effective cryoprotectants than TRE and best results were achieved using cofreeze drying of NPs with TRE and PEG. These ternary NPs/TRE/PEG samples were crystalline, with expected better storage stability. PEG polymers were well tolerated by Caco-2 cells, with the exception of linear PEG 10 kDa. This work shows that, as regards the formulation design and maximising NP loading in the dried product, optimisation of the cryoprotectant type and content is needed as it is highly dependent not only on the type of polyelectrolyte pair in the PEC, but also the polyions ratio.

AB Nearly 20% of people affected by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) suffer from vision problems. The virus can infect all layers of the cornea or cause inflammatory diseases of the sclera. The aim of this work was to test whether encapsulation of acyclovir in Soluplus or Solutol polymeric micelles increases its solubility, corneal permeability and sclera penetration. The aqueous solubility of acyclovir is known to be low, and therefore approaches that increase both its solubility and ability to penetrate through the eye may favor the efficacy of the treatments. Copolymer dispersions (covering wide range of concentrations) were prepared in water and PBS 7.4 and characterized regarding size and Z-potential (close to zero). Solutol micelles increased their size when the drug was incorporated (135 vs. 19 nm), while Soluplus micelles showed little difference (137 nm). Only Soluplus micelles significantly enhanced acyclovir solubility and withstood dilution stability tests. Soluplus (12-20%) formulations showed a progressive increase in viscoelasticity as temperature rose, which may allow for easy dropping onto the eye and subsequent retention in the gel form. Drug permeability through bovine cornea and sclera was investigated in detail. Although similar permeability coefficients were recorded for the drug when applied as the free drug in solution or formulated in Soluplus micelles, the micelle formulation significantly shortened the permeation lag time through the cornea. Moreover, Soluplus micelles were advantageous compared to the drug solution in terms of greater amount of acyclovir accumulated in both cornea and sclera, and higher steady state flux. If compared with cornea, the amounts of drug permeated through the sclera were approx. 10 times greater, which opens the possibility of drug delivery to the posterior eye segment.

AB Single drop impact of liquid on a static powder bed was studied to investigate the granule formation mechanism, droplet penetration time, as well as the characterization of granules (morphology, surface structure and internal structure). Water was used as the liquid and two pharmaceutical powders, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and acetaminophen (APAP), were mixed to make heterogeneous powder beds. The complete drop impact and penetration was recorded by a high speed camera. Two granule formation mechanisms that have been identified previously occurred: Spreading and Tunneling. Spreading occurred for mixtures with an APAP amount of less than 20%, while Tunneling started to occur when the APAP amount increased above 20%. With an increase of APAP concentration, the mean particle size decreased, drop penetration time increased, and the granules formed became smaller in size, which was in good agreement with previous literature. The granule morphology, surface structure, and internal structure were characterized by a prism method with image analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray microtomography, respectively. The Spreading mechanism produced flat disks with a porous internal structure, while the Tunneling mechanism produced round granules with a dense internal structure. There is a clear trend of decreasing porosity and increasing roundness of granules made from heterogeneous mixtures within the transition from Spreading to Tunneling. It is believed that the mean particle size of the powder bed and the powder-liquid contact angle are the predominant factors in influencing the formation mechanism, drop penetration time, and granule properties.

AB Appropriate lubrication is important in tablet manufacturing as it lowers punch sticking propensity and protects tooling by reducing friction between die wall and tablet during tablet manufacturing. Most commercial lubricants negatively impact tabletability and dissolution. A delicate balance is usually attained by trial and error to identify the optimal level of lubricant in a tablet formulation. In this work, we have evaluated the effectiveness of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant, as a tableting lubricant. If adequate lubrication efficiency is achieved, the use of SLS may be suitable to mitigate problems associated with hydrophobic lubricants. Results show that SLS, when applied in the proper amount to typical pharmaceutical powder mixtures, achieved lubrication efficiency comparable to a grade of magnesium stearate (MgSt) without deteriorating tabletability. Moreover, SLS-containing tablets of celecoxib also exhibited improved in vitro dissolution compared to MgSt-containing tablets. The enhancement in dissolution properties was attributed to the improved wetting by the dissolution medium due to the presence of SLS.

AB The objective of this study was to enhance solubility and dissolution of lapatinib (LB) ditosylate (DT) using solid dispersions (SD) prepared by solvent rotary evaporation (SRE) and hot melt extrusion (HME). A series of models based on solubility parameter, the solid-liquid equilibrium equation, and the Flory-Huggins equation were employed to provide insight to data and evaluate drug/polymer interactions. Experimentally, nine SD formulas were prepared and characterized by various analytical techniques including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), solubility, and dissolution. It was found that both material attributes (e.g., drug loading and solid state) and process parameters (e.g., extrusion temperature) significantly affected manufacturability and solubility/dissolution behaviors. Among the formulas investigated, Formula #9 containing LB-DT, Soluplus (R), and poloxamer 188 at a weight ratio of 1:3:1 was screened as the first ranked one. While comparing production routes, the SDs prepared by SRE showed more amorphicity as well as higher solubility/dissolution. This study provided the insight of introducing theoretical models to guide SD formulation/process development and illustrating the potential of bioavailability enhancement for LB-DT.

AB The antibody avastin (R) (Ava) has been clinically to treat various intraocular neovascular diseases, but suffering from the rapid clearance and short shelf-life of Ava in the requirement of frequent administration. In the present study, we reports the sustained release of Ava from a thermosensitive hydrogel based on poly(ethylene glycol)poly(c-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PECE) copolymer for the control of corneal neovascularization in rabbit model. Ava were physically mixed with PECE aqueous solution at 4 degrees C, and resulting Ava-PECE solution showed a sol-gel transition at physiological temperature (37 degrees C). In vitro release study indicated that Ava-PECE hydrogel provided a sustained release of Ava up to 28 days and the drug release behavior could be finely modulated by the change of PECE concentration. A single subconjunctival injection of PECE hydrogel hardly caused the change of intraocular pressure and corneal endothelial morphology during the entire study period. Intraocular pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that the Ava-PECE hydrogel provided a relatively higher Ava concentration in cornea over Ava solution up to 14 days. In addition, anti-angiogenic effects of the Ava-PECE hydrogel in a suture-induced corneal neovascularization rabbit model indicated that the Ava-PECE hydrogel treatment exhibited superior anti-angiogenic efficacy over Ava solution treatment by decreasing the area ratio of neovascularization on 17 days. Overall, the proposed Ava-PECE hydrogel acting a sustained drug delivery system might be a promising vehicle for the treatment of corneal neovascularization.

AB The study explores new benefits of controlled ice nucleation during lyophilization. A highly concentrated monoclonal antibody product was lyophilized using conventional (uncontrolled) and controlled ice nucleation freezing and the processes were compared for their impact on process performance, reconstitution time, and product quality attributes. Glass fogging was observed during the conventional ice nucleation freezing step and is investigated. A mechanical stress study was also conducted on the lyophilized product manufactured using uncontrolled and controlled ice nucleation to measure and compare propensity toward aggregation upon physical stresses associated with shipping and handling. Reduction in primary drying time and reconstitution time was achieved with controlled ice nucleation. In contrast to significant fogging observed for uncontrolled nucleation, glass fogging was absent in vials subjected to controlled ice nucleation. Uncontrolled nucleation freezing produced higher number of particles when subjected to mechanical stress prior to reconstitution compared to controlled nucleation lyophilized samples. The study confirms published benefits of controlled ice nucleation (e.g. reduction in primary drying time). The manuscript reports for the first time the advantage that controlled ice nucleation may offer in regards to glass fogging during lyophilization. The reduced number of particles in the controlled nucleated samples exposed to mechanical stress suggest that frictional forces play an important role in governing the stability of protein in the lyophilized state.
