AB Exposure to air pollutants has been associated with deleterious health effects that cause premature mortality and a range of morbidities. Air quality in the Mediterranean is of particular interest due to an array of environmental and anthropogenic conditions that make it an air-pollution hotspot. However, the scarcity of data for the region's emission inventories inhibits accurate and holistic assessment. Lebanon, located on the eastern board of the Mediterranean, faces several challenges including an unsustainable transport sector, an unregulated power generation sector, and high urban densities, all of which amplify the air-quality crisis. This paper presents an air pollutant emission inventory for two major emission sources in Lebanon, diesel generators and light duty vehicles (LDVs) of the transport sector, and uncovers trends for over a decade. The exhaust emissions for carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter for diesel generators and for LDVs were estimated by assimilating different approaches and data sources through the use of survey data and national statistics for a higher tier. Our results uncovered that diesel generators consumed almost 1.6 million tons of fuel and emitted about 2 Gg of fine particulate matter in 2016. LDVs doubled in number over a decade and were responsible for approximately 0.20 Gg of fine particulate matter emissions in 2015. While the market for diesel generators appeared to have saturated, ownership of passenger cars per passengers continued to increase, while vehicle age, conditions, and, thus, emissions continued to augment. The results highlight the need for greater government intervention to meet the national electricity demand and promote public transportation and discourage private transportation, especially for energy-inefficient vehicles.

AB The first ever systematic study on spatio-temporal variation of the chemo-isotopic compositions of the precipitation in Iran was carried out in a hydrological year (2016-2017) at 7 sites located in Bojnourd area, northeast of Iran. The main aims were to determine the moisture and air mass sources and, in particular, to evaluate the effect of atmospheric conditions on isotope compositions. The isotopic value of the precipitation fluctuates seasonally with higher values in summer and lower values in winter at the all sites. Stable isotope values of the precipitation samples within the local scale resulted a Bojnourd meteoric water line (BMWL): delta D = 6.4 x delta O-18 + 1.2 (R-2 = 0.93, n = 75), with a lower slope and intercept than the global meteoric water line (GMWL) due to isotope kinetic fractionation effects during precipitation in semi-arid region with lower humidity. The air temperature can be suggested as the main controlling factor that impacts the stable isotope compositions of precipitation in the study area. The large rainfall events totally displayed the highest slope, intercept and d-excess values nearly similar to the snowfall samples, indicating the re-evaporation effects on the low rainfall amounts. Precipitations during summer season (Jun-August) with higher isotopes and lower d-excess values mainly originated from the polar and Caspian Sea air moistures. While, moisture contributing to high d-excess and low isotope precipitation during January was mainly transported by the Mediterranean air moisture. The air-mass trajectories that affect the precipitation in autumn (September-December) and spring (March-May) displayed multiple sources, originating from the polar, Mediterranean and Caspian Sea air moistures. Trajectory analysis by HYSPLIT modeling allowed the association of moisture sources with the isotopic compositions of the precipitation. Based on the sea salt contribution for Na+ and Cl-, a sea effect is recognized especially from Caspian Sea and Mediterranean region, despite the long distance at the present study. The correlation between EC and the ions indicate that ion compositions in the precipitation and atmosphere of the study area are mainly effected by dust of soil and sea salt and to some extent from secondary evaporation during rainfall. The hydrochemical investigations confirmed the air masses trajectories which resulted from the isotopic characteristics.

AB CBM-IV mechanism is one of the most-commonly used atmospheric reaction mechanisms in the model studies of air pollution. In this study, by using a concentration sensitivity analysis, we investigated the dependence of NO, NO2 and O-3 on the initial air composition in the CBM-IV mechanism under a typical urban condition. The initial values of the components that are identified important in the sensitivity analysis were also modified to see the relevant changes in the reaction system. The results show that at the beginning of the simulation, NO, NO2 and O-3 are mostly affected by the titration reaction. During this period, the NO mixing ratio depends negatively on the initial O-3 and positively on the initial nitrogen oxides. Moreover, the NO2 mixing ratio was found positively correlated with the initial NO, while its dependence on the initial O-3 transits between positive and negative. In contrast to that, O-3 at this stage has the strongest positive dependence on its own initial concentration, but a negative association with the initial NO. However, as the reaction proceeds, the dependence of O-3 and the nitrogen oxides on the initial air composition changes. During the end of the simulation, the change of NO and NO2 was found moderately associated with their initial values, but the influence caused by the modification of the initial O-3 is negligible. Similarly, ozone at this time was also found less impacted by its initial value. Instead, the ozone level under equilibrium relies mostly on the initial NO and NO2.

AB Characterizing levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in snow and their toxicity is important for understanding snow scavenging of PAHs and associated human health and environmental risks in cold regions. A total of 48 fresh snow samples were collected from six precipitation events during the winter of 2014-2015 at eight (5 urban, 2 suburban and 1 rural) sites across the heavily industrialized and agricultural city of Harbin in northeast China, and were analyzed for the USEPA priority 16 PAHs. Concentrations of the sum of the 16 PAHs from individual snow samples ranged from 0.3 to 2549.6 pg L-1 or nearly four orders of magnitude. The arithmetic mean concentration (+/- standard deviation) of the 48 samples was 218.1 +/- 623.7 mu g L-1, and the median value was 10.7 mu g L-1. The most abundant PAHs averaged from all the samples were Pyrene (17.1%), followed by Phenanthrene (14.9%), Naphthalene (14.4%), and Fluoranthene (10.2%). The important carcinogenic Sigma(7)PAHs accounted for 58.4% of the total PAHs at locations directly impacted by road traffic. Source apportionment analysis using diagnostic ratios coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that coal and biomass combustion and vehicle exhausts are the major sources of PAHs in winter. Concentrations of PAHs in snow were significantly correlated with measured levels of PAHs in airborne particulate matter (PM2.5 (R = 0.857, p < 0.05); PM10 (R = 0.831, p < 0.05)), as well as with ambient temperature (R = -0.851, p < 0.05). Almost all (99%) of PAHs measured in the snow were present in particulate phase. The practice of clearing snow by removing it from urban areas and disposing it in suburban and rural areas may create a new pathway of exposure, which needs to be assessed further.

AB Eleven years of CALIOP and MODIS data are used to investigate the vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds and their possible interactions over the north-eastern South Asia (22-30 degrees N, 88-98 degrees E). Distinct seasonality in the vertical aerosol structure with the presence of elevated aerosol layers (EALs) is observed. The EALs vary from similar to 1.4 to 4.8 km in post monsoon to similar to 4.8-7.4 km in monsoon. Strong convective activities mainly in pre-monsoon and monsoon and upper air transportation of aerosols contribute to the formation of EALs. The contribution of polluted dust, polluted continental/smoke and elevated smoke are found to be predominant in the vertical column during pre-monsoon and monsoon. Contrarily, clean continental, clean marine and dusty marine are dominant during winter and post monsoon. Small spherical particles are abundant during winter while in monsoon hygroscopically grown spherical particles predominate. Seasonally, the cloud occurrence frequency (COF) as a function of altitude is maximum during monsoon. An increase in cloud top height (CTH) is observed within this region corresponding to an increase in number of cloud layers, thus revealing invigoration effect. The occurrence of cirrus and deep convective clouds is maximum in monsoon and minimum in the dry season. Significant inhibition/invigoration is observed for mixed-phase/liquid clouds.

AB Changing climate will impact future air quality. In this study, an online coupled meteorology and chemistry WRF-CMAQ model was applied to simulate such impacts on future O-3 and PM2.5 air quality over Continental Southeast Asia. Simulations were conducted for present (2006-2015) and future (2046-2055) years under two climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Future climate projections were obtained by implementing a downscaling dynamical method based on pseudo global warming technique. In order to estimate the impacts of climate change alone, anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions were held constant at present level while biogenic emissions varying with climate were used. The model results indicated a future regional meteorology characterized by a warmer and more humid atmosphere, increased precipitation, and more stagnant condition. Affected by climate change, NOx and NMVOCs biogenic emissions increase which contribute to the increasing effects on O-3 and PM2.5 precursors concentrations. Subsequently, the changes in meteorology and biogenic emission affect air quality. These influence on ground level O-3 and PM2.5 are different between the two climate scenarios. Under RCP4.5 scenario, future atmosphere appears to be reduced in O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting a potential "climate benefit" for air quality. At four target countries, namely Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, O-3 concentration decreases by -0.76 ppb (-2.40%), PM2.5 concentration decreases by -0.95 mu g/m(3) (-4.32%) on average for the entire year. However, climate change worsen O3 and PM2.5 air pollution under RCP8.5 scenario. O-3 concentration increases by +0.26 ppb (+0.84%), PM2.5 concentration increases by +0.92 mu g/m(3) (+4.20%) on average for the entire year. Significant increases were generally located in northern Vietnam (for O-3) and southern Vietnam (for PM2.5) during the dry season. The analysis suggests that the decrease in O-3 concentration is due to the dominancy of the negative effect of water vapor increase and the increase in O-3 concentration is affected largely by the temperature increase, stagnant condition, and biogenic emission increase. The responses of PM2.5 to climate change depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of each PM2.5 species. The major climate change effect on PM2.5 is the physical effect, rather than the chemical effect.

AB Rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of cyc-CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2- with the OH radicals were assessed by a relative rate method in the temperature range of 253-328 K, from which k(1)(T) = (8.52 +/- 1.58) x 10(-13) exp [(-1017 +/- 53)/T] was derived for the Arrhenius equation. Its atmospheric lifetime was 1.6 years. The estimated photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCP) were 0.211 and 0.076 for North-west European and USA urban conditions, respectively. The radiative efficiency (RE) was measured as 0.200 W M-2 ppb(-1), and the global warming potential (GWP) of the 100-year time horizon was estimated to be 107. The atmospheric oxidation mechanism of cyc-CF2CF2CF2CH2CH2- was studied by the experimental method. COF2, CO, and CO2 were identified as the main carbon-containing products. Additionally, the degradation mechanism of two analogous compounds, cyc-CF2CF2CF2CHFCH2- and cis-cyc-CF2CF2CF2CHFCHF-, were also investigated. COF2, HC(O)F, CO, and CO2 were observed as the main products.

AB Both air pollution detection and source identification for air pollution episodes are highly desirable for detecting and controlling industrial air pollution. Surveillance of air pollution episodes in industrial parks is the focus of this article. The surveillance in this study consists of air pollution detection and subsequent source identification. The Gaussian puff model is applied to simulate the dispersion of air pollution, and the source area analysis method is used to reconstruct unknown source terms. A case study involving hydrogen sulfide emissions in a typical chemical industrial park is presented. The long-term efficiencies of both pollution detection and source identification of a developing planning of boundary-type air quality monitoring network (AQMN) are evaluated. Five typical scenarios are identified for the evaluation. Moreover, several key factors for the surveillance efficiency variation (i.e., meteorological conditions, monitor number and distance between sources) are discussed. The efficiency of pollution detection increases with the number of monitors. The efficiency of source identification increases with the number of monitors and the distance between sources.

AB A novel algorithm named the stepwise genetic algorithm (SGA) is proposed to optimize the air quality monitoring network of mainland China under the framework of adaptive management. SGA is adapted from the genetic algorithm by modifying the operators of "mutation" and "crossover" to increase the number of removed sites by one at each step. Approximately half of the sites are adequate to achieve the same mean kriging variance (MKV) as that from all the sites, and the PM2.5 maps interpolated from these two site sets are very similar. Based on the site array proposed by SGA, the MKV shows a U-shaped trend with the number of removed sites, where the initial decrease of MKV (indicating improvement of interpolation accuracy by removing some sites) has only rarely been reported before. Mathematical proof demonstrates that the clustered sites tend to cause collinearity in the covariance matrix and hence result in MKV inflation.

AB Intensive field measurements were carried out in urban Shanghai between 20th and 30th of May 2017, and the VOC characteristics and sources were investigated with a focus on the relative contributions of local emissions and regional transport, as well as on the potential source regions. The VOC characteristics and sources largely depended on the meteorological conditions, especially wind direction and wind speed. Generally, two kinds of episodes were associated with regional transport. In one scenario, pollutants were transported from areas upwind (north-to-northwest) of Shanghai, specifically the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou and Nantong city clusters and were characterized by combustion emissions and aged air masses. In the other scenario, pollutants were transported from areas upwind (south-to-southeast) of Shanghai, specifically Ningbo-Zhoushan port, and were characterized by industrial emissions and aged air masses. Additionally, an episode associated with air masses from the clean area over the sea provided an opportunity to study the local emissions of VOCs in Shanghai. Vehicle exhaust and chemical industries, especially solvent usage, contributed a majority of the VOCs in urban Shanghai in summer, together accounting for more than 55%. The aromatic fraction of the PAMS in Shanghai was significantly higher than that in other regions in China. Regional transport and secondary formation were also important sources of VOCs, and their contribution ranged from similar to 15% to similar to 25% depending on the meteorological conditions, with an hourly maximum contribution as high as 67%. Fuel evaporation, especially leakage emissions, should be addressed in Shanghai. The present study highlights the fact that joint control of VOCs in conjunction with surrounding cities is critical for Shanghai.

AB Recently, air pollution has been substantially decreased in China, including particulate matter (PM) pollution in Beijing. However, PM pollution still has a great impact on human health, as stated in several epidemiological studies. In this paper, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) to evaluate the associations between PM2.5 and cardiovascular diseases from 2009 to 2012 in the Beijing metropolitan area. In GAM, we controlled the confounding factors, such as day of the week and long-term trends. We used the number of daily hospital emergency room (ER) visits to represent the incidence of the studied diseases. We divided the entire study group by gender (i.e., male and female) and age (i.e., 15-60 yr, 60-75 yr, and >= 75 yr). The results showed strong links were observed between increase in PM2.5 concentration and the number of hospital ER visits for cardiovascular diseases. For each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5, the relative risks (RRs) of the incidence of ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, high blood pressure, and cerebrovascular disease were 1.023 (95% CI: 1.007-1.040), 1.019 (95% CI: 0.992-1.047), 1.082 (95% CI: 0.985-1.188), 0.976 (95%CI: 0.957-0.996), and 1.038 (95% CI: 1.005-1.072), respectively. Overall, the short-term impact of PM2.5 on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases was the strongest for the 60-75 yr subgroup. For the two different gender subgroups, the short-term impact of PM2.5 on ischemic heart disease and high blood pressure was relatively stronger for the females than for the males, while the opposite was true for arrhythmia and cerebrovascular disease.

AB This research paper focuses on with the effects of air pollutants PM10, NOx, and SO2 on the blue (400-510 nm), green (510-600 rim), and red (600-700 nm) spectral regions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The measurements of solar radiation incident on a horizontal surface were taken at two locations in the city of Ostrava (Czech Republic) that differed in the source of air pollution. Linear regression models, with two explanatory variables (solar elevation angle and logarithm of individual pollutant concentration), were used as statistical tools for revealing the effect of air pollutants on incident solar radiation. The effect of air pollution on the Blue/PAR spectral ratio was ambiguous. There was a significant decrease in the Green/PAR spectral ratio, whereas there was a significant enhancement in the Red/PAR spectral ratio caused by the increasing air pollutant concentrations. The effects of air pollutants on these spectral ratios were significant from a statistical point of view with p-values smaller than 0.05, but the magnitude of the effect that the air pollutants had on the Blue/PAR and Red/PAR was small. In comparison to the above mentioned, the pollutants had a dominating effect on the Green/PAR spectral ratio. Pollution did not induce homogenous reduction of all PAR spectral regions, instead each pollutant had a specific effect on the contributions of blue, green, and red spectral regions to PAR irradiance. Possible causes of these effects are discussed.

AB Secondary aerosol (SA) is considered to be an increasingly dangerous air pollutant. However, quantification of SA has suffered from considerable uncertainty due to its poorly understood formation mechanism. In this study, a simplified approach based on characterizing coal combustion emission indicators polonium-210 (Po-210), selenium (Se) and arsenic (As) was used to estimate SA loading (increment) during a heavy air pollution event in December 2016 in Beijing. Due to the insignificant input and output of air pollutants as well as the assumption of non-local emissions during this heavy air pollution event, a steady-state method of severe air pollution has been proposed to estimate SA increment (the sum of newly formed secondary inorganic aerosols and secondary organic aerosols) during this typical air pollution event. Corresponding algorithm of the method was developed depending on the characteristics of coal combustion related pollutants (210Po, Se, and As). The results indicated that the median contribution of newly formed SA to total suspended particulates (TSP) during this heavy air pollution event was 42.4% (interquartile range [IQR]: 36.6%-48.8%), which quantitatively confirms the dominant contribution of substantial enhancement of SA to heavy air pollution. Although further verification is needed, this steady-state method of evaluating severe air pollution has potential for quantification of the SA increment.

AB Given the millions of people suffering from air pollution, filling the air quality monitoring gap in low- and middle-income countries has been recognized as a global challenge. To meet this challenge and make it work will require private enterprise, multiple levels of government, international organizations, academia and civil society to work together toward the common goal of characterizing, understanding better, and then reducing, the air pollution that causes sickness and preventable death for millions of people each year in lowand middle-income countries around the world. This article offers concrete next steps on how to make progress toward increasing air quality monitoring using a combination of emerging technologies, adaptation to country-specific conditions, and building capacity towards the development of lasting institutions.

AB Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) is experiencing negative ecosystem impacts due to nitrogen (N) deposition, which occurs in the forms of ammonium, nitrate and organic N. In order to complement other source apportionment approaches, the efficacy of N isotopes of ammonia to distinguish sources of ammonia deposited in RMNP was investigated. This study reports ammonia concentrations and demonstrates that the average delta N-15-H-3 isotopic ratios of certain sources (beef cattle production, -20.9 parts per thousand; dairies, -28.2 parts per thousand; wastewater treatment plants, -35.7 parts per thousand, cropland -26.4 parts per thousand, urban -16.9 parts per thousand) were distinguishable (p < 0.05) based on measurements at the emission sites; but, the average delta N-15-NH3 (-29.9 parts per thousand) measured at the receptor site in RMNP could not be used for direct ammonia source apportionment. Weekly integrations of gaseous and particulate N and sulfur measurements, and of N and sulfur in wet deposition measurements were used to explore how transport and secondary reactions may have affected the delta N-15 ratios observed in wet deposition. Post emission physical and chemical processes, such as isotopic fractionation likely influenced the delta N-15-NH3 to such a degree that measurements in RIVINP were no longer representative of the isotope signatures from their original sources. These results highlight the need to better understand isotope fractionation between gaseous and aerosol phases.

AB The third generation of Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance instrument (POLDER-3) aerosol products provide aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine aerosol optical depth (AODF), coarse aerosol optical depth (AODC), absorbed aerosol optical depth (AAOD), the angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), complex refractive index (CRI, CRI = n + i kappa) and single scattering albedo (SSA). These properties are essential for understanding the effects of aerosol on climate changes. However, the performance of those aerosol optical properties has not been validated in China. This study provides the first validation of all the POLDER-3/GRASP aerosol optical properties using ground measurements at 15 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations over China. The comparison shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.9530/0.9587/0.6371/0.5566/0.09/0.5835/0.6834 between POLDER-3/GRASP AOD/AODF/AAOD/AODC/n/kappa/SSA and that of AERONET stations. There are less than 49.9%/85.9%/54.4% of the AOD/AODF/AODC values falling within the Expected Error (EE, +/- (0.05 + 15%)) envelopes. The performance of POLDER-3 AOD is close to the MODIS and VIIRS dark-target (DT) AOD. The monthly POLDER-3 AOD are overestimated and SSA are underestimated in SACOL and Xianghe. Different land cover types affect the AODC retrieval significantly and high aerosol loading (AOD > 1) will cause the underestimation of AOD. These results indicate that the POLDER-3 aerosol product is more sensitive to fine aerosol type.

AB The city of Santiago experiences extreme pollution events during winter due to particulate matter and the associated health impact depends on the exposure to this pollutant, particularly to PM2.5. We present and apply a method that estimates the exposure of users of the public transport system of Santiago by combining smart card mobility data with measured surface concentrations from the monitoring network of Santiago and simulated concentrations by the CHIMERE model. The method was applied between July 20th and 24th of 2015 to 105,588 users corresponding to 12% of the frequent users of the public transport system and approximately 2% of the total population of Santiago. During those five days, estimated exposure based on measured concentrations varied between 44 and 75 mu g/m(3) while exposure based on simulated concentrations varied between 45 and 89 mu g/m(3). Furthermore, including socioeconomic conditions suggests an inverse relationship between exposure and income when measured concentrations are used, i.e. the lower the income the higher the exposure, whereas no such relationship is observed when using simulated concentrations. Although only exposure to PM2.5 was considered in this study, the method can also be applied to estimate exposure to other urban pollutant such as ozone.

AB Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in child care environments has raised a public concern. This study aimed to characterize indoor VOCs in four facilities of Head Start programs in Kansas city, Missouri, investigate seasonal and spatial variations in VOC levels, and assess health risks associated with children's VOC exposure. In total, 49 VOCs including aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, glycol ethers, esters and chlorinated hydrocarbons were identified and quantified in the facilities. Significant differences were noted for the VOC concentrations among the facilities. Toluene was the most abundant aromatic hydrocarbon detected in all the air samples, with a narrow median concentration range of 2.17-3.07 mu g/m(3). 2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethanol never reported in prior research was detected in only one facility in this study, with the median (range) concentration of 0.83 (< LOD, 5.64) mu g/m(3). The VOC concentrations in ground-floor classrooms differed significantly from those in basement classrooms. The VOC profiles varied substantially between fall and winter. Identified emission sources of VOCs included vehicle-related emission, solvent-related emission, building materials, personal care products and household products. Through health risk assessment, potential carcinogenic compounds (i.e., benzene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene) were of concern as the total cancer risk exceeded 10(-6). Future research on children's chronic exposure to these pollutants needs to further assess their possible additive and/or synergistic effects on children's health and development.

AB We analyzed the temperature dependence of ozone absorption cross-sections in four data sets: the quadratic temperature data based on measurements of Bass and Paur (BPQ); data measured with the SCIAMACHY satellite spectrometer (SAC); data derived by Daumont, Brion, and Malicet (DBM); and data determined by Serdyuchenko et al. from the University of Bremen (SER). The ozone effective absorption coefficients of the Dobson and Brewer instruments at Kunming in the low-latitude stations and Hohenpeissenberg in the middle-latitude stations were calculated. The test of the total ozone column (TOC) from different ozone absorption cross-section data sets shows that in the Dobson and Brewer retrieval algorithms, the effect of temperature on the Brewer instrument is smaller than that for the Dobson instrument. The temperature sensitivity of the two instruments to the SAC is -0.005%degrees C-1 and 0.102%degrees C-1, respectively, indicating that the differences in the temperature sensitivity result in differences in the TOC measurements between the two instruments, as well as in systematic seasonal differences. Using BPQ, DBM and SER to retrieve TOC will increase the overall deviation of the two instruments by 2.5%, -2.77% and -1.89%, respectively. The consistency of the TOC retrieval in the two instruments is the best when using the SAC, which shows a deviation of only 0.03%. The systematic seasonal deviation can also be effectively improved. In addition, this work makes up for the lack of relevant research in low-latitude areas. The rangeability of the monthly mean value of the instrument system deviation at a low-latitude station is about one-half of that at the mid-latitude station (Kunming: 0.2%-1.1%, Hohenpeissenberg: 0.2%-2.0%). This is because the vertical distribution of the ozone and temperature varies in different latitudes, the seasonal variation in the middle and high latitudes is significant, and the effective temperature of ozone (T-eff) in low latitudes changes little.

AB Traffic induced flow within urban areas can have a significant effect on pollution dispersion, particularly for traffic emissions. Traffic movement results in increased turbulence within the street and the dispersion of pollutants by vehicles as they move through the street. In order to accurately model urban air quality and perform meaningful exposure analysis at the microscale, these effects cannot be ignored. In this paper we introduce a method to simulate traffic induced dispersion at high resolution. The computational fluid dynamics software, Fluidity, is used to model the moving vehicles through a domain consisting of an idealised intersection. A multi-fluid method is used where vehicles are represented as a second fluid which displaces the air as it moves through the domain. The vehicle model is coupled with an instantaneous emissions model which calculates the emission rate of each vehicle at each time step. A comparison is made with a second Fluidity model which simulates the traffic emissions as a line source and does not include moving vehicles. The method is used to demonstrate how moving vehicles can have a significant effect on street level concentration fields and how large vehicles such as buses can also cause acute high concentration events at the roadside which can contribute significantly to overall exposure.

AB Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite, is equipped with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) that provides full-disk images of Earth every 10 min for 16 observation bands from visible to infrared. In this study, the capability to assimilate AHI Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been developed within the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system with an hourly cycling configuration and application to a dust storm over East Asia during 5-7 May 2017. Analyses were produced hourly, and 24 h forecasts were produced every 6 h within the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model. It was found that the mean bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) after data assimilation is obviously reduced (by about 30%) when compared to the control experiment which didn't assimilate any observations during the dust storm period, which verified the positive effects of AOD data assimilation systems. In addition, aerosol analyses and forecasts with AOD data assimilation were substantially improved when compared to independent AOD observations from AERONET sites. Therefore, the AOD data assimilation system developed here could be used as a tool to generate better dust storm forecasts.

AB Aerosol Vertical Structure (AVS) retrieved from CALIOP was used to resolve contradictory seasonality between MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and surface PM2.5 over the Northern China Plain (NCP). CALIOP level 2 data was used to determine seasonally averaged day and night time AVS during 2011-2015 at wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm. Results showed that the AVS differed markedly between seasons. It was the most complex during summer days at 532 nm, when a nose like peak was apparent between 500 and 1000 m. This structure was attributed to strong aerosol hygroscopic growth, and accounted for approximately 40% of column AOD. The lowest section of AVS at 532 nm which is important for surface PM2.5 showed the highest during winter, an improved seasonality compared to column AOD; however, discrepancies were apparent during other seasons. Conversely, AVS at 1064 tun was virtually identical to observed PM2.5, implying that coarse particulates are more representative of PM2.5 in the NCP as compared to fine particulates. Thus, MODIS AOD at 550 nm may not be a good proxy for surface PM2.5 retrieval. Using CALIOP active detection, day and night time AOD were obtained, and showed that seasonality was more reasonable at night as compared to during the day. Comparisons of reconstructed daytime CALIOP AOD with MODIS AOD and AERONET AOD implied that winter AOD over the NCP was not as low as indicated by MODIS AOD.

AB Understanding the chemical composition of pollutants released from forest fuel burning is crucial for revealing the effects of forest fire on the atmosphere and ecosystem. However, relevant studies exploring this aspect in China are rare. The emission factors (EFs) of five key pollutants (CO, CO2, NOx, PM2.5), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) from different components of eight dominant tree species in sub-tropical China were determined under both smoldering and flaming stages using a self-designed combustion system. Results demonstrate that the emissions factors of different pollutants varied by tree component under both combustion stages. The average EFs of gaseous pollutants and PM2.5 of leaves, branches, and bark from the eight tree species under two combustion stages equaled 230.49 +/- 17.61 (smoldering) vs. 154.35 +/- 15.61 (flaming, g/kg) for CO; 1018.23 +/- 48.77 vs. 1307.86 +/- 76.99 (g/kg) for CO2; 1.16 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.42 +/- 0.23 (g/kg) for NOx; and 18.62 +/- 4.30 vs. 9.51 +/- 2.75 (g/kg) for PM2.5. Under different combustion stages, leaves and branches from these different tree species released 48 types of NMHCs, including 19 alkanes, 15 alkenes, and 14 aromatic compounds. The total EF of NMHCs ranged from 841.35 to 1846.46 mg/kg (smoldering) to 754.32-1128.88 mg/kg (flaming) for leaves, and from 539.50 to 2907.14 mg/kg (smoldering) to 698.11-1013.49 mg/kg (flaming) for branches. The NMHCs released from the combustion of leaves and branches under smoldering stage were more harmful to the environment and human health than flaming stage, with the most threatening NMHCs released by forest fires being alkenes and i-butane, 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and p-xylene. Acetic acid was found to be the most abundant species among OVOCs, followed by Glycolaldehyde, Formaldehyde, Phenol, and Furan. Our findings are an important step towards further understanding the ecological and health implications of forest fires in subtropical China.

AB Fine particulate nitrate concentrations are often overpredicted by chemical transport models (CTMs). We show that the production rate of nitric acid downwind of major sources of NOx is quite sensitive to the mixing of the NOx-rich plumes with the background atmosphere due to the nonlinearity of the corresponding chemistry especially during nighttime. Low model grid resolution causes artificial mixing of these plumes with the background contributing to these aerosol nitrate prediction errors. This study tests the hypothesis that Plume-in-Grid (PiG) modeling can improve the performance of CTMs for particulate nitrate with minimum computational cost. A PiG model was used in the CTM PMCAMx for major NOx sources in the United States during a summer month. The PM2.5 nitrate predictions at a coarse (36 x 36 km) grid resolution improved with the use of the PiG model (the bias decreased by 33% and the error by 18%) with just a 20% increase in computational cost. The use of the PiG model with 6 x 6 km grid decreased the nitrate bias by 60% and the error by 65% compared to the base case, but with an increase of 2.6 times in computational cost for its application in a limited subdomain (Pennsylvania). Similar results were obtained for a wintertime period.

AB Currently, studies on the characteristics, reactivity and source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are mainly focused on large cities, however, information about the source characteristics of VOCs in less developed regions is insufficient. In this study, ambient air samples (n = 352) were collected from 11 sampling sites (including urban areas, suburban areas, outer suburb areas, and background areas) in Guilin, a typical tourist city located in southwest China, during the period 1st May to 30th November 2018 to determine the concentrations, temporal and spatial distribution, and activity of VOCs and to identify their sources. The results showed that the concentration of VOCs was 23.67 +/- 9.77 ppbv, and aromatics were the most abundant VOCs, accounting for 65.75% of the total VOCs concentrations. The propylene-equivalent concentration and the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs were 10.08 ppbv and 158.02 ppbv, respectively, and aromatics contributed the largest, accounting for 88.87% and 93.00%, respectively. Moreover, the ratios of T/B and X/E were 1.44 +/- 0.92 and 0.74 +/- 1.10, respectively. The temporal and spatial distribution of VOCs showed that there were significant differences of the VOCs concentrations between seasons (higher in autumn and lower in summer) and the VOCs concentrations were both high in urban areas and outer suburb areas. Based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method, 5 sources were identified as fuel evaporation, vehicle exhaust, industrial productions, solvent use, and biogenic emissions, contributing 35.32%, 28.29%, 15.65%, 11.20%, and 9.54%, respectively. Results indicated that a high proportion of aromatics in ambient VOCs and a large contribution of aromatics to O-3 generation are the main characteristics that differentiate Guilin as a typical tourist city from other types of cities. We concluded that the VOCs in Guilin mainly come from the emissions of fuel evaporation and vehicle exhaust, and the impact of industrial emissions is relatively small, which is consistent with the characteristics of a tourist city. Moreover, our results revealed that the aging degree of air mass in Guilin is relatively higher than other cities, which inferred that the VOCs in Guilin may be affected by transmission from external sources.

AB The light scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)), which quantifies the hygroscopicity of polydisperse ambient aerosols at continuous relative humidity (RH) levels, is usually measured by a humidified nephelometer system. The hygroscopicity of aerosol will change evidently under high RH conditions (> 90%). However, in previous studies, only the aerosol hygroscopicity below 90% RH was generally obtained and discussed due to the difficulty in creating a stable high RH and measuring it accurately. In view of these conditions, an improved high-resolution humidified nephelometer system was established to observe the f(RH) of PM2.5 for a wide RH range between 30 and 96% in an urban area of Beijing during three seasons (winter, summer, and autumn) in 2017. Two sensors were used to calculate the humidified RHs, which made the uncertainty in the f(RH) at a high RH much lower than that in previous studies (lower than 10% for the maximum value). It was found that the f (80%) at 525 nm of PM2.5 was evidently higher under polluted conditions and highly correlated with the fractions of all of the water-soluble ions. A two-parameter fitting equation was selected to fit the observed f(RH) data. The f(RH) data under polluted conditions were more uniform with higher fitting R-2 values during the summer and autumn. The hygroscopicity of aerosols has probably increased compared with that in the previous study conducted in the NCP. The fitted curves of the seasonal f(RH) data showed a significant dependence on the wavelength and increased with increasing wavelength. The hygroscopicity of PM2.5 for RH > 90% was definitely lower than that for 80% < RH <= 90%. The hygroscopic growth of aerosols under high RH conditions can probably be overestimated by only using f(RH) data below a RH of 90%.

AB Biomass burning (BB) seriously affect air pollution, human health and global climate. A severe pollution episode (PE) caused by BB was investigated in the southern Sichuan Basin (SSB), one of the most polluted areas in China. Hourly variations in criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3), chemical components, and sources of PM2.5 before, during, and after the severe regional air PE were characterized at three sites, namely Neijiang (NJ), Zigong (ZG), and Yibin (YB). The results showed that combination of intensive pollution from BB, stable meteorological conditions, and the basin topography caused this severe regional PE in the SSB. The average daily concentrations of PM2.5 during the PE were 1.8-6 times those measured during the periods before and after the PE, and 4.0-7.4 times that of World Health Organization air quality guidelines in the SSB. The highest PM levels occurred in ZG, where the peak values of PM2.5 and PM10 reached 536 mu g m(-3) and 578 mu g m(-3) at night, respectively. PM10, NO2, and CO also increased dramatically at night in the SSB. O-3 formation was affected by BB, showing lower levels at night but higher levels in the day during the PE than before and after the PE, whereas SO2 levels were not affected. Sulfate-nitrate-ammonium in PM2.5 was the main chemical compositions before the PE, whereas organic matter (OM) and K+ became characteristics compositions during and after the PE. Higher OC/EC and K-excess/EC ratios were observed during the PE and K-excess/EC ratio was a better indicator of BB in the SSB than OC/EC ratio. The results of a positive matrix factorization model indicated that BB was the most significant contributor to PM2.5 during the PE, accounting for 58% in NJ, 65% in ZG, and 56% in YB. Backward trajectory analysis confirmed that the SSB is susceptible to pollutants from Chongqing and other surrounding cities, especially in ZG and NJ, due to the unique topography of the basin. Our findings suggest that BB in the basin topography can cause severe regional air pollution events at night, thus supporting the critical need for BB control in the basin to improve regional air quality.

AB The light-scattering properties of volcanic sand collected in Iceland are studied here to characterize the sand particles and develop a reference for future remote-sensing observations. While such sand is common in Iceland, the smaller-size fraction can be readily transported by winds and found in the atmosphere at distant locations. The sand appears dark when deposited on a surface due to the high optical absorption of the material. Therefore, atmospheric regions containing such particles during a dust storm may absorb sunlight considerably, causing redistribution of solar energy. Here, we measure the angular scattered-light intensity and degree of linear polarization from the sand. This is done with two experimental apparatuses, the Cosmic Dust Laboratory (CoDuLab) at the Institute de Astroffsica de Andalucia (IAA) and the goniospectropolarimeter (FIGIFIGO) at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI). Two scattering-scenarios of practical interest for remote-sensing applications are considered: (1) single sand-particles suspended in aerosol as an optically thin cloud, and (2) the same particles deposited on a substrate. We also model the measurements with the discrete dipole approximation to estimate the complex-valued refractive index m, where we find that m approximate to 1.6 + 0.01i at lambda = 647 nm. Lastly, we present a comparative analysis of the polarimetric response of the sand particles with that reported in the literature for carbon-soot, another highly absorbing atmospheric contaminant.

AB Although positive environmental aspects of increasing urban vegetative spaces are undeniable, using predefined or unmanaged long-term green programs may cause undesirable and unexpected impacts on the air quality in megacities. In this study, the mitigation potential of three green spaces development scenarios (expansion of surface vegetative area, Green Roof development and combination of surface and roof greenery) on three gaseous air pollutants (O-3, SO2 and NO2) concentrations in Tehran Metropolis in an early summertime period is analyzed using coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF/Chem), single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) and biogenic emission from Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). Current results indicate that general patterns of diurnal distribution of SO2 and NO2 are totally controlled by the location of anthropogenic sources of pollutants in the south and the city center, beside the prevailing wind field over the city of Tehran. Ozone distribution follows the diurnal advection from the northern and eastern sub-urban areas and distribution of primary pollutants such as NO2. By conducting green scenarios, reduction in the wind speed, variations in pollutants dry deposition velocities which are directly affected by the boundary layer and surface properties, and pollutants deposition fluxes are observed. Alterations in deposition fluxes are not uniform across the city area and clearly conform to changes in pollutants concentrations. In addition, the shallower (deeper) boundary layer height and the buoyancy forcing due to the reduction (increase) in near-surface air temperature cause less (more) vertical mass transport during the day (night), which in both situations could have negative impacts on the air quality since under lower wind speed condition and less convective upward transfer, polluted air near the surface can be trapped. The defined scenarios have shown different impacts over the city of Tehran with the complex urban morphology so, suggestion of the most efficient summertime green policy with the minimum negative feedbacks is not conceivable.

AB China has increasingly addressed air pollution problems in its major cities, but they are severe and difficult to solve. The high level of international participation in the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing led to a desire for good air quality. Improved air quality required stringent emission controls in the first half of November. The resultant blue skies at this time attracted widespread comment and was thought to be responsible for the growing use of the term APEC Blue. The China Daily claimed APEC Blue was the top Beijing environmental key word for 2014, an expression it saw coined to describe these clear skies. However, APEC Blue may have other meanings, and convey more a sense of something wonderful, yet fleeting; the phrase often describes the temporary nature of improvements and was used more frequently during the low pollution days of APEC. There are also comments that the controls impose a heavy burden on citizens and even hint at a sense of deception. We explore the use of the term APEC Blue on social media and in publications and argue that it reflects a growing concern about regulation of air pollution in Beijing, particularly suggesting that the pubic doubts the appropriateness of short-term solutions to China's air pollution problems. Social media reveal a growing environmental sophistication in the Chinese public and the need for regulatory authorities to respond to that voice.

AB The increasing anthropogenic pollution and its interaction with precipitation received much attention from the research community and have been explored extensively for understanding the aerosol-cloud interactions. The impacts of orography and aerosols on the precipitation processes have unveiled the Aerosol-Orography-Precipitation (AOP) interaction as an essential research area. The understanding of AOP interaction is critical for improving the extreme rainfall events prediction over mountainous regions. The phase of clouds (warm or mixed) along with orography has emerged as a significant factor for influencing the AOP relations. The present work reviews the modelling and observational based studies dealing with the relationship between orography and aerosols on the precipitation. The study reveals the principal role of aerosols in shifting the precipitation pattern for orographic regions. The environmental factors, especially ambient temperature, humidity and flow patterns are also identified to affect the orographic precipitation. The review also discovers that AOP studies exist only to limited areas of the world due to limited observations, and mostly with idealised cases in the modelling framework.

AB The compositions of six aggregated aerosol samples from the Storm Peak Laboratory site have been comprehensively analysed (Hallar et al., 2013), focusing particularly on the large water-extractable organic fraction which consists of both high molecular weight organic compounds and a range of acids and sugar-alcohols. The contribution of the soluble organic fraction of atmospheric aerosols to their hygroscopicity is hard to quantify, largely because of the lack of a detailed knowledge of both composition and the thermodynamic properties of the functionally complex compounds and structures the fraction contains. In this work we: (i) develop a means of predicting the relative solubility of the compounds in the water-extractable organic material from the Storm Peak site, based upon what is known about their chemical composition; (ii) derive the probable soluble organic fraction from comparisons of model predictions with the measured hygroscopicity; (iii) test a model of the water uptake of the total aerosol (inorganic plus total water-extractable organic compounds). Using a novel UNIFAC-based method, different assignments of functional groups to the high molecular weight water soluble organic compounds (WSOC) were explored, together with their effects on calculated hygroscopic growth factors, constrained by the known molecular formulae and the double bond equivalents associated with each molecule. The possible group compositions were compared with the results of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry measurements of the organic material, which suggest large numbers of alcohol (-OH) and acid (-COOH) groups. A hygroscopicity index (HI) was developed. The measured hygroscopic growth is found to be consistent with a dissolution of the WSOC material that varies approximately linearly with RH, such that the dissolved fraction is about 0.45-0.85 at 90% relative humidity when ordering by HI, depending on the assumptions made. This relationship, if it also applies to other types of organic aerosol material, provides a simple approach to calculating both water uptake and CCN activity (and the kappa parameter for hygroscopic growth). The hygroscopicity of the total aerosol was modelled using a modified Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson approach as the sum of that of the three analysed fractions: inorganic ions (predicted), individual organic acids and "sugar alcohols" (predicted), and the high molecular weight WSOC fraction (measured). The calculated growth factors broadly agree with the measurements, and validate the approach taken. The insights into the dissolution of the organic material seem likely to apply to other largely biogenic secondary organic aerosols from similar remote locations.

AB An intense dusty event unusually occurred in wintertime over the Iberian Peninsula was detected over two Spanish NASA/MPLNET sites: the temporary Torrejan Observational Tower for Environmental Monitoring (TOTEM, 40.5 degrees N 3.5 degrees W) and the Barcelona station (BCN, 41.4 degrees N 2.1 degrees E). The highest dust incidence was observed from 22 to 23 February 2017; this two-day dusty scenario is examined in order to evaluate the performance of the operational NMMB/BSC-Dust model on forecasted mass concentration profiling in comparison with polarized Micro-Pulse (P-MPL) mass estimates for dust particles. First, the optical properties of the dust (DD) were effectively separated from the non-dust (ND) component by using the combined P-MPL/POLIPHON method. Lidar-derived DD optical depths reached maximums of 1.6-1.7 (+/- 0.1) at both stations. Typical features for dust were obtained: linear particle depolarization ratios between 0.3 and 0.4, and lidar ratios in the range of 41-70 sr and 36-66 sr, respectively, for TOTEM and BCN. Lower AERONET Angstrom exponents were reported for TOTEM (0.12 +/- 0.04) than at BCN (0.5 +/- 0.3). HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis showed air masses coming from the Sahara region, mostly transporting dust particles. AERONET-derived Mass Extinction Efficiencies (MEE) under dusty conditions were used for the extinction-to-mass conversion procedure as applied to the P-MPL measurements: MEE values were lower at TOTEM (0.57 +/- 0.01 m(2) g(-1)) than those found at BCN (0.87 +/- 0.10 m(2) g(-1)). Those results reveal that dust particles were predominantly larger at TOTEM than those observed at BCN, and a longer transport of dust particles from the Sahara sources to BCN could favour a higher gravitational settling of coarser particles before reaching BCN than TOTEM. A comparative analysis between profiles as obtained from the lidar DD component of the mass concentration and those forecasted by the NMMB/BSC-Dust model (25 available dusty profiles) was performed. The degree of agreement between both datasets was determined by the percentage of dusty cases satisfying selected model performance criteria (favourable cases) of two proxies: the Mean Fractional Bias, MFB, and the correlation coefficient, CC. A good agreement is found (72% and 76%, respectively, of favourable cases); however, large discrepancies are found at low altitudes between the dust model and the lidar observations, mostly at early stages of the arrival of the dust intrusion. Higher model-derived centre-of-mass (CoM) heights are found in 60% of the cases (with differences < 15% w.r.t. the lidar CoM, whose values ranged between 1.8 and 2.3 km height). In addition, modelled mass loading (ML) values were generally higher than the lidar-derived ones. However, the evolution of the mass loading along the two days, 22 and 23 February, was rather similar for both the model forecasting and lidar observations at both stations. The relative ML differences (< 50%) of the mass loading represented 60% of all cases. Discrepancies can be based on the uncertainties in the lidar retrievals (mainly, the use of single extinction-to mass conversion factors).
   In general, a moderately good agreement is observed between the P-MPL-derived dust mass concentration profiles and the NMMB/BSC-Dust model ones at both sites; large discrepancies are found at lower altitudes, plausibly due to a lower sedimentation of dust particles coming from upper layers by gravitational settling than that introduced by the NMMB/BSC-Dust model in the simulations. The methodology described for the dust model evaluation against the continuous P-MPL observations can be easily adopted for an operational use of the NMMB/BSC-Dust model for forecasting the mass concentration profiling in frequently dust-affected regions with serious climate and environmental implications, as long as a typical MEE for dust could be accurately specified. Hence, a statistical analysis for determining AERONET-based MEE values over the Iberian Peninsula is on-going.

AB Reactive oxidized nitrogen species play a central role in environmental pollution, and long term monitoring is widespread. But conventional NOx (defined as NO + NO2) analyzers employing heated converters respond to many species in addition to the compounds NO and NO2. The response of these instruments to nitric acid, peroxyacetyl nitrate, alkyl nitrates and other oxidized nitrogen species (the sum of these plus NOx is defined as NOy) is well established, but the ratio of NOx to NOy varies widely in time and space making the accuracy of commercial NOx monitors uncertain. Care must be taken when comparing spectroscopic measurements of NO2 or numerical models to output from commercial NOx monitors. Correction factors can be developed for specific conditions, and long term trends can be meaningful. Recent studies comparing modeled NOx to measurements with large interferences can involve errors of a factor of two or more and produce misleading guidance on science and policy; the need for rigorous model evaluation adds urgency to the deployment of "true NOx" monitors.

AB This work provides the first continuous measurements of atmospheric mercury (Hg) at the EMMA Station in Patagonia (Argentina), within the Southern Volcanic Zone of South America. This monitoring site was set up by the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS project) and is located inside Nahuel Huapi National Park (41 degrees 07'43.33 '' S, 71 degrees 25'12.03 '' W; 800 m a.s.l) in a forested valley of the Andes upwind of San Carlos de Bariloche city.
   This study aimed at describing atmospheric Hg levels and trends of variation using concentration data of Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM) collected from October 2012 to July 2017 and, Gaseous Oxidized Mercury (GOM) and Particle-Bound Mercury (PBM) recorded from March 2014 until July 2017. During the studied period the mean GEM concentration was 0.86 +/- 0.16 ng m(-3); with the highest level in the austral spring (0.95 +/- 0.13 ng m(-3)) and the lowest in the autumn (0.80 +/- 0.15 ng m(-3)). Mean GOM concentration was 4.61 +/- 4.00 pg m(-3), displaying the highest level in autumn (5.47 +/- 4.39 pg m(-3)) and the lowest in winter (1.24 +/- 0.90 pg m(-3)). Mean PBM computed for the whole period was 3.74 +/- 3.41 pg m(-3); with the highest mean levels recorded in autumn (6.32 +/- 3.41 pg m(-3)) and the lowest in spring (1.18 +/- 0.92 pg m(-3)). Daytime levels of GEM, GOM and PBM were higher than nighttime concentrations, although in the case GOM and PBM similar levels were computed in autumn and summer, respectively. Westerly winds along with temperature and relative humidity influenced the dynamics of GEM, GOM and PBM at the EMMA Station. The HYSPLIT model showed that the area of the EMMA station was simultaneously affected by local and regional sources (forest fires and volcanoes) while the lowest values were recorded with the inflow of clean oceanic air masses coming from the free troposphere and corresponding to a long-range transport. Moreover, the Potential Source Contribution Function analysis showed that emissions in the Marine Boundary Layer, deriving from remote areas of Pacific Ocean, are sources of GEM and GOM.

AB Stable carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13) can provide insight into sectors of anthropogenic activities emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) in situations where signatures of unique end-members are known. We present an atmospheric modelling framework that combines local delta C-13 signatures of combustion fuels with the Southern Ontario CO2 Emissions (SOCE) inventory to simulate ambient delta(CO2)-C-13 signatures in the Greater Toronto Area. We demonstrate that the modelled delta(CO2)-C-13 captures the variability in measured hourly signatures at the Downsview station from January to March, 2016 as well as the diurnal profile of signatures. We then use our ability to model delta(CO2)-C-13 to assess traditional isotopic mass balance (IMB) and Keeling and Miller-Tans analysis. We performed three IlVIB to estimate the delta(CO2)-C-13 signature of the local CO2 enhancement (delta C-13,) for measured and modelled data (using two background estimates: 5th percentile of a 48-hour running average and output from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS)). We found that when the 5th percentile was used as a background estimate, the delta C-13, was often unrealistic and isotopically heavier compared to that using CAMS. We compared IMB with Keeling analyses based on both overnight and hour-of-day data. For both approaches, when Keeling analyses were run on modelled and measured data, the median delta C-13 signature of the CO2 sources was more variable and on average heavier than the source attribution in the SOCE inventory. Because this issue occurred using both the measurements and the model simulation, it indicates potential issues with these approaches for independent observational constraints on source attribution.

AB To determine the potential sources of dust at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, this study measured the stable isotopic ratios of strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd) and lead (Pb) in insoluble dust in snow samples (as well as in soil and sand samples) from sites in northwestern China and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere: Altay (Xinjiang, China), Ny-Alesund (Svalbard), Barrow (Alaska) and the Arctic Ocean. The combined plots of the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data demonstrate that there are distinctive geographic patterns among the different sampling sites. The Sr-Nd results from the Altay (Xinjiang) and Ny-Alesund (Svalbard) sites display overall crust like isotopic patterns, indicating that local mineral sources represent a significant contribution. The Sr-87/Sr-86 and epsilon(Nd)(0) data from the sea ice snow samples from the Arctic Ocean and snow samples from Barrow (Alaska) suggest potential long-range dust transport to the Arctic region. Our results indicate that Russia may be a source of anthropogenic pollutants for the high Arctic region, while North America may be a source of anthropogenic pollutants for Barrow, Alaska. These findings are beneficial for protecting the environment at the global scale.

AB A new atmospheric iodine gas-phase mechanism containing 248 reactions combined to the RACM air quality mechanism was implemented into a 0D box model in order to evaluate the behaviour of iodine fission products released in the atmosphere. Different simulation scenarios were performed unravelling the influence of several parameters on the iodine speciation (season, day/night, low/medium/high iodine concentration release, nature of the injected iodine species). The main outcomes of our work are the following: (i) the I-2 reactivity is faster than that of CH3I, (ii) iodine nitroxides INOx are mainly formed during night with low and medium releases in winter, (iii) iodine oxides are promoted with a high release of I-2 during summer, (iv) the formation of organic iodine compounds can be highlighted only in the case of a low I-2 release. In this work, I2O, I2O5, and HOIO2 are the most abundant iodine oxides because their atmospheric removal pathways in the gas-phase are not yet known. The main iodinated organic species is CH3OOI arising from the reaction between I atom and the methyl peroxy radical. In case of a CH3I release, before the I atom formation, the reaction mechanism leads to either the formation or the destruction of several other organic iodinated compounds such as CH2IOH and CH2IOO.

AB In the context of global climate warming, spring thaw period had been changed in the permafrost regions, which significantly affect heat and water dynamics, along with soil microbial community structure and diversity, and microbially-mediated nitrogen cycle changes. However, in-situ N2O emission research is scarce in the permafrost regions and the drivers of N2O emission during spring thaw period remain unclear. We selected three type of swamp forests in the permafrost region to investigate the N2O emissions during spring thaw period from 17 March to 23 May 2017. We found that N2O emission ranged from -35.75 to 74.17 mu g m(-2)h(-1) in the permafrost region during spring thaw period, and there was no significant large burst of N2O emissions as observed in other ecosystems. The N2O emission during spring thaw period were lower than those from growing season, which were significant affected by soil temperature. During spring thaw period, swamp forest types had no significantly influence on N2O emissions, which mainly limited by NO3--N content. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that the air temperature, thawing depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N, TOC, TN, and C/N ratio were the environmental factors which significant effecting the N2O emissions. In the field campaign, cumulative N2O emissions were mainly controlled by thawing depth, soil moisture, pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N and TN during spring thaw period. Overall, the results demonstrate that in the permafrost ecosystems spring thaw period is an important source of N2O emissions.

AB Dry deposition process is one of the important pathways for the removal of particles from atmosphere. It is the result of a combination of different environmental and physical factors as atmospheric conditions, particle properties, characteristics of the canopy. For this latter factor, urban canopy represents unevenly combinations of different types of surface elements that increases the complexity of deposition process phenomena. Therefore, particle dry deposition on urban surfaces is not easy to configure and, although empirical or semi-empirical models in literature have been developed to address this aspect, there is not standardized and commonly accepted criteria, especially for submicron particles. In this paper, comparisons of different dry deposition models and measurement data by experimental campaigns, covering for different surface roughness conditions, i.e. from four Italian cities and urban environments of other countries, are performed. Giardina et al. (2017b) model, by using a Brownian diffusion resistance as proposed in this paper, seems to capture the main dry deposition processes for the examined contexts.

AB Ship exhaust emissions need to be calculated at fine spatial and temporal resolutions because chemical transport processes depend on meteorological conditions that have a high degree of spatial and temporal variability. These emissions can also occur in environments that are affected by spatially and temporally varying emissions from other sources. Ship exhaust emissions are calculated using activity data from the Automatic Identification System. The activity data are combined with ship specific technical data. Hourly emissions are obtained for 2014 over the region within 300 km of Sydney at approximately 1 km resolution. These data are aggregated regionally and by vessel type to examine variability at different temporal resolutions. Cruise ship emissions vary both seasonally and diurnally, with low activity in winter and high activity in spring and summer. Diurnal variability is associated with a preference for hoteling at berth during the day and cruising at sea overnight. Emissions from the Sydney Harbour ferries have a strong but more complex diurnal variation that is affected by work related commuting. Monthly variability is also described for other ship types that visited the four major ports in the region. Spatial cell activity hours are analysed to explain large differences in the average spatial extent of the emissions at different temporal resolutions, the accuracy with which the hourly emission rates are estimated using longer term emissions, and the suitability of generalised temporal profiles to describe the emissions data. Regression analysis is used to model the spatial extent of the hourly and daily emissions.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are mainly emitted from vegetation. However there is still little information on BVOC exchanges with crops. In this study we measured fluxes of BVOC from wheat, maize and rapeseed crops near Paris at the plant level during a full-week period for each species. We used dynamic automated chambers coupled to a Proton Transfer Reaction, Quadrupole ion guide, Time of Flight mass spectrometer (PTR-Qi-Tof-MS) instrument for online measurements of BVOC. Our results confirm the hypothesis that many unexplored compounds contribute to BVOC exchanges between crops and the atmosphere, although for all plant species methanol was dominating the emissions (55-85% of the sum of the BVOC exchanges fluxes on a mass basis) followed by acetone and acetaldehyde. The 10 most exchanged compounds, excluding methanol, contributed more than 50% of the summed fluxes and the 100 most exchanged contributed to more than 90%. The summed BVOC emission and deposition presented large interspecies variations, but limited antra-species variability, with a summed net flux of 0.11 +/- 0.02 mu gBVOC g(Dw)(-1) h(-1) for maize, 1.5 +/- 0.7 mu gBVOC g(DW)(-1) h(-1) for wheat, and 9.1 +/- 2.4 mu gBVOC g(DW)(-1) h(-1) for rapeseed. The 10 most emitted compounds were mostly emitted during the day and were correlated with both photosynthetically active radiation and temperature and anti-correlated with relative humidity. This study provides the first evaluation so far of the biosphere-atmosphere fluxes for several BVOC. In particular we provide a first evaluation of standard emission factor for isoprene and monoterpene for wheat and rapeseed at their respective growth stages. This study is however limited to a week period at a given stage for each species and at the plant level.

AB Due to its twofold effects on climate change and air quality, black carbon (BC) is of wide concern in the atmospheric sciences. Considerable uncertainty exists as to the health effects of atmospheric BC for the limited epidemiological and toxicological studies. As combustion-derived BC is one important component of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m), the question remains of whether or not BC may play an important role in PM2.5-related health risks. To quantitatively analyze the short-term health effects of BC and PM2.5, a confounder-adjusted semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) of a time series study was used to calculate the concentration-response relationship between BC and PM2.5 and daily cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality from 2006 to 2011 in Beijing. During the study period, the mean daily concentrations of BC and PM2.5 were 6.8 mu g/m(3) and 75.9 mu g/m(3), respectively. The results showed that BC was significantly associated with CVD mortality, and an interquartile range (IQR) increase in BC (5.7 mu g/m(3)) and PM2.5 (64. 5 mu g/m(3)) were associated with 2.70% (95% CI: 2.20, 3.21) and 4.06% (95% CI: 3.47, 4.65) increase in CVD mortality. The health risk associated with BC may less than that of PM2.5. When adjusted for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the effects of BC remained statistically significant. It showed the relatively difference between BC and PM2.5 when it comes to the modification effects of age, gender and educational attainment. These findings provide valuable evidence to the rare studies of the concentration-response relationship of BC with human health in developing countries.

AB Air quality in India, especially in north India, is increasingly severe due to rapid growth of industrialization and urbanization in past decades. Very few studies were conducted in the recent past to quantify regional contributions to high pollutant concentrations for designing effective control strategies. In this paper, source-oriented versions of Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model were applied to quantify the contributions of nine source regions (Delhi, Haryana & Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh & Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh & Punjab, Central India, West India, South India, East & Northeast India and Outside India) to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its components including primary PM (PPM) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) i.e. sulfate, nitrate and ammonium ions, in Delhi and three surrounding cities, Chandigarh, Lucknow and Jaipur in 2015. PPM is dominated by local sources (> 70%), with Delhi as the top contributor in Delhi contributing to a maximum of 90 mu g/m(3) in winter. Unlike PPM, SIA contributions from non-local sources are more significant. Delhi, Haryana & Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh & Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh & Punjab contribute to similar to 4 mu g/m(3) SIA concentrations in North India. In Delhi, local sources contribute to over 70% of total PM2.5, but the non local sources are still important (over 30%) especially in winter. Furthermore, local emissions contribute less in highly polluted days compared to less polluted days indicating the importance of regional transport on high pollution episodes in Delhi. Overall, while local sources contribute to 1.495 x 10(4) premature deaths in Delhi, non-local sources contribute to 0.483 x 10(4) premature deaths.

AB Ozone is currently the main atmospheric pollutant in the Pearl River Delta region, China. The atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key participators in the formation of ozone. Thus, the pollution profiles of ambient VOCs in Guangzhou city were measured using both offline (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)) and online (proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS)) methods. Three different functional areas were selected as vehicle detection station (VSD), roadside of city expressway (RCE), and Higher Education Mega Center (HEMC). GC/MS measurement results demonstrated that the total concentration of VOCs (TVOCs) with mean values of 55.0, 44.9 and 24.5 ppb at VSD, RCE and HEMC sites, respectively. At VSD site, the dominant group is aromatic hydrocarbons (accounting for 41.4% of TVOCs), in which toluene accounts for the largest proportion (17.6%). In contrast, aliphatic hydrocarbons were the dominant group at RCE (50.2% of TVOCs) and HEMC (47.4% of TVOCs), in which n-hexane was the major compound (18.4% and 21.6% at RCE and HEMC sites, respectively). Comparatively, the mean TVOC levels analyzed with PTR-TOF-MS were much higher at all studied sites, because large quantity of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs accounting for 72.0%, 76.3% and 73.5% of TVOCs at VSD, RCE and HEMC sites, respectively) could be detected, but not by GC/MS. Among OVOCs, methanol was found as the most abundant component at all three studied sites. The assessment of atmospheric photochemical activity showed that the average contributions to ozone formation potential (OFP) from VOCs were 8.5 x 10(2), 7.3 x 10(2) and 8.2 x 10(2) mu g m(-3) at VSD, RCE and HEMC sites, respectively, and OVOCs were the dominant contributors for OFP. The result can provide the references for local government to eliminate VOCs and attenuate ozone pollution.

TI Ca and Sr isotope compositions of rainwater from Guiyang city, Southwest

AB Rainwater samples collected from Guiyang city in southwestern China between May 2009 and December 2010 were analyzed to measure their calcium and strontium isotope compositions. The results show that Ca2+ is the most abundant cation in these rainwater samples, while SO42- is the most abundant anion. Most rainwater samples are alkaline, with a volume-weighted mean (VWM) pH value of similar to 6.2 (a 1.2-unit increase since 2008). This can be explained by the neutralization of rainwater acidity by the dissolution of atmospheric aerosols in the form of calcium-rich soil and other anthropogenic dust, which are increasing because of rapid urbanization. Both stable (delta Ca-44/40 and delta(88)/Sr-86) and radiogenic (Sr-87/Sr-86) isotope compositions of rainwater show variations correlating with each other and with the inverse of Sr or Ca concentrations. They also correlated with the concentration ratio of (NH4+ + K+)/(Ca2+ + Mg2+)-an index reflecting the anthropogenic input relative to soil dust. Based on our results, three major reservoirs can be inferred to have contributed to rainwater chemistry in Guiyang city: (1) a carbonate aerosol source characterized by low Sr-87/Sr-86 (<=similar to 0.708), delta Sr-88/86 (<= similar to 0.32 parts per thousand) and delta Ca-44/40 (similar to 0.5 parts per thousand), very low (NH4+ + K+) / (Ca2+ + Mg2+), and low 1/Ca2+ and 1/Sr2+; (2) a silicate aerosol source characterized by relatively high Sr-87/Sr-86 (>= 0.717), delta Sr-88/86 (>=similar to 0.34 parts per thousand) and delta Ca-44/40 (similar to 0.8 parts per thousand), very low (NH4+ + K+) / (Ca2+ + Mg2+), low 1/Ca2+ and 1/Sr2+; and (3) an anthropogenic component containing low 87Sr/86Sr (similar to 0.708), delta Sr-88/86 (similar to 0.30 parts per thousand) and high delta Ca-44/40 (similar to 0.8 parts per thousand), and high (NH4+ + K+) / (Ca2+ + Mg2+). The chemistry of solutes in Guiyang rainwater can be explained by (1) dissolution of carbonate and silicate aerosols, as well as the anthropogenic inputs including seasonal farming activities; (2) tightened environmental protection regulations; (3) higher precipitation volumes in 2010; and possibly (4) the increased combustion of coal for heating and electricity in winter. This study demonstrated that a combination of elemental compositions, stable Ca and Sr, and radiogenic Sr isotope compositions in rainwater can be used to trace the sources of atmospheric aerosols.

AB The OMI-observed tropospheric NO2 columns over highly polluted regions in East Asia showed high values during the cold seasons. and low values during the warm seasons. On the contrary, the monthly trends over Mongolia are completely opposite to those in polluted regions in East Asia. This study was initiated by such an interesting contrast. To determine the key factors controlling such monthly trends over Mongolia, we used the WRF-CMAQ simulated data. In the analysis, we explored the budget of (P) over bar (NOx) (columnar net NOx chemical production rates), taking into account atmospheric chemical production and removal of NOx as well as surface (soil) NOx emissions. For the polluted regions, NOx emissions show the largest values, followed by (P) over bar (RNO3) in terms of the magnitudes. Among the negative contributors, the largest contribution is made by (P) over bar (RNO3) (columnar net NOx chemical production rates via the HNO3 and RNO3-related reactions) ranging between -42% and -77% during the warm months. Other negative contribution; from (P) over bar (PANs)(columnar net NOx chemical production rates via the formations and decompositions of PANs) and (P) over bar (Hetero). (columnar net NOx chemical production rates via the heterogeneous reactions of NO3 and N2O5) are relatively small. Unlike the situations over the polluted regions, the negative (P) over bar (RNO3) was offset completely by E-NOx (emission of NOx) and positive (P) over bar (PANs) over the remote continental regions of Mongolia. (P) over bar (PANs) was also regarded as an important atmospheric process, and its positive contributions range between 5% and 51% over the remote continental regions of (south) Mongolia. From the analysis, it was found that NO2 produced via thermal decomposition of PANs in the remote continental regions of Mongolia contribute to the high NO2 columns during the warm seasons and low values during the cold seasons.

AB Based on the long-term observed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) data obtained from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, the present study focused on the analysis of annual and seasonal trends of PM2.5 over the polluted areas in China from 2013 to 2018. The MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data was used as an auxiliary data to supplement the analysis with surface measured PM2.5. The emission source inventory and meteorology datasets are also used and analyzed to examine the causes of changes in trends of PM2.5. The results revealed that the annually averaged values of AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations over the high-polluted areas are decreasing year-by-year, with stable values found over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The decreasing trends of PM2.5 concentration and fine particle pollution frequency over the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) area are most obvious. Over the PRD region, PM2.5 concentration maintains below the annual air quality standard (35 mu g/m(3)) with low fine particle pollution frequency. The decreasing trend of averaged PM2.5 in each region is closely related to the reduction of anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions. However, the fluctuated features in different season are mostly influenced by the meteorological conditions. Based on the weather type classifications observed from the COST733 model, the weather types under uniform pressure and eastern high pressure more likely resulted in the occurrence of fine particulate pollution over China. When the weather under the bottom with high pressure occurs, Northeast China (NEC) and BTH regions are most likely to be polluted, which is more likely to lead to heavy fine particle pollution events. The air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area is the most serious when the uniform pressure field weather occurs in winter.

AB The utilization of numerical atmospheric dispersion prediction (NDP) models for assisting the emergency response to emission of radionuclides has been recommended by a working group of the Meteorological Society of Japan. This paper verifies the feasibility of the recommendation through NDP model intercomparison with limited emission source information for the case of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. According to the recommendation of the working group, the NDP models are run under the assumption of a constant rate of emission during the whole forecast period. This is the worst-case scenario when limited source information is available. Generally, no information is provided on the temporal variability and strength of the emissions, while the source location is known. Surface air radionuclide forecasts are utilized for providing warnings of the risk of inhaling radioactive substances suspended in the low-level atmosphere, whereas column-integrated radionuclide forecasts are utilized for estimating the potential maximum wet deposition of radioactive materials on the ground due to precipitation. The NDP model short-range forecasts were validated with observational data for three locations, at the times when the most serious contamination events occurred at each of the three monitoring stations. The NDP models successfully predicted the risk of surface air contamination and/or ground surface contamination caused by wet deposition in these cases. Particularly, the NDP model forecasts allow us to disseminate warnings at effective lead times before exposure to radiation. The different NDP models gradually deviate their forecasts as the lead time progresses. The deviations may indicate the magnitude of forecast errors. Thus, the use of multi-model forecasts is of greater benefit than the single model forecasts, because forecast error information is suggested.

AB Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) is considered to be one of the hotspots for the occurrence of fog events during the winter time. However, the studies on fog water characteristics reported for IGP are limited and toxicological analysis have not been reported still which indirectly affects air quality. Towards this, we chose a rural site at northern edge of IGP and collected fog water samples during winter sampling campaign for the year 2017-18. Twenty-eight fog water samples were collected during the night time and analyzed for pH, conductivity, inorganic species, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals and toxicological evidence based on nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NT-KB) activity. Nitrate and sulfate were dominant anionic species but excess ammonium and calcium neutralized the fog water such that pH value averaged around 6.7 +/- 0.2. Surprisingly, the concentration of DOC (200 coproduct 80 mg/l) was found to be comparable with the total inorganic ions (188 +/- 62 mg/l). The concentration of DOC was found to have an inverse relationship with liquid water content influencing dilution effect whereas inorganic ions concentrations did not show any significant relation. The observed and predicted sulfate concentration in fog water highlighted the sulfate is contributed significantly by aqueous processing of gaseous SO2 into fog water droplets. Cluster analysis results for backward air mass trajectory showed that the contribution of inorganic species including nitrate and sulfate was significantly higher for long range associated air masses whereas regional air masses had significant DOC contribution. All the fog water samples showed pro inflammation response based on NF-K beta activity values and which was further found to be 52% higher for the local emissions compared to long range transport emissions.

AB The serious degradation of regional air quality is a critical social issue in East Asia despite continuous efforts to reduce the emission of pollutants and their precursors. To better understand high-pollution events in this region, the synoptic weather patterns associated with springtime non-dust high PMic, (High PM10) events and Asian Dust events in Seoul, South Korea, are examined for the 2001-2018 period. It is shown that the two high-pollution events accompany different atmospheric circulations. While High PM10 events are associated with weak surface cyclonic circulations over the Southeast China, Asian Dust events are characterized by strong cyclones over Northeast China. Composite weather maps show that mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies are exactly the opposite between the two events with anticyclonic anomalies over the Korean Peninsula for High PM10 events but cyclonic anomalies for Asian Dust events. The cluster analyses further reveal that High PM10 events are not determined by a single dominant weather pattern. They are associated with surface cyclonic circulations from southeastern China to the Sea of Okhotsk, anticyclonic circulations around the Korean Peninsula or their mixtures. This result is in contrast with the Asian Dust events which are primarily driven by vertically well-organized continental cyclones.

AB Previous studies have proposed that model performance statistics from earlier photochemical grid model (PGM) applications can be used to benchmark performance in new PGM applications. A challenge in implementing this approach is that limited information is available on consistently calculated model performance statistics that vary spatially and temporally over the U.S. Here, a consistent set of model performance statistics are calculated by year, season, region, and monitoring network for PM2.5 and its major components using simulations from versions 4.7.1-5.2.1 of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for years 2007-2015. The multi, year set of statistics is then used to provide quantitative context for model performance results from the 2015 simulation. Model performance for PM2.5 organic carbon in the 2015 simulation ranked high (i.e., favorable performance) in the multi-year dataset, due to factors including recent improvements in biogenic secondary organic aerosol and atmospheric mixing parameterizations in CMAQ. Model performance statistics for the, Northwest region in 2015 ranked low (i.e.; unfavorable performance) for many species in comparison to the 2007-2015 dataset. This finding motivated additional investigation that suggests a need for improved speciation of wildfire PM2.5 emissions and modeling of boundary layer dynamics near water bodies. Several-limitations were identified in the approach of benchmarking new model performance results with previous results. Since performance statistics vary widely by region and season, a simple set of national performance benchmarks (e.g., one or two targets per species and statistic) as proposed previously are inadequate to assess model performance throughout the U.S. Also, trends in model performance statistics for sulfate over the 2007 to 2015 period suggest that model performance for earlier years may not be a useful reference for assessing model performance for recent years in some cases. Comparisons of results from the 2015 base case with results from five sensitivity simulations demonstrated the importance of parameterizations of NH3, surface exchange, organic aerosol volatility and production, and emissions of crustal cations for predicting PM2.5 species concentrations.

AB Volatile organic halocarbons play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of halogens in the atmosphere. High frequency, in situ measurements of methyl iodide (CH3I), bromoform (CHBr3), dibromomethane (CH2Br2) and methyl bromide (CH3Br) were measured in the marine boundary layer at Cape Point, South Africa by an automated Absorption Desorption System-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (ADS-GC-MS) between January and November 2017. These are the first multi-halocarbon measurements recorded at Cape Point and represent the longest time series to date. Baseline wind conditions were established using both wind direction and radon (Rn-222) concentration as markers of dean air. The baseline mixing ratios observed were 0.61 +/- 0.29, 2.02 +/- 0.89, 1.08 +/- 0.17 and 6.09 +/- 0.50 ppt, for CH3I, CHBr3, CH2Br2, and CH3Br, respectively. A statistically significant difference in short-lived halocarbon occurrence was established between anthropogenically affected and clean marine air masses for CH3Br at the Cape Point site. The CHBr3 and CH2Br2 mixing ratios were not statistically different (p > 0.05) when comparing the anthropogenically affected and dean marine air masses. The mixing ratios of CH3I suggested a strong seasonal variation with higher production in austral Summer-Autumn months than in the austral Winter-Spring months. A general chemical decay line was calculated for baseline CH2Br2 and CHBr3 measurements at Cape Point An analysis of the lnUCH2Br21/[CHBr3]):In ([CHBr3]) ratio for the Cape Point dataset exhibited a slight deflection to the right of the general chemical decay line, suggesting the influence of greater [CHBr3]:[CH2Br2] source ratios rather than their dilution.

AB An improved understanding of how emissions from different regions are transported globally is necessary to establish stronger causal relationships between particulate matter emissions and global scale circulation. This study uses the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to identify spatial differences in the transport of Saharan dust emitted from different regions in Northern Africa, during different seasons, and in different particle size modes. This study finds noticeable spatial differences in the transport of dust emitted from each region of the Sahara and during each season. Dust emitted from the northern regions of the Sahara undergoes 25% more latitudinal and 2% more longitudinal transport than dust emitted from the more southern regions. Dust originating from the central regions of the Sahara experiences 28% and 11% more longitudinal transport than dust from western and eastern regions, respectively. Dust emitted from the Sahara during the period from April to June travels 10%, 25%, and 17% percent further latitudinally, longitudinally, and vertically, respectively, than the annual average. As expected coarse mode particles travel shorter distances than fine mode particles. Rather than determining the regions which produce the most dust, we focus on identifying the regions producing the dust that is most extensively transported.

AB Regional transport plays a significant role in the air pollution in China, which is characterized by diverse emission sources and distinct distributions. To improve the understanding of factors determining the PM2.5 level in China, a source apportionment tool coupled with the RAMS-CMAQ model (CMAQ-ISAM) was used to quantify the contribution of transport to PM2.5 and its major components during 2017 in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Chengyu area. It is found that transport accounts for a predominant fraction of the PM2.5 in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai with relatively low PM2.5 levels. Transport in the NCP is mainly at intraregional scale and comparable to local emissions. In contrast, the contributions of interregional transport from the NCP to the YRD (similar to 10-25%) and from NCP and YRD to PRD and Chengyu (similar to 5-25%) is at similar level to those of intraregional transport and local emissions in winter and fall, but are lower in spring and summer. It is worth noting that particle components have very different transport capabilities. Nitrate exhibits much stronger intraregional transport than other components in the NCP, and much higher concentration than other components during winter. In contrast, the concentration of sulfate is higher than that of nitrate during spring and summer in most provinces. In addition, the transport potential of primary OC, EC, and ammonia are relatively weaker, but these compounds can still have considerable contributions. Our results reveal that the notable contributions of regional transport to PM2.5 should be addressed according to. targeted emission sources in order to improve air quality efficiently.

AB The wet S deposition was treated as a key issue because it played the negative on the soil acidification, biodiversity loss, and global climate change. However, the limited ground-level monitoring sites make it difficult to fully clarify the spatiotemporal variations of wet S deposition over China. Therefore, an ensemble model of improved machine learning and geostatistical method named fruit fly optimization algorithm-random forest-spatiotemporal Kriging (FOA-RF-STK) model was developed to estimate the nationwide S deposition based on the emission inventory, meteorological factors, and other geographical covariates. The ensemble model can capture the relationship between predictors and S deposition flux with the better performance (R-2 = 0.68, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.51 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared with the original RF model (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 8.99 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Based on the improved model, it predicted that the highest and lowest S deposition flux were mainly concentrated on the Southeast China (69.57 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1)) and Inner Mongolia (42.37 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1)), respectively. The estimated wet S deposition flux displayed the remarkably seasonal variation with the highest value in summer (22.22 kg S ha(-1) sea(-1)), follwed by ones in autumn (18.30 kg S ha(-1) sea(-1)), spring (16.27 kgS ha(-1) sea(-1)), and the lowest one in winter (14.71 kgS ha(-1) sea(-1)), which was closely associated with the rainfall amounts. The study provides a novel approach for the S deposition estimation at a national scale.

AB The impact of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure on air pollution in Northeast China, where frequently experiences air pollution episodes in autumn and winter, is not well understood due to a lack of observations. In this study, four pollution episodes during autumn and winter of 2016 at Shenyang, a provincial capital city in Northeast China, were examined to investigate the linkage between the PBL structure and air pollution using meteorological sounding data and LiDAR-retrieved profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients. We also conducted a tracer simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to demonstrate the transport and vertical mixing of air pollutants in the PBL. The results indicated that a stable, moist and shallow surface layer (< 400 m) formed and remained at night due to strong surface radiative cooling after a steep decline of temperature during the first air-pollution episode (EP1, from 12:00 Local Time (LT) on November 26 to 07:00 LT on November 27). Stable stratification and stagnant winds contributed to the increase of surface pollutant concentrations in EP1. Strong surface potential temperature inversion and enhanced local emissions during evening rush hour resulted in the formation of EP2 (13:00-23:00 LT on December 2). Observations and modelling results revealed that large amount of pollutants were transported by the southerly nocturnal low-level jets from the North China Plain to Shenyang after EP2. These pollutants were trapped in the residue layer at night and then mixed to the surface after sunrise due to convective turbulence, leading to the formation of EP3 (06:00-23:00 LT on December 3). EP4 (03:00-14:00 LT on December 4) occurred in the convergence zone ahead of an approaching trough. Low wind speed (< 6 m s(-1)) and high relative humidity (> 80%) in the PBL enhanced the deterioration of air quality near the surface.

AB t The concentrations of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), methyl iodide (CH3I), dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl), and bromoform (CHBr3) were determined in the marine atmosphere and surface seawater of the East China Sea (ECS) and the South Yellow Sea (SYS) between March and April 2017. Mean mixing ratios (range) of CFC-11, CH3I, CH2Br2, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3 were 192.6 (179.4-226.9), 2.0 (0.7-4.5), 1.0 (0.3-8.0), 0.8 (0.2-5.0), 0.7 (0.2-3.0), and 5.6 (1.1-25.3) pptv, respectively. Anthropogenic activities contributed to elevated atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11, while a combination of biological processes in the seawater and terrestrial sources contributed to elevated atmospheric concentrations of CH3I and bromoalkanes. Mean (range) concentrations of CFC-11, CH3I, CH2Br2, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3 in the surface seawater were 9.47 (4.43-21.28), 4.65 (3.70-6.05), 12.07 (9.63-31.07), 5.45 (1.06-30.04), 13.51 (4.36-54.29), and 15.80 (1.21-34.51) pmol L-1, respectively. Productions of CH3I and bromoalkanes in the surface seawater might be influenced by phytoplankton, picophytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, dissolved organic carbon, and nutrients. CFC-11 in the atmosphere and seawater showed little diurnal variation. Compared with weak variation in the seawater, CH3I in the atmosphere showed a significant diurnal variation with a range of 1.2-5.6 pptv. The variation of bromoalkanes concentrations in the atmosphere corresponded to the water concentrations, with the highest value occurring at mid-day. In the current study, the emissions of CH3I, CH2Br2, and CHBr3 from the ECS and the SYS accounted for about 1.1%, 1.8%, and 0.01% of the annual global ocean emissions, respectively, highlighting the importance of the coastal areas to the reactive bromine and iodine in the atmosphere.

AB In recent years, more haze days have been detected with the intensification of air pollution in China. Haze is a serious environmental problem that is influencing human health. This study focuses on revealing the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of haze, haze formation factors, and health risks in China since the reform and opening-up. The purpose of this study is to provide a reference for haze governance and develop suggestions for public health. In this study, haze was identified by visibility and meteorological data from 1973 to 2017. Haze days and visibility on haze days were calculated during this period. By using standard deviation ellipse analysis and principal component regression, we calculated the variation of the haze barycenter, standard deviation in the haze area, and contribution rates of the main influencing factors in nine typical regions. Haze seasonal variation and health risk assessment were also analysed in this study. The results show that the changes in haze in China present as five periods: 1973-1979,1980-1989,1990-2001, 2002-2010, and 2011-2017. Haze days in the majority of typical cities in central and eastern China show a tendency of growth or fluctuating growth, and the variation intensified after the 1990s. In most areas, there were about 100 haze days, and the visibility on haze days was approximately 7 km until 2017. The main body of the haze area in China is approximately a diamond-shaped pentagon with BEIJING, CHENGDU, NANNING, GUANGZHOU, and SHANGHAI as the apexes. In addition, GANSU and northeast China are also influenced by haze. The haze situation in typical areas has grown since 1973. The haze centres tended to move outwards, especially from 2002-2010, which was a turning point for haze variation. For most regions, pollutant emissions as well as economic and governance factors were the main contributing factors. Haze has obvious seasonal variation in China. Haze in winter is the heaviest, and then haze in autumn, summer and spring becomes relatively mild. The haze health risk increased sharply and expanded from 1973 to 2017. High- and extremely high-risk areas are still concentrated in the diamond region of the haze area and have expanded along or surround main traffic lines and major cities. Through analysis of the contributions of haze factors in various regions of China, this study suggests that the most important means of haze governance comprise four aspects: I) a reduction of exhaust emissions, II) the implementation of green consumption, travel, and behaviour concepts, III) enhanced governance, and IV) urbanization that is as balanced as possible; furthermore, the development of cities such as enclaves should be promoted to avoid health risks to large cities.

AB Shifting freight from regular hours to nighttime has been widely used to relieve traffic congestion and reduce diesel emissions. However, there are also several cities that restrict trucks from operating at night to meet the noise regulation. Uncertainty exists in terms of the environmental impact of these truck shifting programs. On one hand, shifting trucks from peak hours can reduce the total emissions by easing congestion, while the impact of moving truck emissions to nighttime will be interacted with more stable atmospheric boundary layer and lower mixing height, increasing the nighttime concentration. On the other hand, shifting trucks from the night to day avoids the emissions with a stable atmosphere at night, while worsening traffic condition at daytime, and hence increasing the total emissions. The research presents a realistic case study and explores a comparative analysis of PM2.5 concentration originated from a hypothetical freeway corridor and concentrated at a hospital located at 200-m far away from the corridor by implementing four truck strategies applied under various scenarios with traffic demands and heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) proportions. Two meteorological conditions are also considered, with one representing coast region and unstable atmospheric boundary layer, and thus good dispersion condition, and one inland region with a relatively stable atmospheric condition and bad dispersion condition. The results indicate that shifting trucks from peak-period to off-peak period is effective to reduce both emissions and 24-hr average concentrations in scenarios of high traffic demands and high truck proportions, in which the peak period traffic is congested and thus the benefits of reducing congestion and resultant emissions are quite large by altering freight trucks from peak period. It is also observed in the scenarios with lower-traffic demand where the traffic congestion is less severe (in this case, the throughput is less than 75,000 vehicles per day on a three-lane freeway segment, and average speed is higher than 60 km/h), although shifting truck from night to day increase emissions by adding the shifted traffic demand at peak period, it decreases the average concentration by avoiding nighttime emissions. Such a benefit will be further amplified in the meteorological condition of low mixing height at night. Shifting trucks from daytime to nighttime is found to be the strategy that contributes to the highest average PM2.5 concentration, although sometimes the total emissions are minimized.

AB Methane, CH4, is a powerful greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere by both anthropogenic and natural sources. Urban areas play an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, yet few efforts have been made to investigate CH4 concentration and its spatial variability in cities. In this paper, a case study to monitor the spatial pattern and determinants of near-surface urban CH4 concentration was conducted in Shanghai, the commercial and financial center of mainland China. A total of 173 sampling points were collected to examine the atmospheric CH4 concentration across different land use types and urban-rural gradients at a height of 2 m above the ground in April and May 2014. The contributions of potential influencing factors, including four indicators of human activities (e.g., distance to natural gas pipelines [Dist_gas], distance to sewage plants (Dist_sew), population density [Den_pop), density of road network [Den-road]) and two indicators of natural conditions (i.e., planetary boundary layer height [BLH] and land surface temperature [LST]), in determining spatial CH4 concentrations were investigated using Lindeman-Merenda-Gold (LMG) metric. The results indicated that the average CH4 concentration in the morning for the region was 1,897 +/- 92 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with significant spatial heterogeneity. Atmospheric CH4 had negative correlation with the distance to urban center except the influence of obvious emission sources, such as petrochemical plants etc. The six selected influencing factors could explain 76.3% of the CH4 spatial variability. Population density was the dominant factor for about 27.2%, while the distance to the natural gas pipelines, planetary boundary layer height and distance to the sewage plants were about 14.4%, 14.2% and 12.6%, respectively. The finding in this study might help to build a better understanding of the mechanics of CH4 variations and evaluation of the potentially influencing factors.

AB As air pollution becomes more and more severe, air quality prediction has become an important approach for air pollution management and prevention. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to predict air quality, such as deterministic methods, statistical methods as well as machine learning methods. However, these methods have some limitations. Deterministic methods require expensive computations and specific knowledge for parameter identification, while the forecasting performance of statistical methods is limited due to the linear assumption and the multicollinearity problem. Most of the machine learning methods, on the other hand, cannot capture the time series patterns or learn from the long-term dependencies of air pollutant concentrations. Furthermore, there is a lack of methods that could generate high prediction accuracy for air quality forecasting at larger temporal resolutions, such as daily and weekly or even monthly. This paper, therefore, proposes a deep learning-based method namely transferred bi-directional long short-term memory (TL-BLSTM) model for air quality prediction. The methodology framework utilizes the bi-directional LSTM model to learn from the long-term dependencies of PM2.5, and applies transfer learning to transfer the knowledge learned from smaller temporal resolutions to larger temporal resolutions. A case study is conducted in Guangdong, China to test the proposed methodology framework. The performance of the framework is compared with other commonly seen machine learning algorithms, and the results show that the proposed TL-BLSTM model has smaller errors, especially for larger temporal resolutions.

AB Airborne microorganisms transported by dust events from Asian Deserts influence climate changes, ecosystem dynamics and human health in the westerly-wind blowing areas of East Asia. However, the vertical transport of airborne microorganisms was not understood in detail. We collected aerosols at high altitudes (800 m and 500 m) and ground levels (5 m and 10 m) at Asian dust-source area, such as the Taklimakan and Gobi Deserts, for analyzing compositions and abundances of the airborne microorganisms that are distributed vertically over desert area. Assessment of the dust particles using an optical particle counter and microscopic observation counts demonstrated that the mineral and microbial particles remained suspended at altitudes of over 300 m and decreased to half to one-tenth of concentrations compared to those at the ground level. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (bacterial taxonomic marker) revealed that the airborne bacterial communities were mixed vertically at the altitudes of some hundreds of meters over both the sites and were predominantly composed of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. In contrast, using sequencing analysis of internally transcribed spacer regions (fungal taxonomic markers), the fungal community structures over both the sites were different at high altitudes and ground levels. Sequences belonging to the phylum Ascomycota increased at high altitudes and comprised those of a commonly detected mold that includes the genera Cladosporium and Alternaria and is thought to be resistant to atmospheric stressors. Our results indicate that airborne bacterial communities are easily mixed vertically over dust-source desert, while stressor-tolerant fungi of airborne Ascomycota remain at high altitudes of desert atmosphere.

AB Daily visibility records of the Italian Air Ford synoptic stations over the 1951-2017 period have been used to set up a monthly quality/homogeneity checked dataset of fraction of days with visibility higher than or equal to 10 km (fVV10) and 20 km (fVV20) at 12 UTC. This dataset has been used to calculate regional average fVV10 and fVV20 records for 5 Italian climatic regions. The fVV10 and fVV20 averages show a strong spatial variability with the lowest values in the Po plain, one of the most polluted areas of Europe. In agreement with the results reported in literature for Europe, fVV10 and fVV20 show a positive trend over the whole considered period due to a strong increase starting in the 1980s. Differently, in the previous period, visibility decreases. Moreover, moving from low level areas to mid and high level ones the trends become much weaker, highlighting how the signal decreases with elevation. The analyses performed removing the days with high relative humidity or considering only the clear-sky days show that relative humidity and cloudiness do not have any effect on the observed trends, suggesting that the main driving factor is aerosol load. This hypothesis is supported by the comparison of visibility records with modelled aerosol concentrations, atmospheric optical depth values and emission records. Finally, the trends of fVV10 and fVV20 are in very good agreement with Italian regional records of other variables linked to atmospheric turbidity, like sunshine duration and surface solar radiation.

AB Atmospheric dust is the main aerosol component over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The atmospheric dust over the TP influences climate at local and regional scales through its direct effects on solar and longwave radiation. There are various sources of atmospheric dust over the TP, including the semiarid and arid areas in East Asia as a near source and those in the Middle East and Central Asia and North Africa as remote sources. This study estimates the contributions of these sources to the atmospheric dust over the TP based on a five-year simulation (2010-2014) of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The contributions of all sources were higher in spring than in the other seasons, with the highest dust loading and concentrations in spring over the TP. The dust in the middle to high troposphere over the TP had diameters varying from 0.04 to 2.5 mu m, showing higher dust number concentrations in spring (at 500 hPa) than in other seasons (at 300 hPa). TP was mainly influenced by East Asian source, which dominated the dust loading over the TP with a contribution of 59-78% in all four seasons. As a result, the East Asian source affected the dust concentration at 500 hPa over the TP by contributing 55% in summer, 44% in autumn, and 27-36% in spring and winter with respect to those of the North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources. The North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources influenced the TP through a mainly northern route in the middle to upper troposphere from Central Asia to the TP. The dust concentration at 300 hPa over the TP was dominated by dust from the North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources by a contribution of 31%-58% for North Africa and 36% for the Middle East and Central Asia in the four seasons.

AB We demonstrate how a hierarchical network comprising a number of compliant reference stations and a much larger number of low-cost sensors can deliver reliable high temporal-resolution ozone data at neighbourhood scales. The larger than expected spatial and temporal variation of ozone in a heavily-trafficked urban environment is thereby demonstrated. The framework, demonstrated originally for a smaller scale regional network deployed in the Lower Fraser Valley, BC was tested and refined using two much more extensive networks of gas-sensitive semiconductor-based (GSS) sensors deployed at neighbourhood scales in Los Angeles: one of similar to 20 and one of similar to 45 GSS ozone sensors. Of these, ten sensors were co-located with different regulatory measurement stations, allowing a rigorous test of the accuracy of the algorithms used for off-site calibration and adjustment of low cost sensors. The method is based on adjusting the gain and offset of the low-cost sensor to match the first two moments of the probability distribution of the sensor result to that of a proxy: a calibrated independent measurement (usually derived from regulatory monitors) whose probability distribution evaluated over a time that emphasizes diurnal variations is similar to that at the test location. The regulatory measurement station physically closest to the low-cost sensor was a good proxy for most sites. The algorithms developed were successful in detecting and correcting sensor drift, and in identifying locations where geographical features resulted in significantly different patterns of ozone variation due to the relative dominance of different dispersion, emission and chemical processes. The entire network results show very large variations in ozone concentration that take place on short time- and distance scales across the Los-Angeles region. Such patterns were not captured by the more sparsely distributed stations of the existing regulatory network and demonstrate the need for reliable data from dense networks of monitors.

AB The sources of elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols in Asian outflow were investigated in the spring of 2015 in terms of radiocarbon (C-14) and molecular marker analyses. The contribution of fossil fuel (FF) sources to carbonaceous aerosols (TC) significantly increased in polluted air masses with enhancements in the concentrations of carbon monoxide. For EC, FF sources dominated in the polluted air masses. For OC, the contributions of non-FF sources other than biomass burning (BB) were found to be significant (comparable to or higher than those of FF sources), especially in air masses with higher values of the water-soluble fraction of OC (f(WSOC)) and C-14 concentrations ((FC)-C-14). Positive correlations between f(WSOC) and (FC)-C-14 indicate that the origins of TC (mainly OC) have great impacts on the water solubility variability and the subsequent cloud formation processes of OC during transport. We found the importance of natural sources as possible origins of OC in non-polluted (Le., background) air. This study raises the need to further investigate the source apportionment of OC, especially its natural origins, for more accurately assessing the climatic impacts of EC and OC in East Asia.

AB The warming effect of equivalent Black Carbon (EBC) aerosols due to their light absorbing nature is a serious environmental concern, particularly, in the eco-sensitive and glaciated Himalayan region. Moreover, baseline data on BC is rarely available from most of the glaciated Himalayan region. For the first time, measurements on ambient EBC mass concentration were made at a high altitude site Chirbasa (3600 m, amsl), near Gangotri Glacier in the Indian Himalaya, during the year 2016. The change in the EBC concentration over the year was recorded from 0.01 mu g M-3 to 4.62 mu g m(-3) with a diurnal variability of 0.10 mu g m(-3) to 1.8 mu g m(-3). The monthly mean concentration of EBC was found to be minimum (0.089 +/- 0.052 mu g m(-3)) in August and maximum (0.840 +/- 0.743 mu g m(-3)) in the month of May. The observed seasonal mean concentrations of EBC are less than 0.566 mu g m(-3) whereas the annual mean is 0.395 +/- 0.408 mu gm(-3) indicating a pristine glacial and absence of locality EBC sources. Further, investigation on the occasional high values extricated that the seasonal cycle of EBC was significantly influenced by the emissions resulting from agriculture burning (in western part of the country), forest fires (along the Himalayan slopes) in summer, and to some extent the contribution from long range transport of pollutants in winter, depending the prevailing meteorological condition.

AB Botanical biofiltration using active green walls is showing increasing promise as a,viable method for the filtration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ambient air; however there is a high level of heterogeneity reported amongst VOC removal efficiencies, and the reasons for these observations have yet to be explained. Comparisons of removal efficiencies amongst studies is also difficult due to the use of many different VOCs, and systems that have been tested under different conditions. The current work describes a procedure to determine whether some of these differences may be related to the chemical properties of the VOCs themselves. This work used an active green wall system to test the single pass removal efficiency (SPRE) of nine different VOCs (acetone, benzene, cyclohexane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, isopentane, isopropanol and toluene) and explored which chemical properties were meaningful predictor variables of their biofiltration efficiencies. Ethanol was removed most efficiently (average SPRE of 96.34% +/- 1.61), while benzene was least efficiently removed (average SPRE of 19.76% +/- 2.93). Multiple stepwise linear regression was used to determine that the dipole moment and molecular Mass were significant predictors of VOC SPRE, in combination accounting for 54.6% of the variability in SPREs amongst VOCs. The octanol water partition coefficient, proton affinity, Henry's law constant and vapour pressure were not significant predictors, of SPRE. The most influential predictor variable was the dipole moment, alone accounting for 49.8% of the SPRE variability. The model thus allows for an estimation of VOC removal efficiency-based on a VOC's chemical properties, and supports the idea that system optimisation could be achieved through methods that promote both VOC partitioning into the biofilter's aqueous phase, and substrate development to enhance adsorption.

AB Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere by various natural and anthropogenic sources. Numerous studies have been conducted to quantify the major and minor CH4 sources on spatial and temporal time scales. A minor source of the atmospheric global CH4 budget is the direct release of CH4 from the living human body. Based on available data from recent publications, for the first time, CH4 emissions from human breath and flatus are estimated on a global scale taking into account dominant factors influencing emission, such as age, ethnicity, and gender. Human CH4 emissions are compared between preindustrial times (1750), present age (2017) and future prediction (2100) using demographic data based on World Population Prospects 2017 of the United Nations (UN 2017). In preindustrial times the global CH4 release by humans is estimated at 34 +/- 28 Gg and then substantially increase by a factor of ten reaching 344 +/- 255 Gg by 2017. Emissions are estimated to further increase by almost fourfold to a value of 1221 +/- 672 Gg by 2100, even though the rise in population is predicted to only increase by 50%. This nonlinear relationship is related to the predicted change in population structure affecting the number of CH4 producers. In contrast, for the year 2100 the simplified non-weighted estimation which merely considers the expected increase in population would only account for 612 +/- 169 Gg. The discrepancy between the simplified non-weighted and weighted estimations of human CH4 emissions emphasises the importance of factor-based calculations in order to compile more accurate data.

AB The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network is the basis for monitoring visibility in Class I Areas throughout the United States. Monitoring is conducted by collecting PM2.5 and PM10 samples every third day at over 150 remote and rural sites nationwide, with PM2.5 samples being analyzed for chemical composition. Light extinction is reconstructed using an algorithm that relates speciated mass to light extinction based on aerosol mass and size (second IMPROVE equation). In addition, the National Park Service directly measures light scattering at a subset of IMPROVE sites using Optec NGN-2 integrating nephelometers. The optical measurements serve as a check of the reconstructed scattering, in that measured scattering from the nephelometers and reconstructed scattering from the second IMPROVE equation should be equivalent. During its development, the second IMPROVE equation was shown to accurately estimate light scattering for a broad range of aerosol compositions and loadings for samples collected through 2003. Here reconstructed scattering is assessed from the second IMPROVE equation by comparing measured light scattering from nephelometers to reconstructed light scattering at 11 collocated sites over a 16 year period (2001-2016). The comparisons suggest that the relationship between measured and reconstructed light scattering has changed over time and that in recent years the second IMPROVE equation has underestimated light scattering at many sites. This shift toward poorer agreement corresponds to periods with relatively large decreases in sulfate and organic mass concentrations. These decreases lead to biases in reconstructed scattering calculated with the second IMPROVE equation, due to the assumed relationship between mass concentration and size distribution. This relationship, referred to as the split component algorithm, appears to be flawed as currently implemented. A potential approach is explored that scales the split component algorithm each year and at each site, based on measured mass concentrations at the site. The proposed approach appears to reduce the biases in the second IMPROVE equation.

AB Carbonyl compounds (carbonyls) play important roles in atmospheric photochemistry, serving as reservoirs of radicals (OH, HO2, and RO2) and precursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Field measurements of gaseous and particulate carbonyls were taken over urban Beijing during summer and winter, and field-measured gas particle partitioning coefficients (K-p) were determined. Compared with theoretical values, field-measured K-p values were 4-6 orders of magnitude higher for the six detected carbonyls, which underlined the importance of heterogeneous reactions. In winter, the K-p, values of carbonyl compounds were one order of magnitude higher than those in summer owing to the effect of temperature. This study applied the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to the source apportionment of carbonyl compounds. Five factors were identified for both summer and winter, whereas the biogenic factor was only identified in summer and coal burning was only found in winter. In summer, secondary formation was the largest contributor (39%) to the measured total carbonyl compounds levels. In contrast, vehicular exhaust was the largest source of the measured total carbonyl compounds in winter (37%), although secondary formation still had an important contribution of 31%. The contribution of coal burning to ambient carbonyls was reduced by half compared with prior results. As the most abundant carbonyl compound in the atmosphere, formaldehyde in summer mainly came from secondary production (42%) and primary anthropogenic emissions (48%), while biogenic sources had a minor contribution (10%). However, 78% of formaldehyde was attributed to primary anthropogenic emissions in winter, which indicated that these winter emissions were more important sources of carbonyl compounds. Glyoxal was always dominated by secondary formation, with contributions of 56% in summer and 52% in winter.

AB Concentrations of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particle-bound mercury (PBM) were measured at a suburban site in northern Taiwan between October 2017 and September 2018. Mean concentrations of GEM, GOM, and PBM were 2.61 +/- 6.47 ng m(-3), 12.1 +/- 34.3 pg m(-3), and 18.7 +/- 86.8 pg m(-3), respectively. On 35% of the days, elevated atmospheric mercury (Hg) concentration occurred between midnight and early morning when local wind direction shifted and came from sectors between SSW and S, indicating influence of local anthropogenic emission sources. As such, a diurnal pattern with nighttime peaks was observed for GEM, GOM, and PBM. However, elevated GOM values were also observed around noon on 87 occasions, coinciding with peak O-3 and solar radiation, suggesting additional contribution from in situ photochemical reactions. Seasonally, atmospheric Hg concentrations were higher in spring than in the other seasons. Besides the contribution from local emissions and the East Asian outflow, lower wind speed, cumulative rainfall, and days of rain in spring suggesting poor air dispersion and inefficient pollutant removal, hence leading to the accumulation of atmospheric Hg and thus higher concentrations. Two trans-boundary haze events from China were encountered during this study. Concentrations of GEM and PBM were enhanced on haze days, with particularly significant enhancement in PBM. Comparison of the maximum PBM values during these haze events to respective pre-event PBM values showed enhancements of 378% and 1438%, whereas enhancements of 100% and 147% were observed for GEM. GOM remained relatively low and stable during haze events, which could be due to the favored partitioning of GOM toward solid phase under high PM2.5 concentrations and the lack of sunlight to fuel the photochemical production of GOM. Backward trajectories indicated that Hg emissions in east China likely contributed to the enhancements in atmospheric Hg concentrations measured at the suburban site in northern Taiwan during these two trans-boundary haze events.

AB In this paper we extract the aerosol microphysical properties for a collection of mineral dust cases measured by multi-wavelength depolarization Raman lidar systems located at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA, Athens, Greece) and the Andalusian Institute for Earth System Research (IISTA-CEAMA, Granada, Spain). The lidar-based retrievals were carried out with the Spheroidal Inversion eXperiments software tool (SphInX) developed at the University of Potsdam (Germany). The software uses regularized inversion of a two-dimensional enhancement of the Mie model based on the spheroid-particle approximation with the aspect ratio determining the particle shape. The selection of the cases was based on the transport time from the source regions to the measuring sites. The aerosol optical depth as measured by AERONET ranged from 0.27 to 0.54 (at 500 nm) depending on the intensity of each event. Our analysis showed the hourly mean particle linear depolarization ratio and particle lidar ratio values at 532 nm ranging from 11 to 34% and from 42 to 79 sr respectively, depending on the mixing status, the corresponding air mass pathways and their transport time. Cases with shorter transport time showed good agreement in terms of the optical and SphInX-retrieved microphysical properties between Athens and Granada providing a complex refractive index value equal to 1.4 + 0.004i. On the other hand, the results for cases with higher transport time deviated from the aforementioned ones as well as from each other, providing, in particular, an imaginary part of the refractive index ranging from 0.002 to 0.005. Reconstructions of two-dimensional shape-size distributions for each selected layer showed that the dominant effective particle shape was prolate with diverse spherical contributions. The retrieved volume concentrations reflect overall the intensity of the episodes.

AB To investigate the size distribution of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), an impactor sampler was conventionally employed to collect size-resolved aerosols. The impactor sampling technique may be subject to nonuniform deposits of particles on the sampling substrates, thus affecting the optical correction of the pyrolyzed fraction and leading to errors in the partitioning of OC and EC during determination. Based on one-year observations, these optical correction errors were evaluated by comparison between the first four stages of the impactor (PM2.1) and PM2.5 samples collected at the bypass line of tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). The PM2.5 to PM2.1 ratio of OC is close to 1, indicating that the optical correction errors in size-resolved OC can be ignored. In contrast, the PM2.5 to PM2.1 ratio of EC is much higher than 1, suggesting that the size resolved EC data should be corrected (with a factor of 1.6 in this study). In addition, the size distribution of EC (ECoriginal) exhibited an obvious peak in the coarse mode. We argued that carbonate carbon (CC) might account for this coarse peak and hence biased the size distribution of EC. We then employed a calcium equivalent method to estimate CC, allowing the EC data can be corrected. As a result, CC contributed less than 7% of ECoriginal in the fine mode but accounted for 20%-88% of ECoriginal in the coarse mode. Thus, ignoring the CC may overestimate the coarse model EC and hence misinterpret the EC size distribution, with significant implications in characterization of EC and its dry deposition and climate effects.

AB Nitrogen dioxide and nitrous acid (HONO) in the atmosphere were simultaneously measured with a filter pack (FP) method in JHo Chi Minh City, Vietnam (HCM), in 2017 and 2018. To collect NO2 effectively, the absorption performance of NO2 by the FP method with a triethanolamine (TEA)-impregnated filter was improved. After HNO3 and HONO in the sample air were collected by NaCl and Na2CO3 impregnated filters, respectively, at 2.0 or 4.0 dm(3) min(-1), NO2 was collected. The air flow was divided into two lines after the HNO3 and HONO filter pack, and one line was used for collecting NO2. With a 0.1 dm(3) min(-1) flow rate and 20 wt% TEA in the im-pre-gnating solution, the collection efficiency of NO2 was almost 100%. The present method was applied for the measurement of HONO and NO2 in HCM in August 2017 and 2018. The average concentrations (29-48 h average) of NO2 and HONO were 17.1 +/- 5.7 ppb (average 1 standard deviation) and 2.2 +/- 0.6 ppb, respectively. The average HONO/NO2 ratio of 13.4 +/- 3.5% was significantly higher by a considerable margin than reported values in the literature.

AB The sensitivity of ozone production to increasing temperature and a decreasing concentration of precursors, namely nitrogen oxides and non-methane hydrocarbon, has been estimated with probability theory using observation data for 2004-2015 for the Kanto region, Japan. The sensitivity of ozone, in terms of the number of high ozone concentration days, to temperature was higher at the beginning of the observation period when precursor concentrations were high but lower in more recent years when the precursor concentrations were lower. Analysis of the high ozone concentration days showed that a 10-percent reduction of both precursor concentrations yields a reduction in the number of high concentration ozone days of approximately 4 days per year, whereas a 0.2 degrees C temperature increase leads to less than a 1-day increase per year. This indicates that precursor concentration is more important than temperature for determining ozone concentration.

AB SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ are the important components of PM2.5 in China. This study developed a modeling monitoring coupled approach to determining the sources of SO42- and NO3- as well as the secondary oxidation ratio of SO2 to SO42-, through a monitoring of PM2.5 in Beijing and Tangshan, and a WRF-CAMx simulation over North China. Measurement showed that the concentrations of NO3-, SO42- and NH4+ in winter (summer) were 24.2 +/- 25.2 mu g/m(3) (5.1 +/- 2.9 mu g/m(3)), 17.5 +/- 18.5 pg/m(3) (5.8 +/- 3.7 mu g/m(3)) and 14.5 +/- 14.1 mu g/m(3) (4.7 +/- 2.9 mu g/m(3)) in Beijing, while 12.2 +/- 11.0 mu g/m(3) (13.3 +/- 4.5 mu g/m(3)), 15.8 +/- 11.9 mu g/m(3) (14.3 +/- 4.9 mu g/m(3)) and 14.6 +/- 13.0 pg/m(3) (9.6 +/- 3.7 pg/m3) in Tangshan. CAMx-PSAT simulation showed that the concentrations of SO42- in Beijing was affected more by regional transport. In Tangshan, local SO2 was the main source of SO42-. As for NO3-, both cities were affected more by regional transport in both winter and summer. Sulfate/nitrate aged ratio (SAR and NAR) and sulfate oxidation ratio (SOR) calculated by the coupling approach stated above could reflect the regional and local atmospheric oxidation capacity respectively. The NAR in Beijing were 0.13 +/- 0.08 in winter and 0.09 +/- 0.06 in summer, 0.08 +/- 0.05 and 0.15 +/- 0.05 in Tangshan. The SAR were 0.32 +/- 0.17 and 0.51 +/- 0.17 in Beijing, 0.13 +/- 0.11 and 0.19 +/- 0.11 in Tangshan. Then, we further designed several scenarios in CAMx to differentiated the SO42- converted from outside SO2 in the studied city from that in outside areas, and to further evaluated the SOR. It was 0.22 +/- 0.15 and 0.23 +/- 0.11 in winter and summer in Beijing, and 0.11 +/- 0.10 and 0.14 +/- 0.08 in Tangshan. It implies a stronger atmospheric oxidation ability in Beijing compared with Tangshan, and the impact of regional transport of sulfur pollutants on Beijing is much more obvious. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between RH and SOR was 0.94 and 0.93 in winter, 0.05 and 0.17 in summer in two cities. It indicates that SO42- is transformed mainly through liquid phase and heterogeneous reaction in winter and gaseous reaction in summer.

AB Air monitoring is desirable in many places to understand dynamic pollution trends and sources and improve knowledge of population exposure. While highly miniaturized low cost sensor technology is quickly evolving, there is also a need for the advancement of mid-tier systems that are closer to reference-grade technologies in their longevity and performance, but also feature compactness that requires less significant infrastructure. This project evaluated the performance of a prototype solar-powered air monitoring system known as a Village Green Project (VGP) system with wireless data transmission that was deployed on a school rooftop in Hong Kong and operated for over one year. The system provided highly time-resolved and long-term data utilizing mid-tier cost ozone, PM2.5 and meteorological instruments. It operated with very minimal maintenance but shading by a nearby building reduced solar radiation, thus battery run time, over the 16-months measurement period, approximately 330,000 1-min observations were recorded (data completeness of similar to 62%). The monitoring data were evaluated by comparison with a nearby Hong Kong Environment Protection Department (EPD) station and exhibited good performance for 1-h resolution (R-2 = 0.74 for PM2.5 and R-2 = 0.76 for ozone). Furthermore as a demonstration, a nonparametric regression (NPR) model was applied for identifying the location of pollution source, combining air pollution and meteorological measurements. In addition, based on the high time-resolution wind data, local-scale back-trajectories were calculated as an input for receptor-oriented Nonparametric Trajectory Analysis (NTA) model. The combination of the VGP air monitoring system and NTA model identified apparent local sources in urban area. The demonstration was largely successful and operational improvements are clearly suggested to insure better siting and configurations to insure adequate power and air flow.

AB By investigating data during 2004-2015, this study explored the dynamic mechanisms of seasonal control of air quality over southern and northern Taiwan. Overall, higher (lower) pollution frequencies were observed in thy (wet) stages. Analysis of seasonality further suggested that pollution over southern Taiwan exhibited a symmetric characteristic, and that tropical modulation was a driving factor, whereas pollution over northern Taiwan displayed an asymmetric seasonality and likely followed the asymmetric East Asian seasonality. With the retreat of summer monsoon, air quality in southern Taiwan entered a poor phase rapidly; by contrast, good air quality was observed over northern Taiwan, which was due to the gradual southward migration of the western North pacific (WNP) high. Detailed dynamic processes contributing to atmospheric conditions and large-scale circulation were further compared between pollution and nonpollution cases. During dry stages, the midlatitude perturbations observed as wavy patterns had downstream effects on the atmospheric condition in Taiwan. The downstream effect of the midlatitude wave activity on air pollution was obviously found in the Dry Northerly stage in northern Taiwan and the Dry Southerly stage in southern Taiwan. In contrast to poor air quality during dry stages, air pollution was rarely observed during wet stages. The strength and location of the WNP high, which can be involved in the formation of nearby tropical cyclones, may mainly influence air quality in Taiwan.

AB The PM on plant surface being washed into soil during the rain is one of the key processes for plants to reduce atmospheric PM. This study attempted to explore the PM2.5 washoff processes from different tree leaves during rain events (< 16 mm/h) using an artificial rainfall simulation experiment. We aimed to improve our knowledge of processes associated with PM2.5 reduction and to provide a basis for accurately evaluating the ability of plants to reduce PM2.5. This is the first study showing that the PM2.5 washoff processes from leaves follow quartic functions and 4 pattern curves under different conditions were categorized. They respectively explained the PM2.5 washoff processes in broad-leaved trees with large leaves and simple crowns (bimodal curved), in conifer species with small leaves and complex crowns under high rainfall intensity (unimodal curved), in trees with extremely complex crowns under high rainfall intensity (continually-rising curved), and in conditions under which extremely high water interception efficiency but rather low water storage capacity occur (U-shaped curved). These curves indicate that the amount of PM2.5 on leaves was not necessarily reduced in rainfall events. The general ranking of the average values of PM2.5 number on leaves surface during rain events was Cedrus Deodara (40.3 x 10(3)/cm(3)), Japanese Maple (33.0 x 103/cm(2)) > Dragon Juniper (14.7 x 10(3)/cm(2)), Dawn Redwood (12.6 x 10(3)/cm(2)) > Common Boxwood (6.4 x 10(3)/cm(3)), Lotus Magnolia (4.1 x 10(3)/cm(2)). The cycles of PM2.5 accumulation and removal on broad-leaved trees might be shorter than that of conifers, meaning that they may have a better PM2.5 washoff efficiency during rain, which is opposite to the PM2.5 deposition efficiency. Higher rainfall intensity can reduce the cycle length and enhance the PM2.5 washoff efficiency.

AB The variations and trends of the AOD (aerosol optical depth, at 550 nm) from 2000 to 2017 in mainland China were analyzed in this paper with monthly, seasonal, and yearly mean data, derived from the NASA combined MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue AOD retrievals. Particularly, the distribution and variation of AOD over the desert region of the southern Xinjiang basin which is one of the major Asian dust sources was described. To investigate the seasonal and yearly variation trends of the AOD over China, the linear trend was analyzed for each point during the 18 years. The correlations between AOD and terrain, Gross Domestic Product and Population Density were also analyzed. The results were as follows. (1) In China, the all-year high value (tau(MODIS) > 0.50) of the AOD occurred in the Sichuan basin, the Two Lakes Plain, North China, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Guangzhong Plain, and the Jingjinji Metropolitan Region. In particular, the southern Xinjiang basin is not the high value center. While the all-year low value (tau(MODIS) < 0.20) of the AOD occurred in Northwest Sichuan, Southeast Xizang, the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (Tibetan Plateau), Northern Xinjiang, Shanxi, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. (2) The AOD over China varied with years from 2000 to 2017, which increased in the previous decade but gradually decreased from 2011. (3) The AOD changed more significantly with the seasons, with higher AOD in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (4) The AOD was negatively associated with Digital Elevation Model, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.733, which was positively associated with Gross Domestic Product and Population Density, with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.698 and 0.688.

AB Trace metal distributions are of relevance to understand sources of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), PM2.5-related health effects, and atmospheric chemistry. However, knowledge of trace metal distributions is lacking due to limited ground-based measurements and model simulations. This study develops a simulation of 12 trace metal concentrations (Si, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, K, Mg, As, Cd, Ni and Pb) over continental North America for 2013 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Evaluation of modeled trace metal concentrations with observations indicates a spatial consistency within a factor of 2. The spatial distribution of trace metal concentrations reflects their primary emission sources. Crustal element (Si, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, K) concentrations are enhanced over the central US from anthropogenic fugitive dust and over the southwestern U.S. due to natural mineral dust. Heavy metal (As, Cd, Ni and Pb) concentrations are high over the eastern U.S. from industry. K is abundant in the southeast from biomass burning. High concentrations of Mg are observed along the coast from sea spray. The spatial pattern of PM2.5 mass is most strongly correlated with Pb, Ni, As and K due to their signature emission sources. Challenges remain in accurately simulating observed trace metal concentrations. Halving anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions in the 2011 National Air Toxic Assessment (NATA) inventory and doubling natural dust emissions in the default GEOS-Chem simulation was necessary to reduce biases in crustal element concentrations. A fivefold increase of anthropogenic emissions of As and Pb was necessary in the NATA inventory to reduce the national-scale bias versus observations by more than 80%, potentially reflecting missing sources.

AB Rare earth elements (REEs) are typical materials in optoelectronic industries; however, the effects of optoelectronic industry on the presence of REEs in atmospheric particle (AP) have seldom been reported. Thus, we investigated the provenance of REEs in APs collected from a coastal city in Southeast China, where there are many optoelectronic enterprises. The results showed that the concentrations of Eu, Tb, and Y were highly elevated in the APs from S23-S25 sites near an optoelectronic company which uses REEs for LED production. Furthermore, significant positive Eu and Tb anomalies were observed in the samples collected from S23-S25 sites. Ternary La-V-Eu, La-V-Tb and La-V-Y plots were used to discriminate the S23-S25 site samples from those from other sites. The Nd-143/Nd-144 versus LREE/HREE plot suggested that the REEs in the APs were mainly affected by vehicle emission and coal combustion.

AB Background: Few studies have investigated respiratory effects of particulate matter air pollution using a full range of particle size distribution.
   Objectives: To explore the short-term associations between size-fractionated particle number concentration (PNC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality.
   Methods: We conducted a time-series study to explore the associations between size-fractionated PNC and daily COPD mortality in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China, from 2014 to 2016. We evaluated particle size distribution from 0.01 mu m to 10 mu m, which was segregated into 7 ranges to better explore the size-dependent associations. We used over-dispersed generalized additive models to estimate the associations after controlling for time trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week and holidays.
   Results: A total of 5430 deaths due to COPD were identified during the study period. For size ranges from 2.5-10 mu m, 1-2.5 mu m to 0.3-1 mu m, there were stronger associations between PNC and COPD mortality, but the associations were statistically insignificant. However, for the smaller size ranges from 0.3 to 0.01 mu m, the associations became statistically significant and the magnitude of association remained stable. An interquartile range increase in PNC at lag 0-1 day for size ranges 0.01-0.03 mu m, 0.03-0.05 mu m, 0.05-0.1 mu m and 0.1-0.3 mu m was associated with increments of 4.44% (95% CI: 1.16%, 7.73%), 4.31% (95% CI: 1.16%, 7.47%), 4.22% (95% CI: 1.05%, 7.40%), and 4.28% (95% CI: 0.48%, 8.09%) in COPD mortality, respectively.
   Conclusion: This study suggested that particles below 0.3 mu m in diameter might be mainly responsible for the adverse effect of particulate air pollution on CDPD mortality in Shanghai, China.

AB In August 2016, ambient formaldehyde (HCHO) and related parameters were measured simultaneously at a suburban site (Wujiashan, WJS), an urban site (Ziyang, ZY) and a roadside site (Hankou, HK) in Wuhan, Central China. The mixing ratios of HCHO at WJS (2.1 +/- 0.2 ppbv) were comparable (p > 0.05) to those at ZY (2.2 +/- 0.4 ppbv) and lower (p < 0.01) than those at HK (3.4 +/- 0.5 ppbv). Secondary formation made the greatest contributions to ambient HCHO at WJS (61.9 +/- 5.9%) and ZY (69.3 +/- 7.3%), while vehicle exhaust (i.e., diesel and CNG exhaust, gasoline exhaust) (47.2 10.4%) was the dominant HCHO source at HK. Vehicle exhaust was also the dominant primary source of HCHO at WJS and ZY, accounting for 16.0 +/- 4.0%, and 21.9 +/- 8.0%, respectively. Biogenic emissions made a non-negligible contribution at suburban site WJS (9.8 +/- 3.2%). The precursors of the secondary HCHO were investigated using a photochemical box model. Alkenes and aromatics were found to be the most important contributors to secondary HCHO. The impact of observed HCHO on the production of hydroperoxy radical (HO2) and ozone (O-3) were also assessed. The photochemical reactions of HCHO (i.e., the photolysis and OH-initiated oxidation of HCHO) accounted for 10.5 +/- 0.6%, 10.6 +/- 0.8% and 14.8 +/- 0.9% to the formation of HO2 at WJS, ZY and HK, respectively, and reducing HCHO led to a considerable decrease in O-3 formation. This study demonstrates the important roles of vehicle exhaust and secondary formation in the sources of HCHO, which have significant photochemical relevance. Attention should be paid to HCHO to control the photochemical pollution in Wuhan effectively.

AB This study examined seasonal bias of ammonia (NH3) emission inventory over North China Plain (NCP) using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (NH3-standard simulation, SG1), and found that the MIX NH3 inventory overestimates winter NH3 by 31% and underestimates summer NH3 by 50%. NH3 emission from NCP is thus cut by 24% in winter and doubled in summer (NH3-corrected simulation, SG2) to match up with the observations. The corrected NH3 emission changes the surface PM2.5 and nitrate concentrations and is expected to impact the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission control efficiency (relative changes of PM2.5 and nitrate concentration in response to 1% NOx emission change, beta(PM) and beta(NO3)). We then conducted sensitivity studies (SG3) by reducing 20% (S31) and 40% (S32) NOx emission based on NH3-standard and NH3-corrected simulation, respectively. Through comparing the NO emission control efficiency under the two NH3 emission conditions (NH3-standard and NH3-corrected), we find that NH3 emission bias under the NH3-standard condition causes similar to 30% overprediction of winter beta(PM) and similar to 35% underprediction of summer PPM. In addition, for the NH3-corrected simulation, beta(PM) increases by 43% in winter and 7.7% in summer from S31 to S32. Taken together, these findings highlighted the importance of stringent NOx emission control throughout the year and NH3 emission control in summer as well. Moreover, it is critical to obtain a more accurate seasonal pattern of NH3 emission inventory in assessing emission control efficiency of PM2.5 precursors.

AB Carbonyls are an important class of oxygenated volatile organic compounds that play a crucial role in tropospheric chemistry as intermediates in the formation of ozone (O-3) and secondary organic aerosols. Over the last two decades, China's severe air pollution has led atmospheric chemists to devote substantial efforts to investigate the contribution of carbonyl compounds to the observed phenomena. This study reviews the major findings with regard to the gas-phase atmospheric chemistry of carbonyls in China, including their chemical compositions, temporal and spatial distributions, source apportionments, photochemical formation mechanisms, and impact on tropospheric oxidative capacity, air quality, and human health. Extremely high levels of carbonyls have frequently been observed in China's most rapidly developing regions, such as the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, but observational data from other regions are relatively scarce. Primary emissions and photochemical formation are major sources of carbonyls. Alkenes, aromatics, and isoprene have been identified as major precursors on a national scale. In addition, an increasing number of studies has focused on the effects of carbonyls on O-3 formation, radical chemistry, the formation of secondary organic aerosols, and human health. The photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds was recognized as a dominant pathway to ROx production, which further influences O-3 formation, mainly via HO2 + NO or RO2 + NO. Dicarbonyls (such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal) make important contributions to secondary organic aerosol formation via irreversible uptake by aqueous particles. Indoor and outdoor carbonyls often pose a significant threat to human health. This review also includes recommendations from the perspective of emissions, observations, photochemical formation mechanisms, and the effects of carbonyls to guide future research and provide scientific support for the formulation of mitigation policies to address photochemical air pollution.

AB The contributions of soluble and insoluble fractions of soot particles, as well as their ozonised products, to oxidative potential (OP), warrant investigation. In our study, soot particles generated under two air/fuel ratio (A/F) conditions were aged by ozone (O-3) at an atmospherically relevant level in a chamber. The OP values of total soot particles and the methanol- and water-soluble fractions were measured by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay (OPDTT). Results showed that both A/F and O-3 aging influenced the OPDTT of different fractions. Lower A/F favoured increases in OPDTT for both total soot and its soluble fractions. The highest OPDTT increments after O-3 aging were found in the methanol -soluble fraction of high-A/F soot and the insoluble fraction of low-A/F soot. Phenanthrene (PHE), one of the dominant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soot particles, was selected as a model PAH to investigate O-3-PAH aging using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), with phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and 1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxaldehyde (BD) identified as two major ozonised products. Furthermore, the quantitative contributions of PQ and BD to the OPDTT increases in ozonised soot were extrapolated. In particular, for ozonised low-A/F soot, PQ alone contributed 12.5% to the OPDTT increase. This work highlights the vital contributions of PQ and other key ozonised products of PAHs adsorbed on soot surfaces to the enhanced OPDTT values and potential toxicity of aged soot, which enhances current understanding regarding the health effects of aged soot in the atmosphere.

AB Most of the previous investigations on the relationship between PM(2.5 )chemical characteristics and wildfire focused on the predictions of particle components concentrations or future pollution scenarios. Little research has focused on trends analyses based on large temporal datasets. Our research addresses this gap by quantifying the long-term impacts of wildfires on ambient particulate carbon levels (organic carbon - OC and elemental carbon - EC) in the western U.S. over a long of 29 years (1988-2016). We quantified the past wildfire-related increases in EC and OC concentration using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We used a framework that derives "penalties" (wildfire penalty, in mu g/m(3) per year) for each season (warm and cold) by accounting for the differences of the beta values between two models - adjusted (wildfire included as covariate in the model) and unadjusted model (wildfire is removed from the model). While the wildfire impact is incorporated into the unadjusted trends, the control by wildfire in the adjusted model removes the impact of inter-annual wildfire variation on EC and OC trends. Therefore, we considered that any differences between the unadjusted and wildfire-adjusted trends are entirely attributable to the impact of long-term wildfire changes. A positive penalty (beta(unadjusted) > beta(adjusted)) suggests that an increase in EC and OC is associated with long-term wildfire changes between 1988 and 2016. Wildfires increased in the warm season and decreased in the cold season. We estimated an annual increase of 20.106 km(2) of area burned (95% CI: 20.103; 20.109) in the warm period. EC and OC concentrations increased during the warm and cold season. EC and OC concentrations had an annual decrease of 0.03 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: - 0.14; 0.08) and 0.10 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: - 0.21; 0.01), respectively. In the cold period, our analyses showed an increase of 0.05 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: - 0.07; 0.17) and 0.07 mu g/m(3) (95% CI: - 0.04; 0.19) per year for EC and OC, respectively. In the warm season, during the study period (1988-2016), the estimated total concentration change (total penalty) for EC was 0.003 mu g/m(3) (95%CI: 0.001 and 0.005) and for OC was 0.015 mu g/m(3) (95%CI: 0.008 and 0.022). In the cold season the penalties were statistically insignificant.

AB This study presents a high-resolution (5 km) set of new simulations performed with CAMx v6.40 over the Po Valley area (Northern Italy), aimed to enhance organic aerosol (OA) levels prediction and to gain insight into the sensitivity of CAMx to different uncertain features of the input setup. In particular, we mainly investigated the role of (i) volatility distributions of organic emissions, (ii) parametrizations of semi- and intermediate-volatile organic compounds (S/IVOC) emissions and (iii) different aging schemes, by exploiting the latest experimental information available in the recent scientific literature. Model results were validated against two OA-specific datasets, available for both an urban site (Bologna, February 2013) and a rural one (Ispra, March 2013).
   We found out a remarkable performance enhancement of modelled OA levels when applying revisions in S/IVOC emission parametrizations together with the new volatility distributions, at both the validation sites. This performance enhancement is associated with a very significant improvement in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) prediction, mainly due to revised IVOC emissions. At Bologna urban site, mean fractional bias (MFB) of OA ranged from - 80.1% in the worst run to - 10.1% in the best one and index of agreement (IOA) from 0.52 to 0.75. Notable improvements but overall poorer metrics were found for Ispra site, where MFB ranges from - 84.2% to - 35% and IOA from 0.45 to 0.50. These findings indicate that organic matter in the semi- and intermediate-volatile range are most likely underestimated in official emission inventories for each main source category (i.e. biomass burning, diesel and gasoline vehicles exhaust).
   Finally, model results did not show a very pronounced sensitivity to aging processes, due to the low photochemical activity typically observed during winter-time. However, we give evidence that enabling aging processes for biomass burning related SOA, which is by default disabled in CAMx v6.40, can help in closing the gap between modelled and observed SOA concentrations.

AB The trends per 5th percentile interval of European surface ozone concentrations over urban, suburban and rural sites in the period 1995-2012 have been estimated based on observational data from the European Environment Agency air quality database. Consistent with previous study results, we find a rapid decline of relatively high ozone concentrations after the year 1995, especially of rural summertime ozone. However, the decreasing rate has slowed, and even reversed, of low-level ozone, especially in the urban environment for all seasons. Although the ozone air pollution problem has been declared to be effectively resolved by achieving European air quality goals, our results indicate that ozone remains to be difficult to control for a long time into the future. Global and regional models poorly reproduce the measured differences in ozone and trends in different levels and regions. Thus policy guidelines from the model should be considered with care.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (O-3) are important air pollutants that are associated with adverse health effects. Land-use regression (LUR) models have been widely developed to estimate air pollution concentrations. Due to data availability, however, such models are usually not applied in developing countries. We aimed to characterize NOx and O-3 concentrations and develop LUR models to predict their spatial and temporal distributions using publicly-available data in Tianjin, a heavily polluted city in China. Seasonal samples were collected across Tianjin at 29 locations for O-3 and 49 locations for NOx. Heavy-duty vehicle counts estimated from 0.5 m x 0.5 m satellite images correlated well with field-measured counts, thus supporting the use of highresolution satellite images to assess vehicle traffic. Concentrations of NOx were highest in winter, while the opposite pattern was observed for O-3. The majority of the variance in NOx was explained by season (36,2%) and heavy vehicle traffic (19.8%). For O-3, the variance was explained by season (80.7%) in a pooled model, and by distance to roads (43.4%) and distance to coal plants (26.2%) in a summer model. Cross-validation showed reasonable practicability for NOx (R-2 = 0.53 with field-measured heavy-duty vehicle count; R-2 = 0.46 with satellite-based heavy-duty vehicle count) and O-3 (R-2 = 0.90 for pooled model; R-2 = 0.70 for summer model) models. This study provides utility for researchers investigating air pollution in regions where field-measured vehicle traffic data are not available, as well as for policy makers and public health officials seeking to understand the sources and spatial distribution of air pollution in Tianjin.

AB We propose the use of thermal-desorption dichloromethane-induced low-pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (TD-CH2Cl2-induced LPPI-MS) via a laboratory-built krypton vacuum ultraviolet lamp for the real-time analysis of alpha-pinene secondary organic aerosol (alpha P-SOA). Using this technology, the peak intensities of the majority of SOA were enhanced by at least two orders of magnitude after doping with 720 ppm dichloromethane. Clear temporal evolutions of the SOA oxidation products with particle formation were also observed. The molecular ion peaks at m/z value of 153 and 109 showed a similar sharp increase with particle-number concentration. These two species (i.e. protonated alpha-campholenic aldehyde or dehydrated protonated pinalic-3-acid) with the fragment at m/z 153 and 109 may be critical species to prompt new particle formation. Furthermore, the monomers with the fragment ion peaks at m/z value of 69 and 87 (i.e. protonated pinonic acid, pinic acid, oxopinonic acid, and OH-pinonic acid etc.) were found to be intermediate species with high reactivities during SOA growth. The obtained results provide supplementary knowledge regarding the characterization and temporal evolution of the key components that promote alpha P-SOA formation.

AB Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), formed through photochemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx, is the second-most important photochemical pollutant. Although several studies have investigated ground-level PAN in northern China, the vertical characteristics of PAN in this region have yet to be examined. In this study, measured concentrations of PAN and ozone (O-3) near the surface and at 220 m were obtained from a 250-m observation tower in Tianjin during September 2018. Results show that the mean PAN concentrations at 220 m are 5.3-19.1% higher than ground-level values during the night (20:00-7:00), which can be attributed to difference in vertical mixing and chemical processes. When the inversion layer is below 220 m, the two layers (220 m and ground level) are separated into the residual layer and inversion layer, between which turbulent exchange is weak. Thus, a vertical gradient for PAN exists during the night. After sunrise, the inversion layer breaks up, and PAN concentrations become more homogeneous due to strong daytime vertical mixing. Role of chemical processes is examined using WRF-Chem model, and it is found that the PAN family-PAN and CH3C(O)O-2 radicals-decompose quickly near the surface in the evening due to strong NO emission sources, while those at 220 m decompose more slowly and could also be produced by the nighttime oxidation between VOCs and O-3. Modeling results further show that nighttime high PAN concentrations in the residual layer can occur throughout all of northern China.

AB Biomass burning has become one of the prominent sources of air pollution in Northeast China, where the land is largely covered by forest, grasslands, and agricultural crops. Nevertheless, the impact of biomass burning on air quality and the sensitivity of such impact to weather are rarely documented. In this study, we addressed these issues using satellite fire radiative power (FRP) and surface PM2.5 and CO data at 24 stations during fire seasons (March, April, October and November) in Northeast China from 2015 to 2017. Fire-polluted days were identified by tracing air parcels at the stations back to fire regions using a trajectory model, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The results show that 60-80% the polluted days in Northeast China can be attributed to biomass burning in the fire seasons, varying among subregions due to the differences in landscapes, fire activities, and weather conditions. On fire-polluted days, the mean PM2.5 and CO concentrations from all observation stations in Northeast China reached 111 mu g m(-3) and 1.3 mg m(-3), respectively. The hourly PM2.5 and CO concentrations on fire-polluted days could reach as high as 1000 mu g m(-3) and 10 mg m(-3), respectively. By subregions, the mean PM(2.5 )concentrations were 128, 112, 102, 106 mu g m(-3), respectively, in the central, eastern, northern, and southern subregions, while mean CO concentrations were 1.2, 1.3, 0.8, 1.5 mg m(-3), respectively, in the four corresponding subregions. On average, PM2.5  and CO concentrations on fire-polluted days elevated, respectively, by 22-54% and 4-11% from those on no-fire-polluted days, with the largest enhancement in the central subregion and the least in the southern subregion. We classified six predominant weather patterns during the fire seasons. When Northeast China was ahead of a strong Siberian High, fire-polluted days were least and FRP was weakest among the six patterns in most subregions, leading to lowest enhancement of PM2.5  and CO in the subregions. In contrast, two weather patterns exacerbated PM2.5  and CO pollution the most during fire episodes. Under one of the weather patterns, Northeast China was under a stagnant high-pressure system, resulting in poor dispersion conditions and thus high PM2.5  and CO pollution. The other pattern was characterized with high humidity and southwesterlies ahead of a trough, which brought about strong hygroscopic growth and regional transport of fire emissions. The degree to which the weather patterns impacted air pollution during fires varied largely among subregions. This study highlights the combined impacts of biomass burning and weather on air pollution, The findings and the developed methodology are helpful for forecasting air quality and implementing mitigation strategies during biomass burning.

AB We designed and evaluated the performance of a tandem technique, consisting of a previously developed versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) combined with a compact screen-type diffusion battery that removes ambient ultrafine particles (UFP) from the airflow to enable us to conduct exposures directly on concentrated ambient accumulation mode (0.18-2.5 mu m) particles. The performance of the diffusion battery was evaluated first under controlled conditions using NaCl laboratory-generated aerosols. Based on the laboratory tests, the optimum operational conditions of the diffusion battery were selected in terms of the flow rate (i.e., 5 1pm) and number of stages (i.e., 6). The diffusion battery was then deployed to our sampling site in central Los Angeles and connected to the VACES in order to evaluate the performance of the VACES/diffusion battery tandem using concentrated ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). Results of the field tests confirmed the ability of this tandem technique to concentrate effectively the accumulation mode PM with the majority of the ultrafine particles removed from the concentrated aerosol. The 50% cutpoint of the diffusion battery was at around 100 rim, while the removal efficiency exceeded 70-90% for particles smaller than 50 nm. Comparison of the mass concentrations and chemical composition of the accumulation mode PM collected using the tandem technique with those collected using a MOUDI sampler operating in parallel showed excellent overall agreement (within 5-15% variation), corroborating the effectiveness of the VACES/diffusion battery tandem technique for application in exposure studies to concentrated ambient accumulation mode PM.

AB Atmospheric aerosol levels are high in different regions of China. Changes in atmospheric stability and mixing layer height (MLH) may affect the vertical aerosol distribution during pollution events. Here, we continuous studied the spatiotemporal distribution of MLH in China over 2000-2013 to characterize the regional-scale properties of atmospheric boundary layers. MLH was larger in the Southern Coastal and Southeastern China (1241.5 +/- 73.5 and 632.7 +/- 61.8m, respectively), but lower in Eastern and Southwestern China (518.1 +/- 63.6 and 462.7 +/- 88.5 m, respectively). We divided the monitoring stations into 11 regions; these regions could be classified into three types with an increasing linear trend (95% confidence level), with a decreasing linear trend (95% confidence level), and with fluctuation changes. In all regions, MLH was higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The spatial distribution of the diurnal MLH increased significantly at 1400 BJT (Beijing time) in all regions, with the strongest radiation being noted during the daytime. Higher levels of PM2.5 with corresponding lower MLH were noted during winter, indicating that lower MLH could confine the pollutant diffusion to near the surface. By contrast, in spring, higher MLH could be potentially due to the dynamic condition. In general, the poor air quality days occurred more frequently in winter than in other seasons. As the air quality worsened, most MLH showed a decreasing trend in almost all regions. This work provides information that aids in further understanding not only MLH distribution in China but also specific PM-MLH interaction to facilitate regional atmospheric environment monitoring and prediction.

AB Oral bioavailability of essential and toxic elements has been assessed in particulate matter samples (PM10) at several sites (industrial, urban and sub-urban sites) by using an in-vitro model that combines simulated gastric/intestinal fluids and physiologically based extraction conditions which simulate human digestive system. Metals concentrations in bioavailable fractions will allow to a real human health-risk assessment associated to toxic metals. High oral bioavailability percentages were found for metals such as Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Sb (oral bioavailability ratios in the range of 39.7-45.7%). Al and V are less bioavailables (oral bioavailability ratios in the range of 1.8-9.2%). The influence of chemical composition (major ions, carboxylic acids and black carbon (BC)) on bioavailability ratios was assessed. Fe, Ni, V and Zn bioavailability ratios was found to be affected by the K+, NH4+, acetate and BC contents of PM10; while a correlation was found between marine content (Cl- and Na+) of PM10 and Cu, Fe and Mn dialyzability ratios. Zn and Sr bioavailability ratios were correlated with crustal contribution of PM10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results also showed that Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sr and V bioavailability are dependent on BC and NH4+ contents and Cu and Zn bioavailability are dependent on sea salt content of PM10. Predicted bioavailability for some metals after applying a quadratic surface model based on crustal, marine and anthropogenic content of PM10 could also be established. Toxicity prediction of target metals, by using hazard quotient/index values, suggested potential non-carcinogenic risk for Pb and Sb.

AB This study investigates the influence of PM10 from remote sources on PM10 episodes over the city of Cape Town. For the study, we analysed observation data from Cape Town's air quality monitoring stations as well as high-resolution simulation data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The observation data were used to identify PM10 episodes during the study period (2008-2014) and WRF-Chem was applied to simulate the atmospheric conditions and PM10 transport over southern Africa during each episode. The capability of WRF-Chem to simulate the wind and PM10 concentration over Cape Town was quantified and the paths of air parcels over Cape Town during each episode were tracked. Results of the study show that WRF-Chem gives a realistic simulation of observed wind (speed and direction) over the city during the episodes, but the model struggles to reproduce the observed PM10 concentration. For most episodes, the magnitude of the simulated PM10 is lower than the observed due to lack of local emissions in the simulations. In some cases, the model reproduces the peak in PM10 concentration some days earlier or later than observed. The simulations show that most air parcels over Cape Town during the episodes have travelled over major dust source regions (i.e., the Kalahari or Namib Desert) before reaching the city. Most of episodes are associated with a southward transport of a plume of PM10 from the north-west coast of southern Africa to Cape Town. This PM10 plume is induced by a coastal trough and a continental high pressure system. In some cases, local topography influences the intrusion of the PM(10 )plume into Cape Town by blocking some of the pollution, thereby minimising the amount of PM10 that reaches the city. Results of the study suggest that the transport of PM10 from the north-west coast of southern Africa may contribute to PM10 episodes in Cape Town.

AB The concentrations of organic aerosol (OA) in central and eastern China are much higher than those in Europe and North America. Compared with observations, recent numerical modeling studies have largely underestimated the concentrations of OA, especially the secondary components. Based on the volatility basis set framework, a secondary OA (SOA) module is developed and coupled into the nested air quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS). This model is applied to investigate the concentration and formation pathways of SOA in central and eastern China during 2014, and the simulation performance is validated through observation. The oxidation of intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOCs) is significant to SOA formation and could reduce the great discrepancy between simulations and observations. In winter, the contribution of IVOCs accounted for 60%-80% of SOA formation. In spring and autumn, IVOCs and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a considerable effect on SOA formation. In summer, the contributions of VOCs reach 40%-60% due to an increase in the emissions of biogenic VOCs. The mass yields and other parameters of IVOCs remain largely uncertain. By using the latest mass yields obtained from chamber experiments, the simulated SOA concentrations in winter increase by 10-20 mu g m(-3) compared with the base scenario. To more thoroughly understand SOA formation in China, further research on the emission sources and mass yields of IVOCs is warranted.

AB The components and the periodicity characterising airborne Be-7 monthly concentration collected in Granada (SE Spain) between 2000 and 2018 are studied. These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the Be-7 analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008-2018.
   A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component.
   SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of Be-7. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component.
   In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component.
   The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle.
   Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising T Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between Be-7 data and teleconnection indices. The Be-7 concentrations in the large period (11-14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.

AB The MODIS Multiple Angle Implication of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm enables simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and bidirectional surface reflectance at high resolution of 1 km. Taking advantage of multi-angle and image-based information, the MAIAC algorithm has great potential for improving retrieval of aerosols over both dark and bright surfaces. Here, by comparing MAIAC aerosol products with the ground-based observations at 9 typical sites spread out in China, we gain the insights regarding the performance of MAIAC algorithm, for the first time, over Asia that has complicated surface types, diverse aerosol sources, and heavy loading of aerosols in the atmosphere. While aerosol products from MAIAC show similar spatial distribution as that from MODIS Dark-Target (DT) and Deep-Blue (DB) algorithms, they are superior to reveal numerous hotspots of high AOD values in fine scales due to their higher resolution at 1 km. Moreover, since MAIAC algorithm for cloud screening uses time series of observations, it shows higher effectiveness to mask cloudy pixels as well as the pixels of the melting and aging ice/snow surfaces. While MAIAC and ground-observed AOD values show high correlation coefficient of similar to 0.94 in two AERONET sites of Beijing and Xianghe, considerable bias is prevalent in other regions of China. Systematic underestimation is found over the deserts in western China likely due to the high bias of single scattering properties of aerosol model prescribed in MAIAC algorithm. In eastern China, the distinct positive bias is found in conditions with low-moderate AOD values and likely results from errors in regression coefficients in the surface reflectance model. Given its advantages in cloud and snow/ice screening and retrieval in fine spatial resolution, MAIAC algorithm can be improved by further refinement of regional aerosol and surface properties.

AB Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most hazardous substances in the environment. Although their occurrence and fate in the atmosphere of Eastern Mediterranean is well documented, there is limited information on PAH levels in the inhalable aerosol fraction. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there is lack of information on particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal or less than 2.5 and 10 mu m (PM2.5 and PM10)-bound PAH concentrations and sources in Cyprus. We therefore present the first study that i) determines the concentration levels of PAHs in the respirable and inhalable (PM2.5 and PM10) fraction of particulate matter; ii) identifies, quantifies, and compares PAH emission sources by applying two receptor models (Principal Components Analysis/Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, PCA/MLR; and UNMIX factorization), and iii) assesses their relative toxicity at two different coastal sites in Eastern Mediterranean (Island of Crete, Greece; and Cyprus). For this purpose, a total of 79 samples were collected in Heraklion (Island of Crete) and Limassol (Cyprus) during a 2-year sampling campaign between 2012 and 2014. Thirty five PAH members were identified and the total concentration (Sigma(35)PAHs) levels in PM2.5 ranged between 0.15 and 9.19 ng/m(3) in Heraklion; 0.12 and 3.91 ng/m(3) (PM2.5), and 0.16 and 4.02 ng/m(3) (PM10) in Limassol. PAH concentrations were the highest when air masses were passing over highly polluted areas, such as the eastern Balkan Peninsula/Adriatic Sea and northern Greece. The most abundant members at both sites were Benzo[b]fluoranthene (7-16%), Benzo[e] pyrene (8-11%), Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (10-18%) and Benzo[ghi]perylene (9-21%); as well as Anthranene (5-6%) and Coronene (9-11%) in Limassol. The major PAH emission sources obtained from the application of PCA/MLRA were gasoline and diesel/coal combustion sources, accounting for almost 60% and 40% of total contribution in Heraklion, while in Limassol both sources contributed nearly equally (51% and 49%, respectively). Similar findings were obtained using the UNMIX model. The lifetime incremental cancer risk (ILCR) due to both inhalation and ingestion exposure from particulate PAHs was well below the U.S. EPA regulatory threshold in both study areas.

AB The nocturnal, seasonal and intra-annual variation of vertical distribution of tropospheric aerosols over two nearby stations Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E) and Tirupati (13.6 degrees N, 79.4 degrees E) is investigated using ground-based Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) and space-borne Lidar (CALIPSO) systems during 2010-2017. The nocturnal variation of aerosol extinction (AE) coefficient reveal high AE below similar to 2 km in midnight hours and aerosols are slowly descending towards the surface during early morning hours. From the seasonal variation, AE values are found to be higher at lower altitudes (<2 km) during winter and post-monsoon seasons, a sharp decrease with increasing altitude is found in tandem with boundary layer and low wind speeds. Interestingly, during monsoon season, significant aerosol loading is found in the altitude range of similar to 2-5.5 km mainly due to the influence of strong Low Level Jet (LLJ). The clean environment observed below similar to 2 km during this season is attributed to the wet scavenging, downward vertical winds and existance of no strong local source. The seasonal mean AE profile derived from CALIPSO matches well with the MPL in all the seasons except in monsoon season where a large bias is noticed below 2 km. The intra-annual variation revealed more than 80% of aerosols existing above (below) the boundary layer during monsoon (winter) months contribute to the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). The depolarization ratio (>0.2) in the month of July shows the dominance of dust particles which includes long-range transport over this locations. Back trajectories reveals that potential sources are changing from season to season at different altitudes and confirms that the aerosols observed at higher altitudes are advected from other land and oceanic regions. Thus, aerosol vertical distribution is mainly controlled by meteorology and dynamics over this region. Further, the reasonably good correlation found between MPL and MODIS AODs suggests that MODIS could provide reliable AOD over land region also.

AB The Generic Reaction Set (GRS) is a simplified photochemical scheme that allows estimation of ozone (O-3) concentrations resulting from nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive organic compounds (ROC) emissions in an urban area. Due to its simplicity and relative good performance, it has been included in the algorithms of many atmospheric dispersion models. However, few works assess quantitatively the sensitivity of simulated O-3 concentrations to the uncertainty in the GRS input variables. In order to do so, in this work we carry out two sensitivity analyses: global (applying an atmospheric dispersion model to a representative real case) and local (using a box-GRS model under a wide range of hypothetical conditions). In the global study, a Monte Carlo analysis is performed to estimate the uncertainty of maximum O-3 concentrations that is caused by possible errors in the GRS input variables, applying the DAUMOD-GRS model in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. Results show that the initial concentration of O-3 dominates at all analysed receptors while that of NOx can make a nonnegligible contribution if its error is relatively large. In order to further analyse the effect of each parameter individually, a local sensitivity analysis is performed using a box-GRS model under a wide range of conditions. Except for the small NOx-limited region, sensitivity indexes computed for +/- 1 ppb changes in the initial concentrations of ROC, NOx and O-3 are in the ranges 0.00-0.35, 0.00-0.81 and 0.05-0.96, respectively, with that of ozone dominating over most of the isopleth diagram space. In turn, its relative impact increases with decreasing ROC initial concentrations. Reaction rate coefficients have also different effects on O-3 peak concentrations depending on the initial conditions of the system. Our results show quantitatively the change of dominant variables under different environments.

AB Crop residue burning is an important source of air pollutants and strongly affects the regional air quality and global climate change. This study presents a detailed emission inventory of major air pollutants from crop residue burning for the year of 2014 in China by the bottom-up method. Activity data were investigated for 296 prefecture-level cities. Emission factors were determined for indoor and in-field burning separately. Regional differences were considered for the proportion of residue burned (PCRB), the ratio between indoor and in-field burning, and the ratio of straw to grain production. The emissions were estimated at prefecture-city level as the first step; then they were redistributed within a city based on 1-km resolution land-use, MODIS fire counts, and rural population. Temporal variation was determined according to farming practices in different regions and MODIS fire counts. Uncertainties were estimated using the Monte Carlo method. The total emissions from crop residue burning in China were estimated to be 0.13 ( - 47-92%) for BC, 0.71 ( - 48-92%) for OC, 1.77 ( - 48-91%) for PM2.5, 2.04 (- 50-100%) for PM10, 0.16 (- 59-133%) for SO2, 0.53 ( - 55-105%) for NOx, 0.12 ( - 47-93%) for NH3, 1.07 ( - 55-102%) for CH4, 1.85 ( - 43-74%) for NMVOC, 18.33 ( - 46-85%) for CO and 305.20 ( - 45-80%) for CO2, in unit of Tg yr(-1). Our results are remarkably lower than those reported in previous studies, mainly because of the PCRB has decreased significantly in recent years. For most of the pollutants, indoor burning accounted for about 50-70% of the emissions. Rice, wheat and corn contributed more than 85% of the emissions, but their relative contributions varied a lot with region and season. High emissions were mostly located in the eastern China, central China and northeastern China, and temporally peaked in April, June and October, with different intensities in the north and the south. This study provides a useful basis for air quality modeling and the policy making of pollution control strategies.

AB Severe PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 um) pollution in China, with adverse impact on human health and global climate change, has raised great concern in recent years. The volatile organic compound (VOC) is suggested to be a significant precursor of PM2.5, but which VOC structure contributes the most to the aerosol particulate formation is still an open question. With large space occupation and complex structures (cyclic, linear and branched), VOCs together with inorganics may play a critical role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). To explore the effect of molecular structure on nucleation in NPF, a multi-component (H2SO4-HNO3-NH3-VOC) kinetic model is established based on the gas kinetic theory and graph theory. As the most common VOCs in the atmosphere, alkanes with 2-15 carbons are selected for model analysis. The results show that alkanes especially those with a cyclic structure or carbon number >= 4 results in the highest rate of NPF within the species considered in this study. The dominant size of nuclei, as well as the concentration of particles (larger than 1 nm), is enhanced by the increasing carbon number in alkanes. Taking the alkanes with same carbon number for comparison, the contribution to the nucleation by molecular structure is found to follow the order cyclic > linear > branched, and inversely proportion to branching number.

AB Formation of 1-aminomethanol in troposphere through the reaction between formaldehyde and ammonia has been investigated by means of electronic structure and chemical kinetics calculations employing CCSD(T)/CBS//MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The process is not favorable under tropospheric conditions due to high reaction barrier (30.4 kcal mol(-1)) and very low rate coefficient (1.7 x 10(-34) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K). As a result, catalytic influence of water (monomer and dimer) and formic acid on the ammonolysis of formaldehyde have also been studied. Formic acid was found to be the most efficient in lowering the activation energy and makes the reaction barrierless. It acts better than the other catalysts in terms of rate coefficient as well (increment in rate coefficient with respect to uncatalyzed channel is by similar to 10(21) times whereas the same for water dimer and water monomer are by similar to 10(15) and similar to 10(11), respectively). Further comparative studies on the efficiencies of catalysts carried out by means of relative rate calculations reveal that formic acid catalyzed channel dominates over the water catalyzed channels at 0 km altitude when concentration of the former is high but water catalyzed channels dominate at higher temperature when formic acid is present in low concentration. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds almost exclusively via formic acid catalyzed channel at higher altitudes in troposphere.

AB Kinetics and mechanism of beta-caryophyllonic acid (BCA) oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the aqueousphase were investigated at 298 +/- 2 K using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to follow concentrations of organic compounds during the photooxidation at cloud-relevant concentrations (several mu M). The rate coefficients obtained for BCA + OH reaction were: 4.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(10) M(-1)s(-1) at pH = 2 and 6.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) at pH = 8. The kinetic data obtained in this study was used to estimate atmospheric lifetimes of BCA in the aqueous-phase: between 24 min and 12 h depending on pH. The results indicated that aqueous-phase oxidation is a relevant removal pathway for this compound in clouds, fogs and wet aerosols. The products of BCA + OH reaction were studied with the high resolution tandem MS. The two major, first-generation products identified were keto-BCA and hydroxyl-hydroperoxy RCA; these two molecules were formed by OH addition to the terminal C =C bond of the precursor. The rest of the products were identified as oxygenated BCA derivatives with O:C ratios higher than the precursor although some fragmentation of the original carbon backbone was also observed. Thus, the data acquired provided insights into the mechanism of RCA + OH reaction.

AB East Asia is the largest emitter of mercury (Hg) in the world, but only a few studies of speciated Hg have been carried out in South Korea. In this study, total gaseous mercury (TGM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particulate bound mercury (PBM) were measured at one of the most northwestern islands of South Korea. Concentrations of TGM and GOM were similar to those measured in other regions of Korea; however, PBM was found in much higher concentrations during cold months, most likely from coal and biomass burning in North Korea. Sources outside Korea significantly affected TGM and PBM, and GOM increased as air masses transported from domestic coal-burning power plants. During the warm months, GOM increased as gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) decreased when air masses were confined within the ocean area with minimal influence from anthropogenic emissions. This implies that there is an efficient process for the oxidation of GEM and GOM production in the marine boundary layer. The concentrations of ozone also decreased as an increase in GOM was observed, suggesting that halogens are primarily responsible for GEM oxidation.

AB Aerosol scattering properties (ASP) i.e., scattering and backscattering coefficients (sigma(sp), sigma(bsp), 525 nm), scattering Angstrom exponent (SAE, 450-635 nm) and backscatter ratio (b, 525 nm) along with PM10 concentrations were measured from November 2015 to October 2016 at a mountain site (1558 m a.s.l) located in the southwestern Mediterranean. ASP and PM 10 average values obtained for the whole period were: 26.2 Mm(-1), 3.5 Min(-1), 1.42, 0.139 and 12.4 mu g/m(3), respectively. The study was aimed at analyzing: a) the seasonal variability of the measured parameters, b) the impact of mineral dust from North Africa on PM10 and optical properties and c) the variation of ASP values and PM10 concentrations as a function of the mixing layer height. The extensive scattering properties had values similar to 35% higher during the warm period, while SAE and b were similar during both the cold and warm seasons. sigma(sp) and sigma(bsp) increased under Saharan dust events (SDE). In contrast, SAE and b values showed a decrease due to the increase in coarse particle concentrations during this type of event. On non-event days, the lowest values of sigma(sp) and PM10 were recorded under free troposphere (FT) conditions (10.5 Mm(-1), 3 mu g/m(3)). Conversely, SAE recorded its highest value (2.00) under these conditions, pointing to a predominance of fine particles in this layer. Average values of sigma(sp), and PM10 increased with the increase in the height of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), while the SAE value progressively decreased to a steady value of 1.50-1.60. The average value of the mass scattering efficiency (MSE) during the study period was 1.35 m(2)/g.

AB A limited literature body have estimated regional differences in air pollution mixtures. More comprehensive analyses are necessary to accurately depict differences in air pollution characteristics over space and time. Our objective is to further these efforts by investigating spatial differences of air pollution mixtures across the US. We employed spatially constrained clustering approach (based on k-means algorithm) to group air pollution monitoring sites that exhibit distinct pollutant profiles or mixtures in the US over 9 years (2008-2016). We accounted for 20 chemical components of PM2.5. The resulting clusters of pollution mixtures are characterized and validated based on source emissions represented by land-use information. Our analysis resulted in 27 clusters with different number of sites. For example, the cluster 1 has 14 sites and it covers part of the southeast, including the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The southwest has a very prominent cluster with 8 sites (cluster 26), covering part of the Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas. In the west coast, two clusters were highlighted in our analysis, cluster 3 in California and cluster 7 in Washington and part of Oregon. Both clusters with 5 sites. We estimated that Cu, Se, NO3-, Cr, and Ba were the top five species that divided the study area into cluster of sites more effectively. Observing the concentration ratios (concentrations of the species i/concentration of PM2.5) for some of these clusters, our results show that clusters 3 and 7 in the west coast represent sites with high Na ratios. Cluster 13 in the northwest and part of the Midwest represents sites with high SO42- ratio. The cluster 16 with a single site in northeast has the highest O-4(2-) ratio, representing almost the third quartile of the SO42- ratio. This is one of the few studies focused on spatial patterns analysis to estimate regions that exhibit distinct pollutant mixtures on a large scale. We expect that further investigations can use our findings to analyze the relationship between areas that exhibit distinct pollutant mixtures and the impact of regulations, climate change, and health effects in the US.

AB The size-resolved chemical composition and mixing state of single particles were observed by using single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) from May 12 to June 8, 2017. A total of 979,899 particles were successfully ionized to identify 6 main particle groups including carbon-rich particles (47.66%), K-rich particles (28.78%), heavy-metal particles (10.12%), sodium particles (8.86%), dust particles (3.89%), and ammonium particles (0.67%). The wind direction and speed had large impacts on the proportion of carbonaceous aerosol particles and had little influence on heavy-metal particles. The relative humidity (RH) had great impacts on the chemical components of aerosol particles. The proportion of secondary particles increased, while the primary particles diminished as RH increased. The proportion of carbon-rich particles decreased with increasing particle size. However, the size distributions varied significantly for different types of carbonaceous particles. Sodium particles and heavy-metal particles were mainly concentrated at sizes larger than 1 mu m. K-rich particles had a maximum proportion at 0.5-1.0 mu m. The number fraction of ammonium particles predominated chiefly at 0.6-2.0 mu m. It has been found that aerosol particles, mainly from burning processes, were mixed with 36 [C-3](+) to different degrees at Mt. Tai. A high proportion of ammonium particles were mixed with organics and elemental carbon (OCEC), elemental carbon-sulfate (EC-sulfate), and elemental carbon-secondary (EC-secondary) particles, while few of these particles were mixed with EC-nitrate particles, which indicated that the ammonia in the air was inclined to combine with organic species and sulfate. A higher proportion of atmospheric particles mixed with nitrate were observed compared to those mixed with sulfate.

AB The strong temporal and spatial gradients in NO2 concentrations frequently observed in urban microenvironments are very difficult to measure and model accurately. Recent developments in low-cost air quality instruments have led to improvement in the spatial coverage of time-resolved measurement, however interpolation is still needed to map pollutant concentrations and connect time-as well as space-dependent variations to urban design features. Here we propose a novel approach that uses a previously-described microscale land use regression (LUR) model to spatially interpolate data from a well-calibrated network of low-cost air quality instruments. We use a semiconducting oxide-based ozone sensor to provide a robust correction of the output of an electrochemical NO2 sensor for ozone interference. We characterise signal noise probably associated with meniscus fluctuations as a significant error source, that can be handled with appropriate signal averaging. The LUR model is used to provide high spatial resolution in the data set, whilst correlation with sensor measurements provides a time-dependent estimate associated with different land use types. Observations from the network of instruments showed marked variability in NO2 concentrations over short distances (on the scale of 100 m), with highest concentrations reached near bus stops, intersections and under shop awnings. This approach connects the complex time- and space-dependent variations to urban design features and is a promising way forward as a basis for objective spatial mapping of time-dependent mean concentration fields and local population exposure estimates.

AB The physical properties of black carbon (BC) including the mass loading, size distribution and mixing state were in-situ characterized by aircraft measurements using a single particle soot photometer (SP2) in the lower troposphere over Beijing area. The flights were conducted in both late spring and winter during the daytime with well-developed planetary boundary layer (PBL). The BC mass in the PBL (BCPBL) in late spring showed no apparent vertical gradient nor correlation with the PBL height (PBLH) due to strong convective mixing; in winter the BCPBL, was more concentrated near ground and anti-correlated with the PBLH due to dilution effect of the dominant cleaner northerly air masses at higher altitude. The BC mass loading at height h, C(h) within the PBL can be extended from the surface level (C0) in late spring; for levels above the PBL, C(h) can be parameterized by applying an exponential decline function C(h) = C0*exp(h/hs), with the scale height (hs) of 0.31 +/- 0.16 km and 0.66 +/- 0.24 km for late spring and winter respectively. This parameterization excluded the profiles for: turbulent conditions when the BC mass was efficiently vented upwards and diluted, expressed as C(h) = C0 up to the top of the PBL; or in periods of strong southerly advection, when the entire column was significantly influenced by regional transport from the polluted south regions. The BC core mass median diameters (MMD) were commonly populated at 205-220 nm in both seasons, with additional mode of MMD similar to 195 nm also frequently observed in late spring. The bulk relative coating thickness of BC (coated diameter divided by uncoated core diameter (D-p/D-c) in the PBL mostly populated at 2.0-2.2 but at similar to 1.2-1.6 in the lower free troposphere (FT). The mass absorption cross section of BC at 550 nm (MAC(550)), constrained by the SP2 measurements, was largely influenced by the coating thickness, was relatively consistent in the PBL at similar to 8.6 m(2) g(-1), but reduced to 7-7.5 m(2 )g(-1) in the FT or turbulent condition due to decreased coatings. The BC was found to exhibit smaller particle size in the FT but larger in the PBL, which may imply larger BC have been scavenged by low-level clouds. The BC particles trapped in the PBL or regionally transported from polluted region represent the most absorbing element in the particulate matter population and should be particularly considered in evaluating the radiative forcing impact of aerosols over this region.

AB A disastrous outbreak of thunderstorm-induced asthma attacks posed a major public health threat in Ahvaz, Iran in autumn of 2013 (>15,000 referrals to hospital emergency rooms and pulmonary clinics). City officials claimed that promoting factors included acid rain, particulate matter, ozone, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (PAHS) could lead to this phenomenon. After these potential causes were rejected by careful research, the next possible cause that this study addresses is a potential link of the asthma attacks to airborne pollen grains and fungal spores. In order to sample these parameters, a Hirst-type volumetric spore sampler was used, which was installed on the rooftop of the sampling site. Sampling was done during two six-month periods to characterize the regional bioaerosol. The first period included the autumn (September 22 to December 20 of 2016) and winter seasons (December 21 of 2016 to March 19 of 2017), while the second period included the following autumn (September 23 to December 21 of 2017) and winter seasons (December 22 of 2017 to March 20 of 2018). In both studied periods, airborne weed pollen grains, especially Amaranthaceae sp., were by far the greatest contributor to total airborne pollen grain concentrations (50.45%, 3757 pollen grains/m(3) and 52.12%, 2392 pollen grains/m(3), respectively). Among fungal spores, Cladosporium had the highest concentrations (75.29%, 258677 spores/m(3) and 80.33%, 247693 spores/m(3), respectively). Findings also showed that concentrations of airborne pollen grains were higher in autumn seasons (6361 and 4167 pollen grains/m(3), respectively) in comparison with winter seasons (1085 and 423 pollen grains/m(3), respectively), while the concentrations of fungal spores were enhanced in winter seasons (189216 and 160962 spores/m(3), respectively) versus autumn seasons (154377 and 147377 spores/m(3), respectively). Fungal spores exhibited a uniform distribution during the entire study period, but airborne pollen grains were significantly higher in autumn seasons. The numbers of referrals associated with thunderstorm asthma attacks decreased drastically after implementing Conocarpus erectus tree pruning activities. We concluded that the autumnal thunderstorm asthma attacks in Ahvaz might be triggered by a combination of bio-allergens (fungal spores and airborne pollen grains such as from Conocarpus erectus) and high levels of air pollutants from industrial activity. The results of this work suggest controlling bio-allergen levels by preventive measures such as tree pruning, weed removal, and emasculating urban green infrastructures before the flowering season.

AB We investigate the temporal trends of peak ozone in Switzerland for the 1990-2014 time period. The meteorological conditions have a large influence on ozone formation and drive a large part of the variability in ozone observations. Therefore, the influence of meteorology on ozone was estimated using generalized additive models and removed from the ozone observations. A variable selection method was used for model building allowing the detection of the meteorological variables that have the largest effect on the variability of daily maximum ozone at each considered station. It was found that peak concentrations of ozone have been reducing in most of the stations, indicating a positive effect of implemented air pollution control measures on locally produced ozone. In the remote, high alpine site of Jungfraujoch a small upward trend of peak ozone was observed, most likely due to influence of hemispheric background ozone. In the most polluted traffic sites, peak ozone has for a different reason also been increasing until around 2003, when this trend started to level off. In traffic sites the increasing ozone concentrations due to reduced titration by nitrogen monoxide was the dominating process. One of the advantages of meteorological correction of ozone observations for trend estimation is that the uncertainty in the calculated trends is reduced. In addition, trend estimation based on meteorologically corrected ozone is less influenced by exceptional meteorological events during a specific time period, such as heat waves or by temporal changes in meteorological variables.

AB Water from fossil fuel combustion can represent > 10% of urban specific humidity, but this fraction is difficult to constrain from meteorological measurements alone. Stable water vapor isotopes can be used to estimate the fraction of combustion-derived vapor (CDV) and characterize the contrast between anthropogenically-altered and natural systems due to CDV's distinctive isotope composition. However, accurate estimates of the CDV fraction of urban humidity requires information on vapor isotope ratios in the absence of anthropogenic emissions. We present data from an urban site in Salt Lake City, UT and from a high-elevation site in the adjacent Wasatch Mountains. Urban vapor d-excess values (d-excess = delta H-2-8 delta O-18) closely track CO2 concentrations on diurnal to weekly timescales, but high-elevation vapor values do not. Instead, the high-elevation site captures large-scale atmospheric variability, with d-excess changes largely following changes in delta O-18 and humidity. Isotope ratios at the two sites remain distinct throughout most of the winter, indicating that these sites are regularly decoupled from each other and that high-elevation winter measurements may rarely be representative of valley conditions in the absence of urban emissions. Furthermore, high-elevation d-excess may be higher than emissions-free values at the same elevation as the urban area, as vapor d-excess changes non-linearly during condensation at low specific humidity, and would result in an overestimate of urban humidity amounts. Therefore, the high-elevation site may not help place additional constraints on the amount of CDV in urban systems, yet the paired sites show changes in vapor isotope ratios, particularly in d-excess, that capture differences in urban and natural impacts on water vapor cycling.

AB This work presents a comprehensive study of the size-resolved particle hygroscopicity measurements in a suburban ambient in Southern Europe (Madrid). Measurements were obtained by an H-TDMA instrument during a 16-month period for the size particles of 50, 80, 110, 190 and 265 nm. The annual, seasonal and daily patterns were investigated with the aim of characterizing the hygroscopic growth of ambient aerosol particles and their mixing state in the atmosphere. Simultaneously, the particle number size distributions, gaseous species (SO2, NO, NO2, and O-3) and meteorological factors were measured and analyzed, complementing this study. The growth factor probability density functions (GF-PDFs) at the measurement site normally exhibit a multimodal pattern with two hygroscopic groups of particles clearly differentiated, indicating that the aerosol particles were externally mixed. Generally, particle hygroscopicity increased as particles were larger, indicating an increase less-to-more hygroscopic species. In cold seasons, aerosol particles were more externally mixed than in warm seasons. Thus, the growth factor of the more hygroscopic particle group (GF(MH)) was higher than in warm seasons varying from 1.41 (50 nm)-1.70 (265 nm). However, the number fraction of more hygroscopic particle group (NFMH) was lower. The persistence of anticyclonic stagnation conditions and the enhanced particulate nitrate formation from traffic emissions seemed to be the two main factors responsible for this result. A dominant hygroscopic particle group was often observed in warm seasons, due to frequent NPF bursts. In these seasons, and probably associated to the high atmospheric oxidative capacity, the highest average growth factors (GF(mean)) of the study period were obtained. This finding was also reflected in the diurnal cycle. Thus, GF(mean), and NFMH during rush-hour periods usually reached the minimum values of the day, especially in cold seasons. When comparing weekdays and weekends, the strong influence of traffic emissions on particle hygroscopicity was evidenced (WKs/WEs ratios for NFMH were < 1.00). The more dispersive atmospheric conditions in the warm seasons hampered the impact of traffic emissions on particle hygroscopicity. Results from H-TDMA measurements obtained here are similar to those found in other suburban European sites and lower than in suburban Asian ones. With respect to urban sites, our values were lower than those found in urban European and Asian sites. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the strong dependence of the hygroscopic behavior of aerosol particles on the atmospheric conditions and particle sources, and thus, aerosol composition.

AB Cold fronts are mesoscale meteorological phenomena that play important roles in chemical transport processes. Effects of a single cold front episode on surface ozone may vary since meteorological factors may alter ozone in different (increasing or decreasing) directions. We studied cold front events and their effects on surface maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) during 2003-2017. The average number of cold front days in the CONUS was 50.02 days per year per site with a slightly increasing trend (1.06 per year) during 2003-2017. The Rocky Mountains blocked most cold fronts for the Northwest and the Southwest. Percentages of 24 h back trajectories from north side in 12 sample cities show that cold front effects exist +/- 12 h to cold fronts' arrival at least. Compared to all days' average, MDA8 ozone differs from prefrontal days, cold front 1st days, cold front 2 + days, and post frontal days by 0.10, - 0.94, - 0.84, and -1.89 ppbv ( - 0.89 ppbv on average), respectively. By contrast, they overlapped 9.85%, 5.82%, 0.89%, and 5.04%, respectively (21.60% in total) with ozone exceedance days. Regional consistent long-term effects of cold fronts on surface MDA8 ozone have been found. Enhancements during prefrontal days can be seen in the Northeast and the Midwest during non-winter seasons. For cold front days and post frontal days, ozone differences in the Southwest, the Northwest, and the Northeast were negative in non-winter seasons then reversed to positive in winter. The areas along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico showed positive ozone difference in non-winter seasons and expanded to the inland area during summer then reversed to negative in winter. Synergy of cold fronts and other climatic and meteorological factors (e.g., prefrontal stagnation, southerly flow from the Gulf of Mexico, and winter stratospheric intrusions) can preliminarily explain these consistent long-term effects.

AB Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) is the most commonly measured ambient air pollutant worldwide on account of its adverse health effects. In 2008 the US Embassy in Beijing started monitoring PM2.5 on the embassy premises to provide US citizens in the area with actionable health information related to ambient air pollution. By May 2019 the United States Department of State ambient air quality monitoring network had expanded to 43 cities in 27 countries. This provided a reliable source of nearreal-time PM2.5 data to fill data gaps in previously under-served countries.
   This manuscript describes data analyses of seasonal, diurnal and meteorological trends which can be used for air quality planning and awareness in 29 of the embassies host cities. People living, working, traveling or considering relocating to those areas can gain a better understanding of the air quality they are exposed to. Potential explanations are offered for sites that deviate from expected trends: Addis Ababa experiences high PM2.5 during the rainy season probably due to widespread biomass burning and light winds; Manama has high PM2.5 throughout the day on summer weekends because widespread air conditioner usage causes coal-fired power plants to operate at high capacity to meet the electricity demand; Pristina experienced very high PM2.5 during winter weekend nights, which turned out to be very cold and stagnant periods and likely increased wood and coal combustion for home heating.
   Although Chinese sites consistently exceed the country's annual PM2.5 standards, analysis of long term trends confirm steady improvements in air quality. These improvements cannot be attributed to favorable meteorological conditions alone and are likely due to reductions of emissions. Since random forest-based machine learning methods explained > 90% of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations at 21 locations, they can be used in conjunction with meteorological models for air quality forecasting.

AB Snow is an important reservoir of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds. In this paper, the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) and other two kinds of important pollutants in the environment, 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) and trichloromethane (TCM), were investigated by the adsorption experiment. The results suggest that gamma-HCH adsorption capacity on snow is much higher than that of p-DCB and TCM, The adsorption kinetics of the three pollutants fit the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, and their adsorption thermodynamics accord with Henry's linear adsorption model. The effect of common inorganic salts (Na2SO4, Na2CO3 and NaNO3) on adsorption was positive, the presence of inorganic salts promoted the adsorption of gamma-HCH, p-DCB and TCM on the snow. The adsorption of gamma-HCH on natural snow was at least 3.5 times greater than that on artificial snow. All the results indicate that snow in cold regions may be the significant reservoir of organic pollutants.

AB Ambient PM2.5 pollution has been a major environmental concern in recent years. Beijing, the capital of China, is enduring frequent and severe PM2.5 pollution. In this study, 186 valid PM2.5 pollution episodes during the 2014-2017 period were identified and classified into four categories according to the mechanism of pollution formation and evolution. Category I often occurs in autumn, winter and early spring, depending on accumulation during stagnant weather. Category II featured by photochemistry is dominant in summer, and category III caused by dust storms occasionally occurs in spring. Category IV represents a combination during transition periods. Interannual variations show that particulate pollution decreased from 2014 to 2017, and the decline in categories I and II played the most important role. To further understand the PM2.5 pollution patterns in Beijing, the temporal and spatial characteristics and relationships between PM2.5 levels and meteorological features were analyzed. Category I is the main pollution type that brings forth heavy or severe pollution and has the longest duration in those cases, while category II often leads to light or moderate pollution. There is a north-south gap in the PM2.5 levels in Beijing. The high-level pollution in category I tends to evolve northward, while the low-level pollution in category I and category II pollution tend to evolve southward and widen the north-south gap, affected by the regional transport and more local emissions in the south. Additionally, the relationship between the concentrations and meteorology also vary with the pollution categories. High relative humidity, low wind speeds and low boundary layer heights are likely to lead to category I or II pollution, but category III requires high winds. These results provide insights into the annual tendency and characteristics of Beijing's particulate pollution in recent years.

AB Bromine and iodine chemistry has been updated in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to better capture the influence of natural emissions from the oceans on ozone concentrations. Annual simulations were performed using the hemispheric CMAQ model without and with bromine and iodine chemistry. Model results over the Northern Hemisphere show that including bromine and iodine chemistry in CMAQ not only reduces ozone concentrations within the marine boundary layer but also aloft and inland. Bromine and iodine chemistry reduces annual mean surface ozone over seawater by 25%, with lesser ozone reductions over land. The bromine and iodine chemistry decreases ozone concentration without changing the diurnal profile and is active throughout the year. However, it does not have a strong seasonal influence on ozone over the Northern Hemisphere. Model performance of CMAQ is improved by the bromine and iodine chemistry when compared to observations, especially at coastal sites and over seawater. Relative to bromine, iodine chemistry is approximately four times more effective in reducing ozone over seawater over the Northern Hemisphere (on an annual basis). Model results suggest that the chemistry modulates intercontinental transport and lowers the background ozone imported to the United States.

AB A shallow ice core from Dome A (DA2005 ice core), East Antarctica is used to investigate the preservation and variation of nitrate (NO3-) at a location with extremely low snow accumulation rate. The average NO3- concentration of 11.8 +/- 3.0 mu g kg(-1) in the last 2840 years covered by the top 100.42 m is the lowest in all Antarctic ice cores for this specific temporal frame. Isotopic composition of NO3- indicates that NO3- in the DA2005 core has experienced strong post-depositional processing most likely driven by photolytic chemistry, which results in the extremely low NO3- concentration. NO3- remaining at depth far below the surface is mainly cycled and produced locally. A decrease in NO3- concentration from AD 1250 to 1900 and a sustained NO3- dip in AD 1500-1900 below the long-term mean concentration may be linked with changes in primary NOx sources. In the DA2005 core, significant NO3- displacement is observed in layers containing volcanic sulphate; the degree of displacement is largely influenced by the volcanic signal magnitude, i.e., large volcanic signals lead to significant displacement, while small signals result in negligible displacement. In addition, it is found that snow accumulation rate could influence NO3- displacement by comparing DA2005 core and other Antarctic ice core records.

AB Dust particles are hazardous to human health and severely affect the city operations. However, there is few research on the topographic dynamic removal of near-surface dust particles. In this study, the surface meteorological and aerosol monitoring data if such an event was analysed. The event took place on March 27-29, 2018 in Beijing, China. Given the special topographic conditions in Beijing, various parameters, such as wind profile line data, four-dimensional variation Doppler radar data, and aerosol lidar data were used to determine the dynamic effects of easterly wind. The event could be divided into four stages. In Stage 1 (Dust aerosol transfer), the dust particles at higher elevation were transferred to upper atmosphere of Beijing through northern wind. These dust particles gradually moved to the lower atmosphere. The temperature inversion layer hindered the settlement of dust particles on the near-surface atmosphere. The dust particles could not penetrate the temperature inversion layer and moved to the near-surface layer. Anthropogenic aerosols of high concentrations were retained below the height of 1 km. In Stage 2 (development of dust particles), following the dynamics of easterly wind, the temperature inversion phenomenon gradually disappeared. The high-concentration dust particles in the higher atmosphere were transferred to the near-surface layer and settled down, thus mixing with the anthropogenic aerosol particles. In Stage 3 (decreasing dust aerosol concentration in the middle troposphere), the easterly wind clearly strengthened in the middle troposphere. Above this layer, the easterly wind weakened with height and formed uplifting airstreams, which coupled with the southerly airstream formed by the upper trough above Beijing. Furthermore, high-concentration aerosols were lifted to a certain height and could not spread to the upper atmosphere because of sinking airflow. In Stage 4 (removal of dust particles), the easterly wind reached the strength of low-level jet streams. The south-westerly wind was present above 2.5 km height. The high aerosol concentrations at the height of 2.0 km and below were lifted to the upper atmosphere and blown downstream by the strong south-westerly wind and the easterly wind coming from clean-ocean air masses, thereby concluding the dust particles' event.

AB Background: Air quality standards are typically based on long term averages - whereas a person may encounter exposure peaks throughout the day. Exposure peaks may contribute meaningfully to health impacts beyond their contribution to long term averages, and therefore should be considered alongside longer-term exposures. We aim to define and explain peak exposure to black carbon air pollution and look at the relationship between short peak exposures and longer term personal exposure.
   Methods: A peak detection algorithm was applied to pooled data from two independent studies. High-resolution personal black carbon monitoring was performed in 175 healthy adult volunteers for a minimum of two 24-h periods per person. At the same time, we retrieved information on the time-activity pattern. Data covered Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In total, 2053 monitoring days were included.
   Results: Exposure profiles revealed 2.8 +/- 1.6 (avg +/- SD) peaks per person per day. The average black carbon concentration during a peak was 4206 ng/m(3). On 5.5% of the time participants were exposed to peak concentrations, but this contributed to 21.0% of their total exposure. The short time in transport (8%), was responsible for 32.7% of the peaks. 24.1% of the measurements in transport were categorized as peak exposure; while sleeping this was only 0.9%. When considering transport modes, participants were most likely to encounter peaks while cycling (34.0%). Most peaks were encountered at rush hour, from Monday through Friday, and in the cold season. Gender and age had no impact on the presence of peaks. Daily average black carbon exposure showed only a moderate correlation with peak frequency (r = 0.44). This correlation coefficient increased when considering longer term exposure to r > 0.60 from 10 days onward.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of peaks varied substantially over time, across microenvironments and transport modes. Daily average exposure was moderately correlated with peak frequency. Real-time air pollution alerting systems may use the peak detection algorithm to support citizens in self-management of air pollution health effects.

AB The reactions of tropospheric oxidants, Cl, OH and O-3, with three cyclic hydrocarbons, cyclooctane, cis-cyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene, have been investigated to understand the significance of these reactions, particularly with Cl, in degradation of these hydrocarbons. The rate coefficients of reaction of Cl (Ica) atom at 298K are determined as (4.5 +/- 0.4), (4.7 +/- 0.4) and (5.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1)s(-1) for cyclooctane, cis-cyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. The corresponding values of rate coefficients of reactions with OH (K-OH) at 298K are (1.4 +/- 0.2), (5.1 +/- 1) and (11.1 +/- 2) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1)s(-1) for cyclooctane, ciscyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene, respectively and the values of kO(3) at 298 K are (4.1 +/- 0.8) and (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(-16) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for cis-cyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene, respectively. The quoted errors include the experimental 2 alpha, along with the error in the reference rate coefficients. The values of k(Cl;) i of cis-cyclooctene and k(OH) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene are being reported for the first time. The results suggest that Cl atom is more effective in the atmospheric degradation of cyclooctane than OH, in the conditions of marine boundary layer. Reactions with both OH and ozone contribute to the degradation of cis-cyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene, the ozone reaction being more effective in the former and the OH reaction in the latter. Analysis of the stable products suggests that the addition of Cl atom is dominant in the unsaturated molecules. Unsaturated ketones and alcohols are identified as products in the reactions of OH and Cl with cis-cyclooctene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene in the gas phase, emphasizing the importance of H atom abstraction/addition-elimination channels in these unsaturated molecules.

AB The causal link between ambient PM2.5 and adverse health effects is still not clear enough, nor it is clear what factors (physical and/or chemical) contribute to PM2.5 toxicity and by what mechanism(s). With a view on this, we launched the CARE experiment, during which we performed a comprehensive characterisation of the physicochemical properties of fine and ultrafine particles under exposure levels dominated by the urban combustion aerosol, and their toxicological assessment through in-vitro tests (lung epithelia cells cultured at the ALI) directly under ambient conditions, oxidative potential (determined through 2',7'-dichlorouorescin, OPDCFH), and human biomonitoring. We already reported about aerosol characterisation, and in-vitro model results during CARE. Building upon these, in this work we assess the combustion aerosol oxidative response through the analysis of consistency between the three independent aerosol oxidative responses obtained, and the exploration of any causality link with the combustion aerosol. This is the first time to our knowledge that combustion related PM2.5 physicochemical properties and its OPDCFH are compared to the cellular-oxidative response (C-OR) obtained through the PM in-vitro test carried out (for the first time) directly under atmospheric ambient conditions, and to certain biomarkers of oxidative damage to DNA/RNA (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8 - dihydroguanosine). Our results provide a first evidence of a combustion-dependent association between the in vitro C-OR, the PM2.5 OPDCFH, and the urinary excretion of the 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine. Yet this is not a substantial basis for drawing any cause-effect relationship. However, our findings support previous literature suggesting a link between combustion and oxidative response of PM2.5. Moreover, we add a consistency across completely independent oxidative response measurements with a possible dependence on the combustion traffic-related aerosol. This is a piece of information that may have important implications in the understanding of how combustion sources contribute to oxidative response related diseases.

AB Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to have an adverse impact on public health and is an important climate forcer. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contributes up to 80% of PM2.5 worldwide and multiphase reactions are an important pathway to form SOA. Aerosol-phase state is thought to influence the reactive uptake of gas-phase precursors to aerosol particles by altering diffusion rates within particles. Current air quality models do not include the impact of diffusion-limiting organic coatings on SOA formation. This work examines how alpha-pinenederived organic coatings change the predicted formation of SOA from the acid-catalyzed multiphase reactions of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPDX). A box model, with inputs provided from field measurements taken at the Look Rock (LRK) site in Great Smokey Mountains National Park during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS), was modified to incorporate the latest laboratory-based kinetic data accounting for organic coating influences. Including an organic coating influence reduced the modeled reactive uptake when relative humidity was in the 55-80% range, with predicted IEPDX-derived SOA being reduced by up to 33%. Only sensitivity cases with a large increase in Henry's Law values of an order of magnitude or more or in particle reaction rates resulted in the large statistically significant differences form base model performance. These results suggest an organic coating layer could have an impact on IEPDX-derived SOA formation and warrant consideration in regional and global scale models.

AB Levoglucosan is used as a tracer of biomass burning; however, its determination often requires expensive analytical techniques. Therefore, this study describes the development of an inexpensive and useful method using paper-based analytical devices (PADs) to determine levoglucosan based on colorimetric measurements. The color intensities were correlated with the analytical concentrations and presented linear behavior in the range from 0 to 64.8 mu g mL(-1). The achieved limits of detection and quantification were 2 and 6 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The conversion rate of levoglucosan into glucose was 81 +/- 8% and the average recovery was 105 +/- 9%. Moreover, the method presented selectivity for levoglucosan, showing variation in colorimetric signal intensity lower than 8% in the presence of other saccharides (xylose, glucose, galactose, maltose, mannose, arabinose, and fructose). The accuracy of the method was confirmed by comparison with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proposed method was explored to determine levoglucosan in samples of atmospheric particulate matter collected in Goiania city (Brazil) and the values ranged from 0.08 to 1.10 mu g m(-3), showing the high impact of the biomass burning to the particulate matter in the region's atmosphere. The method was also used to detect levoglucosan in rainwater samples. Therefore, the use of PADs can simplify fieldwork involving the determination of levoglucosan in atmospheric particulate matter.

AB The concentrations, optical and radiative effects of carbonaceous aerosols were essential to studies of the climatic, environmental and health effects. The previous studies less combined numerical simulation with in-situ observations, especially for the aerosol vertical profiles. In this study, we off-line measured vertical profiles of submicron black carbon (BC) aerosols and on-line obtained aerosol optical properties over urban Lanzhou during 26 December 2017 to 11 January 2018. The BC optical properties and radiative effects were evaluated using Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) and Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) models. The absorption and scattering coefficients and optical depth of BC aerosols ranged from 9 to 83 M m(-1) , 3-24 M m(-1) and 0.02 to 0.2 respectively, which in average accounted for 50%, 3% and 11% of the optical properties of total aerosols during the study period. BC aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) within ATMOS (top-surface) varying from 16.6 to 108.8 W m(-2) accounted for 17.3%-97.4% of total aerosols ARF with an average of 66.6%, and the percentages increased significantly as BC concentrations increased during the period. The mean atmospheric heating rate (AHR) induced by BC aerosols was 1.94 K day(-1) ranging from 0.46 to 3.03 K day(-1) during the study period. This study contributes to understanding the impacts of light-absorbing aerosols on climate and haze pollution in an urban valley.

AB Background: Air pollution affects the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal tract and has been linked to several gastrointestinal diseases in recent years. However, little is known about the association of air pollution with peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB). We aimed to conduct a time-series study to examine the association between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and emergency admissions for PUB in Beijing, China.
   Methods: Data on emergency admissions for PUB between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012 were obtained from the Beijing Medical Claim Data for Employees. Measurements of PM2.5 concentration were obtained from the United States Embassy air-monitoring station. A generalized additive Poisson model was applied to explore the association between PM2.5 concentrations and emergency admissions for PUB, with stratification by gender and age.
   Results: A total of 5123 emergency admissions for PUB were identified. Short-term exposure to outdoor PM2.5 was significantly associated with increased emergency admissions for PUB at lag0 day. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration at lag0 day corresponded to a 0.56% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04%-1.08%; P = 0.035) increase in emergency admissions for PUB. There was a clear concentration-response association between PM2.5 concentrations and emergency admissions for PUB. The PM2.5 effect estimates were greater in elderly people ( >= 65 years old) with the difference approaching statistical significance (percentage change 0.78, 95% CI 0.03%-1.54% in patients >= 65 years old; percentage change 0.32, 95% CI -0.38%-1.03% in patients < 65 years old; P = 0.073), but the difference between men and women was not significant (percentage change 0.75, 95% CI 0.08%-1.43% in man; percentage change 0.27, 95% CI -0.51%-1.07% in woman; P = 0.368).
   Conclusion: Short-term elevation in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations was associated with increased emergency admissions for PUB, particularly in elderly people. Future studies are warranted to confirm the findings and elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association.

AB Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) conducted a nested, case-crossover-design public school-based study in two different climate regions of California in 2000-2003. This included exploring operating profiles of two mechanical ventilation (HVAC) systems (alternated over a period of approximately nine weeks during 2001 Fall school semester) in pairs of classrooms sited adjacent to one another, equipped with either standard or alternate (low-emissivity) interior finish materials. Our retrospective analysis included inferring estimated indoor ozone concentrations. Because ozone can react with certain indoor pollutants to generate secondary organic aerosols, a mass-balanced based indoor/outdoor ratio expression was used to model indoor ozone to subsequently model indoor particles from possible ozone-initiated chemistry. When Indirect-Direct Evaporative Cooling (IDEC) HVAC was running, surface (especially ceiling) reactions dominated ozone loss processes. When standard Bard heat-pump air-conditioning (HPAC) HVAC system was running, damper setting (air excluded from building envelope), ventilation and/or gas phase reactions accounted for most indoor-outdoor ozone differences. Future research should explore outdoor air and surface chemistry contributions to indoor air pollution.

AB The light absorption enhancement (E-abs) of black carbon (BC) caused by non-BC materials is an important source of uncertainty in radiative forcing estimate, yet remains poorly understood in relatively polluted environment such as the megacity Beijing. Here BC absorption enhancement at 630 nm was in-situ measured using a ther-modenuder coupled with a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer and a single scattering albedo monitor in Beijing in summer. The project average (+/- 1 sigma) E-abs was 1.59 ( +/- 0.26), suggesting a significant amplification of BC absorption due to coating materials. E-abs presented a clear daytime increase due to enhanced photochemical processing, and a strong dependence on the mass ratios of non-BC coatings to BC (R-BC). Our results showed that the increase in E(abs )as a function of R-BC was mainly caused by the increased contributions of secondary aerosol. Further analysis showed that the BC absorption enhancement in summer in Beijing was mainly associated with secondary formation of nitrate, sulfate and highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA), while the formation of freshly and less oxidized SOA appeared not to play an important role.

AB Atmospheric PM2.5-bound Phthalate esters (PAEs) pose a major threat to human health. We investigated the concentrations and sources of PAEs in the background and urban area by sampling at the top and foot of Mount Tai (MTtop and MTroot) from May 12 to June 24, 2017. Results demonstrated that the total concentrations of PAEs at the MTtop (120.17 +/- 224.37 ng m(-3)) and MTfoot (130.38 +/- 129.01 ng m(-3)) were close to the domestic urban pollution levels. Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) showed high abundances during the whole sampling period. Daytime PAEs concentrations were higher than that in nighttime both at the MTtop and MTfoot, which is associated with anthropogenic activities, planetary boundary layer (PBL), ambient temperature, and inversion layer. PAEs concentrations were affected by the amount of rainfall. Furthermore, we identified the sources of PAEs based on meteorological conditions and backward trajectories. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and DEHP were mainly from the long-range transport of the high-altitude air masses passed through Shanxi and Hebei provinces in the north direction, especially at the MTtop. Diethyl phthalate (DEP), DnBP and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) were mostly transported from the urban area in the south direction to the MTtop. The sufficiently high PBL, small wind speeds and south-westerly winds were the necessary conditions in the local transport. These findings will help in understanding of PAEs pollution characteristics and provide a scientific basis for reducing PAEs pollution in North China Plain (NCP).

AB With the acceleration of urbanization, industrial prosperity and economic development, China has attracted great attention as one of the largest sources of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution in Asia. Many studies have carried out on the source analysis, spatial and temporal distribution, physical and chemical properties of pollutants. However, there are a few studies on the high-resolution spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants in small-scale cities, especially by using land use regression (LUR) model. LUR model is a common method for predicting the spatial variation of pollutants. It expresses spatially local changes in the results through potential variables in the equation, thus fully reflecting the spatial differentiation of small-scale pollutant concentrations. In our study, along with 40 types potential predictor, we used LUR model to simulate the concentration of NO2 in Xi'an and to generate a high-resolution spatial distribution map of the concentrations, to provide better support for health risk assessment. In addition to using traditional predictors, due to the different classifications of roads in our study area, the use of road length as a predictor did not reflect traffic volumes well. For this reason, we weighted the roads with grades and calculated their area to fit the model. The results show that the fitting effect of the model in this study is good (adjusted R-2 > 0.85), and the deviation (< 2.27%) and LOOCVRMSE (< 2.22 mu g/m(3)) are both small for all time periods. Compared with traditional interpolation models, the LUR model has better prediction accuracy and greater ability to express spatial differences. Using a grid of 500 m * 500 m, 3494 grids were defined in Xi'an to simulate the spatial distribution of NO2 concentrations. High NO2 values appeared around the factory and represented the highest health risk. Due to abundant surface vegetation coverage, the concentrations of NO2 and the consequent health risks in tourist spots, parks and universities were low.

AB Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are an important anthropogenic emission source of atmospheric mercury (Hg). Understanding the co-benefits of conventional air pollution control devices (APCDs) on Hg reduction is crucial for reducing Hg emission from this source. In this study, atmospheric Hg emission from a pulverized coal (PC) utility boiler in North China was investigated along the emission control stage of selective catalytic reduction (SCR), electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and fabric filter (FF) and lime stone-gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD). Historical atmospheric Hg emission from this CFPP with total 1550 MW capacity since its operation in 1976 was estimated based on the implementation of different configurations of APCDs. The results showed that a combination of SCR + ESP-FF + WFGD leads to a co-beneficial Hg control of 96%, with the in-stack Hg concentration (0.87 mu g m(-3)) much lower than the Chinese national standard for CFPPs (30 mu g m(-3)), and the stack Hg speciation (Hg-0:Hg2+:Hg-P) was in 86%:13%:1%. Mass balance analysis indicates that Hg from the input of feed coal and limestone was mainly ended up in fly ash (89%), followed by gypsum (5%), stack gas (5%) and bottom ash (1%), respectively. During the past 42 years of operation (1976-2017), the total air Hg emission from this CFPP summed to 17.62 tonnes, in which Hg-0 make up 14.02 tonnes (79.5%), Hg2+ make up 3.15 tonnes (17.9%) and Hg-p 0.45 tonne (2.6%). Although the speciation of emitted Hg into the atmosphere changed with respect to the configuration of APCDs, Hg-0 was the most dominated emission species (64-98%) for all time. Nearly 90% of total Hg emissions occurred in the first three decades when venturi scrubber (VS) and ESP were the primary APCDs. The installation of WFGD and SCR substantially decreased the Hg emission factors by 17 times compared to the peak values during 1998-2004. This study demonstrates the combination of SCR + ESPFF + WFGD as a best available technology (BAT) for Hg control in CFPPs in China.

AB In depth and detailed study about various classes of aerosols over an urban city of Beijing has been carried out, with the help of cluster technique during the period from (2005-2017). Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), retrieved data for Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE), Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Real and Imaginary index of Refraction (RRI & IRI respectively), Asymmetry Parameter (ASY) has been utilized for discrimination of aerosols over the study site. Higher mean values of AOD and AE were found in winter and spring season as (0.86 +/- 0.38, 0.85 +/- 0.32) and (1.06 +/- 0.36, 1.19 +/- 0.21), while lower values (0.75 +/- 0.33, 0.75 +/- 0.33) and (0.97 +/- 0.22, 0.85 +/- 0.17) for summer and autumn season respectively, representing mixed anthropogenic aerosols over the site. Three main types of aerosol were reported in this study: Mixed Carbonaceous (MC), Biomass Residuals (BR), and coarse mode local and transported Dust Particles (DP). Various aerosol parameters and their inter-relationship were investigated in detail to analyze the dominant aerosol type and its seasonal variations. The EAE and AAE values ranged from (0.10-1.77 and 0.00-1.70 respectively), could mainly be attributed towards MC aerosols. Real and Imaginary parts of Index (RRI & IRI) were recorded in the range from (1.33-1.60 and 0-0.010) respectively. Similarly, the range for SSA and ASY was found as (0.79-0.99 and 0.43-0.78) respectively. Back-trajectories using Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed transportation of air masses from Mongolian deserts, Gobi desert, and other neighboring regions (i.e. Russia and Kazakhstan).

AB Surfactants are often found to be associated with atmospheric particles. They can change the physicochemical properties of these particles, and thereby impact their chemical reactivity. However, their influences on heterogeneous reactions of atmospheric trace gases have not been paid much attention. In this study, the impacts of different surfactants on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite were investigated by using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), including cationic cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and nonionic polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether (Triton X-100). Results indicated that heterogeneous reactivities of hematite-surfactant mixtures were significantly different due to the presence of different surfactants. Under dry conditions, heterogeneous reactivities decreased with the increase of their concentrations, but the higher reactivities were observed at an appropriate concentration range of CTAB and SDS when compared to pure hematite, showing their promoting effects at this concentration range. Under the condition of 58% relative humidity, the heterogeneous reactivities increased first and then decreased with the increasing mass fractions of CTAB and SDS, but pure hematite showed the highest reactivity. While the mixtures containing Triton X-100 had stronger ability to suppress sulfate formation under 58% RH than under dry condition, though these mixtures under 58% RH presented same trend as under dry condition. Water molecules can renew surface reactive sites and promote sulfate formation at an appropriate mass fraction of CTAB or SDS, water molecules can also promote the adsorption mode transition of Triton X-100 from adsorption through terminal OH groups to adsorption through ethoxyl groups, resulting in more surface active sites being covered and a drastically decrease in the reactivity. A Corresponding possible mechanism for the impact of surfactants on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite is proposed, and atmospheric implications based on these results are discussed.

AB Black carbon (BC) influences the global radiation budget and adversely affects air quality and human health. Removal of BC from the atmosphere can mitigate these effects. Although wet deposition (rainfall) is thought to be a dominant pathway for BC removal over land and oceans, studies quantifying rainfall BC concentrations and deposition are scarce. Here, we synthesize empirical measurements of BC in rainfall conducted between 1984 and 2016 from sites around the world. Data from 20 peer-reviewed publications and 42 unique sites were compiled. All observations were from the northern hemisphere, with the vast majority located in mid-latitudes with medium to high annual rainfall. Differences in rainfall BC concentrations and deposition among urban, rural, and remote sites were examined. Annual rainfall BC concentrations ranged 120-fold, from 2.8 mu g L-1 at a remote site to 333 mu g L-1 at an urban site, while annual BC deposition ranged 16-fold from 0.014 mg m(-2) d(-1) at a remote site to 0.22 mg m(-2) d(-1) at an urban site. The small number of observations, high measurement variability, and location relative to coast appeared to mask the effects of land use on BC in rainfall. However, characteristic seasonal patterns in BC concentrations and/or deposition were found for geographic regions with similar rainfall patterns, BC emission sources, and air mass trajectories. Annual rainfall BC deposition across sites was comparable to modeled estimates for the global oceans, but BC concentrations were somewhat higher than those measured in surface snow at central North American sites. Neither tropical regions nor urban areas (BC-emission hotspots) were well represented in the dataset, highlighting fundamental gaps in understanding of rainfall BC deposition. More extensive monitoring of rainfall BC deposition is imperative to develop improved global climate and carbon cycling models.

AB During wintertime, Salt Lake City experiences periods of high-pressure atmospheric stagnation that leads to prolonged periods with stable atmospheric boundary layers (ABL) due to the unique orography of the region. These atmospheric conditions typically lead to persistent cold air pool (PCAP) events, where the stable ABL remains over several days, degrading air quality in the Salt Lake Valley. In this work, we applied novel source apportionment methods to identify sources that were the greatest contributors to elevated secondary PM2.5 concentrations during PCAP events in winter 2007. A source-oriented modeling approach that relies on emissions inventory data (i.e., source-specific data) was utilized for source characterization. A correction was applied to chemical transport model (CTM) outputs to improve the estimates of source contributions to secondary PM2.5 components (organic carbon, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium). As a result, gasoline vehicles (25%), natural gas combustion (21%), and other sources (29%) were identified as the largest sources of nitrate, which was the dominant aerosol component during the PCAP periods ((NO3-](max) = 37.5 mu g m(-3)). Further, receptor-oriented source apportionment modeling was conducted using the chemical mass balance method with gas constraints (CMB-GC) with location-specific, mathematically optimized PM2.5 source profiles to examine the multi-year trend in PCAP pollution. These optimized profiles were enhanced by integrating the initial guess profiles with (FM results and observations. CMB-GC was applied for the period 2007-2015 at an urban monitor, and the use of seasonally varying optimized source profiles improved results by resolving more mass than when using static source profiles, increasing the predicted-observed PM2.5 mass ratio from 0.91 to 1.03. The averaged biomass burning impacts exhibited the most significant change, increasing from an average of 0.85 to 1.87 mu g m(-3) when using the static profiles and the optimized profiles, respectively. The static and optimized CMB-GC results were similar for secondary components but differed slightly for mobile impacts. Stratification of PCAP vs. non-PCAP CMB-GC source impacts revealed that the dominant sources of PM2.5 varied under the two meteorological conditions.

AB Traditional air monitoring approaches using regulatory monitors have historically been used to assess regional-scale trends in air pollutants across large geographical areas. Recent advances in air pollution sensor technologies could provide additional information about nearby sources, support the siting of regulatory monitoring stations, and improve our knowledge of finer-scale spatiotemporal variation of ambient air pollutants and their associated health effects. Sensors are now being developed that are much smaller and lower cost than traditional ambient air monitoring systems and are capable of being deployed as a network to provide greater coverage of a given area. The CitySpace project conducted by the US EPA and the Shelby County Health Department included the deployment of a network of 17 sensor pods using Alphasense OPC-N2 particulate matter (PM) sensors integrated with meteorological sensors in Memphis, TN for six months. Sensor pods were collocated with a federal equivalent method (FEM) tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) monitor both before and after the primary study period. Six of the sensor pods were found to meet the data quality objective (DQO) of coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.5 when collocated with the TEOM. Seven pods were decommissioned before the end of the study due to mechanical failure. The six pods meeting the DQO were used to examine the spatiotemporal variability of fine PM (PM2.5) across the Memphis area. One site was found to have higher relative PM(2.5 )concentrations when compared to the other sites in the network. The 1-min data from this sensor pod were evaluated to quantify the regional urban background and local-scale contributions to PM2.5 at that monitoring location. This method found that approximately 20% of the PM2.5 was attributed to local sources at this location, compared to 9% at a local regulatory monitoring site. Additionally, the 1-min data were combined with 1-min wind speed and wind direction data to examine potential sources in the area using the nonparametric trajectory analysis (NTA) technique. This method geographically identified local source areas that contributed to the measured concentrations at the high reading sensor location throughout the course of the study.

AB Dust emissions due to wind erosion have significant impacts on air quality, climate, and biogeochemical processes. Arid and semi-arid regions in Northern China are a major contributor to global dust emissions. However, how dust emissions affect soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient losses in this region are poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of SOC and nutrient (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) losses in spring using a process-based dust emission model in Northern China during 1982-2011. Spatial patterns of SOC and nutrient losses are consistent with dust emission rates across the research region. Annual losses of SOC, TN, and TP resulted from wind erosion in spring were 0.985 +/- 0.149 Tg yr(-1), 0.094 +/- 0.014 Tg yr(-1), and 0.089 +/- 0.013 Tg yr(-1), respectively. Two distinct periods with opposite trends were identified in dust emissions and SOC and nutrient losses, declining from 1982 to 1997 and then increasing. The opposite patterns in Northern China are largely attributed to the changes in vegetation growth due to climate change and shifts of green-up date of vegetation. The findings could help to reduce the uncertainties in simulating regional biogeochemical cycling in Northern China.

AB During the summer of 2012 a coordinated field campaign was conducted in multiple locations in Greece in order to characterize the ambient particulate matter (PM) levels, its chemical composition and the contribution of the regional and local sources. PM1, PM2.(5) and PM10 samples were collected simultaneously at seven different sites in Greece: an urban and a suburban station in Patras, a suburban station in Thessaloniki, a suburban and an urban background station in Athens, a rural background station at the Navarino Environmental Observatory (NEO) in southwestern Peloponnese and a remote background site at Finokalia in the northeastern part of Crete. The sites were selected to facilitate the estimation of the contribution of the local emission sources and long range transport.
   Sulfate and organics were the major PM1 components in all sites suggesting that high sulfate levels still remain in parts of Europe. The photochemistry of the Eastern Mediterranean can convert rapidly the emitted sulphur dioxide to sulfate. Our analysis indicated significant sulfate production over the area, with high sulfate levels, especially in the remote site of Finokalia, associated with air masses that had passed over Turkey. There was high regional secondary organic aerosol production dominating organic aerosol levels even in a major city like Athens. High organic aerosol levels were associated with air masses that had crossed the Balkans with a significant biogenic component. The average PM2.(5) concentration ranged from 13 to 18 mu g m(-3) in the different sites. There were unexpected significant gradients in the concentrations of secondary aerosol components in length scales of a few hundred kilometers. The low concentrations of measured PM2.5 nitrate are mostly organic nitrates and supermicrometer nitrate associated with sea-salt and dust. Dust was a significant PK10 constituent in all areas and was quite variable in space showing the importance of the local sources.

AB Summertime bulk and size-segregated cloud water samples were collected in 2014 at the summit of Mount Tai (Mt. Tai, 1534 m a.s.l.) in the North China Plain to investigate the concentrations, size distributions and stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta C-13) of dicarboxylic acids, oxoacids and a-dicarbonyls as well as fluorescence properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Positive correlations were observed for Peaks A (terrestrial humiclike), M (marine humic-like) and T (protein-like) with diacids and related compounds (r(2) >= 0.43), except for Peak M and alpha-dicarbonyls, illustrating that fluorescent components and dicarboxylic acids were derived from common biological origins and biomass burning. Oxalic acid (C-2, 2080 mu g L-1) was the dominant diacid in this study, followed by succinic (C-4, 640 mu g L-1) and glyoxylic (omega C-2, 448 mu g L-1) acids. Compared to organic precursors, the relatively negative delta C-13 values of C-2 ( -18.8 parts per thousand), glyoxylic acid (omega C-2, -16.6 parts per thousand), pyruvic acid (Pyr, - 21.5 parts per thousand) and methylglyoxal (MeGly, - 19.6 parts per thousand) supported that C-2, Pyr, omega C-2 and MeGly were formed via the oxidation of C-13-enriched organic precursors in aqueous phase. Furthermore, the larger size (22 mu m) of cloud droplet was associated with more abundant organic compounds in general, which might be caused by scavenging ability and condensation of aerosol particles on the larger surface of large droplets. Our study suggested that high loadings of diacids and related compounds in cloud water over Mt. Tai were involved with emissions from anthropogenic and biological sources, followed by photochemical formation during the long-range atmospheric transport.

AB Despite being recognized as an important part of particulate matter (PM) air pollution and health risk, bioaerosols have not been quantified as extensively as other PM components for establishing PM standards and management strategies. The challenge lies partly in the lack of practical measurement methods. This study evaluated a filter-based, direct-staining fluorescence microscopy (DS-FM) method that may be adapted to routine air quality monitoring for bioaerosol concentration and size distribution. Through testing with bioaerosol standards made of bacterial cells and fungal spores, the method is shown to have precision, accuracy, detection limit, and dynamic range suitable for most ambient environments. DS-FM was demonstrated with PM samples from an arid urban location in Las Vegas, Nevada during the spring allergy season. Detectable bioaerosols ranged from 0.37 to 16 mu m in geometric diameter and averaged 0.27 +/- 0.23 cm(-3) in number concentration with about 2/3 and 1/3 in the fine (<= 2.5 mu m) and coarse (> 2.5 mu m) mode, respectively. The bioaerosol mass, estimated from the size distribution and an assumed density, was mainly in the coarse mode and accounted for 17 +/- 11% of PM10, 20 +/- 13% of PM10-2.5, and 4 +/- 3% of PM2.5 mass. Rain and high wind speeds appeared to elevate bioaerosol levels. Other advantages of DS-FM include low sample consumption and short turnaround times; a large amount of data can be generated by incorporating the measurement into current long-term air quality networks. Suggestions for using the data to inform bioaerosol origins, contributions, and public health impacts are discussed.

AB Open burning is a widely practiced method of solid waste disposal in many regions of the world and represents a significant source of air pollution. Black carbon (BC) is a particularly serious air pollutant emitted from the uncontrolled burning of waste in open fires because it has a global warming potential (GWP) up to 5000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) and is also linked to detrimental health impacts. However, few quantitative measurements of BC from open burning have been completed to establish the extent and impacts of this emission source on the environment. Emission factors (EFs) for BC from burning mixed solid waste samples were measured in the laboratory based on waste compositions in a representative developing country (Mexico). Black carbon EFs were also derived for individual waste types, including: green waste, different types of plastics, textiles and paper and cardboard. Individual waste BC EFs were combined using waste composition data from different areas of the world to estimate regional and global BC emissions from this source. The results demonstrated that BC emissions from open burning of waste have a significant climate impact, equivalent to 2-10% of global CO(2)Eq emissions. Global BC CO(2)Eq emissions from burning waste are 2-8 times larger compared to methane (CH4) CO(2)Eq emissions arising from the decomposition of equivalent amounts of combustible biodegradable waste disposed at dumpsites. Action to reduce open burning of waste would have a significant and immediate benefit to improving air quality and reducing the potential impact on climate change.

AB The current compliance networks of automatic air-quality monitoring stations in large urban environments are not sufficient to provide spatial and temporal measurement resolution for realistic assessment of personal exposure to pollutants. Small low-cost sensor platforms with greater mobility and expected lower maintenance costs, are increasingly being used as a supplement to compliance monitoring stations. However, low-cost sensor platforms usually provide data with uncertain precision. To improve the precision, these sensor platforms require in-field calibration. Our paper aims to demonstrate that data from each individual sensor system can be corrected using that sensor system's own data to achieve much improved data quality compared to a reference. However, in this procedure, there are practical difficulties such as individual sensor outputs from the multi-sensor system not being sufficiently available due to malfunctions for instance. We explore how this can be dealt with. In our opinion, this is a novel approach, of practical importance both to users and manufacturers. We present a detailed comparative analysis of Linear Regression (univariate), Multivariate Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks used with a specific aim of calibrating field-deployed low-cost CO and O-3 sensors. For Artificial Neural Network models, the performance of three common training algorithms was compared Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient back-propagation and Conjugate Gradient Powell-Beale algorithm). Data for this study were obtained from two campaigns conducted with 25 multi-sensor AQMESH v.3.5 platforms used within the activities of the CM-SENSE project. The platforms were co-located to reference gas monitors at the Automatic Monitoring Station Stan Grad, in Belgrade, Serbia. This paper demonstrates that Multivariate Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network calibration models can improve the output signal. This improvement can be measured by changes in the median and interquartile ranges of statistical parameters used for model evaluation. Artificial Neural Networks showed the best results compared to Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression models. The best predictors for CO, in addition to CO low-cost sensor data, were PM2.5 and NO2, while for O-3, in addition to O-3 low-cost sensor data, the most suitable input predictors were NO and aH. Based on residual error analysis, we have shown that for CO and O-3, a certain range of concentrations exists in which calibrated values differ by less than 10% from the reference method results. In addition, it was noted that for all models, CO sensors consistently showed lower variability between platforms compared to O-3 sensors.

AB A new method to calculate the plume rise of smoke emitted from fires is evaluated. We perform numerical simulations of the plumes originated by fires from prescribed burnings. The field experiments, carried out in August 2013 in Idaho and Washington States (USA), are considered for our simulations. In a Lagrangian particle model, we use different plume rise schemes: a simple estimated effective virtual source height, as used in the operative system; a Lagrangian approach based on a state-of-the-art equation; and the new plume rise scheme able to dynamically simulate the buoyancy due to the high temperature of the plume. Comparisons of model results with lidar ground-based measurements, aircraft data and, large eddy simulations are presented and discussed. The new plume rise scheme performs the same as the other schemes or even better in some conditions, but it does not need any a priori assumption on the dynamics of the plume or the atmospheric conditions.

AB Reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms are essential for atmospheric chemistry modeling where the use of explicit kinetic schemes is too computationally demanding. By tailoring mechanisms to specific cases, the size of the mechanism can be kept small, without significant loss of accuracy in predictions of selected species' concentrations. In the present work, we present small kinetic mechanisms tailored to specific cases, using a novel method. The reduced mechanisms are generated by applying the method to several cases previously described in the literature and their performance in box model simulations are evaluated. The characteristics of the reduced mechanisms are examined. In addition, the methods sensitivity towards time scales, choice of trace gas species of interest, and NO(x )regime are investigated. The reduced mechanisms include 10%-30% of all the reactions in the relevant subset of the detailed chemical mechanism. Simulations with the reduced mechanisms typically yield no loss in accuracy of ozone concentration predictions and less than a 10% accuracy loss for the concentration predictions of nitrogen oxides for the cases over as long as five simulated days. Mechanisms generated to predict the concentrations of few species, over short time scales, in high NOx conditions, and with no isoprene, generally include fewer reactions than mechanisms generated to predict the concentrations of several species, over long time scales, in lowNO(x) isoprene rich conditions.

AB Tropospheric Ozone (O-3) is both an air pollutant and a greenhouse gas. Predicting changes to O-3 is therefore important for both air quality and near-term climate forcing. It is computationally expensive to predict changes in tropospheric O-3 from every possible future scenario in composition climate models like those used in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Here we apply the different emission pathways used in CMIP6 with a model based on source-receptor relationships for tropospheric O-3 to predict historical and future changes in O-3 and its radiative forcing over a 300 year period (1750-2050). Changes in regional precursor emissions (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds) and global methane abundance are used to quantify the impact on tropospheric O-3 globally and across 16 regions, neglecting any impact from changes in climate. We predict large increases in global surface O-3 ( + 8 ppbv) and O-3 radiative forcing ( + 0.3 W m(-2)) over the industrial period. Nine different Shared Socio-economic Pathways are used to assess future changes in O-3. Scenarios involving weak air pollutant controls and climate mitigation are inadequate in limiting the future degradation of surface O-3 air quality and enhancement of near-term climate warming over all regions. Middle-ofthe-road and strong mitigation scenarios reduce both surface O-3 concentrations and O-3 radiative forcing by up to 5 ppbv and 0.17 W m(-2) globally, providing benefits to future air quality and near-term climate forcing. Sensitivity experiments show that targeting mitigation measures towards reducing global methane abundances could yield additional benefits for both surface O-3 air quality and near-term climate forcing. The parameterisation provides a valuable tool for rapidly assessing a large range of future emission pathways that involve differing degrees of air pollutant and climate mitigation. The calculated range of possible responses in tropospheric O-3 from these scenarios can be used to inform other modelling studies in CMIP6.

TI Meteorological drivers and mortality associated with O-3 and PM2.5 air

AB In this study we examine the meteorological drivers resulting in concurrent high levels of ozone (O-3) and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) during two five-day air pollution episodes in 2006 (1st - 5th July and 18th - 22nd July) using an air quality model (AQUM) at 12 km horizontal resolution to simulate air pollutant concentrations. The resultant UK health burden associated with short-term exposure to simulated maximum daily 8-h O-3 (MDA8 O-3) and daily mean PM2.5 is estimated at the national and regional level.
   Both episodes were found to be driven by anticyclonic conditions with light easterly and south easterly winds and high temperatures that aided pollution build up in the UK. The estimated total mortality burden associated with short-term exposure to MDA8 O-3 is similar during the chosen episodes with about 70 daily deaths brought forward (summed across the UK) during the first and second episode, respectively. The estimated health burden associated with short-term exposure to daily mean PM2.5 concentrations differs between the first and second episode resulting in about 43 and 36 daily deaths brought forward, respectively. The corresponding percentage of all-cause mortality due to short-term exposure to MDA8 O-3 and daily mean PM2.5 during these two episodes and across the UK regions, ranges from 3.4% to 5.2% and from 1.6% to 3.9%, respectively. The attributable percentage of all-cause mortality differs between the regions depending on the pollution levels in each episode, but the overall estimated health burdens are highest in regions with higher population totals. We estimate that during these episodes the short-term exposure to MDA8 O-3 and daily mean PM2.5 is between 36-38% and 39-56% higher, respectively, than if the pollution levels represented typical seasonal-mean concentrations. This highlights the potential of air pollution episodes to have substantial short-term impacts on public health.

AB Particle number size distribution measurements were conducted during the summer of 2012 at City-Centre Urban Background (Patras-C), Urban Background (ICE-HT in Patras, DEM in Athens, EPT in Thessaloniki), and Regional Background stations (FIN in Crete). At the City-Centre Urban Background station, the average number distribution had a geometric mean diameter peak approximately at 60 nm and the highest number concentration, whereas at the Regional Background station and the Urban Background stations it displayed a major peak approximately at 100 nm, with the Regional Background station exhibiting the lowest number concentration. The particle number size distribution at each site was divided into size fractions and, based on their diurnal variation and previous studies, we concluded that the main sources for the City-Centre Urban Background station are traffic and the regional background concentration, for the Urban Background stations fresh traffic, aged traffic, cooking and the regional background concentration, and for the Regional Background station local activities (tourism, cooking) and regional background concentration. The median number concentration that is attributed to regional background concentration for the City-Centre Urban Background, the Urban Background and the Regional Background stations are respectively 13, 29 and 45% of the total number concentration. Nucleation events were identified at DEM station, where the newly formed particles accounted for 4% of the total particle concentration for the measurement period in the size range 10-20 nrn, EPT, where they accounted for 12%, and FIN, where they accounted for 1%, respectively. New Particle Formation events contribution during summer to Condensation Cloud Nuclei were therefore insignificant in the Eastern Mediterranean. Modal analysis was performed on the number distributions and the results were classified in clusters. At the City-Centre Urban Background station, the cluster-source that dominated number concentration and frequency is related to fresh and aged traffic emissions, at the Urban Background stations aged traffic emissions, while at the Regional Background station number and frequency were dominated by the regional background concentration. Based on cluster analysis, 18% of the median number distribution was due to long range transport at the City-Centre Urban Background site, 37% at the Urban Background sites, and 59% at the Regional Background site. The Flexible Particle Dispersion Model (FLEXPART) was used in order to acquire geographic origin clusters and we concluded that the Etesian flow increases the median regional background number concentration in the Mediterranean basin by a factor of 2.5-4.

AB Continuous measurements of the mass concentrations of composite (MT) and Black Carbon (MB) aerosols were carried out on-board an Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV) Sagar Kanya (cruise number - SK345) during its cruise (from 16 January to 13 February, 2018) over the southeastern Arabian Sea and equatorial Indian Ocean as a part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB-2018). In general, mass concentrations of aerosols during the cruise period of northern hemispheric winter were found to be high over the southeastern Arabian Sea (M-T > 50 mu g m(-3); M-B > 3 mu g m(-3)), which gradually reduced to low values over the far oceanic regions of equatorial Indian Ocean (M-T < 20 mu g m(-3); M-B < 1 mu g m(-3)). Aerosol mass size distributions were bimodal in nature having a prominent accumulation mode over both near coastal and far oceanic regions. Interestingly, BC mass fraction (F-BC) also showed significant higher values (3.7%) at the far oceanic equatorial Indian Ocean, indicating the continental anthropogenic influence even in the remote environment. Over the near coastal locations of Arabian Sea, F-BC increased significantly during the return phase of the cruise after a rainfall event. Considering latitudinal gradient between 15 degrees N and 2 degrees S, within the longitude sector of 65 degrees E to 75 degrees E, both M-T and M-B showed a scaling distance of 17.08 degrees and 14.28 degrees respectively. Investigation of the long-term temporal change of M-T and M-B over the experimental domain indicates that the values observed in the present study are significantly higher than those reported elsewhere two decades back, which is very significant over the Arabian Sea.

AB We present direct room-temperature vapour pressure measurements for eight semi-volatile n-alkanes of atmospheric importance. Measured vapour pressures range from 8.4 +/- 1.6 x 10(-3) Pa for C-17, to 1.7 +/- 0.6 x 10(-8) Pa for C-31. The new measurements for C-17-C-18 are in reasonable agreement but at the lower end of values in the literature; the new measurements for C-28 and C-31 are one-to-two orders of magnitude higher than most literature values, but six orders of magnitude higher than the lowest values in the literature. Our measurements are suitable for atmospheric aerosol modelling and interpretation of environmental measurements, interpolated in carbon number where necessary, and extrapolated over temperatures relevant to the atmospheric boundary layer using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation with literature values of the enthalpy of vaporisation.

AB The adverse health effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) highlight the need of spatiotemporal models to assess exposure for epidemiological studies. Herein, a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model was developed to estimate the spatial variability of the VOCs, including acetone, benzene, toluene, and m/p-xylene in Yangpu (YP) District, Shanghai, China. The GTWR model shows a good prediction performance, with cross-validation (CV) R-2 = 0.60, 0.75, 0.64, and 0.62 for acetone, benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, respectively. Moreover, the GTWR model outperforms the ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and temporally weighted regression (TWR) model in terms of higher CV R(2 )and lower CV root mean square error (RMSE) values. The 100 m x 100 m gridded concentrations of acetone, benzene, toluene and m/p-xylene estimated from the GTWR model range from 1.57 to 2.57 ppbv, 0.24-1.06 ppbv, 0.40-1.56 ppbv, and 0.31-1.05 ppbv, respectively. Among them, the concentrations of acetone, toluene and m/p-xylene are far below the thresholds of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), whereas the benzene concentrations are higher than that of the USEPA's standard by 2-10 times. The VOC emissions are closely associated with transportation, industrial activities, commercial activities, and the release from recreational areas. The lifetime cancer risk (LCR) of benzene for juveniles, adults and elderly are in the range of 2.3 x 10(-5)- 0.98 x 10(-5), 3.1 x 10(-5)-1.4 x 10(-4), and 3.7 x 10(-5)-1.6 x 10(-4), respectively, indicating potential and high cancer risks to human health. The integrated non-cancer risks (HQ) of four VOC species are far below the safe level (= 1), suggesting a negligible non-cancer risk for residents living in YP District.

AB This study proposes a new monitoring method to measure real-time aerosol chloride deposition. The concept of a water candle device is introduced, and the device is manufactured. By continuously generating a thin water film in combination with a conductivity sensor, the device is capable of measuring aerosol chloride deposition in all directions and has a compact design. The water candle device was fully tested in the laboratory and applied to monitor on a bridge. For the laboratory tests, the transport of aerosol in an area near the seashore was simulated to evaluate the accuracy and responsiveness of the device according to the variable wind speed and source salt concentration. For monitoring in the field, the device was implemented at the Thuan Phuoc Bridge, Vietnam, for seven days with a short recording frequency of a few hours. A set of wet candle devices were placed next to the water candle device to compare the results of the two methods. The results of the laboratory test and field monitoring demonstrated a high accuracy and responsiveness of the water candle device to variations in the wind speed and salt concentration of the source. Further, there were only very small differences between the results from the wet and water candle devices.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are important drivers of atmospheric chemical composition and accurate model simulations require characterization of the emissions associated with specific vegetation types which is typically determined using enclosure measurements. Static enclosure techniques were used for past BVOC emission measurement studies, especially in the 1960s-1980s, but are no longer widely used because of concerns that the resulting emission rates are not representative. The main advantages of the static approach are the capability for rapid measurements and a lower detection limit that enables the use of less sensitive analytical techniques. We evaluate a version of the static approach which we call the semi-static approach. In order to evaluate the performance of the semi-static approach for BVOCs emission measurements, multiple replicate measurements for different plants were conducted in a laboratory growth chamber using both semi-static and dynamic enclosure techniques. Variability of replicate measurements was calculated and the results from the two techniques were compared. The semi-static technique provided consistent measurements for isoprene but not for alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and other compounds that are stored in leaves. The measured isoprene emission factors were much higher than dynamic measurements. There were a large number of compounds to be detected by dynamic technique that could not be detected by the semi-static technique. But the semi-static technique could still provide qualitative information on categorization of non, low and high emitters for some compounds.

AB Dynamic responses of soil microbial properties of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to elevated ozone concentration have never been quantified. In this study, the winter wheat was cultivated under two contrasting ozone treatments: non-filtered ambient air (hereinafter called NF) and elevated ozone (effective increase in 9-h mean ozone concentration of 34.91 +/- 1.42 nL.L-1 (mean +/- SE) above ambient, hereinafter called EO3). Linear regressions between the response ratio of each variable (i.e. EO3/NF) and the increments of exposure- or flux-based ozone indices (i.e. EO3 - NF) were conducted. The results showed that the response ratios of soil microbial biomass C and N, as well as cumulative CO2 and N2O effluxes significantly correlated with the increments of ozone indices. The Delta POD0 (increment of integrated phytotoxic ozone dose with no threshold) and the Delta AOT40 (increment of accumulated hourly O-3 concentrations over a threshold of 40 nL.L-1) performed better than Delta SUM06, Delta W126 and the increments of other flux-based ozone indices. They showed stronger linear relationships with soil microbial biomass than that with gas effluxes. The expanded deviations from the effect-free line indicated distinct cumulative detrimental ozone impacts on soil microbial properties. Ammonia nitrogen content and nitrite reductase activity showed non-significantly adaptive and self-adjustment responses to accumulative ozone stress. The ozone dose-response relationships obtained here will benefit the ecological modeling that evaluates the dynamic responses or predicts the feedback effects of sustainable agro-ecosystems under global climate change.

AB Heavy air pollution attacked Beijing and its surrounding areas in January of 2013, which attracted large attentions from around the world. In this study, we conducted highly time-resolved measurements of inorganic ions associated with PM2.5 at an urban site in Beijing during this period. We applied the curve fitting method, the quantile regression model and the probability function model to evaluate the relationship between secondary inorganic ions (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, SNA) and meteorological parameters (relative humidity (RH) and temperature). In our model results, RH was regarded as one of the key factors of high concentrations of SNA, and high level of RH would enhance the concentrations of SNA. In addition, the effect of temperature was also important and noticeable. We further constructed a probability function model to investigate the joint effects of RH and temperature. The model results showed higher RH and a temperature of approximately -5 degrees C (-4 similar to-6 degrees C for sulfate and nitrate; -5 similar to-7 degrees C for ammonium) would be the most suitable conditions for the high concentrations of SNA during the air pollution episodes in Beijing.

AB Regional transport always plays a crucial role in the formation and dissipation of haze over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. This study, conducted using pollution and meteorological observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), investigated the possible meteorological causes for the occurrence of haze pollution and quantitatively assessed the PM2.5 transport contribution to haze episodes that occurred in Beijing in January and July 2015. The results indicated that modeling system reproduced the spatial-temporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region well. During the study period, haze episodes were primarily attributed to meteorological conditions such as planetary boundary layer height, relative humidity, wind vector, and temperature inversion, in the context of pollution emissions. Analysis of surface PM2.5 transport showed that 62.89% of the surface PM2.5 in Beijing was came from local emissions, with the remaining 23.69% and 13.42%, on average, originating from short- and long-range transport during the study period. The percentage of contribution varied with the evolutionary stage of the haze episodes, showing the joint influence of local emissions and regional transport on haze pollution in Beijing. Additionally, investigation of vertical PM2.5 transport identified the following three major pathways: a northwest-southeast pathway in January (at all layers below 1200 m, though it was stronger above 600 m), a southeast-northwest pathway in July (at all layers below 800 m), and a southwest-northeast pathway during both months (at a height of 200-1200 m). Moreover, the magnitude of daily PM2.5 transport fluxes during the haze episodes was generally stronger than the corresponding monthly average. These results provide a scientific basis for strategic control of both multiple cities and provinces and in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms and sources of haze pollution in the BTH region.

TI Extreme levels and chemistry of PM from the consumer fireworks in the

SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article

ID PARTICULATE
AB Mass concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM) in New-Year's nights can be high in the Netherlands because of the unconstrained use of consumer fireworks. In the study presented here the chemical compounds of the PM were determined. It is for the first time that this information was used to deduced the average composition of the explosive mixture/black powder. Measurements were made during the turn of the year 2007-2008 at an urban background location, when hourly PM10 mass concentrations exceeded 2000 mu g m(-3) at street sites. These extreme levels were due to the stagnant weather conditions occurring that night. The on-line artefact-free "MARGA" was deployed for assessment of the major compounds. These were found to be the (hygroscopic) salts KCl, MgSO4 and K2SO4. The mass ratio of sulphur and potassium showed that a standard black powder mix is used as explosive. The potassium was for 65% present as KCl. This is the reduction product of the oxidiser KClO4, which is hence the main oxidiser. The rest of the potassium was present in the form of K2SO4. We proved that this compound derives from the "standard" oxidiser KNO3 of black powder. The formation of the SO42--salts is explained as follows. The sulphur in the black powder oxidises to H2SO4. This compound reacts with the reduction product of the KNO3 to K2SO4. MgSO4 forms in a reaction of the main colouring agent magnesium with the H2SO4. The full composition of the PM, including carbonaceous material and trace metals, was obtained from an analysis of 24-hr filter samples. This showed that the mentioned salts comprised about half of the mass, while almost all of the remainder is "carbon" deriving from the incomplete combustion of the cardboard wrapping. About 85% of the PM10 is in the more harmful PM2.5.

AB Atmospheric aerosol particles exert significant influence on the earth's radiation budget, and accurate measurement of aerosol optical properties can help reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing. Therefore, year-round measurements of aerosol optical properties from August 2016 to July 2017 at an urban site in Beijing were analysed. The results show that the annual mean scattering coefficient (sigma(sp) at 550 nm, 131 +/- 135 Mm(-1)) was approximately half of the measurement in Beijing from 2008 to 2009 and from 2005 to 2006, mainly due to the reduction of PM2.5 and scattering aerosols in recent years. Meanwhile, annual mean of sigma(abs) (637 nm) and SSA was 14 +/- 11 Mm(-1) and 0.85 +/- 0.06, respectively. Seasonally, sigma(sp) during winter was approximately two times higher than in other seasons, while sigma(abs) was higher during autumn and winter, which may be attributed to biomass and fossil fuel burning under a shallow and stable boundary layer. Diurnal variation of sigma(sp) showed an evening peak and a slight morning peak in spring and summer, as well as a night peak in autumn and winter. ag, in four seasons were basically unimodal, with a morning peak in spring and summer, and a night peak in autumn and winter. In addition, the scattering Angstrom exponent and bacicscattering Angstrom exponent suggested the dominance of micro-size aerosols. Seasonal variations of SAE, BAE and the backscatter fraction indicated a larger proportion of isotropic scattering and fine-mode particles in summer and autumn, as well as a dominance of coarse particles in spring and a complicated aerosol type distribution and emission sources in winter. Furthermore, radiative forcing was estimated by a radiative transfer model. Radiative forcing varied between -6.69 and -235.67 Wm(-2) (with the average of -54.93 +/- 39.92 Wm(-2)) at the surface, with a mean of 35.56 +/- 22.88 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere.

AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one of the world's most sensitive areas for climate change, but the lack of information on light-absorption by aerosols limits the understanding of climate forcing feedbacks. Here, the contributions of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) to light absorption and radiative forcing were investigated. Absorption Angstrom exponents (alpha), mass absorption cross sections (MAC), and absorption coefficients (b(abs)) for selected wavelengths were measured for a year of aerosol samples collected at Lulang on the southeast TP. Aerosol absorption at all wavelengths was strongest in the pre-monsoon when levoglucosan, a biomass burning indicator, was elevated. The contributions of BC, BrC, and dust to b(abs) were decoupled. Results showed that dust contributed 8.5% to the total light absorption at 405 nm and 3.9% 808 nm. A two-component model indicated that BC and BrC contributed 48.7% and 44.0% to total b(abs) at 405 nm but BrC had a smaller effect at middle visible wavelengths. Elevated b(abs,non-dust,BC) and b(abs,non-dust,BrC) and a high alpha(BrC) but low alpha(aerosol) values in the pre-monsoon were attributed to biomass burning, which produces not only BrC but also BC which has a much lower a value. Average non-dust MACs for BC and BrC at 405 nm were 6.1 +/- 2.8 and 0.72 +/- 0.55 m(2) g(-1), respectively. Nonparametric statistical tests showed that the MAC(non-dustBC) was relatively constant but MAC(non-dust, BrC) was more variable. In addition, BrC was correlated with non-dust b(abs,BC) and MAC(non-dust,BC) in winter and the pre-monsoon, implying BrC and BC shared sources in those two seasons, but lower correlations in the monsoon and post-monsoon suggest that a mixture of sources impacted BrC (e.g., biogenic emission, secondary formation, etc.). Finally, the relative contributions of BrC to BC for radiative forcing from 405 to 808 nm were 29.4 +/- 9.5% with no remarkable seasonal differences, confirming the importance of BrC to light absorption in the near UV throughout the year. As a result, the BrC absorption is an important additional factor which needs to be considered in atmospheric models, although the atmospheric heating by BC seems to be a larger climate forcer in this region.

AB In this study, we estimated the contribution of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) to aerosol light absorption from surface in-situ and aerosol robotic network (AERONET) columnar observations. The mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of BC (MAC(BC)) was estimated to be 6.4 +/- 1.5 m(2) g(-1) at 565 mn from in-situ aerosol measurements at Gosan Climate Observatory (GCO), Korea, in January 2014, which was lower than those observed in polluted urban areas. A BrC MAC of 0.62 +/- 0.06 m(2) g(-1) (565 mn) in our estimate is approximately ten times lower than MACK at 565 nm. The contribution of BC and BrC to the carbonaceous aerosol absorption coefficient at 565 nm from the in-situ measurements was estimated at 88.1 +/- 7.4% and 11.9 +/- 7.4%, respectively at GCO. Similarly, the contribution of BC and BrC to the absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) for carbonaceous aerosol (CA), constrained by AERONET observations at 14 sites over East Asia by using different spectral dependences of the absorption (i.e., absorption Angstrom exponent) of BC and BrC, was 84.9 +/- 2.8% and 15.1 +/- 2.8% at 565 nm, respectively. The contribution of BC to CA AAOD was greater in urban sites than in the background areas, whereas the contribution of BrC to CA AAOD was higher in background sites. The overall contribution of BC to CA AAOD decreased by 73%-87% at 365 nm, and increased to 93%-97% at 860 nm. The contribution of BrC to CA AAOD decreased significantly with increasing wavelength from approximately 17% at 365 nm to 4% at 860 nm.

AB Diesel trucks contribute significantly to emissions leading to deterioration in urban air quality. Many recent studies have attempted to quantify real-world emissions from trucks in cities. However, studies on real-world emission from trucks in India are scarce. In this study, we measured real-world emissions of gaseous pollutants (CO, HC, and NO) from twenty trucks of different sizes and emission standards. The trucks were classified into three categories (light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs), medium-duty diesel trucks (MDDTs), and heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs)) based on their gross vehicle weight (GVW). The tested trucks conformed to Bharat Stage (BS) II, BS HI, and BS N emission standards. A vehicle specific power (VSP) based approach was adopted to model the relationship between vehicle activity and emissions. In addition, real-world emission factors of CO, HC, and NO for all the truck types were determined and compared based on their emission standard. Considerable reductions in emission factors were observed from lower to higher emission control standards for all the pollutants. The CO, HC and NO emission factors from the BS II standard LDDTs were 8.05 g/km, 0.86 g/km, and 8.04 g/km, respectively. The CO emission factor decreased by 29% and 65% respectively, for LDDTs and MDDTs with improved emission standards. The HC emissions (g/km) reduction from BS II to BS III for LDDTs and HDDTs were 49% and 8%, respectively. In the case of MDDTs, HC emission factor reduced by 16% from BS H to BS N. On comparing with ARAI emission standards, we found that the emission factors of the trucks with GVW less than 3500 kg were higher for all the pollutants. In the case of trucks with GVW greater than 3500 kg, the CO emission factor for BS II and BS III complying trucks were higher than standard values while HC emission factors were lower than the standard values. Further, the emission factors of CO and NO from BS N standard trucks were higher than the standard values. Moreover, emission factor values from our study were higher than that reported in the literature. Although India aims to adopt BS VI emission standards by 2020, phasing out older vehicles will be the key to mitigate emissions from diesel vehicles.

AB In the United States, industrial compounds are routinely transported by rail in pressurized vessels, often near urban areas. A rupture of a vessel, for example due to a derailment, can result in the rapid release of a liquid-aerosol-gas mixture. The health consequences of such a release, especially close to population centers, are not well understood. To address this question, a series of controlled experimental releases of pressurized chlorine (Cl-2) was conducted at the Dugway Proving Ground (Dugway, Utah). Each trial consisted of the sudden breach of a tank containing at least 4,500 kg (kg) of pressurized liquid Cl-2. In this paper, we report on measured Cl-2 concentrations in three test structures downwind of the release. Based on these data, we estimate the indoor-outdoor exchange, transport through a multi-room structure, and the first-order loss rate due to reaction or sorption. This loss rate is particularly important for consequence assessment. For example, in a mobile office with a ventilation rate of about three air changes per hour, the reaction loss rate was approximately 2.5 h(-1). This accounts for a nearly 20 percent reduction in toxic load to indoor occupants. Finally, the paper discusses the modeling and analysis of a typical urban hazard assessment.

AB Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is one of the common allergic diseases, which may be influenced by environmental factors. This study was to examine the association between the first occurrence of AC, air pollution and weather changes, and demographic factors in Taiwan. A total of 100,636 eligible subjects were identified from the systematic sampling cohort database containing 1,000,000 insureds of the National Health Insurance of Taiwan from 2004 to 2013, and were matched with data from the environmental monitoring stations adjacent to their locations of clinics. The case-crossover design, using the same subjects experiencing exposures at the time of diagnosis for cases and that on the days one and two weeks before and after diagnosis for controls, was applied in the study. We found that the first occurrences of AC were significantly the most for youngsters by age (42.6%), for women by sex (56.2%), and in spring by season (29.6%) (P < 0.001). Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses indicated that nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), and temperature were positively associated with AC (P < 0.001), while relative humidity was negatively related to AC (P < 0.001). Knowing these associations, we suggest that AC patients pay attention to air pollution and weather change in the ambient environments and manage accordingly to mitigate the problems.

AB Due to the local emissions and transportations of air pollution from the most polluted regions such as the North China Plain and Yangtze Delta metropolitan, Xuzhou is becoming one of the most polluted cities in East China. The sources and formation processes of nitrogen-containing aerosols are therefore very complex. Two continuous aerosol measurement campaigns were conducted in this industrial city during the wintertime and summertime of 2016, to investigate the chemical compositions and potential sources of total nitrogen (TN, including 89% inorganic nitrogen and 11% organic nitrogen) in PM2.5. Abrupt enhancements of nitrogen-containing aerosols (e.g., NO3- and NH4+) were found in the winter, and nitrate became as a dominant contributor in high pollution days (e.g., PM2.5 > 150 mu g m(-3)). Nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR) correlated significantly with aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), which was estimated by ISORPROPIA-II model. This suggested heterogeneous process might be an important pathway in nitrate formation during the high PM2.5 days. The nitrogen isotope composition (delta N-15) in TN varied from -1.3 to + 13.2 parts per thousand with a mean value of 6.9 +/- 3.646 parts per thousand during the wintertime. An isotope-based source apportionment approach was then developed using a Bayesian isotope mixing model (SIAR) with chemical compositions as an important constrain, which improved accuracy and reduced the overall uncertainties in estimations of TN sources. From this optimized model, we identified six major sources including NH3 from combustion-related emissions (49%), NH3 derived from animal wastes (6%), NH3 from urban volatilization (3%), NOx derived from coal combustion (33%), NOx from biomass burning (5%) and NOx from vehicles (3%). Our results demonstrated that ambient NOx was dominated by coal combustion. Since NOx and NH3 are important precursors for ammonium nitrate aerosols, controlling of combustion related NOx and NH3 emissions might be an important way to reduce PM2.5 levels in this region.

AB One of the extensively used methods for aerosol mass concentration measurement is the optical filter method used in Aethalometer. Due to the aerosol loading and multi scattering effect, there are uncertainties that can lead to underestimation or overestimation of aerosol concentration and measurement of the absorption coefficient. To overcome such uncertainties, a data correction method has been adopted in the present work. During the winter, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, Aethalometer underestimated black carbon (BC) concentration by 8 +/- 1%, 11 +/- 1%, and 10.5 +/- 0.2%, due to the higher aerosol deposition. While in the monsoon season, underestimation of 5.5 +/- 2% is observed because of the presence of bigger scattering nature aerosol. For 70% of days, found a positive correlation between the compensation parameter (k(880)) and wavelengths, which indicated the dominance of the smaller aerosol particles. While 30% of days have a negative correlation due to the bigger aerosol particle. In the winter, pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, the absorption coefficient at 370 nm was 86%, 90%, and 93% higher than that of 880 nm due to the higher biomass burning emissions. The absorption Angstrom exponent (a(370-880))was 1.02 for fossil fuel burning and the corresponding k(880) was 0.0037. In the winter and post-monsoon seasons, BC emissions from fossil fuel combustion dominated over the BC emitted by biomass burning emissions with alpha(370-880) < 1.1, whereas alpha(370-880) is found to be more than 1.2 during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons due to the higher biomass burning.

AB Increasing levels of air pollution greatly affect the environment and human health; air quality control is therefore of particular importance. To improve the efficiency of air pollution control, reliable air quality models for source apportionment are critically in need. The multitude of air quality models to find the sources of air pollution, however, have their own limitations. Hence, this study seeks to integrate different air quality models, including a diffusion model (AERMOD) and a grid model (CMAQ), employing initial meteorological fields provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Using the advantages of these models, this study builds a hybrid air quality model, which provides a more effective analysis of the distribution of primary pollutants, secondary pollutants, and other environmental information. Two significant fine particulate matter (PM2.5) events were selected in this study to discuss the influence of the Taichung coal-fired power plant and the Taichung traffic source on the PM2.5 in the Taichung area, as well as to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model. Simulation results for the two cases show that if the coal-fired power loads are reduced by 20% (around 1100 MW), the concentration of PM2.5 in the Taichung area will decrease by 0.5%; such decrease will reach 1.25% when the power load reduction is 40%. If the traffic source is reduced by 20%, the concentration of PM2.5 in the Taichung area will decrease by 4.3%, and by 6.6% with 30% traffic source reduction. The hybrid model shows that the contribution of different pollution sources can be illuminated to support air quality control strategies.

AB To estimate the pollution impact of seven sample airports in California on the surrounding schools, routine high quality observations of 1-min average wind direction and speed at the airports were used to calculate the time each school within a 10-km radius was downwind of each airport. We demonstrate 0.87 correlation between pollution levels and downwind time at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Depending on the airport size, between 10 and 15 years of data was collected and downwind times calculated for the school hours throughout the school-months of August to June. By comparing this data with the 2015-2016 student enrollment size and demographics of the neighboring schools, we have demonstrated that an estimated 65,409 (8.7%) students spend 1-6 h per day at school throughout the academic year with exposure to airport-related air pollution. However, a higher proportion of economically disadvantaged students (10.6%) experience aforementioned levels of exposure. The level of exposure does not appear to be affected by the proposed 1-h delay in the school starting time that is intended to reduce student fatigue.

AB Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of most concerning air pollutants in East Asia. In order to further understand the dry deposition process of PM2.5, measurements were carried out in a cool-temperate forest located in a remote area of northern Japan. These measurements took into account the improvement of simulations by chemical transport models in this region. We measured the vertical profiles of fine (PM2.5), coarse aerosol components, HNO3, and other relevant gases using two denuder/filter-pack sampling systems together with three 4-stage filter-pack sampling systems from July 22, 2017 to August 07, 2017. The vertical profile measurements clearly showed the difference in dry deposition process between fine NO3- and fine SO42-. Concentration gradients of fine NO3- from over to under the canopy were significantly higher than those of fine SO42-. Since most of fine NO3- existed as NH4NO3, it was considered that these high gradients of NO3- were associated with the process of the conversion between NH4NO3 and HNO3/NH3. The concentration gradients of fine NO3- increased with the increase in daytime air temperature from over to under the canopy. The simulations of the thermodynamic equilibrium of NH4NO3 at canopy surface temperatures using ISORROPIA II showed that the equilibrium shift of NH4NO3 into the gas phase during the daytime hot canopy can decrease fine NO3- by approximately 9% when compared to normal atmospheric conditions. The volatilized HNO3 was most probably immediately removed by the canopy as the HNO3 concentrations near the canopy were extremely low. Therefore, the equilibrium shift enhanced the dry deposition of nitrogen within fine NO3-.

AB Over eight years have now passed since the chain of events that occurred at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) and despite this, considerable research effort continues to be expended - yielding results pertinent to understanding the conditions behind the numerous radioactivity release events. As well as investment in this extensive scientific research, great effort is also being directed to the large-scale remediadon of the radiologically-affected area and is set to continue for the foreseeable future. Central to this has been the study of the highly-volatile and high-yield fission products of cesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) and iodine (I-129 and, I-131)which were together dispersed at considerable total activities as a consequence of the accident.
   In contrast to investigating the distribution (and state) of these high -activity fission products, this study examined fragments of transition metals, rare earth elements and actinides found adhered to a diverse range of organic samples collected from localities across the radiologically contaminated Fukushima Prefecture. As well as varying enormously in their elemental composition, the entrapped particulates comprised a wide size range (150 nm to > 10 mu m). For particulate of certain compositions (including Ag, Ce, Sm, and Au), a correlation was observed between their size and the distance at which they were encountered from the FDNPP. While a trend was apparent for these and several other composition particles, other materials (including Zr, Pb, Sn, and Ba) could not be described by such a strongly-negative linear trend. Although a Fukushima provenance could be apportioned to a component of the material, an alternate source is necessary to account for a significant inventory of the particulate material. While contrasting provenances may exist, both the size and composition of this particulate could represent potentially significant health implications for exposed populations.

AB Pollen grains are carriers of allergens, causing severe symptoms to hay fever sufferers. Due to annual variability in pollen levels, there is a need to develop a precise forecasting model that can accurately predict levels of annual airborne pollen for use by patients and medical personnel. In a previous study, we developed and tested a new pollen prediction algorithm based on past meteorological conditions in a flat region. In this study, we analyzed pollen samples (spring 1997-2016) and meteorological data (summer 1991-2015) from nine Swiss cities, using the algorithm to test its applicability in a mountainous region. However, we found variations in model applicability (r(2) and RMSE) among the nine observation sites. Based on considerations of topographical influence on the spatial representativeness of airborne pollen data, we then investigated the relationships between these indices and topographical features at varying spatial ranges. The results suggested that the applicability of the algorithm to annual total airborne pollen forecasts can indicate the spatial representativeness of observed airborne pollen concentrations: r(2) and RMSE reflected deviations in airborne pollen concentration caused by dispersal conditions at local and meso-scales, respectively. At higher-altitude monitoring sites, the local spatial representativeness of airborne pollen declined due to the influence of local topography-driven climate. On the other hand, dispersal conditions in the atmospheric boundary layer may deteriorate the meso-scale representativeness of airborne pollen at monitoring sites with higher terrain complexity. This study provides a reference approach to determining the spatial representativeness of airborne pollen data by applying the pollen forecast algorithm.

Exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 indoors has received considerable attention as people spend about 80% of their time in indoor environments, but little information is currently available on the assessment and mitigation of this exposure. A systematic field study was conducted with the key objective to assess and mitigate indoor human exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 in a typical naturally ventilated residential apartment. Results indicated that traffic-related PM2.5 levels indoors exceeded the air quality guidelines (12 mu g/m(3)), and the PM2.5 levels decreased significantly (74%) while using an indoor air cleaner. The human health risk assessment based on the bioavailable fraction of toxic trace elements revealed a substantial reduction in potential health risk while using the air cleaner. Overall, the major outcomes of this study would help develop effective air pollution control strategies to reduce indoor human exposure to PM2.5 and potential human health risk caused by vehicular pollution in urban areas.

AB The reduced representation of isoprene degradation in the Common Representative Intermediates (CRI) mechanism has been systematically updated, using the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1) as a reference benchmark, with the updated mechanism being released as CRI v2.2. The complete isoprene degradation mechanism in CRI v2.2 consists of 186 reactions of 56 closed shell and free radical species, this being an order of magnitude reduction in size compared with MCM v3.3.1. The chemistry initiated by reaction with OH radicals, NO3 radicals and ozone (O-3) is treated. An overview of the updates is provided, within the context of reported kinetic and mechanistic information. The revisions mainly relate to the OH-initiated chemistry, which tends to dominate under atmospheric conditions, although these include updates to the chemistry of products that are also generated from the O-3(-) and NO3-initiated oxidation. The revisions have impacts in a number of key areas, including recycling of HOx and NOx. The performance of the CRI v2.2 isoprene mechanism has been compared with those of the preceding version (CRI v2.1) and the reference MCM v3.3.1 over a range of relevant conditions, using a box model of the tropical forested boundary layer. In addition, tests are carried out to ensure that the performance of MCM v3.3.1 remains robust to more recently reported information. CRI v2.2 has also been implemented into the STOCHEM chemistry-transport model, with a customized close-variant of CRI v2.2 implemented into the EMEP MSC-W chemistry-transport model. The results of these studies are presented and used to illustrate the global-scale impacts of the mechanistic updates on HOx radical concentrations.

AB In China, most farmers intensively producing vegetables in greenhouses use frequent flooding irrigation and apply excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. This results in low resource use efficiency and high environmental N losses, partly in the form of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) or of the atmospheric pollutant nitric oxide (NO). For ensuring high vegetable productivity at lower environmental costs, it is crucial to develop efficient irrigation and fertilization strategies. Here we report on year-round measurements of N2O and NO fluxes as well as crop yields for a greenhouse cucumber cultivation, comparing common farmers' practice with two alternative managements, i.e., drip fertigation (which reduced irrigation water amount to half of that used for flood irrigation) and reduction of chemical N application by 1/3. Soils managed by farmers' practice were an important source of atmospheric N-oxides, specifically with regard to N2O. Annual emissions were 60.5 and 1.39 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for N2O and NO, which were 2.40% and 0.05% of the applied N, respectively. Compared to the farmers' practice, N2O emission factors under drip fertigation were decreased by 41%, while NO emission factors nearly doubled. Applying lower rates of N application reduced N2O and NO emission factors by 43% and 40%, respectively. Differences in the N-oxides emission strength were primarily ascribed to changes in soil microbial N turnover processes, i.e., higher moisture conditions in soils managed by farmers' practice favored denitrification in a greater extent compared with soils fertilized by drip fertigation. We also showed that drip fertigation and reducing fertilization rates by 1/3 did not compromise vegetable yields, so that lower yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions were calculated. Therefore, the replacement of farmers' practice by drip fertigation or by reducing the amount of N applied would help to secure productivity, while reducing the climate and air quality footprint of greenhouse vegetable production.

TI Historical and projected HFC-410A emission from room air conditioning
   sector in China

DT Article
DE Room air conditioning (rac); Hfc-410a; Emission; China; Projection
AB China's room air conditioning (MC) sector is now undergoing a substitution of HCFC-22 (CHClF2) by HFC-410A (a blend of HFC-125 (C2HF5) and HFC-32 (CH2F2)) as refrigerant. However, HFC-410A is also one of the strong greenhouse gases (GHGs) and will be regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. In this study, an updated HFC-410A emission inventory for China's RAC sector is established for the period of 2006-2017 with a projection to 2050 based on a bottom-up method. Our estimation indicates that the HFC-410A emissions increased from 0.0092 Gg yr(-1) to 12.0 Gg yr(-1) with an annual increase of 115.7%/yr during 2006-2017. More than 95% of the emissions were from end-of-life process. Under a business-as-usual (MU) scenario, projected emissions will continuously grow to 89.2 (54.8-126.0) Gg yr(-1) in 2050. However, under a mitigation scenario with implementation of the Kigali Amendment, emissions will peak at 63.8 Gg yr(-1) in 2039 and then decline to 43.1 (26.1-62.0) Gg yr(-1) in 2050, and about 373 Gg of cumulative emission could be curbed during 2018-2050. Additionally, we find that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangzi River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and provincial capital cities show greater HFC-410A emission intensities per unit of area than those of the rest of China during 2009-2017.

AB Black carbon (BC) emissions in China have been changing significantly due to rapid evolution of fuel consumption. In this study, BC emissions from fossil fuel consumption in different sectors were estimated in 2015 based on up-to-date activity data and emission factors (EFs). While for the future scenarios in 2020 and 2030, it was estimated according to relative changes in the activity level and EFs. In 2015, total BC emissions were estimated to be 1.48 Tg, mostly from the industrial, residential, and transportation sectors. Emission fluxes were found to have remarkable spatial features, where high fluxes generally located in eastern China. About 25% of the terrestrial area of China showed an annual flux above 0.2 t km(-2). Total BC emissions will be decreased to 1.33 (2020) and 1.16 Tg (2030). Most reduction will occur in the industrial and residential sectors, while the transportation sector will see an obvious increase. The dramatic reduction of BC emissions in future is a new indication to our current understanding of the emission and its effects as well, and it may provide guidance for future scientific research and policy making in the field of climate change and air quality control.

AB The transient piston effect induced by a fleet of vehicles that passes through a tunnel can dominate pollutant dispersion, human exposure, and tunnel ventilation. This study employed the realizable k-epsilon model together with the dynamic mesh technique to analyze the characteristics of the transient traffic piston effect inside a tunnel. A tunnel model with a length of 450 m and a 450-m extension from the outlet in the driveway direction was developed, which contained 36 gasoline-powered cars located in nine rows with four vehicles per row. The unsteady three-dimensional model was validated by comparing the simulation results with the field-measurement data of a real tunnel. The simulation results show that traffic wind was significant, and is sufficient for diluting the pollution inside the tunnel if the vehicle speed is over 20 km/h. The peak-to-valley ratio of traffic-wind velocity below 60 km/h in three specific planes (Z = 0.5 m, Z = 1.5 m, and the tunnel outlet) was in the range of 1.47-1.77, which was slower than the 40-km/h (2.00-2.36) and 20-km/h (2.45-3.09) cases. Ventilation fans should be added to ensure fresh air supply as well as human health and safety when the vehicle speed is not faster than 40 km/h. A drag coefficient of 0.1-0.3 should be used to increase the accuracy of the pressure analysis if a fleet of vehicles moves inside the tunnel at a speed of not less than 40 km/h.

AB Emissions from fuel combustion and agricultural activities contribute significantly to the continuous atmospheric entrainment of pollutants into protected and vulnerable ecosystems where long-term monitoring is often a challenge. Here, results are presented from a 26-year study (1989-2015) of wet precipitation collected at Paradise Station (1654 m above sea level), Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Weekly samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity and major anions and cations. While precipitation concentrations for sulfate, nitrate, protons and conductivity peaked in the early 2000s, overall trends decreased by 54%, 46%, 41%, and 37%, respectively. Associated pH values increased from 5.2 to 5.6, and were largely controlled by non-sea-salt contributions of sulfate and neutralizing calcium, potassium and magnesium. Between 1999 and 2015, nitrogen (N) deposition rates from ammonium increased by a factor of 3.6, from 0.27 to 0.96 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (p = 0.02), while nitrate deposition did not change statistically (0.91-0.74 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), p = 0.30). Combined, these N sources are reaching reported critical loads of 2.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Results indicate that emission regulations focused on stationary sources have effectively decreased apparent acid precipitation, however, increased nitrogen deposition from ammonium may lead to further fertilization and acidification of delicate soils and waters. Continued long-term monitoring is thus imperative to track continued anthropogenic inputs to vulnerable ecosystems.

AB Nanjing is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone of China. In this study, a series of monthly collections of atmospheric dustfall was performed in different directions from a high-rise building in Nanjing from February 2015 to March 2016. A series of magnetic parameters including chi, chi(fd)%, chi(ARM), SIRM, magnetic hysteresis loops, high-temperature kappa-T curves and SEM images was measured from atmospheric dustfall samples. The research shows that the type and size of magnetic minerals within atmospheric dustfall samples in Nanjing are similar to those found in northern cities in China, but the atmospheric dustfall samples in Nanjing have higher magnetic mineral concentrations. Coarse-grained magnetite dominated magnetic minerals. The peak concentrations of magnetic minerals contained from atmospheric dustfall of Nanjing occurred in summer. The relationship between magnetic parameters and meteorological data shows that the high values are mainly influenced by precipitation rather than by wind direction. Combined with results of the SEM images and the weak relationship between magnetic parameters and the data of PM 2.5 and PM10, all these indicate that the atmospheric dustfall of Nanjing is mainly from near-source polluted dustfall rather than from long-distance dustfall. This research suggests that environmental magnetism as a simple, economic and nondestructive technology, will be a useful tool in atmospheric dustfall research.

AB Between the end of September and the beginning of October 2017, low but detectable air concentrations of Ruthenium-106 (Ru-106) were measured throughout the European atmosphere. To date, the source has not been clearly identified. This study aims at constraining the location of the most likely emission source, by combining HYSPLIT back trajectories and a multi-site source-receptor model. The model follows a concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) approach, based on a Ru-106 measurement dataset gathered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) shortly after the event and shared by the French Institut de Radioprotection et de &tete Nucleaire (IRSN). The back trajectories are computed using Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) and ERA-Interim meteorological data, with horizontal resolution from 1.5 degrees to 0.5 degrees. The effect of the starting altitude was also investigated. The source-receptor model results show that the most likely emission source region extends from Ukraine to the West to the Russian Volga and Ural regions to the East, in accordance with two previous studies. The analyses also show that the identified source region is relatively insensitive to the type of meteorological data, their horizontal resolution and values of starting altitude. The model precision is found to increase with increasing number of receptors. The method is fully open-source, requires low computational resources and is therefore suited to estimate the source origin of radioactive pollutants on a real time basis, providing an additional tool to more sophisticated atmospheric models.

AB Located in the Mediterranean Basin and close to Marseille (France), Fos-sur-Mer is situated in the vicinity of industrial harbor and agricultural lands. Its location makes it prone to mixed pollution contributions, combining the influence of residential, industrial, agricultural, maritime road and traffic sources. For this study, the origins of carbonaceous particles sampled over several months are investigated by a coupled approach based on analyses of radiocarbon (C-14), elemental to total carbon ratio (EC/TC) and various molecular tracers (levoglucosan, methoxyphenols, malic and glyceric acids), giving information about their background origins. Accelerator mass spectrometry with a gas ion source give the opportunity to quantify the fossil and non-fossil fractions for each individual sample, avoiding to pool them. Analyzing C-14 in micro-samples (down to a few mu g of carbon) complements the approach based on chemical tracers, which are useful to identify sources, but insufficient to quantify accurately the modern and fossil carbon fractions.
   The measurements in about 30 samples collected during summer and fall/winter 2013, allow the detection of a strong seasonality of the pollution: the fall/winter PM2.5 fraction concentration equals to three times the summer concentration and we observe a significant fluctuation of the relative contributions of fossil and non-fossil fractions (f(NF) is approximate to 0.83 for fall/winter samples and approximate to 0.59 for summer samples).
   Significant correlations between C-14, levoglucosan and different methoxyphenols, allow the identification and quantification of a major influence of biomass burning emissions during fall and winter. Biomass burning organic carbon (OCBB) and elemental carbon (ECBB) contribute to 45% and 8% of the TC, respectively, whereas their total contribution is only 3% in summer samples.
   Biogenic emissions from the vegetation are the main sources of carbon during summer (approximate to 57%). Significant correlations between summer OCbio and malic acid and DL glyceric acid suggest a secondary origin for this fraction.
   The total fossil carbon concentration (ECF and OCF) from vehicular, shipping and industrial sources is constant throughout the year, which is compatible with intense road and maritime traffics and industrial activity during both seasons.
   Overall, our study based on C-14 and molecular tracers illustrates the power of a coupled approach in order to both identify and quantify biomass burning, biogenic, traffic and industrial sources of carbonaceous aerosols, forming a complex mix of background PM origins in a typical industrious harbor of the Mediterranean region.

AB Dicarboxylic acids have low volatilities and hence are present mostly in the particulate phase, including the surface of dust particles. Mineral dust, globally the most emitted aerosol, has photocatalytic properties that can initiate photo-induced heterogeneous chemistry of organic compounds, which is still poorly characterized. We investigated the photochemistry of five dicarboxylic acids (DCA) i.e., succinic (butanedioic) acid, glutaric (pentanedioic) acid, adipic (hexanedioic) acid, pimelic (heptanedioic) acid and suberic (octanedioic) acid on Arizona test dust (ATD) particles upon UV-A light irradiation (0-1.4 mW cm(-2)). Gas-phase products were monitored by a high-resolution proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS), and surface sorbed products were extracted and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a heated electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HESI-HRMS). Monoacids and aldehydes were the main observed and quantified gaseous products. In contrast, shorter chain DCA and highly oxygenated products were found at the surface of the dust particles. Interestingly, the photochemistry of these DCAs presented an even-odd alternation concerning their heterogeneous reactivity, with odd-numbered carbon diacids being more reactive than their even-numbered homologous ones. We present and discuss a reaction mechanism for the C-4-C-8 DCA heterogeneous photooxidation catalysed by TiO2/Fe2O3-rich dust particles. Our results suggest that photochemical processing on dust surfaces should be regarded as a possible efficient pathway for altering their surface properties impacting ice nucleation and cloud condensation properties.

One cascade impactor operated at the LASA-station considered the reference station and the other used for simultaneous measurements at the three other sites. Three sets of independent samples were collected during every season of the year 2011. The initial activity distribution inverted into smooth size distribution. The model parameters successfully defined to obtain the best fit-curve and two or three modes were resolved, with the predominant fit at the accumulation range. The lowest Activity Median Aerodynamic Diameter (AMAD) values were observed during summer. The AMAD values were anticorrelated with Be-7 activities, while they were correlated with Relative Humidity. Similar AMAD values in suburban and urban regions were observed during all periods of the year. AMAD values of Be-7 aerosol particles in areas with poor air quality were greater than those at the less polluted environments far from anthropogenic activities regions. This indicates that Be-7 AMAD values could be used as an index of air quality conditions in areas like the Po Valley.

AB Brake wear particles constitute a significant part of the non-exhaust related particulate matter (PM) associated to traffic. These particles derive from various components of the vehicles' brake system and were recognized as an important pollution source only recently. In the present study, electron microscopy was applied to elucidate brake wear particle morphology and associated chemical composition. Sampling was carried out on a brake test bench. Particles were collected on 13 successive polycarbonate foil bags and a backup filter by means of a Dekati Low Pressure Impactor (DLPI), based on the equivalent aerodynamic particle diameter. The results revealed a broad size range from the micro-to the nano-scale, as measured on electron microscope images, including coarse (2.5-10 mu m), fine (0.1-2.5 mu m) and ultrafine ones (< 0.1 mu m), down to a few nanometers. It cannot be implied with certainty to what extent the particle size spectrum identified under the experimental conditions of the present study strictly applies to real-world conditions. The particles occur typically in form of aggregates, also in the ultrafine scale; single, i.e. non-agglomerated particles are more common in the ultrafine fraction than at larger sizes. Imaged particles have commonly rounded outlines probably due to friction and associated abrasion during braking; melting/evaporation at high temperature braking phases, associated with the rate of the generated frictional energy of braking, and subsequent rapid solidification can be invoked to interpret the nearly spherical shape of nanometer size particles. The individual constituents of the aggregates have various sizes and chemical composition. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the imaged aggregates and of their constituents showed that Fe is prevalent in all size fractions but is less pronounced in the smaller sizes, where Ca, occasionally in combination with S and/or P becomes more frequent. Other frequently analysed elements are Al, Sn, Mg, Si, Cr, Ti, K and W; less frequent are Ni, Zn, Zr, Ba, S, C, P, F, Mn and rarely Bi and Sb.

AB The existence of biological (pollen and spore) and non-biological (PM2.5, PM10, O-3, CO, NO2, SO2, etc.) particles in the atmosphere is connected to the frequency of adverse allergenic reactions affecting human health. Considering all probable effects of atmospheric pollutants and airborne pollen on allergic reactions, the present study mainly examines the influence of non-biological pollutants and weather parameters on the concentration of airborne pollen in the Guangzhou city area by using Pearson's correlation, Spearman's rho test, and multiple linear regressions. Accordingly, we analyze the seasonal variation of non-biological pollutants, meteorological parameters, and airborne pollen during 2017 from two districts (Haizhu and Panyu) of Guangzhou, China. The airborne pollen data were collected using the volumetric method. Spring and autumn were the primary seasons for most of the pollen identification in this area. Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rho test revealed that pollen dispersion was significantly correlated with non-biological pollutants and meteorological parameters. Among them, PM2.5 and O-3 were positively correlated with pollen concentration and NO2 was negatively correlated. A significant positive correlation was observed between temperature and wind speed with pollen concentration. Precipitation and relative humidity were negatively correlated with pollen concentration during the study period. In contrast, multiple linear regressions revealed a minor effect among these parameters on pollen concentration. However, the meteorological parameter shows more valid regression than the air pollutants. Some inconsistent results were discovered, which might be due to differences in climate, vegetation type, and rapid urbanization. Therefore, considering the long periods needed to collect data on pollen, further research is necessary to investigate the allergenic effects and health burden due to atmospheric pollutants.

AB Air quality is often assessed using particulate matter (PM) mass concentration without considering its toxicity, thus possibly leading to improper control policies or inadequate health protection. Here, we studied differences in oxidative potentials (OPs) of PM samples collected using automobile air conditioning (AC) filters from 19 global cities, as well as influences from microbial contents. Dithiothreitol (DTT) assay showed remarkable differences in the PM OPs among cities (p-values <= 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). For example, the normalized index of oxidant generation (NIOG) of PM samples in San Francisco (2.20 x 10(-2), annual average PM10 = 16 mu g/m(3)) was found to be twice that in Beijing (1.14 x 10(-2), annual average PM10 = 135 mu g/m(3)). Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay found that PM-borne endotoxin ranged from 12.16 EU/mg (Florianopolis, Brazil) to 2518.23 EU/mg (Chennai, India) among cities. Besides, culturing method and real-time qPCR revealed significant differences of up to similar to 100-fold in both bacterial and fungal levels among 19 cities. Spearman's correlation analysis implied that PM-borne microbes such as bacteria and fungi as well as metals could strongly influence the PM OP. As an example, our results in Xfan, China further suggest that the PM2.5 OP evolves for a particular city over the time, which is attributable to both the urbanization and air pollution control measures. This work highlights the importance in optimizing the current air quality control measures by considering the toxicity factor and its microbial constituents.

AB The detailed molecular composition of laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosols (SOA) during the high-NO photooxidation of beta-pinene (beta P) was investigated using a novel thermal desorption dichloromethane-assisted low-pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (TD-CH2Cl2-assisted LPPI-MS) technique. We found that protonated norpinone gave the highest signal intensity, which supported that assumption that this compound was the key oxidation species responsible for promoting beta P-SOA formation. In addition to the previously identified monomers (i.e., 2,2-dimethylcyclobutyl-1,3-dicarboxaldehyde (m/z 140), pinene aldehyde (m/z 150), myrtenol (m/z 152), (2,2-dimethyl-3-acetyl)-cyclobutylformate (m/z 156), pinene acid (m/z 166), and isomers of pinalic-3-acid (m/z 170)), two additional nitrogen-containing species (i.e., C-10 hydroxy nitrate and C-10 carbonyl nitrate) were also observed at m/z values of 214 and 216 in the mass spectrum of beta P-SOA. Furthermore, the losses of 18 (H2O), 46 (NO2), and 64 (H2O + NO2) were attributed to the typical fragmentation pathways of the two nitrogen-containing species. Overall, these results not only contribute to an improved understanding of beta P-SOA formation, but they also indicate that TD-CH2Cl2-assisted LPPI-MS can be used as a novel detection means to study SOA formation.

AB Cooking fumes are important volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sources of indoor air, however, emission characteristics of the commonly used oils (canola, soybean, peanut, corn and lard) in Chinese cooking and health risks of the corresponding VOCs are still not clear. In this study, we sprayed the oil droplets uniformly on a pre-heated wall via a nozzle in order to obtain the cooking fumes with constant VOC compositions. Our results show that emission profiles of VOCs are similar among the five oils. The vegetable oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids emit more VOCs than the lard oil rich in saturated fatty acids, and the VOCs emitted from the soybean oil increase with increasing cooking temperatures. Water in oils always enhances VOC emissions by steam stripping at high temperatures. Moreover, oxidative radicals generated in the water-oil system facilitate oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, producing carcinogenic aldehydes, benzenes and furans in the emitted VOCs. The carcinogenic risk order of furan > nonanal > hexanal > heptanal > octanal > 2-nonenal > benzene indicates that furan and various aldehydes are more carcinogenic than benzene compounds. The comprehensive health risk factor further reveals that the carcinogenic risks of the emitted VOCs from the five oils follow the order of peanut > canola > soybean > corn > > lard.

AB Particulate matter is the main air pollutant in China, especially in Xi'an in recent years. Since 2013, the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ model system has been used to build an air quality model system for daily air quality forecasting in Xi'an. The emission inventory was built based on several anthropogenic emission inventories and open access emission datasets, and the model evaluation is presented to verify the emission inventory for particulate matter in Xi'an. Comparing the daily observed and simulated fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations for four winters in different years (from 2014 to 2017), the model performs well in all studied time periods. The correlation coefficient of the simulated daily PM2.5 concentration data are all larger than 0.58, reaches 0.80 in 2016, and the fraction of predictions within a factor of two of observations (FAC2) are all above 66%. The differences of simulated results based on emission-unchanged system between 2014 and 2015 indicate that the slightly deteriorating air quality of 2015 is affected by the unfavorable air diffusion condition. The PM10 concentration increases from 95.9 mu g/m(3) to 110.3 mu g/m(3), and the PM2.5 from 82.4 mu g/m(3) to 95.4 mu g/m(3). According to the error analysis in model performance, the serious polluted situation of 2016 is mostly because of the sharp increased dust emissions. The emission-unchanged simulated particulate matter concentrations have little variation from 2015 to 2016, but the observation data increase obviously, that results in dramatically change of Mean Bias (MB). The absolute MB of PM10 increase from 70.3 mu g/m(3) to 135.2 mu g/m(3), and PM2.5 from 0.46 mu g/m(3) to 69.9 mu g/m(3). While the improved air quality in 2017 is attributed to both the better weather condition and the emission-reductions. The emission-unchanged simulated results decrease, and the absolute MB even have bigger decrease, that of the PM10 concentration reduce by 47 mu g/m(3), and PM2.5 by 37 mu g/m(3).

AB The adverse health effects of inhaled particulate matter (PM) are global concern. Yet, in general, estimating the exposure to PM is challenging due to the sparsity of standard air quality monitoring stations and the low accuracy of dispersion models when high spatial resolution is required. The city of Elad, Israel, is situated less than 1 km from the Migdal Tzedek stone quarry, and public concerns were raised regarding the impact of the quarry's PM emissions on the city air quality.
   This work describes a year-long campaign of continuous measurements of particle number concentration (PNC) in few locations in the city and its vicinity, using a network of low cost optical particle counters (OPCs). To assess the possible impact of the quarry on the city we examined the OPCs' accuracy, coherency, and their capability to detect the quarry's impact on the PNC levels in the city. Using PNC time series in two size channels from a network of five nodes, PM10 and PM2.5 records from a nearby reference air quality monitoring station, and meteorological data, we could conclude that the quarry's impact on the city was small relative to the background PNC levels. Yet, more importantly, this work demonstrates the use of a network of low cost OPCs for responding to an environmental query for which the sparse standard air quality monitoring observations were not sufficient. The trade-offs between deployment of a network of cheap low-quality instruments and the use of a single high-end device are discussed.

TI Measurement-based assessment of the regional contribution and drivers of
   reduction in annual and daily fine particulate matter impact metrics in
   Paris, France (2009-2018)

AB Health effects from long- and short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have resulted in an annual average PM2.5 standard across Europe and World Health Organisation guidelines for annual (10 mu g m(-3)) and 24 h PM2.5 concentrations (25 mu g m(-3)). Developing strategies to reduce both annual and 24 h average PM2.5 requires that the conditions that produce the magnitude of these metrics are understood. This paper presents a standard and replicable set of statistics that link the magnitude of annual and daily PM2.5 metrics to variation in i) hourly PM2.5 concentrations, ii) geographic regions traversed by air mass back trajectories, and iii) the 'urban increment' and 'regional contribution' to urban PM2.5 concentrations. These statistics are calculated between 2009 and 2018 at monitoring sites across Paris and the Ile-de-France region, France, where there is a national objective to achieve the WHO annual PM2.5 guideline, and where short-term PM2.5 episodes still occur. The aim is to investigate changes in the conditions producing annual average, and 24 h PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 25 mu g m(-3,) and how these long- and short-term metrics could be reduced further. The statistics indicate that reductions between 2009 and 2018 in both annual PM2.5 concentrations (PM2.5AA, -0.79 mu g m(-3) y(-1) averaged across 3 urban background sites (33% average 2009-2018 reduction)) and the number of days with 24 h PM2.5 concentrations above 25 mu g m(-3) (D24h25, -6 days y(-1) (62% average 2009-2018 reduction)), were driven by reductions in local emissions in Paris and the Ile-de-France region. For example, reduction in PM2.5AA and D24h25 were greater at urban traffic sites, and between 2009 and 2018 the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred less frequently during rush hour periods, while the lowest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred more frequently during the day. In addition, when relatively moderate and high hourly PM2.5 concentrations were measured, air mass back trajectories spent more time (during the 4 preceding days) over European geographic regions, compared to the ocean indicating an increased relative contribution from regional transport to these hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Consequently, there is now a greater difference in the contribution of different hourly PM2.5 concentrations to annual and 24 h PM2,5 compared with 2009, with relatively high hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to D24h25, and moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to PM2.5AA. Strategies to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in Paris should consider how mitigation measures will affect different ranges of hourly PM2.5 concentrations to understand the (potentially differing) effect on long- and short-term PM2.5 impact metrics. Comparison of hourly PM2.5 concentrations at urban sites and upwind rural sites showed regional contributions to PM2.5AA of approximately 50% and 70% at urban traffic and urban background sites, respectively. The largest regional contributions were also estimated for the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations, compared to moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations.
   Regional emission reductions could therefore make a substantial contribution to achieving the WHO air quality guidelines in Paris.

AB Studies on pollution due to polyaromatics (PAs) focus on a limited number of commercially available compounds such as US-EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EPA-PAHs). Benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method involves oxidation of condensed aromatic rings (CARs) to a few BPCAs, and the subsequent conversion of the BPCA carbon to CAR carbon. It can be used to quantify PM in environmental samples (in terms of CAR carbon), although the chemical structures of numerous PAs are still unknown. However, this method needs to be developed further for practical application. In this study, we developed a protocol for the simultaneous analysis of EPA-PAHs, and characterisation of low- and high-polarity PM in aerosols by the BPCA method, using an aerosol reference material. The low- and high-polarity PM were extracted successively with dichloromethane and water. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was developed for the BPCA characterisation of PM in aerosol. Chromatographic peaks of BPCAs could be identified easily and reliably with a short instrumental runtime (18.2 min). Deuterated phenanthrene was first used as a surrogate of chemicals characterised by the SPCA method, which significantly improved the reproducibility of the method (mean coefficient of variation similar to 4%). Particles that remain in the solvent extracts may contain chemicals with highly condensed aromatic structures, resulting in the overestimation of PAs quantified by the SPCA method. This situation was investigated by analysing SPCA patterns, and the particles that remained were found to be negligible through appropriate extraction techniques. Preliminary results from the analysis of the aerosol reference material using the protocol revealed that EPA-PAHs account for less than 1% of low-polarity PAs. The abundance of low- and high-polarity PAs was found to be comparable, whereas there is very little knowledge on the sources, pollution, and health effects of high-polarity PM in ambient aerosol at present.

AB Intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) recently have been identified as an important group of air pollutants, and they can contribute significantly to the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation via gas-phase reactions. However, significance of the SOA from aqueous oxidation of IVOCs was largely unknown. Here, we investigated the aqueous aging of two model IVOCs of naphthoquinone (NAQ) and phenanthrene (PHE) at a staring concentration of 10 mu M. Both species were found to have high SOA yields (similar to 50%) against hydroxyl radical photochemical oxidation. PHE can be slowly oxidized under dark conditions (similar to 10% in 8 h) while NAQ cannot, but it can photo-degrade itself under simulated sunlight at a high rate (similar to 56% in 1 h). A group of oxygenated products were formed and its concentrations increased continuously throughout hydroxyl radical-mediated aging of both precursors. Aqueous aging led to enhancements of light absorption, especially for NAQ, and the oxygenated products were likely light chromophores. Our findings highlight the possible significance of SOA from aqueous oxidation of IVOCs. Future investigations on a broad spectrum of IVOCs and inclusion of such SOA formation pathway into climate and air quality models should be considered.

AB This work is concerned with the source identification problem in air pollution modeling. The forward problem is described by an advection-diffusion equation with physically realistic coefficients. It is solved by the combination of adaptive meshes and a stabilized finite element method. The source is estimated by Tikhonov-type regularization with a composite misfit function and an entropic penalty term. The composite misfit is given by the convex combination of l(1) and l(2) norms of the discrepancy between observed and predicted concentrations. Morozov's discrepancy principle is applied to simultaneously choose the regularization and the misfit combination parameters. Numerical experiments using Copenhagen field data is used to validate numerically the proposed methodology.

AB Contributions of industries, power plants, residential, transportation, open burning, and biogenic sectors to summertime ozone (O-3) in China in August 2013 are quantified using an improved O-3 source apportionment method implemented in a source-oriented Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The new O-3 source apportionment method attributes in-situ O-3 formed in each time step to nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with a new attribution scheme that considers NOx-VOC-O-3 formation sensitivity in NOx-limited, transition, and VOC-limited regimes (three regimes, 3R). This represents an improvement from the traditional O-3 source apportionment models, in which O-3 formation sensitivity is divided into two-regimes (2R), either NOx-limited or VOC-limited. An expanded source-oriented gas phase chemical mechanism is developed to concurrently track NOx and primary VOCs and their oxidation products from different sources. The source-resolved NO2 photolysis rates and the NO to NO2 conversion rates by peroxy radicals from the source-oriented chemical mechanism are then used to apportion O-3 to NOx (O-3-NOx) and VOCs (O-3_VOC) from different emission sources.
   Industries, transportation, power plants and biogenic sources are the major emission sectors to O-3. High industrial O3NOx (8-15 ppb; 20-25% of total O-3) is mainly located in north and northeast China, the Yantze River Delta (YRD) and part of the Sichuan Basin (SCB). Transportation O3NOx accounts for 10-15% of total O-3 in most urban areas. Power plants' contributions to O-3_NOx (10-15%) are mostly located in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia and part of Shandong and Jiangsu. The contribution of soil NOx to O-3_NOx is highest in regions in west, central and south China with less direct anthropogenic emission influences. VOC-limited grid cells are mostly located at urban cores and large city clusters in the YRD and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions. Biogenic and industrial sectors are the most important emission sectors that contribute to O-3_VOC, accounting for more than 85% of the O-3_VOC in China. In north and east provinces, more than 50% of the O-3 is non-background, with the provinces in north China having higher overall O-3. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region has an area-averaged 8-hr O-3 of 75 ppb in August 2013 and about half is non-background. Contributions of industries, transportation, power and biogenic sources to non-background O-3 are 37%, 22%, 13% and 23%, respectively. The relative contribution of biogenic emissions to non-background O-3 is lower on high 8-hr O-3 days. The 2R and 3R approaches show significant differences in assessing the relative importance of O-3_NOx and O3VOC, with the 2 regime approach predicting lower O3NOx but higher O3VOC. The new source allocation method for O-3_VOC can lead to up to 10% differences for industrial and biogenic sectors.

AB By understanding the sources and temporal variations of nitrated mono- and di-aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroaromatic hydrocarbons, NAHCs) in ambient particles, we can evaluate their impact on the climate, environment, and human health. This work quantifies (for the first time) a series of NAHCs (3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, 2,4-dinitro-1-naphthol, 4-nitrophthalic acid, and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl alcohol) in ambient particles collected from an urban site in Nagoya, Japan. The data were collected throughout the day/night cycles during the summer and fall of 2013. To evaluate the possible sources of the NAHCs, the observed NAHC concentrations were compared with organic tracers of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols (ASOAs) and biomass buming. Nitrocatechols were mainly influenced by emissions from biomass burning during the fall, and by secondary formation from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) during the summer. In both seasons, AVOC oxidation mainly produced nitrosalicylic acids, 4-nitro-1-naphthol, and 4-nitrophthalic acid, whereas biomass burning in the fall produced a significant amount of 4-nitro-1-naphthol. The concentrations of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid and 4-nitrophthalic acid were highly correlated with those of other ASOA tracers, and were strongly related to wind direction, oxidant concentration, and solar radiation. Therefore, these NAHCs are suggested as new tracers of ASOA. Meanwhile, although 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl alcohol was generated by AVOCs photo-oxidation during the day, its concentration remained high at night, indicating additional nighttime sources such as nitrate radical reactions. Our results suggest that different NAHCs could have different sources, large seasonal and day-to-night variations in their major ones.

AB In this study, we investigated the cell-free ascorbic acid assay (OPAA response) to quantify the oxidative potential (OP) of particle matter (PM), as a promising metric for studying the association between the chemical properties and toxicological effects of PM.
   With the purpose of designing an experimental set-up mostly representative of the intracellular oxidation, the assay was performed in different media, representing an artificial respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), i.e., simple ascorbate (Asc) or mixtures of reduced glutathione (GSH), urate (UA) and citrate (Cit).
   The study was performed on real PM2.5 samples collected at an urban and rural site in the Po Valley (northern Italy). For comparison, standard solutions of redox-active species were investigated, i.e., Cu2+, Fe2+, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone and 9,10-phenantrenequinone, that are known to give positive response to the AA assay.
   The composition of the synthetic RTLF strongly effected the OPAA responses, as they decreased with increasing the mixture complexity, following the order:
   Asc > Asc + Cit > Asc + UA > Asc + GSH > Asc + Cit + GSH similar to Asc + Cit + GSH + UA.
   Based on comparison of the dependence of OPAA on RTLF composition, we could infer that Cu2+ and quinones were the redox active species most responsible of the OPAA response of the analysed PM2.5 samples.

AB The ecosystem area in the 28 states of the European Union (EU28) for which eutrophication critical loads are exceeded is investigated under the revised National Emission Ceiling Directive (NECD) and under alternative scenarios whereby reduction efforts are shared equitably among Member States. The focus is on nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) emission reduction policies that ensure that the total EU28 emission reduction target for 2030 under the NECD is achieved, but by equity-based emission reductions for each Member State. A gradual reduction of emissions of nitrogen in the EU28 is assessed by imposing ever lower common maximum densities for emissions (a) per unit area of a country (areal-equity) (b) per capita of a country's population (per capita-equity), and (c) per euro ((sic)) of a country's GDP (GDP-equity). The NECD aims at a reduction of EU28 emissions of NOx and NH3 of 63% and 19%, respectively in 2030, compared to base year 2005. Under these reductions, about 67% of EU28 ecosystem area remains at risk of adverse effects of nitrogen deposition. We demonstrate that reducing N emissions subject to GDP-equity among EU28 Member States could have reduced that area at risk to about 61%. The application of areal and per capita-equity does not lead to significantly different ecosystem areas at risk when compared to NECD.

AB Modeling fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of air pollutants can be challenging. Advanced spatio-temporal modeling methods were used to predict both long-term and short-term concentrations of six criteria air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 and 2.5 mu m [PM10 and PM2.5], SO2, NO2, ozone and carbon monoxide [CO]) in Beijing, China. Monitoring data for the six criteria pollutants from April 2014 through December 2017 were obtained from 23 administrative monitoring sites in Beijing. The dimensions of a large array of geographic covariates were reduced using partial least squares (PLS) regression. A land use regression (LUR) model in a universal kriging framework was used to estimate pollutant concentrations over space and time. Prediction ability of the models was determined using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Prediction accuracy of the spatio-temporal two-week averages was excellent for all of the pollutants, with LOOCV mean squared error-based R-2 (R-mse(2)) of 0.86, 0.95, 0.90, 0.82, 0.94 and 0.95 for PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, ozone and CO, respectively. These models find ready application in making fine-scale exposure predictions for members of cohort health studies and may reduce exposure measurement error relative to other modeling approaches.

AB The deep learning model can simulate the complex nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth (AOD), and has great application potentiality in PM2.5 inversion. However, the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations problem is still exist in heavily polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JingJinJi) region due to AOD cannot adequately represent the correlation between high PM2.5 concentrations and independent variables and neglected the effects of missing AOD. Thus, the long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure risk estimate was reduced. This work introduces gaseous pollutant data (NO2, SO2, CO, and O-3) related to primary emission and secondary transformation of pollutants as predictors into a deep neural network model to improve the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations based on AOD and meteorological factors. We predicted the PM2.5 concentration in the missing AOD areas, generated a daily continuous PM2.5 spatial distribution, and reduced estimated bias due to AOD deficiency. Grid-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was used to test the model performance. Results show that daily PM2.5 concentration CV R-2 is 0.87 and the root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE) is 27.11 mu g/m(3). The CV R-2 and RMSE are higher by 0.12 and lower by 9.72 mu g/m(3) than the model without gaseous pollutants (GAS(s)) as predictors. In including the missing AOD, the average concentration of PM2.5 CV R-2 is 0.86 and the RMSE is 16.95 mu g/m(3) in heavy polluted winter; the CV R-2 and RMSE are higher by 0.07 and lower by 3.95 mu g/m(3), respectively, than when the missing AOD was excluded. Prediction results of PM2.5 spatial distribution show that the model has high prediction accuracy and provides a complete and highly accurate spatiotemporal distribution characteristics for long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure studies, and reduces exposure misclassification of PM2.5 in heavily polluted areas.

AB Mercury is a global pollutant that poses threats to ecosystems and to human health. Due to its global transport, mercury contamination is found in regions of the Earth that are remote from major emissions areas, including the Polar regions. Global anthropogenic emission inventories identify important sectors and industries responsible for emissions at a national level; however, to be useful for air transport modelling, more precise information on the locations of emission is required. This paper describes the methodology applied, and the results of work that was conducted to geospatially distribute anthropogenic mercury emissions as part of the global anthropogenic mercury emissions inventory for 2015 prepared by AMAP/UNEP for the Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) 2018 (UN Environment, 2019). This work includes the identification and use of emission point sources as well as distributing diffuse emissions for 21 emission (industry) sectors. The basic approach involves assigning emission estimates to geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where available, and otherwise assigning a modelled emission to the point. Emissions which cannot be assigned to point sources are distributed using sector-specific proxies. Mercury speciation highly depends on industry processes and air pollution control technology. Different Hg speciation ratios are therefore applied per sector and country technology level. The resulting global emission datasets include total mercury (Hg-T), gaseous elemental mercury (Hg-0), divalent mercury (Hg2+) and particulate mercury (Hg-P) in kg per year per raster cell (kg/a). The spatial resolution is flexible and the vertical resolution of the data is based on a set of predefined height classes. The resolution of the GMA2018 emission data is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees with three (physical emission) height classes (0-50, 50-150 and > 150m). A comparison with the EMEP European mercury emission was made based on spatial correlation between the two datasets. Suggested improvements for future work include the further development of proxy data and the implementation of a more structured reporting of emissions by countries.

AB Background: On December 30th, 2013, the Hong Kong government implemented the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) alert programme warnings designed to reduce short-term effects of air pollution on population health. However, whether air quality alert programme warnings, such as the AQHI, reduce morbidity is still questionable. Using a quasi-experimental design, we conducted the first evaluation of the AQHI in Hong Kong focusing on respiratory morbidity.
   Method: Interrupted time series with Poisson segmented regression from 2010 to 2016 was used to detect any sudden or gradual changes in emergency respiratory hospital admissions, adjusted for air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10, O-3), temperature and humidity, when the AQHI policy was implemented. The findings were validated using three false policy study periods and digestive diseases as a control. We also assessed effects on specific respiratory diseases (respiratory tract infections (RTI), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia) and by age.
   Results: From January 1st' 2010 to December 31st, 2016, 10576.98 deseasonalized, age-standardized hospital admissions for respiratory disease occurred in Hong Kong. On implementation of the AQHI, RTI admissions immediately dropped by 14% (relative risk (RR) 0.86 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.98). In age specific analysis, immediate reductions in hospital admissions were only apparent in children for RTI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96) and pneumonia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60-0.96).
   Conclusion: Hong Kong's AQHI helped reduced hospital admissions in children, particularly for RTI and pneumonia. To maximize health benefits of the policy, at risk groups need to be able to follow the behavioral changes recommended by the AQHI warnings.

AB Vape shops are widespread due to the popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) as an alternative to tobacco cigarettes. In this study, sixty-seven Southern California vape shops were randomly surveyed for building characteristics, ventilation, and business patterns. Based on the survey results, six representative shops were recruited for real-time measurements of indoor and outdoor fine and ultrafine particles concentrations on a busy and less busy day. Occupancy, vaping frequency, and opening and closing of doors were recorded, and shop air exchange rate was determined. Indoor CO2, relative humidity, and temperature were also recorded. In addition, simultaneous measurements were taken at increasing distances away from a vaping area to assess the mixing and spatial profiles of particle levels inside the shops. During active vaping, real-time indoor particle number concentration and gravimetric-corrected PM2.5 mass concentration across the six vape shops varied from 1.3 x 10(4) to 4.8 x 10(5) particles/cm(3) and from 15.5 to 37,500 mu g/m(3), respectively. The spatial profiles of particle number and mass were more uniformly mixed than expected in an indoor environment. Total vaping frequency was the main predictor of particle concentrations inside the vape shops when indoor-outdoor particle mass transfer is minimal (doors closed).

AB In the atmosphere, pesticides are distributed between gaseous and particulate phases according to their physicochemical properties. In these two phases, they can react with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone, hydroxyl radical and nitrate radicals. Heterogeneous kinetics of the degradation by nighttime nitrate radicals are not well described. In this study, the heterogeneous reactivity with nitrate radicals of eight current-use pesticides (i.e., difenoconazole, tetraconazole, cyprodinil, fipronil, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, deltamethrin, and permethrin) adsorbed on silica model particles was investigated using laboratory experiments with in-situ nitrate radicals generation and concentration measurement. Under these experimental conditions, all pesticides were degraded. Atmospheric half-lives calculated with a Langmuir-Rideal model ranged between 8 days and 16 days and between 2 days and 11 days according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for an atmospheric nitrate radicals concentration of 20 ppt. Results obtained can contribute to a better understanding of the atmospheric fate of pesticides in the particulate phase and show the importance of their degradation by nitrate radical compared to their degradation by other oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals.

AB Accurate precipitation information is necessary for modelling the deposition of radionuclides following an accidental release of radioactive material to the atmosphere. The increase in resolution of numerical weather prediction models (NWP) has led to precipitation which looks more realistic but performs poorly when compared to observations using traditional grid-point statistics. Dispersion models have the ability to use precipitation information derived from radars. This study looks at the differences in estimates of air activity and deposition when precipitation information from a high resolution NWP is replaced by precipitation information from radar. Using a hypothetical release and a year's worth of meteorological data the results show that in around a third of cases there is a significant difference in the amount of deposition estimated when NWP precipitation is used compared to cases where radar precipitation is used. The results also show a small number of cases where air activity concentrations vary significantly between the runs.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) pollution, which is closely linked to photochemical smog and secondary organic aerosols, has become a severe concern in China. Therefore, we compiled a new high-resolution emission inventory for the industrial non-methane Volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) using "bottom-up" approaches throughout 2010 and 2016. In this work, the industrial sources were divided into five major categories, and 108 specific sources, as well as an emission factor database, was developed for industrial NMVOCs. Results indicated that the total NMVOCs emissions from industrial sources increased from 16.88 Tg in 2010 to 21.04 Tg in 2016 at an annual average rate of 3.7%. The five major source categories including "production of VOCs", "storage and transportation", "industrial processes using VOCs as raw material", "processes using VOCs-containing products", and "fossil fuel combustion" generated 1.92 Tg, 0.94 Tg, 6.54 Tg, 10.04 Tg, and 1.60 Tg NMVOCs, respectively, in 2016. Coke production, plastic manufacturing, raw medicine industry, and architectural decoration were the primary sources of industrial NMVOCs and emissions of these sources increased by 140 Gg, 190 Gg, 640 Gg, and 700 Gg between 2010 and 2016. The emissions displayed distinct spatial characteristics, with significantly higher emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Cheng-Yu region than in other areas. Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan were the top five provinces with the highest NMVOCs emissions, while the emission hotspots in the county-level were mainly distributed in Guangzhou urban area, Shanghai Pudong New Area, Hangzhou urban area, and Shenzhen urban area. The emissions in Henan province, Hubei province, and Cheng-Yu region increased significantly during the study period. Instead, emissions in some counties of Zhejiang province and Hebei province decreased than in 2010.

AB Growing evidence suggests that tropospheric ozone has widespread effects on vegetation, which can contribute to alter ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics and belowground processes. In this study, we used intact soil mesocosms from a semi-improved grassland and investigated the effects of elevated ozone, alone and in combination with nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil-borne greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem C fluxes. Ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions was occurred during the growing season. Across a one-year period, soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions did not differ between treatments, but elevated ozone significantly depressed soil CH4 uptake by 14% during the growing season irrespective of N fertilization. Elevated ozone resulted in a 15% reduction of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, while N fertilization significantly increased ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Aboveground biomass was unaffected by elevated ozone during the growing season but significantly decreased by 17% during the non-growing season. At the end of the experiment, soil mineral N content, net N mineralization and extracellular enzyme activities (Le., cellobiohydrolase and leucine aminopeptidase) were higher under elevated ozone than ambient ozone. The short-term effect of single application of N fertilizer was primarily responsible for the lack of the interaction between elevated ozone and N fertilization. Therefore, results of our short-term study suggest that ozone exposure may have negative impacts on soil CH4 uptake and C sequestration and contribute to accelerated rates of soil N cycling.

AB Increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is driving nutrient imbalances, soil acidification, biodiversity losses and the long-term reduction in stability of sensitive ecosystems which previously had limited N. In this study, we analysed the concentrations of seven different N compounds in precipitation and in the air at 34 sites across Switzerland. We calculated the N deposition by precipitation (bulk deposition) and applied the inferential method to derive dry deposition (gases, aerosols) from air concentrations. We then quantified the total inorganic N deposition by adding together the bulk and dry deposition. Finally, the total inorganic N input into the sensitive ecosystems of the 34 sites was compared to the critical loads of these ecosystems.
   N deposition by precipitation was the main contributor to the total N load in 16 out of 34 sites, especially into open ecosystems such as alpine/subalpine grassland, mountain hay meadows, and raised bogs. Dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) was the second most important pathway, in particular for forests close to agricultural activities, due to high NH3 concentrations and the higher deposition velocity. The N deposition exceeded the lower limit of the Critical Load of Nitrogen (CLN) range at most sites, and at many sites even surpassed the upper limit of the CLN range. No, or minor, exceedances of the critical loads for N were found only at remote sites at higher elevation in the Central Alps. Annual inorganic N deposition between 2000 and 2017 revealed a significant decline in oxidised N compounds at four of five sites (-1.6-1.8% per year), but reduced compounds only decreased at two sites (-1% and -1.4% per year) and even increased at one site (+1.2% per year), despite adopted abatement strategies for agricultural practices. This emphasises that most sensitive ecosystems in Switzerland continue to be exposed to excessive N loads through atmospheric deposition, with detrimental consequences for the biodiversity and stability of these ecosystems.

AB A dew condenser was used to collect dew and frost samples to investigate the chemical properties of dew water for comparison with frost, rain and fog in Nanjing, China during the 2016-2017 winter. Twenty-three separate ambient dew samples were collected at a grassland site in suburban Nanjing, China, from 1st November 2016 to 20th January 2017. Six frost samples, two fog water samples and 13 rainwater samples were also collected for comparative study. Cations (Na+, Ca2+, NH4+, K+, and Mg2+), anions (NO3-, NO2-, Cl-, SO42-, and F-) and pH were detected and measured in all wet depositional samples. In addition, seven kinds of water-soluble ions (WSIs) in atmospheric fine particulates (PM2.5) and atmospheric gas (SO2 and NH3) concentrations were investigated. The field study elucidated that dew water resembles frost water, with WSIs ranked in the order of Ca2+ > NH4+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ for cations and SO42- > NO3- > Cl- > NO2- > F- for anions. Most dew and frost samples were alkaline and not as acidic as the rainwater and fog water samples. The mean concentrations of various ions and total ionic content (TIC) in the fog samples were the highest, while the ion concentration ranges in the dew, rain and frost samples were similar. The neutralization strength decreased in the order of NH4+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ for the fog samples and decreased in the order of Ca2+ > NH4+ > Mg2+ > K+ for the dew, frost and rainwater samples. A high pairwise correlation between K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ was observed, which means these cations shared a common crustal source. The SO42-, NO2- and Cl- ions were closely correlated, indicating that the ions were released simultaneously from anthropogenic sources. The low and negative correlations among the NO3-, SO42- and NH4+ ions in the dew water and PM2.5 may imply that fine-mode aerosols have little impact on the composition of dew, which means that the dew water component was dominated by coarse-mode aerosols. The NH3 in the atmosphere plays an important role in dew water due to the strong relationship between NH3 and NH4+.

AB Ground-level ozone (O-3) is a major air pollutant which is strongly links to weather conditions. To our knowledge, there are few analysis of O-3 behavior in Caribbean region. The aim of this paper is to study the correlation between O-3 and meteorological parameters (i.e., solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed) in a multi-scale way. Firstly, we estimate their Fourier power spectra and consider their scaling properties in the physical space. The power spectra computed follows a power law behavior for all datasets. Thereafter, the multiple scale dynamics and the correlations between simultaneous measurements of O-3 and meteorological parameters was analyzed using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based methods. After EMD decomposition of each time series, we investigate their local correlations using a new cross-correlation technique termed Time Dependent Intrinsic Correlation method (TDIC). The time evolution and the scale dependence of their correlation are determined at different time scales and for different intrinsic modes functions. All measured TDICs have highlighted strong correlations between O-3 and meteorological parameters. The impact of weather conditions (e.g., drought, rainfall, windy period) have been locally observed on O-3 formation for all the time scales. This study shows that TDIC method is a powerful tool for perform multi-scale cross-correlation analysis in air pollution field.

AB Proteinaceous compounds are particularly interesting because of their ubiquity and importance in many atmospheric processes. We investigated hydrolyzed amino acid (HAA), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations in precipitation samples collected in a suburban site in Guiyang over a 12 month period. Annually averaged total HAA, DON, NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were 3.7 mu mol L-1, 151.1 mu mol L-1, 68.9 mu mol L-1 and 117.3 mu mol L-1, respectively. Regarding the HAAs in precipitation, glutamic acid, glycine and proline were present in relatively high concentrations, followed by aspartic acid and alanine. The concentrations of total HAAs in precipitation showed a clear seasonal cycle, with a minimum level in winter and a maximum level in spring. Based on seasonal variations of total HAAs together with back-trajectory analysis, the air mass origins did not significantly impact the precipitation HAA levels. The NO3- concentrations recorded a better positive correlation (P < 0.01) with both the DON and total HAA concentrations than the NH4+ concentrations, possibly revealing that the sources for precipitation amino acids in suburban Guiyang were more linked with NO3- sources (from biomass burning, microbial activities and agricultural activities) than with NH4+ sources (from biomass burning and agricultural activities). In particular, in some specific periods, such as spring, abundant pollen releases may have been responsible for the relatively high precipitation amino acid concentrations. The average air temperature and the highest air temperature showed a positive correlation with the total HAA levels in precipitation. Clearly, the increase in precipitation total HAAs with higher air temperatures may indicate the enhanced temperature-induced degradation of high molecular weight atmospheric proteinaceous matter. Moreover, the volume-weighted precipitation glycine and total HAA levels were positively correlated with the product of atmospheric ozone and nitrogen dioxide, indicating that atmospheric proteinaceous matter may be inextricably bound up with both ozone- and nitrogen dioxide-related atmospheric processes. In conclusion, this study improves current knowledge on the origins and atmospheric processes of atmospheric proteinaceous compounds.

TI An uncertainty for clean air: Air quality modeling implications of

AB Recent literature has shown that volatile organic compound (VOC) emission inventories for urban regions may be substantially underestimated. In particular, non-transportation sources including volatile chemical products (VCP) are increasing in relative importance due to both the current and historical focus on controlling transportation emissions. These findings have major implications for photo-chemical air quality modeling used to determine appropriate and effective regulatory controls to meet limits for primary and secondary pollutants. Using a regional air quality model, we quantify the changes in ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) simulated for updated VOC emissions reported in the recent literature relative to a baseline inventory for California. Results show that simulated maximum 8-hr ozone concentrations could increase by 17.4 ppb in summer and by 15.6 ppb in winter, and the 24-hr maximum PM2.5 could increase by 7.8 mu g/m(3) in winter. Impacts reflect differences in the spatial location of VCP source emissions relative to those for transportation. However, compared to measurement data, model performance is not substantially improved by the adjustment of VOC emissions of current sources. In brief, augmented VOC emission inventories impact simulated concentrations of pollutants, but may not improve the performance of models used for the design of emission control policy without more refined representation of missing VCPs sources in the inventory.

AB A field experiment was conducted to assess the accuracy of the backward Lagrangian stochastic (BLS) model combined with an open-path tunable diode laser (OPTDL) system for estimating ammonia emissions from rice field by comparing with the micrometeorological mass balance (MMB) method. During the experimental period, the average height of rice was 0.65 m, and the average height of laser path was 1.3 m. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the ammonia emission rates estimated by the two methods, indicating no significant effect of tall rice on the accuracy of the BLS model. The high temporal resolution data showed that ammonia emissions had a dramatic diurnal cycle: rise at daytime and fall at night. Although the OPTDL technique was not able to measure ammonia concentrations at low emission rates due to relatively high detection limit, the total ammonia loss estimated by the BLS model was not significant different from that of the MMB method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BLS model with the OPTDL technique for estimating ammonia emissions from farmland covered with tall vegetation. Within the acceptable accuracy, the relatively low laser path height is recommended for farmland with tall vegetation due to relatively high detection limit of the OPTDL technique and low ammonia concentration of farmland.

AB Biomass burning is an important source of atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols, and its emissions can be estimated using Fire Radiative Power (FRP) retrievals from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites. Accurate and timely estimation of biomass-burning emissions (BBE) requires high-spatiotemporal-resolution FRP that is characterized by accurate diurnal FRP cycle. This study is to estimate hourly reliable BBE in a 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees grid across the conterminous United States (CONUS) to be used in chemical transport models for air quality forecast. To do this, this study for the first time fused FRP retrievals from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) with those from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 after GOES FRP was angularly adjusted and was further calibrated against MODIS FRP. The FRP data was obtained from Terra and Aqua MODIS 1 km active fire products with fire observations of four times a day and from 4 km GOES WF_ABBA (WildFire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm) fire products for GOES-W (GOES-11 and 15) and GOES-E (GOES-13) with observations every 5-15 min across the CONUS from 2011 to 2015. The diurnal FRP cycles at an interval of 15 min for a grid were reconstructed using the ecosystem-specific diurnal FRP climatology and actually available MODIS-GOES fused FRP, which were applied to estimate hourly BBE across the CONUS. The results indicate that the reconstructed diurnal FRP cycle varied significantly in magnitude and shape among 45 CONUS ecosystems. The biomass burning released 717 Gg particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) in the CONUS each year; however, it presented significant temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual) and spatial variations. Finally, the BBE estimates were evaluated using available data sources and compared well (a difference of similar to 4%) with emissions derived from Landsat burned areas in the western CONUS and with hourly carbon monoxide emissions simulated using a biogeochemical model over the Rim Fire in California (difference < 1%). The BBE estimates showed similar seasonal variation to six available BBE inventories but with variable magnitude.

AB The expansion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) may potentially impact regional isoprene emissions. Modeling based on field measurements is an effective approach for assessing the potential impact of the moso bamboo expansion. The G93 algorithm is one of the most widely used models, however no studies have tested the applicability of the algorithm for moso bamboo isoprene emission. This study was undertaken to establish a model for reproducing moso bamboo isoprene emission fluxes. To this aim, this study examined 1) the isoprene emission ability of moso bamboo, and 2) its responses to environmental factors such as leaf temperature and light. We also tested 3) the reproducibility of the G93 algorithm for moso bamboo isoprene emission fluxes. This study used a chamber method with a modified photosynthesis system and carbon absorbents to quantify isoprene emitted from bamboo leaves in central Taiwan under the humid subtropical climate. First, we screened isoprene emission from 12 bamboo species, and the results confirmed that moso bamboo exhibited significant isoprene emission potential. Second, we measured isoprene emission fluxes from moso bamboo leaves with light controls every month from summer to spring. The isoprene emission fluxes increased with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD); under sufficient PPFD conditions, the seasonal changes in the isoprene emission fluxes were regulated by leaf temperature, and low isoprene emission fluxes were found in low leaf temperature conditions. Thirdly, overestimations were observed in the G93 algorithm with the original parameters in periods with leaf temperatures < 23 degrees C. Using the G93 algorithm with site-specific parameters could improve the overestimation in the low-temperature period. This study suggests the necessity of parameterization in the G93 algorithm to reproduce the suppression of isoprene emission fluxes from moso bamboo leaves in the low-temperature period.

AB The feedback between ambient aerosols and planetary boundary layer (PBL) meteorology has been proven to play a critical role in the enhancement of haze pollution. Vertical distribution of aerosols as well as temperature stratification are vital to understand aerosol - boundary layer interaction (ABI) and its impact on air quality deterioration. In current regional air quality models, the default vertical grid setting is relatively coarse and decreases progressively with altitude. However, the ABI is sensitive to aerosol layer at specific altitudes, i.e. around the top of PBL. This work aims to explore optimized vertical grid setting for better characterizing ABI and its role in air quality degradation. A single column model (SCM) is used for sensitivity tests considering the balance between model performance and computational cost. This optimized grid setting is then applied in three-dimensional air quality modelling in eastern China. Compared with default configuration, the optimized one is demonstrated to perform much better in characterizing temperature stratification and extreme fine particle (PM2.5) concentration as well as its diurnal variation during haze episodes. Specifically, the averaged decrease in PBL height and increment in surface PM2.5 concentration are about 5% and 20% while applying optimized setting, thereby reducing the mean bias from 30 to 5 mu g/m(3) in PM2.5 concentration. The improvements could be attributed mainly to more accurate profiles of aerosol and its heating effect, and thus stabilized lower atmosphere. The optimization of vertical grid setting could be applied to areas with high concentration of absorbing aerosols such as eastern China and India, which could help better predict extreme near-surface pollution episodes.

AB Spatial-temporal characteristics of the air quality including size-segregated particulate matter (PM) portions and ozone (O-3) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong -Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China are analyzed using daily observational data during 2015-2017. A big picture of multiple years' in situ observational air quality in GSA is provided. A collection of three neighboring cities Foshan (FS), Guangzhou (GZ), and Dongguan (DG), referred to as FGD, on average has the worst air quality in GBA, mostly due to the heavy primary emissions and high chance of secondary pollutant productions and accumulations. The air quality in FGD generally has a significant seasonal cycle which is influenced by the East Asian Monsoon and modulated by ENSO. Different cities have different prominent air quality issues and there are special multi-scale characteristics in PM2.5 at FS, O-3 at DG, and PM(2.5-10 )at DG. The inter-city differences of multi-scale air quality variations in FGD could be attributed to both sources and meteorology. For example, DG has extremely high O-3 (especially in 2015) and PM2.5/PM10 but relatively low PM, and PM2.5-10 at DG has strong 2-3 days' oscillation but weak seasonal oscillation. The special air quality characteristics at DG might be attributed to combined effects of the different ventilation and dilution consequences of the sea-land breeze to different air quality components which have different three-dimensional source distributions. Through a combined multi-scale lag correlation analysis of air quality, some prior air quality components (with different leading time on different scales) are identified as potential indicators for statistic air quality prediction.

AB We have analysed the impact of the North Atlantic jet on the winter PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) concentrations in Europe during a 10-year period. For this purpose we have extracted the daily latitude and strength of the jet from a reanalysis dataset and surface PM10 observations from the AirBase network. We show that the detection of the jet over the eastern North Atlantic (0 degrees-15 degrees W) is preferred compared to the whole North Atlantic basin as this maximises the signal on the PM10 concentrations. Four preferred jet positions have been identified over that region and season: southern (south of 41 degrees N), central-southern (between 41 degrees N and 51 degrees N), central-northern (between 51 degrees N and 63 degrees N) and northern (north of 63 degrees N). According to our results, the jet latitude exerts a stronger influence than the jet strength on the mean PM10 levels. We also examine the impact of the jet positions on the full distribution of PM10 as well as on the odds of PM10 extremes (exceedances of the local winter 95th percentiles). The latter is done through a logistic regression model which considers the effect of the persistence of extremes and different time lags for the jet position. The northern position is associated with enhanced PM10 concentrations (on average similar to 9 mu g m(-3)) over northwestern/central Europe and threefold increases in the odds of PM10 extremes at most sites in the region. Similar increases have been found for PM10 in southern Europe when the jet is in its central-northern position. In both cases, the rise in the PM10 concentrations is associated with anticyclonic conditions over those regions and the impact on PM10 extremes is maximised for time lags of around 1-2 days. On the other hand, the central-southern and southern jet positions yield large PM10 decreases (on average around similar to 9 mu g m(-3)) in northwestern/central Europe and southern Europe, respectively.

AB In the present study, the toxicological profile of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with airborne particulate matter (PM) was assessed. The average concentration of both PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Amongst 13 analyzed PAHs, Naphthalene (Nap) was found to be the most dominant in both size fraction of PM whereas Indeno (1, 2, 3-cd) pyrene (IP) exhibited the least concentration. The relative % distribution of Low molecular weight (LMW) three ring PAHs were found to be predominant in both sized PM. The combined results derived from diagnostic ratios and factor analysis suggested that the vehicular emission (Diesel + gasoline) and coal combustion in the vicinity of study province are probable sources of PM bound PAHs. Maximum contribution towards the carcinogenicity has been found for Benzo (a) pyrene [B(a)p] for both size PM. The cytotoxic profile of PAHs determined by MTT assay demonstrated significant decrease in cell viability and PAHs associated with PM10 samples exhibited higher cytotoxic response. The redox activity measured by DTT assay exhibited the oxidative nature of PAHs associated with both sized PM. The interaction study between the PAHs and BSA resulted in substantial decrease in fluorescence intensity of BSA, indicating that PM bound PAHs could quench intrinsic fluorescence of the protein through successive molecular interaction and further conformational changes of protein was confirmed by circular dichroism spectra. Results obtained in the present study provide a valuable approach to evaluate the toxicological profile of PAHs encountered in the atmosphere of Pune.

AB Intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) in outdoor air have been reported in recent years with focus on characterizing IVOCs and their contributions to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Little has been studied on the different behaviors of IVOCs in particulate matter (PM) dominated winter pollution weather and ozone (O-3) dominated summer pollution weather. In this study, we collected and analyzed outdoor airborne IVOCs in an urban location in Shanghai during PM dominated pollution events in winter (ten samples) and O-3 dominated pollution events in summer (22 samples). IVOCs were categorized into n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and unspeciated complex mixture (UCM) that includes unspeciated branched alkanes (b-alkanes) and other unidentified IVOCs. In winter samples total IVOCs concentrations were up to 114 mu g/m(3) and UCM IVOCs accounted for 91% +/- 3%, while in summer samples total IVOCs concentrations were only up to 17.2 mu g/m(3) and UCM accounted for 69% +/- 14%. The average concentration of primary IVOCs which are directly from emission sources, was 35.1 +/- 16.1 mu g/m(3) and 4.0 +/- 2.2 mu g/m(3) in winter and summer, respectively. IVOCs were found to have statistically significant positive correlations with PM (PM2.5, PM10) but not with O-3 in both winter and summer samples. Statistically significantly inverse relationships between O-3 and C-12-C-14 n-alkanes and between O-3 and two to three rings PAHs in summer samples were observed, indicating that these relatively more volatile IVOCs might be actively involved in atmospheric photochemical reactions in the atmosphere in summer. Our study revealed different behaviors of IVOCs in winter and summer pollution events in Shanghai; however, more research is needed to better understand the contribution of IVOCs to SOA, and the underlying photochemical reactions of IVOCs during O-3 dominated air pollution events.

ID MONITORING-SYSTEM; FIELD CALIBRATION; POLLUTION
AB Low-cost air quality sensors measuring air quality at fine spatio-temporal resolutions, typically suffer from sensor drift and interference. Field calibration is typically performed at one location, while little is known about the spatial transferability of correction factors. We evaluated three calibration methods using a year of hourly nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from low-cost sensors, collocated at two sites with a conventional monitor as reference: (1) an iterative Bayesian approach for daily estimation of the parameters in a multiple linear regression model, (2) a daily updated correction factor and (3) a correction factor updated only when concentrations are uniformly low. We compared the performance of the calibration methods in terms of temporal stability, spatial transferability, and sensor specificity. We documented drift within the 1-year period. The correction factor updated under uniformly low concentrations performed poorly. The iterative Bayesian approach and daily correction factor reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 21-46% at the calibration locations, but did not reduce RMSE at the other location. By examining the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients, we found that the poor spatial transferability is consistent with different responses of individual sensors to environmental factors. We conclude that the spatial and temporal variability in the calibration parameters requires them to be updated regularly, including sensor-specific recalibrations.

AB Architectural limestone surfaces are particularly susceptible to decay from natural and anthropogenic acidifying gases and particulates. This investigation evaluates environmental conditions, air quality, and decay patters on Istria stone surfaces of four palaces in Venice (Italy): Ca' Bembo, Ca' Bottacin, Ca' Foscari, Ca' Dolfin. Climate parameters and air quality indicators are used to discuss the atmospheric influence on limestone and to calculate the related theoretical recession rate. Graphic assessment, surface profiling, digital microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray fluorescence are used to assess stone surface textures and degradation patterns associated with stone decay. The morphological analysis via surface profiling using silicon mould, digitization and statistical analysis of the roughness is proposed for the assessment of stone deterioration. In particular, the methodology is used for understanding stone morphological variations in relation to parameters such as sites, exposure (sheltered or exposed area), and location (overlooking a Canal or inner court).
   In relation to increasing rain amount and intensity, decreasing SO2 and increasing NOx concentrations, theoretical limestone recession rate compatible with an urban environment (around 8 mu m/year) are calculated. The morphological analysis of the sites evidences the role of the stone original texture and finish, the facade location and the specific exposure on the formation of crusts or eroded area. Buildings not recently restored (Ca' Bottacin and Ca' Bembo) present thick dendritic crusts, in particular on court side and in sheltered positions. Ca' Foscari surfaces, subjected to cleaning intervention after 2000s, show thin grey crust only in sheltered areas, reflecting the reduced presence of SO2. Large eroded areas have been found on exposed surfaces in relation to the rain wash-out action and to high levels of NOx.

AB Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS, 23.47 degrees N, 120.87 degrees E; 2862 m above sea level).at the summit of Mount Lulin in central Taiwan was established in spring 2006 and is the only high-altitude background station over western Pacific region in East Asia to study the impact of various air pollutants through long-range transport. Continuous in-situ measurements of equivalent black carbon (EBC) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were made at LABS from June 2012 to May 2014 and their association was investigated in this study. The highest monthly concentration of EBC (median; 840 ng m(-3)) and CO (212 ppbv) in March were primarily attributed to the westerly winds coupled with biomass-burning (BB) emissions from Southeast Asia (SEA) region. The association of EBC and CO was weak at LABS possibly due to the influence of dissimilar air masses from various sources, and scavenging or dilution of EBC during the long-range atmospheric transport to Mt. Lulin. The mean Delta EBC/Delta CO ratio (slope of least-squares regression line of Delta EBC-Delta CO scatterplot; where Delta indicates surplus amounts with respect to the background value) was found the most significant in March (5.3 ng m(-3) ppbv(-1) or 7.3 x 10(-3) g of carbon as EBC per gram of carbon as CO). On the basis of episodic cases, the mean Delta EBC/Delta CO ratios at LABS were estimated to be 6.1, 8.0, and 2.4 ng m(-3) ppbv(-1) for SEA BB emissions, southern China mixed pollution, and northern China mixed pollution, respectively. A total of 32% loss in EBC aerosols (6.4% of EBC removal per day) was estimated for the atmospheric transport of BB emissions from SEA region to LABS. This study provides needful information to understand the Delta EBC/Delta CO ratios at a remote site and would be used in model simulations to evaluate BC aging and scavenging over western Pacific region in East Asia.

AB The diurnal variations of haze properties are essential in understanding the haze pollution formation and its environmental impact. Ground-based measurements can provide this information with high temporal resolution, but the haze measurements are not spatially continuous. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor onboard the next-generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 can provide haze properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, the diurnal variations of haze frequency, haze properties [aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE) and fine-particle ratio (RF)] and cloud cover are jointly analyzed over the North China Plain (NCP) for summer and winter seasons during 2015-2017. Both the haze and cloud scheme and the haze properties are well validated. The results reveal that the haze frequency in winter (33.51%) is much higher than that in summer (6.34%), and the diurnal variations of AOD values in winter (0.2-0.9) are stronger than those in summer (0.5-0.9). The diurnal maximum haze frequency values in summer (16:00 p.m.) occur 3 h later than the most severe pollution (13:00 p.m.), with AOD values of 0.7-0.9, AE values of 1.1-1.2 and RF values of 0.5-0.6. In winter, the haze frequency increases from 9:00 to 15:00. However, no typical diurnal variations of AOD, AE and RF are shown. It is also found that haze frequency exhibits opposite diurnal variations compared with those of clouds.

AB Visibility can be used as a highly relevant visual indicator of the air pollution level. Published data on the correlations between visibility and health outcomes are very limited in China, and the health effects of slight haze on the human body have not been clarified. A semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to assess the acute health effects of visibility on respiratory-cardiovascular mortality in Beijing, China. The correlation between visibility and PM2.5 as well as the contributions of PM2.5 to the health effects of visibility were analysed. Stratification model was employed to investigate the health effects of slight haze. The mortality risk of impaired visibility on the current exposure day peaked and was statistically significant for all the mortality outcomes. Every 1 km decrease in visibility corresponded to a 0.78% (95% CI: 0.62-0.95%) increase in total respiratory mortality and 0.54% (95% CI: 0.45-0.61%) increase in total cardiovascular mortality. Older people (age >= 65) were at a higher risk than the younger age group under impaired visibility. PM2.5 had a negative logarithmic relationship relative to visibility. After adjustment for PM2.5, the risk estimates for both respiratory and cardiovascular mortality reduced. Short-term exposure to low visibility was significantly associated with increased respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in Beijing. The health risk of impaired visibility was particularly high, even in slight haze. The hazardous effects of visibility can be partially attributed to the effects of PM2.5. These results can provide useful reference for relevant agencies to determine whether an adjustment to the haze warning level is warranted. Our findings indicate that visibility can be used as an alternative indicator for air quality assessments if air pollution data are insufficient or not available, particularly in developing countries.

AB Limited by scarce observations, the sources and transport of aerosols over Central Asia are relatively unclear. In this study, using Terra and Aqua satellite images, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite observations and meteorological reanalyze data, the distribution, source and transport of aerosols over Central Asia are investigated. We find that there are 227 aerosol events occurred in Central Asia during 2000-2017_ and the aerosols which can be transported from outside to Central Asia are dominated by dust and smoke (organic carbon and black carbon) particles. Statistical analyses show that the contribution of the sources outside of Central Asia (76 times) to all aerosol events (122 times) is greater than that of local emissions in Central Asia (46 times) in the spring and summer during 2000-2017. The smoke events (39 times), sourcing from Russia and Europe with strong northwest wind, account for 51.3% of total aerosol events contributed by sources outside of Central Asia. Additionally, the dust events (37 times), which mainly source from the northern Arabia Peninsula and North Africa with strong southwest wind, account for 48.7% of the total aerosol events contributed by the sources outside of Central Asia. On the contrary, the contribution of local emissions in Central Asia (90 times) to all aerosol events (105 times) is greater than that of outside sources (15 times) in the autumn and winter. Result of clustering analyses for all 157 aerosol events during 2005-2017 is in agreement with the conclusion of statistical analyses based on observations. This study can provide some evidence to understand the aerosol properties over the Central Asia.

AB In this study, the effects of ozone (O-3) on the physiology of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea var. furfuracea previously subjected to field stressing conditions were assessed. Samples collected in a pristine site were exposed for 6 weeks at 3 sites characterized by different pollution, e.g. elemental and PAH depositions (site RU, close to wood-burning house chimneys; site UI, close to cast-ironworks; site CK, in a semi-natural context). Afterwards, samples were transferred to controlled fumigation chambers, where they were either O-3-treated for 2 weeks (250 ppb O-3 for 5 h day(-1), O-3(+) samples) or not (0 ppb O-3, O-3(-) samples). Three physiological markers (F-v/F-m, maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry; MDA, malondialdehyde content; potassium leakage) as well as elemental and PAH concentrations were measured in matched sets of sample replicates at each experimental step. Data were explored by multivariate techniques and the effects of field exposure and fumigation were tested by generalized linear models (GLM). Detrimental effects on MDA and F-v/F-m were observed limited to samples exposed in RU and UI sites. Physiological parameters in O-3-treated samples showed heterogeneous variation patterns with respect to field-exposed ones. A recovery of F-v/F-m was observed in RU- and UI-exposed samples, whereas a significant increase of MDA was highlighted limited to CKO3+ and CK O-3(-) samples, possibly related to a "chamber effect". Overall, the impairment caused by ozonation was limited, proving the strong Or tolerance of our test species. Interestingly, the content of the most abundant 4-ring PAHs in RU O-3(+) samples, which underwent the highest field enrichment of PAHs, was significantly lower than that of matched RU O-3(-) samples. This suggested a possible role of ozone in degrading PAHs at thallus level, with interesting interpretative repercussions in the context of transplant-based surveys aimed at evaluating PAH depositions when O-3 ground levels are high.

AB In this study, PM2.5 airborne particulate matter was collected over a full year at a costal site of the Central Mediterranean Sea and analysed for its chemical composition and oxidative potential (OP), determined by the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the ascorbic acid (AA) assays. In autumn-winter, the volume normalized oxidative OP (OPV) were 0.29 +/- 0.03 nmol min(-1) m(-3) and 0.21 +/- 0.03 nmol min(-1) m(-3) for the DTT (OPVDTT ) and AA (OPVAA) assay, respectively. In spring-summer the OPVDTT values were higher than OPVAA responses, i.e., 0.19 +/- 0.02 nmol min(-1) m(-3) vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 nmol min(-1) m(-3). Overall, marked seasonality was observed with higher values in Autumn-Winter (AW) than in Spring-Summer (SS), i.e., 1.5 and 2.3 times increase for OPVDTT and OPVAA, respectively.
   In the cold season, the OPV activity was broadly correlated with metals and carbon species, such as K+, NO3-, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, P, V, OC, EC, Acetate, Oxalate and Glycolate (p < 0.05). This suggested the main contribution of a "mixed anthropogenic" source, consisting of the biomass burning (K+, OC and EC) and traffic (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, V, EC) emissions. In SS, OPV was significantly correlated with only few species i.e., OC, EC, Cu, and NO3-, suggesting main association with the "mixed anthropogenic" and the "reacted dust" sources.
   For each sampling day, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were simultaneously collected and analysed to investigate the variation of the OP activity in relation with the particle size and chemical composition.
   OPVDTT in values exhibited a poor particle-size dependence, with similar values close to 0.20 +/- 0.04 nmol min(-1) M-3 in both fractions. This could be explained by the association of OPVDTT with species mainly accumulated in the fine fraction, i.e., OC, POC and EC and K+. Otherwise, the OPVAA responses exhibited a clear particle-size dependence, with significantly higher values for PM10 than for PM2.5, i.e., 0.35 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.03 nmol min(-1) M-3 in AW and 0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 in SS. This may be supported by the strong correlation of OPVAA with Cu and Fe, which were most abundant metals in the PM10 fraction.
   The data of specific monitoring days were investigated in detail to better highlight the impact of some individual redox active species on the OP(V)(DTT)and OPVAA responses.The oxidative potential of PM2.5 and PM10 samples was assessed with Dithiothreitol and Ascorbic Acid assays: the variation of OP responses was related with the PM size and chemical composition.

AB Open bio-mass burning plays an important role in the formation of heavy pollution events during harvest seasons in China by releasing the trace gases and particulate matters into the atmosphere. A better understanding of spatial-temporal variations of open bio-mass burning in China is required to assess its impacts on the air quality and especially on the heavy haze pollution. The MODIS fire spots data and the calculated burned areas were used in this research, which shows the varying number of fire spots in China from 2013 to 2017, with the highest in 2014 and the lowest in 2016. Meanwhile, the fire spots were found mainly concentrated in three key periods (March-April, June and October-November) and two zones (Zone 1 and Zone 2) with inter-annual variations of burned areas. In addition, the contribution of major vegetation types burning was studied, the cropland occupied the largest proportion of burned area of more than 70% in any period time, followed by forest. Finally, from the perspective of climate and human activities, the causes of inter-annual variations were discussed. By comparing the average temperature and precipitation in the two zones from 2013 to 2017, it was found that the burned forest area is positively correlated with the average temperature of the zones and negatively correlated with the average precipitation. Meanwhile, the relationship between the El Nino events and the bio-mass burning was discussed.

AB Relationships between meteorological factors and airborne fungal spore concentrations at high altitudes are virtually unknown. We used cross-correlation analyses to test the relationships between daily variation in meteorological factors (i.e., temperature, humidity and wind speed) and airborne spore concentration, diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) and evenness (Pielou index) in an Apennine high altitude site (Gran Sasso Massif, 2117 m elevation). Daily average concentration of spores in this high altitude site was much lower than that observed at a low altitude site in the same area, which can be explained by the environmental conditions at high altitudes. We found that diversity and evenness tended to be negatively correlated with temperature and positively with humidity and wind speed with some delay, whereas abundance tended to be positively correlated with temperature and wind, but negatively with humidity. These relationships can be explained by the fact that rain increases turnover by removing dry spores of Cladosporium (the most abundant taxon) and aerosolizing wet ones. The high dominance of the most abundant taxon is a reflection of the extreme climatic conditions at high altitudes.

AB We present a new method for the evaluation of field measurements of atmospheric dispersion at the smallest resolvable time scales. Our method has its origins in the distance-neighbour functions defined by Richardson as well as the auto correlations, spatial correlations and cross correlations commonly used in the turbulence community. We show that a robust quantification of the puff duration can be achieved, which is comparable to the puff duration derived by a dosage-based approach. The new method gives reasonable results without the need to apply thresholds when the concentration measurement is very noisy, which is very advantageous in the context of field measurements.

AB The hygroscopicity and phase state of atmospheric aerosols, depending on relative humidity (RH), dominate their impacts on global climate and heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry. It is challenging to achieve full course measurements on hygroscopic mass growth factors (MGFs), deliquescence relative humidity (DRH), efflorescence relative humidity (ERH) and efflorescence kinetics of aerosols at different ambient RH, which concerns the gas, liquid and solid phases. The combination of a rapid scan vacuum FTIR and a RH pulsed controlling system allowed us to directly and synchronously determine ambient RH and MGFs of aerosols, as well as nucleation rates in the efflorescence process with a subsecond time resolution. With an excellent signalto-noise ratio and high time resolution spectra, the vacuum FTIR method allowed for real-time in situ measurements of water partitioning between gas and particle phases as it changed with RH, as well as the ratio between the number of crystallized aerosol droplets and the total number of particles during the efflorescence of aerosols. The hygroscopicity and efflorescence kinetics of NaCl and (NH4)(2)SO4 aerosols were studied in linear RH change mode and in pulsed RH change mode. The measured MGF values, DRH and ERH agreed well with theoretical data from the Extended Aerosol Inorganic Model (EAIM) and literature for both the linear and pulsed RH change modes. In addition, the pulsed RH mode also provided both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation rates for NaCl and (NH4)(2)SO4 aerosols. There were significant advantages of the vacuum FTIR method combined with the pulsed RH controlling technique. First, the RH was continuously changed and was determined in real-time with a time resolution of 0.12 s in the pulsed mode. During the RH change process, the water content in the aerosols was measured synchronously with the same time resolution, allowing for high-efficiency measurements of MGFs, ERH and DRH. The deviations of measured MGFs from the EAIM predictions in the RH range of 75-55% were less than +/- 3.3%. Second, FTIR spectroscopy was sensitive to phase transitions, which provided quantitative information on the ratio of the number of aerosols transformed from droplets to solid particles at ERH, allowing for the measurement of nucleation kinetics during the efflorescence of aerosols.

AB Ground-based two-dimensional (2D) Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were collected continuously from June 2015 to May 2016 in Hefei, China. The spatial distribution of NO2 concentrations showed that more air pollution was present in eastern and southeastern direction from the study site, and these areas were located in the center of the city and economic developing zone. The seasonal variations of NO2 concentrations were distinct, and the highest levels were detected in winter, while the lowest levels were detected in summer. The mean concentration of NO2 during the heating season (November-March of the following year) was 6.56 ppbv, while that during the non-heating season (April-October) was 4 ppbv. The highest concentrations of NO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and PM2.5 were all observed during the heating season. The results from the potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis suggested that NO2 pollution in the summer was caused primarily by long-range transport from the east, while that in winter showed significant local influences. By combining the analyses of meteorological trajectory pressure profiles and aerosol optical depths (AODs), the sources of NO2 during the heating season were found to be mainly local emissions, while those during the non-heating season were mainly from long-range transportation.

AB Following our simulation results in Part I (Song and Zhao, 2019), in this study we continued to analyze pollutant dispersion patterns and exposure levels when a fleet of vehicles passed through a 450-m long tunnel by employing the Realizable k-epsilon model and pollutant transport equation together with the dynamic mesh technique. The same 450-m-long tunnel model with a 450-m extension from the outlet in the driveway direction in Part I was developed; it contained 36 gasoline-powered vehicles in nine rows with four vehicles per row. The transient pollutant dispersion profiles were validated by comparing the simulation results to field-measurement data in a real tunnel. The simulation results show that volume-averaged CO and NOx concentrations inside the tunnel were less than the exposure limit in China (150 ppm for CO and 1 ppm for NOx) at 60 km/h and 40 km/h, which is in accordance with the study in Part I. However, in the breathing zone (0.5-1.5 m in height), accumulated pollutants and averaged CO and NOx concentrations were 0.85-2.44 times the exposure limit in China, even at 60 km/h and 40 km/h. The personal intake fraction (P_IF) CO and NOx values inside the tunnel in this study were at least an order of magnitude higher than those outdoors, including in Beijing, Hong Kong, and the US urban areas. The results indicate that occupant exposure risk is relatively high inside the tunnel and ventilation systems should continue to work to decrease the exposure levels in the breathing zone, even when vehicles move at medium or high speeds inside the tunnel.

AB Hopanes are useful molecular markers for tracking airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with vehicular exhaust in receptor models. However, they undergo atmospheric degradation. This causes deviations from the underlying assumption of mass conservation in receptor models and leads to biased estimation for source contributions. Little work has been conducted to account for this issue in receptor modelling. In this study, we analyzed the PM2.5 chemical speciation data including C-27-C-31 hopanes from two urban sites in the Pearl River Delta region, China. We developed an approach using ambient-to-source ratio of hopane homologues to show evidence of hopane degradation. Organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 were then apportioned using the chemical mass balance (CMB) model, with the emphasis on considering hopane degradation. We applied a set of volatility-dependent degradation factors to correct for the loss, and determined the extent of degradation through identifying the statistically optimal CMB solution. The results reveal that neglecting hopane degradation would underestimate the primary vehicular OC and PM2.5 contributions by similar to 55% in warm season and by similar to 35% in cold season in our subtropical study region. The method developed in this work could be used to improve accuracy of vehicular source contribution estimation in other urban locations.

AB This study presents that increases in atmospheric CO2 levels impact the ventilation and energy in buildings. The most significant impact of ventilation occurs during use, because of the indoor air quality. According to the 2014 IPCC report, observed atmospheric CO2 levels increased at a rate of 1.9-2.1 ppm per year. This study measured CO2 levels in a building in an urban area in Shanghai, China, and analyzed existing ventilation performance and energy simulation in relation to the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As long as the atmospheric CO2 level increased, the outdoor airflow rate had to increase also to maintain an acceptable indoor CO2 level. The ventilation rate was also considered in relation to the surrounding environment. In Shanghai, the average value of CO2 concentrations on an auto road was 550 +/- 20 ppm and the average value on a pedestrian road was 435 +/- 15 ppm. A building that was surrounded by high traffic roads needed 20-30% more outdoor airflow rate than a building surrounded by pedestrian roads. Accordingly, energy loads in buildings, for heating and cooling were also affected. In order to dilute indoor CO2 level, the thermal ventilation energy and the ventilation energy uniformly provided a 20% energy load increase during the 12 months, while each monthly energy load varied, depending on the season and/or month. By analyzing indoor CO2 levels and the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, this study determined how these rises impacted the energy consumption of the building, and how to design a new outdoor airflow supply rate to adapt to a changed environmental condition.

AB Effective reduction strategies for fine particles (PM2.5) in areas downwind of Asian continental outflows require quantification of regional and local contributions to PM2.5. To quantify the chemical compositions of long-range transported and locally produced aerosol particles during a severe haze episode, aerosol particles were collected at a remote background site in Baengnyeong Island (BN) and an inland urban site in Daejeon (DJ) in the Republic of Korea from 7 February to 6 March 2014. Aerosol samples were analyzed for PM2.5, inorganic ions, carbonaceous species, and heavy metals. During a severe haze episode (EP) from 22 February to 1 March 2014, elevated PM2.5 concentrations of 73.3 +/- 18.3 mu g m(-3) and 74.9 +/- 14.3 mu g m(-3) were measured at the BN and DJ sites, respectively. Although both sites were influenced by long-range transported haze from China, SO(4)(2-)was determined to be the most abundant species at the BN site during the EP period with an average of 29.9 +/- 11.5 mu g m(-3), whereas NO3- was the most abundant species at the DJ site with an average of 20.9 +/- 5.4 mu g m(-3). Low NO2 concentrations (2.6 +/- 1.9 ppb) and a northwesterly air-mass trajectory suggest that most air pollutants at the BN site underwent long-range transport from China during the EP period and were minimally affected by local emissions from the Korean Peninsula. The chemical components of long-range transported and locally produced PM2.5 were quantified using arsenic (As) as a tracer for long-range transported haze from China. It was found that large fractions of SO42- (87% +/- 31%), OC (70% +/- 16%), and NH4+(65% +/- 10%) at the DJ site underwent long-range transport from China during the EP period. However, a significant fraction (67% +/- 15%) of NO(3)(- )was determined to be secondarily produced from NO2 emitted from local sources during the EP period. On average, 34% of PM2.5 was locally produced at the DJ site during the EP period. Local production of PM2.5 is attributed mainly to NO3-(57%), followed by NH4+(18%), SO42-(11%), and OC (9%). Results from this work suggest that when severe haze undergoes long-range transport from China to the Korean Peninsula during winter, a reduction of local NO2 emissions is the most effective strategy to reduce PM2.5 levels in inland of the Korean Peninsula.

AB Stringent emission controls during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC; November 5-11, 2014) provide a valuable opportunity to examine the impact of such measures on the chemical properties of PM2.5 and other air pollutants. Here, we measured the water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and carbonaceous species in PM2.5NH3 and NO2 at multiple sites in Beijing between September and November 2014. Relative to the pre-APEC period (September and October 2014), significant reductions in the average concentrations of WSII (69% for NO3, 68% for SO42-, 78% for NH4+, and 29-71% for other species), elemental carbon (EC, 43%) and organic carbon (OC, 45%) in PM2.5 were found during the APEC period. The contributions of secondary inorganic ions (SIA, including SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) to PM2.5 were significantly lower during the APEC period (9-44%), indicating a combination of lower gaseous precursor emissions and a relative weak secondary aerosol formation. Ion-balance calculations indicated that the PM2.5 sample in the pre-APEC period was alkaline but was acidic during the APEC period. Relatively lower mean concentrations of EC (1.5 mu g m(-3)), OC (10.5 mu g m(-3)), secondary organic carbon (SOC, 3.3 mu g m(-3)), secondary organic aerosol (SOA, 5.9 mu g m(-3)) and primary organic aerosol (POA, 10.0 mu g m(-3)) appeared during the APEC period. The average concentrations of NH3 and NO2 at all road sites were significantly reduced by 48 and 60% during the APEC period, which is consistent with clear reductions in satellite NH3 columns over Beijing city in the same period. This finding suggests that reducing traffic emissions could be a feasible method to control urban NH3 pollution. During the APEC period, concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO from the Beijing city monitoring network showed significant reductions at urban (20-60%) and rural (18-57%) sites, whereas O-3 concentrations increased significantly (by 93% and 53%, respectively). The control measures taken in the APEC period substantially decreased PM2.5 pollution but can increase ground O-3, which also merits attention.

AB Background: Land use regression (LUR) has been widely used to estimate air pollution exposure in recent epidemiology studies. However, few LUR studies were conducted in China, and even fewer used purposefully designed monitoring networks. The objectives of this study are to obtain preliminary understanding of fine-scale air pollution distributions, and to provide a foundation for a future extended study in Lanzhou, China, a major industrial city.
   Methods: A pilot monitoring network was designed using stratified-random sampling, and purposeful selection in gaps of spatial predictor distributions. Based on this network, NO2 were measured using Palmes tubes for 2 weeks in summer 2015, which were used to develop a pilot LUR model considering spatial information of traffic and population densities, elevation, land cover, and land use. We developed linear regression, kriging models, including ordinary kriging, universal kriging, and compared them using AIC.
   Results: The sampling sites of the pilot monitoring network represented wide ranges of spatial predictors (N = 47). The pilot LUR model explained 71% of the variance in the measured NO2 at the sampling sites. The spatial predictors in the model included road densities, elevation, and district indicator. Predicted NO2 concentrations were higher in the east of the city, which is more developed and has dense road networks. Linear regression model performed better than the kriging models due to the lowest AIC.
   Conclusions: This study developed a pilot monitoring network that can effectively capture variability in spatial characteristics and developed a robust LUR model capturing small-scale spatial variations of air pollution in an understudied area. The predicted and measured NO2 showed substantial spatial heterogeneity that was not captured by the limited government monitors. A future study with extended monitoring network and measurements from more seasons is needed to fully understand the distribution of air pollution in Lanzhou, China.

AB Accurate estimation of dust deposition is of significance for modelling global radiation and the biochemical carbon cycle in the earth system. However, the paucity of dust deposition data precludes our ability to adequately verify estimations of dust deposition. Based on the environmental monitoring records in Xinjiang Province, northwest China, we conducted a numerical simulation of dust deposition using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and compared observed and modelled deposition during the spring dust season (March-May). The performance of WFtF-Chem on modelling dust deposition was tested and evaluated with adoption of Georgia Tech/Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and Shao et al. (2011a) dust emission schemes. Our results indicate that the dry deposition schemes have the capability to predict size-resolved dust deposition. However, modelled and measured dust deposition differed by more than one order of magnitude. The modelled dust dry deposition does not satisfactorily agree well with field measurements. This study suggests significant distinctions exist among these two dust emission schemes when simulating mineral dust thy deposition in northwest China. Uncertainties in estimating the dry dust deposition are in a range of 77-96%. These uncertainties imply that parameterization in the current dust deposition schemes need to be further improved. We found that the estimation of dust deposition is highly underestimated by the Global Climate Model and Regional Climate Model (GCM/RCM). Thus global dust cycles and dust deposition may exceed our current estimates.

AB Much attention has been paid to develop methods to estimate particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD). One of fundamental limitation of these methods is lack of AOD and thereby PM2.5 cannot be derived from satellites when clouds are present or when surface conditions are not favorable. This would probably result in an inherent clear-sky biased estimate of PM2.5 for air quality assessment that requires continuous 24-h measurements at all-sky conditions. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD and PM2.5 data in North China, a highly polluted area with large spatiotemporal variabilities of AOD and PM2.5 values, missing MODIS AOD retrievals and its potential effect on PM2.5 estimation are studied. The MODIS dark target (DT) algorithm produces very few AODs in winter, with a regional observation rate of 4%, which limits its statistical significance for PM2.5 air quality monitoring. This limitation applies to MODIS DT AOD products at 10-km and 3-km resolutions since they are derived from the same retrieval core (Remer et al., 2013). In contrast, The MODIS deep blue (DB) AOD product complements the MODIS DT AOD coverage, which is remarkable in winter. The MODIS DT and DB merged product has comparable accuracy to that of the DT and DB products but shows a larger sampling rate, therefore, it is more suitable for estimating surface PM2.5. While the regional mean PM2.5 values in the presence and absence of AOD retrievals in spring and summer are comparable, but the former is substantially lower than the latter in autumn by 11.2 mu gm(-3 )and winter by 8.5 mu gm(-3) on average. The difference in some stations even exceeds 20 mu g m(-3). Methods to fill missing AOD values in North China are crucial to provide an unbiased sampling and estimate of PM2.5 concentration in all-sky conditions, likely by integrating satellite, surface and modeling data.

AB This study examines the multiple dust storms that hit the eastern Mediterranean and Greece during March 2018, emphasizing on the atmospheric dynamics for their generation, the source regions, the dust-induced radiative forcing and the impacts on PM concentrations in Athens. In March 2018, several dust storms facilitated by increased cyclonicity in the western Europe/Mediterranean and by the Sharav cyclogenesis along the north African coast resulted in abnormal-high columnar aerosol loading and PM concentrations over Greece. The dusty days were associated with intense winds ( > 15 . 20 ms(-1)) from southwestern directions, triggered by cyclonic circulations over the central/eastern Mediterranean and troughs over Italy and the north African coast. Statistical analysis of the backward air-mass trajectories shows that the highest PM10 concentrations are related to dust sources in Libya, while Ceilometer profiles indicate thick dust plumes with highest intensity between the surface and 3 km over Athens. The monthly-averaged hourly PM 10 concentrations at several stations in the Athens basin ranged from 37 mu gm(-3) to 53 mu gm(-3), while nine days exhibited PM 10 daily-means above 50 mu gm(-3), characterized as dusty days. The PM10 concentrations in Athens maximized on 25-26 March (similar to 500 mu gm(-3) at hourly basis), while the PM2.5 constitutes 38%-59% of PM 10 , indicating a dominance of coarse particles. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) estimates via the synergy of OPAC and SBDART models at three AERONET stations in Greece revealed significant impact of dust on radiation budget, with large (similar to- 40 W m(-2) to -50 W m(-2)) decrease in surface solar radiation and an overall cooling effect at the top of atmosphere (similar to - 5 to - 30 W m(-2)).

AB This study reports simultaneous measurements of inorganic N-r trace gases (NH3, NOx, HNO3) and the corresponding particulates (NH4+, NO3-) for elucidating photochemical interactions that are involved in their spatial and diurnal evolution along the north west - south transect of an urban NCR. Three sites were chosen with different land use characteristics where the spatial gradient in Nr precursor gases were observed as Faridabad (92.33 mu g m(-3)) > Delhi (56.01 mu g m(-)(3)) > Rohtak (24.84 mu g m(-3)). Their percentage fractions in the total N r composition were estimated as 25.45% of NOx, 28.91% of HNO3, 40.05% of NH3 at industrial Faridabad site respectively; 27.59% of NOx, 8.36% of HNO3, 61.61% of NH3 respectively at urban representative Delhi site and 22.37% of NOx, 15.36% of HNO3, 53.53% of NH3 respectively at background Rohtak site. Particulate N-r concentrations, on the other hand, exhibited insignificant inter site variability where its percentage contribution to the total N-r had the sequential order as Rohtak (3.56%) > Delhi (1.69%) > Faridabad (0.22%) for NH4+ fractions whereas NO3- fractions has the order as Faridabad (5.37%) > Rohtak (5.18%) > Delhi (0.75%). Ionic composition of these particulates was characterized by the dominance of Ca2+ as the major base cation in which the role of photochemical reactions becomes limited. Hence, such N-r distribution patterns were further evaluated for their diurnal behaviour at each site where D/N > 1 ratios were observed for NOx, (1.52), HNO3 (1.02), NH3 (1.72), NO3- (1.01) at Rohtak as well as for NH4+ (3.02) and NO3- (2.60) at Delhi and Faridabad site respectively. However, their transformation extents in the photochemical reactions were observed to be independent of diurnal phases where the incomplete phase conversions were characterized by the molar ratios of NOx/NOy > 0.8 at Delhi and NH3/NHx > 0.5 at all the sites. The correlation matrix of these parameters confirmed their gas phase oxidation occurring independent of their meteorological condition of temperature and relative humidity. Such observations were thermodynamically evaluated by the calculation of their K-m and K-p values that were further plotted for their ambient temperature and below deliquesce relative humidity levels for ascertaining the favourable conditions that are existing for the NH4NO3 aerosol formation over the study region.

AB We developed a coupled computational fluid dynamics-chemistry model to examine the transport and chemical transformation of reactive aerosols on an urban street. The model was evaluated by comparing the results of simulations with those of observational campaigns in a street canyon in Elche, Spain. The model generally captured the composition of fine particulate matter (PM1) in the street canyon in summer and winter. However, compared with the observed concentration of PM1 in summer, the simulated concentration of PM1 was overestimated by 40%, indicating that the model predicted a weaker canyon vortex. Although the model has some bias, it reasonably reproduced the observed aerosol concentration. We also investigated the diurnal variations and spatial distribution of PM1 and its composition in the street canyon. The simulated sulfate concentrations were mostly affected by boundary transport, showing weak diurnal variations. The nitrate aerosol concentrations exhibited clear sinusoidal diurnal variations following the precursor gas, HNO3, which is mainly formed by photochemical reactions. We also found that nitrate aerosol formation was suppressed by low O-3 concentrations under extreme volatile organic compound-limited conditions. The concentrations of PM1, organic carbon, and black carbon followed traffic volume curves, indicating the dominant effect of vehicular emissions on aerosols. Our sensitivity model simulation showed that considering chemical reactions significantly affects the diurnal variations of secondarily produced aerosol concentrations. These results clearly demonstrate that considering chemical production and loss is essential to investigate the diurnal variations of PM1 in street canyons, especially in winter.

AB Based on satellite observations and reanalysis datasets, this study focuses on the effect of aerosols on clouds over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the impact of dust-polluted convective clouds on precipitation over downstream regions. A heavy dust event is detected by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) over the northern slope of the TP on 16 July and 17 July 2016. The high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are mainly distributed over the northern slope of the TP. Simultaneously, the CloudSat satellite observes deep convective clouds over the northern slope area of the TP, in which convective clouds and dust mix at the same height. With the AOD increasing from 16 July to its peak on 17 July, the ice particle size decreases to a minimum, and convective clouds develop at higher heights because of the prolonged cloud life. Accordingly, a larger ice water path (IWP) is induced by the development of convective clouds that move eastwardly from 16 to 17 July. In the following days, under favorable meteorological conditions, some of the developed convective clouds continuously move eastward and merge with the convective cloud clusters along the motion path, which induces significant precipitation over the Yangtze River basin on 17 July. Furthermore, driven by the northward wind, some developed convective cloud clusters move northward and induce strong precipitation over North China on 19 July. The indirect effect of dust aerosols over the TP could enhance the plateau's cloud development and potentially contribute to downstream precipitation, which is a meaningful factor for weather forecasting.

AB Background: Ambient particulate matter (PM) has been linked to adverse health outcomes, but evidence is still relatively limited for emergency department visits (EDVs). Most prior studies used daily mean PM as exposure assessment regardless of within-day variations, which might underestimate the potential acute health effects. In this study, we evaluated the hourly associations between PM and EDVs, so as to further understand the very short-term impacts of PM on EDVs.
   Methods: Hourly data for all-cause EDVs, air pollutants and meteorological factors were collected from Shenzhen, China, between March 1, 2015 and February 28, 2018. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the hourly associations between PM and EDVs, adjusting for hourly mean temperature and relative humidity. Subgroup analyses stratified by gender, age and clinic department were conducted to identify vulnerable populations. We further classified the whole year into warm (April to September) and cold (October to March of the next year) months to evaluate seasonal effect modification.
   Results: Hourly mean all-cause EDVs peaked at 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., while PM2.5 and PM10 peaked at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. The hourly associations between PM and EDVs appeared immediately and persisted for about 10 hours. All-cause EDVs increased 0.72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 1.12) and 0.72% (95% CI: 0.45, 0.99) associated with per 10 mu g/m(3) rise in PM2.5 and PM10 at lag 0-10 h, respectively. Stronger effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on EDVs were observed among younger groups (age < 35 years). Significant PM-EDVs associations were only identified in cold season. A 10 mu g/m(3) rise in PM2.5 along 0-10 h, for instance, was associated with increased all-cause EDVs risks of 1.13% (95% CI: 0.67, 1.60) in cold season and -0.23% (95% CI: -1.00, 0.53) in warm season, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our study provided hourly perspective for the short-term associations between PM exposure and increased EDVs. The adverse impacts of PM on EDVs were only identified in cold season, and young people suffered more from both PM2.5 and PM10 exposures. These findings may have valuable implications for public policy promotion on air cleaning, as well as hospital management in optimizing allocation of resources on PM-sensitive conditions.

AB Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a marine-derived trace gas, can influence atmospheric compositions and has an impact on the global climate. To date, obtaining continuous and coupled shipboard underway measurements of DMS in seawater and air has been challenging. To address this issue, we report a custom-made sampling device based on the purge-and-trap technique. This sampler, in combination with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS), was successfully utilized to perform coupled shipboard underway measurements of DMS in surface seawater and air around western Antarctica during the 34th Chinese Antarctic Research Expedition from February 2018 to April 2018. The seawater and air streams were continuously introduced into the sampler unit and subsampled every 10 min. The limits of detection (LODs) of DMS in seawater and air were found to be 0.07 nM and 32 pptv, respectively. The variability in the DMS levels in the surface seawater and air can be distinguished and evaluated based on the variations in the DMS peaks. These results demonstrated that the sampling device was effective for consistent, sensitive underway measurements of DMS.

AB New particle formation (NPF) is one main source of atmospheric aerosols and plays an important role in global climate by contributing up to two thirds of the atmospheric cloud condensation nuclei. Numerous studies on characteristics and mechanisms of near-surface NPF have been conducted in last decades. However, the characteristics of NPF around the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) remains unclear due to the limitations of vertical measurements. In this study, a tethered airship onboard with advanced particle instruments was deployed for directly measurement of the NPF exactly above and under the top of the PBL in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of eastern China in December 2017. Coupled with the real time ground Lidar observation, we successfully conducted measurement of aerosol size distribution, chemical components of aerosol and gas pollutants with 100 m above/under the top of the PBL. Despite not being observed within the PBL during the flight and at three ground sites in YRD, NPF event with the growth rate of 3.8 nm/h was detected above the PBL. High oxidizing capacity, enough condensable vapors and low condensation sink above the PBL favor the onset of NPF. Model simulation and the aerosol chemical composition result indicate the important role of gaseous sulfuric acid in NPF and its subsequent growth in the upper atmosphere. Our study highlights the potential mechanism of NPF above the PBL and the need of direct vertical measurements to better understand NPF in the atmosphere and its climate effect.

AB Precipitation samples collected at or near the surface of the earth are composite samples of many different raindrops. Little is known about the abiotic and biotic components found within individual raindrops. To help fill this knowledge gap, we designed a system for collecting individual raindrops called the Liquid Nitrogen Apparatus for Isolating Raindrops (LNAIR). The LNAIR was used in a series of laboratory experiments to determine (1) determine the recovery volume of drops with known sizes and to (2) measure the viability of seededmicrobes from drops of different sizes. The LNAIR recovered an average of 73% of the initial drop volume for drops ranging from 5 mu l to 50 mu l, and the original and recovered mean volumes were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.96). The viability of seeded ice-nucleating strains of Pseudomonas syringae and Fusarium avenaceum decreased after passage through the LNAIR, but the ice nucleation activity (INA) did not change. Moreover, the size (volume) of the droplet did not appear to have an effect on the viability of microbes after passage through the LNAIR, at least for the two strains of P. syringae tested. The LNAIR was then used in a series of field experiments to collect raindrops from simulated and natural precipitation events. The mean drop volume observed from six simulated rain events (SREs) was 9.4 mu l +/- 0.5, while the mean drop volume observed from four natural rain events (NREs) was 7.6 mu l +/- 0.4. Flow cytometer analysis showed that there was an average of 395 +/- 103 DNA-containing particles per 10 mu l of NRE drops (n = 6) and an average of 892 +/- 171 DNA-containing particles per 10 mu l of SRE drops (n = 4). NRE drops contained a similar range of particle sizes compared to SRE drops. Twenty seven percent (9/34) of the SRE drops and 28% (40/143) of the NRE drops collected with the LNAIR contained culturable microorganisms, but none of these displayed INA at - 8 degrees C. Microbes cultured from individual NRE drops were identified to the level of genus using sequences. The genera Cladosporium (fungi) and Bacillus (bacteria) represented 22% (15/68) and 20% (19/68) of the microbes identified, respectively. One natural raindrop contained four different genera (Bacillus, Trichoderma, Penicilliurn, and Cladosporium). The LNAIR has the potential to increase our understanding of causal agents of precipitation processes.

TI Sensitivity of isoprene emissions to drought over south-eastern
   Australia: Integrating models and satellite observations of soil

AB South-east Australia, characterized by arid and semi-arid climate, has experienced large-scale rainfall reductions in recent decades. Larger temporal and spatial drought conditions are predicted in future. The temperate south east coastal zone is characterized by dense forests of Eucalyptus. Drought conditions have implications for the functioning of these indigenous ecosystems, and for emissions of reactive gases that are upwind of major metropolitan regions along the eastern coast. Here, we focus on the impact of drought on the emission of isoprene, a volatile organic compound emitted by a range of trees and shrubs. Previous model calculations grossly overestimate observations of the isoprene mixing ratio, potentially due to overestimated emission factors for native vegetation, but could also be due to drought-induced isoprene emission reductions. We develop the implementation of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) within the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model to include a parameterization of drought using soil moisture. We test this parameterization using two approaches. First, we drive MEGAN using soil moisture fields from two Australian land surface models achieving reductions in isoprene emissions of 24-52% during summer. Second, we use a simple statistical approach to nudge model soil moisture towards satellite observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) instrument. This work is the first application of SMOS towards isoprene emission modelling, providing a constraint on surface soil moisture which extends to global scales. Applying these soil moisture approaches, domain average isoprene emissions reduce by 38-58% in summer. Using these results, errors in basal emissions are likely in the region of 40%. Comparison of modelled soil moisture to observations using root density weighted averages across depths of 4 m showed minor differences of up to 0.04 m(3)m(-3). We find that the choice of land surface model used in the SMOS assimilations has a greater impact on isoprene emissions than adjusting either the nudging strength or the number of soil levels these satellite data may influence. However there are only small differences of 3% when using hourly or 24-hourly soil moisture input data to drive the emission calculations, suggesting that the lower temporal availability of satellite data does not reduce model quality. As the spatial resolution of satellite observations of atmospheric composition and land surface properties begin to approach the resolution of regulatory air quality models, we anticipate that these data will improve model predictive skills further.

AB Soil respiration is a crucial source of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. The underlying processes involved are multifaceted, sequential chemical reactions associated with the conversion of soil organic carbon to CO2. In this paper, we present a mechanistic, biogeochemical model to simulate soil CO2 emissions considering the microbial and sequential chemical processes using the well-established hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the first time. The soil CO2 emissions from multiple sequential soil chemical reactions were compared with the observed data at three sites in Canada. The results show that the modelled CO2 emission rates are in good agreement with the observed data with performance statistics: PBIAS: 0.13%-23%; NSE: 0.27 to 0.62; RSR: 0.60 to 0.84; R-2: 0.29 to 0.83. This approach could be used in future regional to global-scale models for simulating the soil CO2 emission and hydrological processes.

AB The "Campaign on Atmospheric Aerosol Research" network of China (CARE-China) is a long-term project for the study of the spatio-temporal distributions of physical aerosol characteristics as well as the chemical components and optical properties of aerosols over China. This study presents the size-segregated sugars from the CARE-China network. Sugars associated with size-segregated particulate matter at 8 regions (North China (NC), East China (EC), Northeast China (NE), and Central China (CC), South China (SC), Northwest China (NE), Southwest China (SW) and the Tibetan Plateau (TP)) including 14 sites over China from January 2013 to December 2014 were analyzed via gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Mass concentrations of measured sugars varied considerably with location and season, ranging from 0.20 to 5588 ng m(-3), with the majority from levoglucosan (170 +/- 207 ngm(-3), accounting for 48% of total sugars), followed by sucrose (44.6 +/- 39.6 ngm(-3), accounting for 11.3% of sugar), and sorbitol (35.5 +/- 42.2 ng m(-3), accounting for 10.0% of sugars). The highest levels of sugars were observed in urban sites in Central and Southwest China, whereas the lowest concentrations occurred in background and Tibetan Plateau sites. A distinct seasonal variability of sugars was observed, with higher in the winter or autumn and lower during the summer at urban sites. Inconsistent seasonal trends were observed at the background sites located in the higher latitudes, which were characteristic with the highest concentration occurred in spring. Levoglucosan, galactosan and mannosan were found to be dominant in fine size range < 1.1 mu m, accounting approximately 59% of all size-segregated sugars. Sucrose was enriched in the size range of 3.3-9.0 mu m for almost all sampling sites. Concentrations of trehalose and sorbitol in the three size particles were similar. The OC from biomass burning was estimated to be in the range of 0.93-58.7 mu g C m(-3), with the highest level OCBB % were observed in urban sites in summer and winter. The contributions of biomass burning to OC in the rest of sites were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Higher OCBB % was observed in spring at the background sites located in Northwest and Northeast China.

AB Evaluating long-term air quality and deposition trends can demonstrate effectiveness of control strategies and guide future air quality management planning. Observations show a reduction of atmospheric concentrations of NOx and SOx species and their wet and dry deposition since monitoring began in 1978 and 1987, respectively, although deposition observations are sparse. This study used a regional model (CAMx) nested within a global model (GEOS-Chem) to characterize regional changes in sulfur and nitrogen deposition due to intercontinental transport and local/regional anthropogenic emissions representing six modeling years spanning five decades (1970-2020). The meteorological year and the natural emissions were fixed at 2005 to isolate the effects of changing anthropogenic emissions. The downward trend from 1970 to 2020 of mean atmospheric SO2 concentration is 1.5-1.8%; of total S deposition is 1.0-1.7%; and of SO2 emissions is 1.4-1.8% per year. The rate of decline in NOy deposition of 0.6-1.4% per year is similar to the 0.5-1.6% per year reduction in NOx emissions, thus showing that the changes in deposition have tracked changes in emissions of SO(2 )and NOx emissions quite well. Further reducing N deposition could face some challenges due to increasing NHx contribution from NH3 emissions and the expectation of these to increase globally. Our study also examined the transference ratios of NOy and SOx in the context of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx and found them to be sensitive to emission reductions over the study period.

AB This paper presents isotopic compositions (delta N-15 and Delta O-17 values) of atmospheric particulate nitrate (p-NO3-) collected over the Pacific Ocean between 40 degrees S and 68 degrees N on two cruises using the Research Vessel Hakuho Mani. Six marine regions over the Pacific Ocean were categorized using backward trajectory analysis, and various ion concentrations were employed to assess the dominance of anthropogenic or non-anthropogenic sources. The delta N-15(p-NO3-) values ranged from -15.4 parts per thousand to 2.5 parts per thousand over the Pacific Ocean between 40 degrees S and 68 degrees N. The range of the source delta N-15(NOx) values were calculated for each sample based on isotopic exchange/fractionation during oxidation from NOx (NO and NO2) to HNO3, and a range of - 14.1 to 6.9%o was yielded over the Pacific Ocean. Compared to other regions, extremely low delta N-15(NOx) values of -14.1%o to -7.3 parts per thousand were found over the equatorial Pacific, and such values cannot be matched using conventional NOx apportionment. Emissions of specific oceanic nitrogen emissions of NH3 and alkyl nitrate are thus proposed for the equatorial Pacific. Results demonstrate the importance of the nitrogen recycling process between the ocean and lower atmosphere in the equatorial Pacific. Delta O-17(p-NO3-) values and light flux were found to be generally well-correlated in most Pacific Ocean regions, and this result is consistent with the importance of photolysis for OH radical concentrations relative to the contribution of O-3 in producing HNO3 from NOx. In contrast, Delta O-17(p-NO3-) values for the eastern North Pacific region were higher than in other regions with similar light fluxes, which implies a contribution from halogens to p-NO3- formation.

AB We present here the first long-term (2001-2017) record of aerosol optical depth (AOD; interchangeably, AOT) and contributions of aerosol chemical components to light extinction over Kolkata, the second-most polluted metropolis in India. For this purpose, we use daily gridded MODIS AOD measurements coupled with modeled AOT for 5 major aerosol constituents - sulfate, sea-salt, dust, organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC), from the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. We find that AOD over Kolkata has increased significantly (32% overall, 0.010 y(-1); Mann-Kendall test with Thiel-Sen slope estimation; p < 0.01) over the past 17 y to a mean of 0.74 +/- 0.10 in 2017, and an overwhelming majority of this increase is driven by a concurrent rise (70% overall, 0.007 y(-1), p < 0.01) in sulfate AOT. This is followed by smaller but significant enhancements in OC (40% overall, 0.002 y(-1), p < 0.01) and BC (20% overall, 0.0004 y(-1), p < 0.01) AOT. Although a non-trivial fraction (24%) of AOT is associated with natural emissions (sea-salt and dust), these do not exhibit significant trends over time and therefore are not instrumental in driving the observed AOD rise. A concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis shows that sulfate aerosol over Kolkata is mostly regional (within similar to 250 km) during winter and post-monsoon with significant footprints over thermal power plant clusters in neighboring states and areas with considerable residential biofuel use (eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin). In comparison, BC and OC AOT show a significant long-range component (similar to 1800 km) originating from northwestern and central IGP, especially during post-monsoon, when open agricultural residue burning is rampant. Overall, these results provide a preliminary indication that a considerable fraction of aerosol light extinction over Kolkata might be related to non-local, atmospherically transported aerosol. Once validated by ground-based measurements, these results would reinforce the need to bring regional and long-range emissions, in addition to within-the-city emissions, under the purview of air quality management policies.

AB The rapid growth of the vehicle population was regarded as an important factor that contributed to the urban air pollution in China during the past decades. We used Tianjin, a typical megacity facing vehicle pollution problems, as the study domain to investigate a comprehensive estimation of vehicle emissions, including carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), inhalable particles (PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), from 2000 to 2030. The Computer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) model was used to simulate the vehicle emission factors. Historical simulations show that the total emissions of CO, VOCs, NOx, PM10, CO2, and SO2 changed from 545.1 Gg, 70.04 Gg, 60.19 Gg, 6.57 Gg, 6.82 Tg and 12.88 Gg to 259.11 Gg, 34.01 Gg, 55.14 Gg, 3.42 Gg, 25.30 Tg and 0.16 Gg from 2000 to 2016, respectively. Passenger cars (PC) and light-duty vehicles (LDV) were the main contributors to the CO and VOCs emissions. Heavy-duty trucks (HDT) and buses (BUS) were the important contributors to NOx and PM10. PC was the major contributor to CO2 and SO2. With respect to the future, four Single Control Policy Scenarios (SCPS), including Passenger car Population Regulation (PPR), Emission Standard Updating (ESU), Public Transportation Promotion (PTP) and Electric Vehicle Popularity (EVP), and Integrated Scenarios (IS), were assembled to describe the impact of future policies on vehicle pollution from 2017 to 2030. Among all SCPS, the results show that the ESU is the more effective policy to control emissions of CO, NOx and PM10, while PPR is the more effective way to reduce emissions of VOCs, CO2, and SO2.

AB The particle mixing state is a key feature in determining their role in the earth system, exerting a substantial impact on radiative forcing and climate. However, the mechanism of particle mixing reactions is unclear, especially for the mixing of mineral dusts with anthropogenic pollutants (APs). In this study, the mixing reaction mechanisms of typical APs (acrolein, SOx and NOx) with mineral dust (SiO2) were investigated by using theoretical approach. The mixing ability of SiO2 with inorganic compounds mainly depends on the strength of the interaction of the center atom of inorganic compounds and the surface of SiO2, while SiO2 mixed with acrolein (ARL) proceeds via only hydrogen bonding (HB). The nucleation ability of SiO2 is enhanced significantly from simultaneous existence of ARL and SOx/NOx SiO2 exhibits a high reactivity with SO3 and acrolein (ARL), proceeding an irreversible process. The mixing reactions of SO2/NOx and SiO2 are reversible, but the binding is enhanced by ARL, which contributes to the dust aerosol nucleation process by binding to SO2/NO. and SiO2. The charge density difference and natural bond orbital analysis show that organic compound acts as both hydrogen bonding (HB) donors and acceptors, while inorganic compound is only HE acceptor. Our results reveal that the mixing state of mineral dust with anthropogenic pollutant is largely facilitated in area with rapid industrialization and urbanization, which could further influence climate and radiative forcing.

AB In this study, we used the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to apportion the sources of organic carbon volatility fractions (OCx) as well as total OC concentrations in five different locations across the Los Angeles Basin, including West Long Beach, Anaheim, central Los Angeles (CELA), Rubidoux, and Fontana over the period from July 2012 to June 2013. Total OC as well as OC volatility fractions (OC1-OC4), measured with the thermaloptical analysis as part of the fourth Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study (MATES IV) by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), in combination with gaseous and particulate source tracers (such as NOx, O-3, particulate sulfate, K+/K ratio, and biomass-burning originated black carbon (BCbb)) were used as inputs to the PMF model. A 3-factor solution, including traffic, secondary organic aerosols (SOA), and biomass burning, was found to be the most physically interpretable solution. Average total OC concentrations showed an upward trend from the sites closer to the coast (i.e., 3.7 +/- 1.9 mu g m(-3) at West Long Beach) to inland downwind sites (i.e., 4.8 +/- 1.8 mu g m(-3) at Fontana), especially in the warm season, suggesting the major impact of SOA formation on total OC concentrations. Source apportionment results indicated that traffic is the dominant contributor to OC2 and OC3 fractions, especially at the sites that are near major primary sources such as CELA and West Long Beach, with corresponding contributions of 60 +/- 1.0% and 79 +/- 1.7% to OC2 and 53 +/- 0.9% and 64 +/- 1.3% to OC3, respectively. On the other hand, SOA was found to be the dominant contributor to OC4 fraction, especially at the receptor sites located further inland, with corresponding contributions of 66 +/- 1.0% in Rubidoux and 56 +/- 0.7% in Fontana. Our results also indicated that traffic is the dominant source of total OC concentrations, with an average contribution of 53 +/- 2.4% at all the sites, followed by SOA formation and biomass burning, contributing to 40 +/- 1.8% and 7 +/- 0.8% of total OC concentrations, respectively. The contribution of traffic and biomass burning to total OC concentrations increased during the cold season, while that of SOA became more significant during the warm season when photochemical activities peak. Results from the present study provided important insight on the sources and spatio-temporal variations of OC volatility fractions as well as total OC concentrations in PM2.5 across the Los Angeles Basin.

   RELEASE
AB The pollen of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (ragweed) is an important aeroallergen. The plant originated from North America and, has spread worldwide in recent decades. Air masses can transport pollen grains far from their source region and episodes of long distance transported (LDT) of ragweed pollen have been reported. The allergenic properties of LDT pollen grains can be altered by humidity, temperature and UV radiation. The aims of the study are to detect the major allergen of ragweed (Amb a 1) in the atmosphere of uninfested areas and to compare daily Ambrosia sp. pollen grains with Amb a 1 amount per m(3) of air. Samples for allergen detection were collected by ChemVol (R) sampler. ChemVol (R) collects particles at 800 l/min and contains 2 impaction stages (PM > 10 mu m and 10 > PM > 2.5 mu m). Samples collected on to filters were obtained during a 63 day period in the year 2014. Amb a 1 was recorded on 54 days and pollen grains of ragweed on 43 days. Diurnal average Amb a 1 concentrations ranged between 0.29 and 263.3 pg per cubic meter of air and correlated positively with daily average ragweed pollen concentrations. The average seasonal Ambrosia pollen allergen potency was 2.57 pg Amb a 1/pollen. The air mass movement was simulated using the HYbrid Single-particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and back-trajectory paths were computed for four episodes. The findings suggest that ragweed pollen allergens still survive after at least 48 h during transport over long distances from allochthonous regions and are therefore a potential trigger of allergic reactions even in areas where ragweed is not widely dispersed.

TI Influence of regional emissions on SO2 concentrations over Bhubaneswar,
   a capital city in eastern India downwind of the Indian SO2 hotspots

AB In a scenario when haze and smog events are wreaking havoc in many parts of the world; accurate information on ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) sources is a required input to models for prediction and mitigation of air pollution. Globally, India is one of the highest emitters of anthropogenic SO2. However, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data reveal that unlike many other anthropogenic air pollutants, the strongest anthropogenic SO2 sources are not located in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) but over the coal belts of North Eastern peninsular India. In this study, we report SO2 measurements conducted at Bhubaneswar, a rapidly developing smart city in the Eastern Coast of India. The city is ideally located just downwind of the Indian SO2 hotspots during winter, when SO2 concentrations are the highest, reaching 14.3 ppbv for hourly averaged data. The measurements, reported here from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2012, show that despite being a rapidly developing location, SO2 over Bhubaneswar is dominated by regional emissions rather than local sources like vehicular exhausts. The influence of regional emissions is strongest in winter as the city is directly downwind of 6 of the 10 largest thermal power plants and 7 out of the 13 largest integrated steel plants in India with a mean SO2 concentration of 3.2 ppbv. This is evinced by multiple pointers viz. Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis for surface SO2 data, correlation analysis for OMI SO2 data, analysis of surface concentrations of SO2, organic carbon, black carbon and carbon monoxide; which reveal SO2 emissions from the industrial and mining regions of Chhattisgarh and north-west Odisha. This is the same region that shows up as hotspots of SO2 in OMI retrievals over India. However, despite being downwind of major SO2 sources during winter, SO2 concentrations in Bhubaneswar are lower than over some other cities (Kolkata, Kanpur) in the IGP, due to influence of strong local sources in the later cases. Unlike most other urban regions in India, the diurnal variation of SO2 over Bhubaneswar shows elevated daytime values due to predominant influence of regional emissions.

AB Air pollution has been identified as one of the most challenging health issues in urban areas worldwide.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory disease over a long-term period in Shiraz, one of the largest cities in Iran. Methods: hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases (asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pleural effusion) in residents of Shiraz between March 21, 2009 and March 20, 2015 were included. Demographics for each patient and meta data to include principal meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) and five ambient pollutants (CO, O-3, SO2, NO2, and PM10) were also included. Statistical analysis was performed by Poisson regression in single-pollutant generalized linear model with principal component analysis (GLPCA) to analyze the relationship between pollutants and hospital admissions at the 0-9 cumulative lag day period. Pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationship between different pollutants, temperature and humidity.
   Results: It was found that the highest increase in asthma admission was related to PM10 (relative risk (RR) = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.47). For COPD, the rate of hospital visits significantly increased with the increase in NO2 concentration (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.091.27). In the children's hospital, O-3 (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06,1.47) and SO2 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.28) affected the asthma admissions and all contaminants (highest RR observed was for NO2 (RR = 1.28 95% CI = 1.18, 1.40) affected pneumonia admissions on cumulative lag days of 0-9. Conclusions: These data confirm an association between ambient air pollutants and hospital admissions due to respiratory disease.

AB In winter, heavy aerosol pollution episodes (HPEs) occur frequently on the North China Plain (NCP) under unfavorable meteorological conditions. After the aerosol pollution with fine aerosol particles less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) accumulates to a certain extent in Beijing and its vicinity (BIV), boundary-layer (BL) meteorological conditions worsen due to radiative cooling effects of aerosols, which further facilitate PM2.5 accumulation. This "two-way feedback mechanism" between unfavorable metrological conditions and cumulative PM2.5, particularly PM2.5 explosive growth with mass concentration doubled in several to 10 h, has been found in BIV. To investigate whether the two-way feedback exists on the southern NCP, we selected four representative cities with radiosonde observations, which lie south of Beijing and used PM2.5 data, radiation observations, and radiosonde data from December 2016 to the beginning of January 2017. We found that the two-way feedback existed in these four cities. In each city, HPEs included transport stages (TSs), during which relative strong winds transport pollutants into different regions, and cumulative stages (CSs), in which temperature inversions occur and became striking due to the radiative cooling effects of elevated aerosols under slight or calm winds. This would further cause an increase of PM2.5 concentration. During the CSs, growth of PM2.5 concentration was governed by the two-way feedback, which explained over 70% of the increase. During HPEs, warm and humid advection, topographic wind, longwave radiation at night were conducive to the inversion at the beginning of HPEs, but not dominant with respect to anomalous inversion in CSs. In addition, with the presence of supersaturated layers, aerosol would enter the cloud-fog system, which would reduce observed PM2.5 mass concentration to a certain degree.

AB China has been suffered from the severe sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in the past decades. The spatiotemporal estimation and health effect assessment of SO2 using two-stage machine learning models have not been performed yet. In this study, a high-quality model named random forest coupled with spatiotemporal Kriging (RF-STK) model was developed to estimate the daily SO2 concentration across the entire China from May 2014 to May 2015 based on the satellite data and geographic covariates. Compared with other statistical methods, the RF-STK model showed the better explanatory performance, with the 10-fold cross-validation R-2 = 0.62 (root mean-square error (RMSE) = 10.36 mu g/m(3)) for daily estimations. The annually mean population-weighted SO2 concentration was estimated to be 30.49 +/- 10.83 mu g/m(3) (mean standard deviation). The SO2 levels displayed the remarkably seasonal variation with the peak in winter (47.27 +/- 22.64 mu g/m(3)), followed by ones in autumn (28.41 +/- 10.41 mu g/m(3)) and spring (25.92 +/- 7.95 mu g/m(3)), and in summer (21.33 +/- 6.51 mu g/m(3)). At the national scale, only 20.31% of the population lived in the safe regions (population-weighted SO2 concentration < 20 mu g/m(3)). The higher population-weighted SO2 concentrations were mainly concentrated on some provinces of North China Plain (NCP) (e.g., Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong), followed by the provinces of Northeast China, and the lowest one in Hainan (8.31 +/- 1.38 mu g/m(3)). The mean all-cause mortalities due to excessive SO2 exposure were estimated to be 131,957 cases, accounting for 0.009% of the whole Chinese population. Among all of the diseases, the mortalities per year were in the order of respiratory disease (RD) (11913 cases) > cardiovascular disease (CVD) (11386 cases) > chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (8112 cases) > cerebrovascular disease (CEVD) (2188 cases). The statistical modelling of SO2 at a national scale provided the valuable data for epidemiological research and air pollution prevention.

AB Over recent years, crop residue burning has become a widely practiced agricultural activity in developing countries due to varying economic and social reasons. To estimate current pollution generation from crop residue burning in Pakistan, an emission inventory was developed based on district level crop production data from 2000 to 2014. Spatial distribution of quantified emissions was achieved by using MODIS Active Fire Data (MOD/MYD14A1) at 1-day temporal and 1 x km spatial resolutions. The fire occurrences were extracted over agricultural land using land cover data provided by European Space Agency/Climate Change Initiative (ESA/CCI) at 300 m spatial resolution for 2000 to 2014. Results show that CO emissions have increased by 40% at an average annual rate of 2.7% from 1.16 Tg in 2000 to 1.63 Tg in 2014 and increase in emissions of CO2, CH4, NMVOCs, N2O, NH3, SO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, OC and BC ranged between 37%, to 63% during same period. Spatially, CO emissions were more significant in districts of Punjab and Sindh provinces with intensive agricultural activities as compared to other areas of Pakistan with highest emission grids located in Muzaffargarh, Jafferabad, and Noushahro Feroze districts. Crop residue burning exhibited similar trend with highest emissions in June followed by February and November over 15-year period. The emissions for most of the considered pollutants were comparable to the limited previous studies available. Finally, the study conducted provides better understanding regarding spatial and temporal patterns of crop residue burning across Pakistan and can be utilized for air quality modeling and management with higher accuracy.

In this study, the relations between regional particle pollution and synoptic weather patterns in the city cluster of the Sichuan Basin (SCB), China are investigated. The data analyses of air quality monitoring records show that particle pollution is extremely serious in the SCB, with the main air pollutants dominated by PM2.5. According to the geographical locations and particle pollution levels, the 22 typical SCB cities can be classified into three categories. The intercity correlations are very high, implying that there exists regional particle pollution in the SCB. Based on the NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data, synoptic weather classification is conducted with the sum-of-squares technique, and five typical weather patterns are primarily identified. For the weather pattern 4 and 5, there are few days with regional particle pollution. They are considered as the clean weather patterns, and record as P4 and P5 respectively. For other three weather patterns (1, 2 and 3), both the polluted and the clean days are considerable. Their clean (record as P1_C, P2_C and P3_C, respectively) and the polluted (record as P1_P, P2_P and P3_P, respectively) cases are further separated to discuss the exact impact mechanism of weather patterns on regional particle pollution. In the end, three polluted and five clean weather patterns are identified. By synthetically analysing the meteorological factors, the three-dimensional atmospheric circulation structures and the backward trajectories, the influence mechanisms of these eight weather patterns on regional particle pollution are discussed. The results show that the polluted weather patterns are generally associated with higher air pressure, higher relative humidity, lower air temperature and lower wind speed. Particles in the SCB can be locally produced under all weather patterns. For the polluted weather patterns (P1_P, P2_P and P3_P), there is often long-range transportation bringing polluted air masses to the SCB, and local adverse atmospheric circulation tends to obstruct the transport and the diffusion of particles. For the clean weather patterns, the southwest flows from the ocean at the 850 hPa layer are the main cause for the scavenging of particles in P1_C and P3_C, the mitigating impacts of P2_C and P5 are related to rainfalls in autumn and summer, and the alleviating impact of P4 is linked to strong winds from winter monsoon. These findings are consultative for the investigations on the formation mechanism of smog pollution in the SCB.

AB A tethered balloon-based measurement was conducted to investigate vertical distribution of O-3 over Shanghai, China, during May of 2016. The time-series and diurnal variation of ground-level air pollutants (including O-3, NO, NO2 and VOCs) were analyzed systematically. By using TrajStat (a GIS-based software), the potential distant contributions of O-3 might come from East China Sea, and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Within 1000 m above ground, the average vertical profiles of O-3 exhibited obviously diurnal characteristics. Most of the NO and O-3 profiles measured on high-ozone days demonstrated anti-correlation. The launches on May 11, 2016 revealed that the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and shifting of wind direction contributed to the peaks of O-3 at the upper altitude. A typical case of vertical mixing of O-3 was caught on May 18, 2016, when the ground-level O-3 was greatly influenced by the O-3 transported from high altitude (1500 in above sea level). The present study provides an important insight of the vertical distribution of O-3 over Eastern China, which implied that coupling effects of horizontal and vertical transportations on ground-level ozone should be investigated in future studies.

AB Irregular oscillations of Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures known as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been shown to affect air pollution in China by altering atmospheric circulations. In this study, we use hourly PM2.5 data from nearly 1500 monitoring stations across entire China to further explore the connection between ENSO and Chines haze pollution by comparing PM2.5 concentrations for the two most recent ENSO events, the 2015-2016 El Nifio and the 2017-2018 La Nina. The PM2.5 concentrations show significant differences between the two events and the differences are larger in winter and smaller in summer. In summer, the PM2.5 concentrations are higher across China during El Nino. However in winter, higher concentrations are found at most stations in northern China during El Nino, but at majority of stations in southern China during La Nina. Spring and autumn show a transitional pattern between summer and winter. Dividing the country into nine regions with similar geographical conditions, the relationship between the monthly PM2.5 concentration anomalies and the Nino3.4 indices, as revealed by linear regression, is generally positive at stations in North, Northeast and the northern parts of Central and East China, but generally negative in South, Southwest and the southern parts of Central and East China. No difference is found in the oscillation periods of the PM2.5 concentrations between the two events, except that the seasonal and infra-seasonal oscillatory signals appear to be slightly stronger during El Nino than La Nina. The regional and seasonal differences in PM2.5 concentrations between El Nino and La Nina can be partially explained by the differences in the anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns, particularly the low-level wind and surface precipitation patterns.

AB Evidence of the short-term effect of SO2 on hospital admissions for cause-specific cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is still limited. This study aimed to examine the short-term associations between SO2 and cause-specific CVD hospital admission in Beijing. A total of 460,938 hospitalizations for total CVD were obtained from electronic hospitalization summary reports from 2013 to 2017. A time series analysis was conducted to investigate the association between SO2 exposure and hospitalizations for total and cause-specific CVD, including coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure (HF). Stratified analysis was also conducted by age group (18-64 years and >= 65 years), sex and season. A generalized additive quasi-Poisson model was used to examine the associations between SO2 and cause-specific CVD after controlling for seasonality, day of the week, public holidays, and weather conditions. We found an almost linear relationship between the exposure to SO2 and cause-specific CVD admissions. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in the two-day average concentration (lag0-1) of SO2 was associated with an increase of 1.38% (95% CI:0.99%; 1.77%) in hospital admission for total CVD, 1.58% (95% CI: 1.16%; 2%) for CHD and 1.69% (95% CI:0.41%; 2.99%) for AF. Nevertheless, a statistically significant association was not observed for admissions for HF. The observed associations in the single-pollutant models were robust to the inclusion of pollutants in the two-pollutant model, but the estimate was attenuated when adjusting for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). No difference in the association was observed for the effect modifiers of sex, season and age. A statistically significant association between hospitalizations and SO2 was observed. The observed association between SO2 and hospitalization might not be independent of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and further studies should be conducted to demonstrate the independent effect of SO2.

AB Through scattering or absorbing radiation, aerosols have important impacts on tropospheric photochemistry and oxidation capacity. In this study, we systematically evaluate the radiative impacts of aerosols on the tropospheric actinic flux, photolysis rates (J(NO2) and J(O-3)) and oxidants such as OH radicals and ozone (O-3) from a global and seasonal perspective. Sensitivity simulations for year 2013 are conducted by the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to quantify the photochemical effects of aerosols, including sulfate-nitrate-ammonium (SNA), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), dust and sea salt. The results suggest that aerosols can enhance or reduce the actinic flux by scattering and absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It is found that the surface actinic flux can be reduced by over 30% in January over eastern China due to aerosol radiative effects, which leads to maximum reductions of approximately 30% in photolysis rates and OH production. The largest regional-averaged reduction of surface actinic flux is found over eastern China (12%), followed by India (9%) and North Africa (8%). The impacts over other regions are generally less than 5%. The aerosols have a slight positive impact on surface O-3 over some regions, possibly due to the dependence of O-3 production on NOx/VOCs ratio. The impacts on surface O-3 vary from -16% to 2%, with the largest reduction occurring in China during wintertime. The effects of aerosols on tropospheric chemistry are sensitive not only to Aerosol optical depth (AOD) but also to the vertical structure and chemical components of aerosols. The vertical profiles of the impacts over eastern China indicate that the radiative effect of aerosols can reduce the actinic flux in the lower troposphere by approximately 18%, while above the boundary layer, the actinic flux is increased (maximum of 7% approximately 2 km) because of scattering aerosols. In turn, changes in the actinic flux induce changes in photolysis rates (ranging from -17% to 8%), OH production (ranging from -15% to 6%) and O-3 concentrations (ranging from -3% to 1%) over eastern China. This study highlights the different roles of each aerosol type in atmospheric photochemistry. The scattering aerosols (SNA and OC) weaken photochemistry in the lower layer and enhance in the upper troposphere, while the absorbing aerosols (BC and dust) slightly weaken the photochemistry throughout the troposphere. Globally, the impact induced by SNA is the most significant, followed by dust and BC.

AB A central strategy in achieving greenhouse gas mitigation targets is the transition of vehicles from internal combustion engines to electric power. However, due to complex emission sources and nonlinear chemistry, it is unclear how such a shift might impact air quality. Here we apply a prototype version of the new-generation NOAA GFDL global Atmospheric Model, version 4 (GFDL AM4) to investigate the impact on U.S. air quality from an aggressive conversion of internal combustion vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). We examine a suite of scenarios designed to quantify the effect of both the magnitude of EV market penetration and the source of electricity generation used to power them. We find that summer surface ozone (O-3) decreases in most locations due to widespread reductions of traffic NO,, emissions. Summer fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases on average and largest in areas with increased coal-fired power generation demands. Winter O-3 increases due to reduced loss via traffic NOx while PM2.5 decreases since larger ammonium nitrate reductions offset increases in ammonium sulfate. The largest magnitude changes are simulated at the extremes of the probability distribution. Increasing the fraction of vehicles converted to EVs further decreases summer O-3, while increasing the fraction of electricity generated by "emission-free" sources largely eliminates the increases in summer PM2.5 at high EV adoption fractions. Ultimately, the number of conventional vehicles replaced by EVs has a larger effect on O-3 than PM2.5, while the source of the electricity for those EVs exhibit greater control on PM2.5.

AB Highly time-resolved measurements of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1) were performed using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) over a big urban city (Ahmedabad, 23.0 degrees N, 72.6 degrees E, 49 m amsl) of western India during the post-monsoon season. All the components of NR-PM1 [i.e., organic aerosol (OA) SO42-, NO3-, NH4+ and Cl-] showed a strong diurnal variation with the overall dominance of OA (58%) in NR-PM1, and the OA composition was found to be a mixture of fresh and aged species. O/C varied from 0.04 to 0.91 whereas, H/C varied from 1.34 to 2.26. A strong diurnal variation in O/C caused a large variability in OM/OC ratio (ranging from 1.2 to 2.3) during the study period, which suggests that a constant conversion factor for OM estimation (from OC) can be a source of large uncertainty in their load assessment over the study region. Furthermore, the observed slope (-0.78 +/- 0.01) of Van Krevelen (VK) diagram suggests that plausible major functional groups of ambient oxidized OA could be the mixture of alcohols and carboxylic groups. Further, a drastic change in NR-PM1 concentrations and composition was observed during Diwali, a festival when huge amount of firecrackers are burnt across India. Three distinct sources of OA [i.e., primary OA (POA), semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and low volatility OOA (LV-OOA)] were identified via positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis. The OA mass was dominated by POA (42%), followed by LV-OOA (33%) and SV-OOA (25%). Diurnal variations in PMF factors suggest that OOA (SV-OOA + LV-OOA) were high during early morning and afternoon hours; whereas, POA was most abundant during traffic rush hours. Observations also revealed that the high OA loading events were dominated by POA during the study period. This study provides new insights on the atmospheric aging of OA, for the first time, over western India, which would be helpful in understanding the formation mechanism of secondary OA over this region.

AB Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have particle diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) are hazardous to public health whose concentration has been either measured on the ground or inferred from satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD). The latter is subject to numerous sources of errors, making the satellite retrievals of PM2.5 highly uncertain. This study developed an ensemble machine-learning (ML) algorithm for estimating PM2.5 concentration directly from Advanced Himawari Imager satellite measured top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances in 2016 integrated with meteorological parameters. The algorithm is demonstrated to perform well across China with high accuracies at different temporal scales. The model has an overall cross-validation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.86 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 17.3 mu g m(-3) for hourly PM2.5 concentration estimation. Such accuracies of the estimation on PM2.5 concentration by using TOA reflectance directly are comparable with those of the common methods on estimating PM2.5 concentration by using satellite-derived AODs, but the former has a relatively stronger predictive power relating to spatial-temporal coverages than the latter. Annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 concentration over three major the developed regions in China are estimated using the model and analyzed. The relatively stronger predictive ability of developed model in this study may help provide information about the diurnal cycle of PM2.5 concentrations as well as aid in monitoring the processes of regional pollution episodes and the evolution of PM2.5 concentration.

AB Urban trees and forests are widely used as biological filters to combat the airborne particulate matter (PM). Precipitation washing PM off from plants is regarded as filter cleaning, which is a key factor for recovering the function of foliar PM filtering. However, it is uncertain on how much PM can be total filtered by urban trees due to lack of understanding about how PM deposition, removal, resuspension and redeposition interact with species and rainfall variability. For this reason, we developed a study to determine foliar PM removal amount and rate of different sizes for five plant species commonly used for urban greening by simulated different rainfall regimes. Our specific objectives were to: (1) explore the difference in PM removal between different plant species and different rainfall patterns; (2) understand the response of foliar PM removal as a function of rainfall characteristics; and (3) quantify the relationship between foliar PM removal rate and leaf coarseness. Results showed that significant differences (P < 0.05) in PM removal amount and rate were found not only between different species within the same rainfall pattern, but also between different rainfall patterns for the same species, PM removal rates from the leaf surface were significantly correlated with rainfall intensity (P < 0.01). Different size PM cumulative removal rate exhibited an exponential loss with rainfall duration (P < 0.01). For smooth leaf surfaces, long duration-low intensity rainfall could increase PM removal rate while for rough leaf surfaces, short duration-high intensity rainfall could achieve a larger removal rate using the same amount of total rainfall. Additionally, more PM was removed by rainfall than that by water washing. The findings from this study have implications for better estimating long-term air purification potential of urban plants, and for air phytoremediation planning in urban areas.

AB Sulfate plays an important role in atmospheric haze in China, which has received considerable attention in recent years. Various types of parameterization methods and heterogeneous oxidation rates of SO2 have been used in previous studies. However, properly representing heterogeneous sulfate formation in air quality models remains a big challenge. In this study, we quantified the heterogeneous oxidation reaction using experimental results that approximate the haze conditions in China. Firstly, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the heterogeneous uptake of SO2 with different relative humidity (RH) levels and the presence of NH3 and NO2 on natural dust surfaces. Then the uptake coefficients for heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 to sulfate at different RH under NH3 and NO2 coexistence were parameterized based on the experimental results and implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ). Simulation results suggested that this new parameterization improved model performance by 6.6% in the simulation of wintertime sulfate concentrations for Beijing. The simulated maximum growth rate of SO42- during a heavy pollution period increased from 0.97 mu g m(-3) h(-1) to 10.11 mu g m(-3) h(-1). The heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 in the presence of NH3 contributed up to 23% of the sulfate concentration during heavy pollution periods.

AB For the first time, atmospheric carbonyls were identified in an island in the South China Sea during biomass burning episodes to investigate their chemical characteristics and possible sources. PM2.5 and its chemical species, including water-soluble ions, water-soluble organic compounds, organic carbon and elemental carbon, were also identified. The levels of atmospheric carbonyls in Weizhou Island were significantly higher than those in other remote areas and most polluted cities in China during the sampling period. The sum of formaldehyde (27.23 +/- 12.25 mu g/m(3)), acetaldehyde (10.67 +/- 4.46 mu g/m(3)) and isovaleraldehyde (2.35 +/- 1.21 mu g/m(3)) accounted for similar to 84% of the total 16 carbonyls. Different from other studies, isovaleraldehyde ranked the third highest carbonyl in this study, while it was extremely low in other rural areas, and it was believed to be a photochemical production from industrial pollutants. Backward trajectory analysis showed that transport from Southeast Asia could be possible sources of isovaleraldehyde. Contrary to many previous studies, diurnal variation of carbonyls at this site showed that the concentrations of carbonyls were high in the early morning and evening (82.00 mu g/m(3) and 43.18 mu g/m(3), respectively) but low in the morning and afternoon (47.99 mu g/m(3) and 32.16 mu g/m(3), respectively), indicating that transport and intense photolysis might be responsible for the diurnal variation of carbonyls in Weizhou Island. The ozone formation potential and propene-equivalent concentration were 345 mu g/m(3) and 20 mu g/m(3), respectively, suggesting that carbonyls had a significant contribution to ozone formation in Weizhou Island. Diagnostic ratios and correlation analysis together with backward trajectory analysis showed that anthropogenic activities and biomass burning emissions from Southeast Asia and northern Gulf of China were two main sources of carbonyls at the sampling site.

AB Nighttime chemistry plays an important role in NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) removal. A box model was used to study nighttime nitrate radical (NO3), O-3 oxidation and nitrate products in Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. The model input data were collected from five representative monitoring sites in YRD regions from 20 August to 11 September 2016. The production rate of NO3 was found very fast with the nocturnal average of 1-3 ppbv h(-1) in different sites. Large directly NO3 loss frequency was determined from V005 measurements, with the average of 0.01-0.03 s(-1), which represented a lower limit due to the lack of monoterpene measurement. The model results show NO3 governs nocturnal oxidation of hydrocarbons (HCs) in YRD region (80%) and O-3 contributes to 20% in average. The oxidation percentage attributable to NO3 increased against the NOx concentration, with 3.5-7.7 ppbv HCs removal by NO3 per night in average, suggesting that the production of organic nitrate by NO3 oxidation may be significant. As to products, the integrated inorganic nitrate production in the nighttime was considerable around 62% 20% of the whole day in urban sites, but the percentage was small in rural sites. More inorganic nitrate was produced with the increase of NO3, since the HCs oxidation by NO3 has already been saturated at night. This study highlights nocturnal fast oxidation by NO3 in YRD region, and the variability of oxidation is large in different NO regime.

AB Increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution affects N deposition in alpine ecosystems. Moss often dominates these ecosystems and their N content (%N) and stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) are used as indicators of atmospheric N deposition. Here, we used a single moss species (Hylocomiwn splendens) as a bioindicator of atmospheric N deposition in the mountainous areas of Japan. The moss was collected from 38 sites on all slope aspects (east, west, south, and north) ranging from 1800 to 2800 m in altitude. The correlation between moss N variables (%N and delta N-15) and environmental conditions (altitude and slope aspects) was analyzed using linear models based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the constructed models, %N showed a significant or weak negative correlation with altitude on all slope aspects. In contrast, delta N-15 was significantly and positively correlated with altitude, with high values on the western alpine slopes. When using delta N-15 as a marker of N sources, N in alpine moss on the west slope seemed to be influenced by transboundary N pollutants through particulate matter (PM), which is brought to Japan from mainland Asia by prevailing westerly winds and northwest monsoons. However, as moss N is also affected by other factors, such as different N chemical forms, fixed N from cyanobacteria, and seasonal differences in atmospheric N, further research should directly compare moss N with atmospheric N deposition to elucidate the influence of transboundary N pollutants on moss N.

AB Long-term aerosol optical and physical properties such as aerosol optical thickness and angstrom exponent were obtained from AERONET ground based sun sky radiometer located at the rural coastal Erdemli (36.6 degrees N, 34.3 degrees E) site in the Eastern Mediterranean from January 2000 to December 2014. Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and Angstrom Exponent (alpha) exhibited a great short-term variability, varying up to couple of fold from day to day. The lowest AOT values was found in winter due to the removal of particles by wet deposition. Elevated AOT values with low alpha(440.870) was observed in spring owing to sporadic mineral dust transport from North Africa and the Middle East. High AOT at 440 nm and alpha(440-870) were characterized in summer because of high gas-to-particle conversion, sluggish air masses and absence of rain. Enhanced AOT and low alpha (0.7) and fine mode fraction (47%) were associated with air flow from North Africa and the Middle East with a slight decrease from 440 nm to 1020 nm, showing importance of coarse particles. Air flow from Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Turkey, on the other hand, showed comparatively higher alpha (> 1.1) and fine mode fraction (> 62%). Three classes of aerosol were identified namely non-hygroscopic dominated, moderately hygroscopic and hygroscopic dominated. Non-hygroscopic particles were dust dominated aerosol population originated from North Africa (Southern Tunisia, Western Libya, Libya/Chad border, southern Egypt northeastern Mauritania, north Mali, southern Algeria, Northwestern Niger) and the Middle East (extending from Iraq to eastern Saudi Arabia). Moderately hygroscopic particles were a mixture of mineral dust and anthropic aerosols when the dust reached receptor site after passing through industrialized and populated sites (such as Spain, France and Italy). Hygroscopic particles, however, were ascribed to nearly mesoscale formation of secondary aerosols under the prevailing summer conditions.

AB Frequent dust storms have harm to human health and agricultural activities in Central Asia. However, there has been a great deal of uncertainty in prediction of dust storms in Central Asia. One of the important reasons is that the adaptability of different dust emission schemes has not been evaluated. Here, the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Shao2004 (Shao04) dust schemes coupled to the WRF-Chem model were used to simulate the severe dust storm occurred in Central Asia on 12-15 July 2016. Generally, this dust storm was initialed by a vortex at 500 hPa and surface cold front, and then swept across Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The Shao04 case could represent the spatial-temporal evolution of the dust storm well, especially at the northern Iran and Turkmenistan, due to its better description of the physical process of dust emission. But it overestimated the aerosol optical depth (AOD) to the southeast of the Aral Sea, which might be associated with the uncertainties of the soil particle distribution dataset. The AFWA case simulated AOD as better as Shao04 case with improved soil moisture correction factors, saltation algorithms and particle size distributions although it had smaller particle size, indicating that smaller particles are assignable. The GOCART case showed the largest dust emission areas due to the low threshold velocity. Yet both the AFWA and GOCART scheme underestimated the high AOD over northern Iran owe to its low erodibility factors. The total dust emission of the four-day period in the Shao04 scheme was 11.9 Tg, which was 2-3 times larger than those obtained in the AFWA and GOCART schemes. The significant differences of dust emission between three dust schemes may essentially depend on the sensitivities of threshold friction velocity on surface property.

AB Guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) has a high emission rate from wood burning and mainly exists in the gas phase, but the formation potential of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the atmospheric oxidation of guaiacol has not been well determined yet. In this work, SOA formation from the gas-phase reaction of guaiacol with OH radicals was investigated using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) under different experimental conditions. The results showed that SOA yield was dependent on guaiacol concentration, OH exposure, and the presence of SO2 and NO2. SOA yield firstly increased and then decreased as a function of OH exposure. The maximum SOA yield (0.28-0.54) obtained at different guaiacol concentrations could be well-expressed by a one-product model. The SOA oxidation degree was represented by the carbon oxidation state (OSc) and f(44)/f(43) (the ratio of organic mass fractions of m/z 44 to m/z 43), which both increased linearly and significantly with the increase of OH exposure. In addition, SO2 and NO2 promoted SOA formation, for which the maximum yield enhancements were 13.38% and 10.69%, respectively. The N/C ratio (0.034-0.045) indicated that NO2 participated in the OH-initiated reaction of guaiacol, consequently resulting in the formation of organic nitrates. The experimental results would be helpful to further the understanding of SOA formation from the atmospheric oxidation of guaiacol and its subsequent impacts on air quality and climate.

AB Significant emissions from transportation contribute to the formation of O-3 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), causing poor air quality and health. In this study, four scenarios were developed to understand how future fleet electrification and turnover of both gasoline and diesel vehicles affect air quality and health in the Houston Metropolitan area. These scenarios considered increased vehicle activity and various configurations of emissions controls. Comparing to a base year of 2013, model predictions for 2040 indicated a similar to 50% emissions increase in the Business As Usual (BAU) case, and similar to 50%, similar to 75%, and similar to 95% reductions in the three distinct emissions control cases, the Moderate Electrification (ME), Aggressive Electrification (AE), and Complete Turnover (CT) cases, respectively. Each modeling scenario was conducted using a high-resolution (1 km) WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ-BenMAP air quality and health modeling framework, which helped capture urban features in higher detail. The emissions control cases resulted in 1-4 ppb maximum 8 h O-3 increase along highways and reductions both in the regions enclosed by the highways and those downwind. Simulated PM2.5 concentrations decreased between 0.5 and 2 mu g m(-3). Health impact results suggest that increased O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations from the BAU case will lead to 122 additional premature deaths with respect to 2013. However, reduced emissions for the control cases (ME, AE, CT) will prevent 114-246 premature deaths. Additionally, about 7,500 asthma exacerbation and 5,500 school loss days will be prevented in the ME case, benefiting younger individuals. The economic benefits generally followed the same trends as health impacts. The analysis framework developed in this study can be applied to other metropolitan areas. The effects of motor vehicle electrification on power plant emissions were estimated using the Argonne National Laboratory's Autonomie data, and indicated the electrification load to be negligible as opposed to projected electricity generation.

AB Sea salt is one of the major aerosols in the atmosphere in both the fine and coarse size ranges. Newly formed sea salt particles have a similar composition to seawater; including elements such as Na, Cl, Mg, S, Ca, Br and K. However, once in the atmosphere sea salt particles can undergo chemical reactions with other airborne pollutants, resulting in a loss of chlorine (whereas Na is conservative). The modified aerosol is commonly referred to as aged sea spray or aged sea salt.
   Fine aerosols from two sites in the Sydney Basin were analysed for source fingerprints with components that may have originated from the ocean (i.e. fresh and aged sea spray). At Lucas Heights, 18.4 km from the nearest coast, the average source fingerprint concentrations of fresh and aged sea spray were 0.47 +/- 0.02 and 1.08 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3), respectively. At Richmond, 58 km from the coast, the average fingerprint concentrations of fresh and aged sea spray were 0.26 +/- 0.01 and 0.87 +/- 0.02 mu g/m(3), respectively. At Lucas heights, fresh and aged sea spray contributed to 11% and 21% of PM2.5, respectively. At Richmond fresh and aged sea spray contributed to 4.8 +/- 0.35 and 16 +/- 0.5% of the PM2.5, respectively.
   The Cl/Na ratios of aged sea spray at Lucas Heights and Richmond were 0.72 and 0.87, respectively, in comparison to 1.54 for fresh sea salt. At Richmond the corresponding Ca/Na and K/Na ratios were both 0.037 (close to that of seawater), and at Lucas Heights, the corresponding ratios were 0.038 and 0.026, respectively.
   Back trajectory and Radon-222 analysis demonstrated that the largest concentrations of aged sea spray occur when the air masses had travelled over regions of anthropogenic sources. This confirms an interaction between anthropogenic precursors and sea spray that liberates chlorine enabling it to contribute to other chemical reactions in the atmosphere, e.g. resulting in an increase in the formation of ozone.

AB Deposition of atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) in precipitation can be an important source of reactive nitrogen (N) to ecosystems, particularly in regions with high nitrogen oxide (NOx = nitric oxide (NO) + nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) emissions. However, high resolution deposition data are lacking for most systems. We conducted hourly precipitation sampling across six growing season storms in a forested area historically subjected to some of the highest levels of chronic N deposition in the United States. To characterize the influence of electricity generating unit (EGU), vehicle, and biogenic NOx emissions on NO3- deposition, we calculated the total NO emitted from these sources within a 100 km radius of air mass back trajectories determined for Fernow Experimental Forest (West Virginia, USA). We combined these emissions estimates with established N-15 isotope values for NOx sources in a three end-member mixing model to predict source-based delta N-15 values of deposition reaching the study site on an hourly basis. To evaluate the effect of NOx, oxidation pathways on measured delta N-15-NO3- values, we compared observed hourly isotope values to a coupled delta N-15 and Delta O-17 array representing N isotope exchange between atmospheric oxidized N molecules. Within individual events, delta N-15, delta O-18, and Delta O-17 values ranged by as much as 19.5 parts per thousand, 28.9 parts per thousand, and 13.8 parts per thousand, respectively. This extreme short-term isotopic variability suggests a dynamic mix of NO sources, oxidation pathways, and fractionation processes contributing to HNO3 formation. During every storm, precipitation delta N-15-NO3- values were lower than those expected to result from predominant HNO3 formation pathways or oxidation of estimated NO. emissions along back trajectories, suggesting a systematic underestimation of NOx. contributions to atmospheric HNO3 formation from isotopically depleted soil emissions. Together, these analyses represent the most comprehensive assessment to date relating high temporal resolution delta N-15-NO3- observations to NOx emission sources, oxidation chemistry, and isotopic fractionation effects. We present the first observations of extreme intra-storm delta N-15, delta O-18, and Delta O-17 variability, emphasizing the need for improved constraints on soil NOx emissions, forest canopy effects, and their role in atmospheric NO3deposition and isotope dynamics in forests.

AB The reaction constants and products for the reactions of OH radicals with different C-15 alkanes, were determined by using Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrum (PTR-MS) in the smog chamber. Rate coefficients (in units of 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) k(1(pentadecane)) = 1.72 +/- 0.1 8,k(2(2,6,10-trimethyldodecane)) = 1.90 +/- 0.20, 1c3(nonylcyclohexane) = 2.09 +/- 0.22 were first obtained by the relative rate method using toluene and m-xylene as reference compounds at (298 +/- 1)K and atmospheric pressure. In addition, the products of these reactions were measured by PTR-MS simultaneously. The results show that the major gas phase products observed in the OH radicals reactions were aldehydes and ketones for C-15 alkanes. The possible reaction mechanisms were speculated and the atmospheric implications were also discussed.

AB The reaction of OH radicals with ethylene (CH2CH2) and formaldehyde (CH2O) molecules with and without water have been investigated using ab initio/DFT potential energy surfaces (PESs) at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ// BHandHLYP//aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory. The rate coefficients for the bimolecular reaction pathways OH + CH2X center dot center dot center dot H2O (X = CH2, O) and CH2X + H2O center dot center dot center dot HO were calculated using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling (SCT) correction. The kinetic results show that OH radical adds to C=C bond in CH2CH2, and abstract the hydrogen atoms from CH2O, similar to its isoelectronic analogous OH + CH2NH (+ H2O) reaction. The catalytic effect of a single water molecule on OH + CH2X (X = CH2, 0) reaction system shows that the initial water complexation step is essential in the rate coefficients calculation. The calculated rate coefficient for the OH + CH2CH2(+H2O) reaction at 300K is 6 x 10(-16) ems molecule(-1) s(-1) and for OH + CH2O(+H2O) reaction at 300K is 8.1 x 10(-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The rate coefficient for OH + CH2CH2(+ H2O) reaction is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than OH + CH2NH(+H2O) reaction (at 300K is 5.1 x 10(-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) and rate coefficient for OH + CH2O reaction is in good agreement with OH + CH2NH reaction. In general, the rate coefficients for OH + CH2X (X = CH2, O)center dot center dot center dot H2O and for CH2X + H2O center dot center dot center dot HO reactions are similar to 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than reaction without water molecule. Our results predict that catalytic effect of single water molecule on OH + CH2CH2 and OH + CH2O reactions can make a negligible contribution to the gas phase removal of CH2CH2 and CH2O by OH radicals because the dominated water-assisted process depends parametrically on water concentration. As a result, the overall reaction rate coefficients are smaller. The present results provide a better understanding of gas phase catalytic effect of a water molecule on the most important atmospheric and combustion reaction prototypes.

AB The United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s SPECIATE database contains speciated particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions profiles. Emissions profiles from anthropogenic combustion, industry, wildfires, and agricultural sources among others are key inputs for creating chemically-resolved emissions inventories for air quality modeling. While the database and its use for air quality modeling are routinely updated and evaluated, this work sets out to systematically prioritize future improvements and communicate speciation data needs to the research community. We first identify the most prominent profiles (PM and VOC) used in the EPA's 2014 emissions modeling platform based on PM mass and VOC mass and reactivity. It is important to note that the on-road profiles were excluded from this analysis since speciation for these profiles is computed internally in the MOVES model. We then investigate these profiles further for quality and to determine whether they were being appropriately matched to source types while also considering regional variability of speciated pollutants. We then applied a quantitative needs assessment ranking system which rates the profile based on age, appropriateness (i.e. is the profile being used appropriately), prevalence in the EPA modeling platform and the quality of the reference. Our analysis shows that the highest ranked profiles (e.g. profile assignments with the highest priority for updates) include PM2.5 profiles for fires (prescribed, agricultural and wild) and VOC profiles for crude oil storage tanks and residential wood combustion of pine wood. Top ranked profiles may indicate either that there are problems with the currently available source testing or that current mappings of profiles to source categories within EPA's modeling platform need improvement. Through this process, we have identified 29 emissions source categories that would benefit from updated mapping. Many of these mapping mismatches are due to lack of emissions testing for appropriate source categories. In addition, we conclude that new source emissions testing would be especially beneficial for residential wood combustion, nonroad gasoline exhaust and nonroad diesel equipment.

AB This study aims to determine the level and potential sources of nocturnal surface ozone (NSO) in different regions in Malaysia. Eleven-year (2005-2015) ozone data from 37 continuous air quality monitoring stations throughout Malaysia have been analysed to determine spatio-temporal variations in NSO concentrations. NSO daily maximum concentrations from different regions in Malaysia were used for seasonal variation analysis while linear regression and the Mann-Kendall trend test were used for the annual variation analysis. Average ratios of mean NSO to daytime surface ozone (DSO) for the whole country were found to be 60% of DSO (0.58-0.61). The east coast of the Malaysian Peninsula recorded the highest ratio (70% of DSO) while the central region recorded the lowest concentration (50% of DSO). Titration processes, particularly by NO in the urban areas of the central region, and long transboundary movement of ozone to the east coast are expected to influence the concentration of ozone in these two regions, respectively. On certain occasions, the NSO concentrations (with a maximum value of 137 ppb) exceeded the limit of 100 ppb, the value suggested by Malaysian Air Quality Standard for ambient ozone concentration. The monthly diurnal variation analysis revealed the occurrence of secondary/nocturnal peaks at more than 50% of the stations occurring around 0300-0500 h. The NSO was found to be influenced by the monsoonal season with higher concentrations mainly observed during the boreal winter season. The long-term trend analysis presented the country's overall NSO as having an increasing trend at 27% of the stations.

AB The paper presents the variation of aerosol columnar variation and vertical profiles over the study area encompassing a portion of Central Himalayan region and the surrounding planar areas. The analysis is carried out using decadal (2007-2016) Level-2 CALIOP (onboard CALIPSO), Level-3 MODIS (onboard Aqua/Terra) and MISR (onboard Terra) datasets. Four seasons have been considered, namely, DJF (December-January-February), MAM (March-April-may), JJA (June-July-August) and SON (September-October-November). The CALIOP data has been screened using quality flags, i.e., CAD score, aerosol layer fraction and extinction quality checks. There are also signatures of elevated aerosol layers, especially during winter (DJF) and post-monsoon (SON) seasons. Latitudinal and longitudinal variations of the vertical structure have also been presented. The HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis has been carried out in order to explore the changes in the sources of the aerosols during different seasons. It is seen that as we go higher up in the altitudes, the long range transport becomes more dominant. Compared to the other seasons, the air masses are more localized in JJA season. The changing aerosol amounts at different heights of the atmosphere have also been discussed in terms of decadal trends for the four seasons. These trends have been supplemented by the AOD trends from the passive satellite sensors. We find that aerosol amounts have increased in the last decade during DJF and SON seasons, when the atmospheric conditions are more stable. On the contrary, aerosol amounts have significantly decreased in JJA season throughout the vertical column. The effect of changing amounts of aerosols may have impacts on the snow cover variability as well. In this connection, the seasonal trends in snow cover have also been explored during the considered decadal period. Especially during the DJF and SON seasons, decreasing trends in snow cover are observed when the aerosol amounts have been found to be increased.

AB Most cities in China have suffered severe atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution, with reduced visibility and worsened air quality. Fugitive dust that primarily originates from soils through the action of wind and anthropogenic activities is recognized to be a major source of urban PM. However, it remains challenging to quantify and parameterize fugitive dust emission from various sources due to a lack of observation data. In this study, a portable wind erosion system, PI-SWERI, was applied to characterize the dynamics and magnitude of PM10 and PM2.5 (particles smaller than 10 mu m and 2.5 mu m respectively) emissions from several possible sources in Nanjing, a typical large city in the Yangtze River Delta economic regions, East China. Results indicate that aerodynamic suspension and abrasion were two major physical mechanisms responsible for fugitive dust emissions, with varying characteristics by location. Changes of emission characteristics and quantities were primarily associated with differences in the supply of fine particles available for wind erosion, controlled by source-specific surface characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances. Construction sites and unpaved roads were identified as two significant sources, with total emission rates of 95.85 (56.97) and 57.22 (32.62) kg s(-1) respectively for PM10 (PM2.5) at a friction velocity of 0.82 m s(-1). These values were up to five times the amounts of PM emitted from arable lands and woodlands, and 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those from paved roads, grasslands and bare lands. These data demonstrate the importance of construction sites and unpaved roads as local PM sources which might be significant in policy making for air quality management strategies and prioritization of emission control targets in an urban area.

AB At present, there were countless documents and periodicals which have been paying more attention to the impact factors of carbon emissions at different levels. Nevertheless, in previous studies, regional classification methods are always based on geographical location or single factor which lack of comprehensive indicators for measurement. In this paper, 30 provinces are divided into three areas (advantageous area, potential area and backward area) from 1996 to 2015 by factor analysis and cluster analysis according to the different social development which is measured by urbanization, economy, energy utilization, industry and technology. An extented STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model containing with panel regression models are utilized to evaluate the influence of factors on CO2 emissions in China at national and diverse regional levels. The results indicate that the R&D investment and energy cleanliness play important roles in reducing CO2 emissions at advantageous area. Besides, the impact of demographic factor in potential area is higher than the other two areas. Meanwhile, improving the tertiary industry level is more essential in backward area than others. On the whole, the effect of economic growth has a greatest positive influence among three regions. Nevertheless, there exists EKC curve for three regions which shows a downward trend of CO2 emissions with increasing GDP per capita in the future. Finally, the concrete solution depends, of course, on the circumstances in three differentiated regions.

AB In the framework of the INDAAF (International Network to study Deposition and Atmospheric chemistry in AFrica) programme, part of the ACTRIS European Research Infrastructure for the long-term observation of Aerosols, Cloud, and Trace gases, this paper aims to study trends and seasonal variability of surface atmospheric NO2 and HNO3 concentrations, and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) NO2 over 6 sites in tropical Africa. Sites are located in west and central Africa to represent the major African biomes: dry savanna (Banizoumbou, Niger and Katibougou, Mali), wet savanna (Djougou, Benin and Lamto, Cote d'Ivoire) and forest (Bomassa, Republic of Congo and Zoetele Cameroon). Ground-based NO2 and HNO3 concentrations were obtained over the period 1998-2015 using INDAAF passive samplers at a monthly basis, and NO2 Vertical Column Densities (VCDs) from OMI for a 1 degrees grid cell around each sites were obtained from 2005 to 2015. Mean annual NO2 concentrations ranged from 2.3 +/- 1.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.4 ppb from dry savannas to forests, representing a north south gradient. In dry savannas, we observe two concentration peaks of NO2 appearing at the beginning and the end of the wet season both for ground-based and satellite measurements, whereas at wet savannas and forest sites, NO2 concentrations are highest in the dry season. The seasonality of surface NO2 observations provide further evidence for a large role of microbial soil NOx emissions in dry savannas and of biomass burning NOx emissions in wet savanna and forest sites. Mean annual HNO3 concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 ppb in dry and wet savannas to 0.2-0.3 ppb in forest. In dry ecosystems, higher HNO3 concentrations are measured in the early wet season, consistent with NO2 results. The analysis of a long-term dataset of surface 03 concentrations indicates that HNO3 production can mainly be explained by the photooxidation of NOx. Mann-Kendall and Seasonal Kendall statistical tests showed that NO2 surface concentrations have a significant decreasing seasonal and annual trends at multiple sites (p-value < 0.05) ranging from -2.96% yr(-1) (at Zoetele) to -0.64% yr(-1) (at Banizoumbou). HNO3 results indicate no trends except at Bomassa (1.07% yr(-1)). The decreasing NO2 ground-based concentration trends observed in wet savannas sites are correlated with OMI NO2 decreasing trends at these sites. Trends obtained for NO2 concentrations in wet savanna and forest ecosystems are consistent with trends of NOx biomass burning emissions.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are largely affected by ambient temperature. However, responses of source-specific VOCs to ambient temperature are poorly understood. Based on one-year (2016.4-2017.3) observations for 57 VOC species (average: 33.4 +/- 26 ppbv), and on the use of a k-means cluster technique and positive matrix factorization model, temperature dependence of VOCs and their potential sources were studied. The VOC reactivity was dominated by alkenes, though alkanes contributed the most to the VOCs both by volume and by carbon atoms. The cluster analysis suggested that real-world VOCs were influenced directly and indirectly by temperature. The responses of the VOCs in terms of volume and carbon atoms to temperature exhibited V-shape patterns, and the inflection points occurred when temperatures were around 15 similar to 25 degrees C. Nevertheless, the VOC reactivity generally increased with increasing temperature, suggesting that temperature could be used as a proxy for VOC reactivity. The source apportionment study revealed that vehicle emissions (44.8%) contributed the most to ambient VOCs, and followed by natural gas (NG)/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)/Combustion (24.9%), petrochemical industry (9.6%), other industrial process (8.4%), solvent use (7.4%), and biogenic emission (4.9%). Solvent use and biogenic emissions were the greatest contributors to VOC reactivity. Unexpectedly high propane/ethylene ratios were observed at low temperatures. This might be associated with domestic heating-related emissions from NG/LPG sources because their contributions generally increased with the decreasing temperature. By comparison with similar to 25 degrees C, the VOC concentrations and ozone formation potentials contributed by vehicles were respectively 7- and 2.6- times greater at similar to 0 degrees C (cold engine starts dominance), and were 50.4% and 57.5% greater at similar to 35 degrees C (gasoline evaporation dominance). Local emission controls for VOCs were beneficial for alleviating atmospheric secondary pollution because the potential source-areas of VOCs were mostly distributed in the geographically flat North China Plain. However, alkanes-dominated VOC sources (e.g., vehicle emission, NG/LPG) could experience long-distance air transport bacause of their relatively long atmospheric lifetime. The results highlight that the temperature dependences of VOCs depend on the emission sources, and this is of great value in understanding the linkage between meteorology and air quality.

AB Air pollution problems in East Asia are now critical. One issue attracting much attention is the high level of aerosol loading, so that, aerosol effects on climate and air quality are more significant than in other regions. These effects can substantially influence air quality prediction. Thus, it leads to a need to apply online models for climate and air quality simulations in this region. In this study, an online coupled meteorology and air quality modeling system composed of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied for the purpose of evaluating the impacts of aerosol direct effects on meteorology and air quality in East Asia. Simulations were carried out in both one-way and two-way online (without and with the aerosol direct effects) for the whole historical year 2014 at a horizontal resolution of 45 km x 45 km. The model showed a good performance in reproducing the observations as well as capturing the spatial and temporal fluctuation of meteorological variables and air pollutant concentrations. On average, due to aerosol direct effects, shortwave radiation (SWR), temperature (T), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), and wind speed (WS) were decreased by -7.71%, -0.42 degrees C, -8.13% and -1.00%, respectively; PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 concentrations were increased by +6.26%, +4.91%, +7.48%, respectively; while O-3 concentration was decreased by -3.12% over China, Korea, and Japan for the entire year. Analyzing the cause-effect relationships among the responses of the above selected meteorological variables and air pollutants indicated that the reduction in SWR at ground surface caused by aerosol direct effects produces a decrease in T and PBLH, leading to an increase in PM2.5 concentration and a decrease in 03 concentration. Aerosol direct effects also affected long-range transport of PM2.5 from the continent to downwind area. Investigation of eastward response of PM2.5 to aerosol direct effects revealed that the amount of long-range transported PM2.5 was decreased in downwind area due to the impact of aerosol direct effects. It was mainly attributed to the increase in dry deposition of PM2.5 precursors and the decrease in WS in the continent. The results of study highlighted that the aerosol direct effects play an important role in the atmospheric dynamic and chemistry and cause considerable impacts on East Asia air quality.

AB While the ongoing increases in the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (N) in China have attracted ever more attention, to date there has been little research in N deposition in inland aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we quantified the bulk and dry atmospheric N deposition around the Dongting Lake, which is connected to the Yangtze River and is the second largest freshwater lake in China. Bulk N deposition averaged 48.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), of which ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) accounted for 41.6%, 35.1%, and 23.3%, respectively. Dry N deposition averaged 27.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and was dominated by NH3. Bulk N deposition was higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter at the sites around the lake because of the high precipitation. NH3 deposition was the highest in spring and summer due to fertilization, and NOx deposition was the highest in winter because of the combustion of coal for domestic heating. The concentrations of NH3 significantly decreased with the concentration of NH4-N, indicating below-cloud scavenging and local sources. The concentrations of NOx and NO3-N were not correlated, indicating long-distance transfer of NOx. Bulk N deposition in our study was generally twice that reported in other studies, even when only inorganic N species in bulk deposition were considered. Total N deposition averaged 75.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which was much higher than that reported in other studies. Both N deposited directly into the lake and N deposited across the lake basin that was subsequently transported to the lake in runoff could enrich the N concentration of the lake water and increase the gross primary productivity (GPP). Our results highlighted the importance of integrated management that includes both aquatic and atmospheric systems at either the lake basin scale or regional scale, rather than at the individual lake-scale.

AB The aim of this study is to explore the aerosol optical depth (AOD) - an indicator of air quality, based on satellite data over Central Asia. Due to limited studies and lack of knowledge regarding AOD variations over this region, five countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and fifteen sites including the capital cities were selected for the analysis. Long-term Aqua-MODIS Collection 6.1 Deep Blue (DB) AOD observations at 10 km spatial resolution were obtained for 2002-2017 and the angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) was calculated using spectral AOD observations. AOD and AE were explored based on seasonal and inter-annual scale. The relationship between aerosol loading and economic indicator (gross domestic product) was also analyzed. Highest frequencies of low AOD and high AE were observed in all countries. Average AOD (AE) values during the study period were 0.17 +/- 0.09 (1.29 +/- 0.17) for Kazakhstan, 0.11 +/- 0.13 (1.41 +/- 0.13) for Kyrgyzstan, 0.17 +/- 0.14 (1.36 +/- 0.18) for Tajikistan, 0.20 +/- 0.10 (1.10 +/- 0.28) for Turkmenistan, and 0.18 +/- 0.09 (1.18 +/- 0.24) for Uzbekistan. Summer season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, whereas spring season experienced highest aerosol loading over Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan possibly due to the influence of less precipitation and dust from the arid regions. All fifteen cities selected in this study exhibited increasing aerosol load. Aerosol types based on the relationship between AOD and AE were investigated, results suggested the clean continental aerosol as a major aerosol type over the region, whereas the contribution of mixed aerosols was observed during spring and summer seasons. This study suggests for establishment of ground-based aerosol monitoring stations network and inclusions of modeling works to understand the complex nature of aerosol over this vast landmass.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PANS) derivatives, such as oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), some of which are more toxic and persistent than parent PAHs, have been ubiquitously detected in the environment. Gaseous and particulate PAHs, OPAHs, and NPAHs in the air were measured in an urban environment of Chongqing in southwest China in 2016. Annual average concentrations were 79.9 +/- 40.5 ng/m(3), 93.7 +/- 75.2 ng/m(3) and 1.65 +/- 1.43 ng/m(3) for Sigma(29) PAHs, E-10 OPAHs and Sigma(27) NPAHs, respectively. PAHs had highest level in winter and lowest level in summer while NPAHs and OPAHs showed relatively higher concentrations in summer than spring and autumn, which may be explained by stronger secondary formation of NPAHs and OPAHs in summer. Source apportionment analysis revealed that biomass burning, coal combustion, and petroleum combustion were the main sources for PAHs, while secondary formation, especially in summer, contributed greatly to OPAHs and NPAHs. Gas/particle partition coefficient (logK(P)) of PAHs, OPAHs and NPAHs, calculated from our observation data, was found to correlate well with the corresponding subcooled liquid vapor pressures (logP(L)(0)). The shallower slope of the linear regression between logK(P) and logP(L)(0) for PAHs ( - 0.61 to - 0.52) than OPAHs or NPAHs ( - 2.14 to - 0.73) indicated stronger absorption into the atmospheric particles for PAHs. Three gas/particle partitioning models were evaluated, including the Junger-Pankow adsorption model, the K-OA absorption model, and the Dual octanol-air/soot-air model. Compared to the measured values of particle-bound fractions, model predicted values were in reasonable range for PAHs, but were underestimated for NPAHs and OPAHs, suggesting that other important factors such as the influence of RH should be incorporated in gas/particle partitioning models for less hydrophobic compounds, especially in humid areas.

AB To investigate the transport and formation mechanism of pollution in Beijing, this study explored the vertical profiles of aerosol properties using aircraft measurement during a regional transport (RT) pollution event from 10th to 12th December 2016. The aerosol chemical composition and size distribution were characterized. Different vertical structures exhibited during three periods (defined as before RT, during RT, and after RT) for this pollution event. Before RT, PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) mass loading were at low level in the mixing layer (ML) when the clean northerly air mass dominated. During RT, an elevated aerosol layer, in which BC and PM2.5 mass concentrations were about 1.5 times higher than that at the ground level, was found in the upper ML (at 400-900 m) over Beijing. This elevated aerosol layer was advected by the prevailing southwesterly air mass which transported the pollutants from the intensively polluted southwestern region over Beijing. These aerosols through RT featured with pronounced secondary compositions and large coatings on BC particles. After RT, the pollutants were significantly diluted by the prevailing NW air mass, whereas the aerosol concentration almost maintained in the near surface, leading to notable vertical gradient. The continued surface pollution may result from the low wind speed and secondary aerosol formation in the next day. This study suggests that only the ground observation could not fully explain the pollution event, but the variation of vertical structure of aerosol properties should be considered to elucidate the formation mechanism of pollution over Beijing.

AB This study used a closed-circuit boundary-layer wind tunnel, with a series of instruments including SO2, NO2, O-3, NH3, and PM2.5 monitors and an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), to explore the effects of relative humidity (RH) on properties of ambient fine particles (PM2.5 and PM1) in the northern suburbs of Nanjing. The results showed under all conditions the PM1 concentration were influenced largely by organic matter, and meanwhile, the contribution of sulfate decreased. Under non-humidification conditions, the mass concentrations of fine particles increased with the increase of RH. The mass concentration of PM2.5 was not influenced by the SO2 concentration and changed in a manner similar to those of the NO2 and NH3 concentrations at higher RH; however, the mass concentration varied inversely with changes of O-3 concentration. The mass concentration and mass fraction of sulfate and nitrate changed in different manners as RH varied. CxHy+ ions took up the highest percentage of organic matter in the AMS spectra, indicating organics in a large part might be emitted as primary organic aerosol (POA), and the fine particles were overall alkaline. With atomized humidification (at constant temperature), the mass concentrations of all fine particles showed an explosive increase, with PM(2.5 )levels rising at an average rate of 11.9 mu g/m(3)-min. The increase in the fine particle concentration was primarily due to increases in the PM1-2.5 level. The percentage of organic matter increased with RH, with C.11,0 +/- and CxHyOz+ ions becoming the major ion groups indicating the dominance of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) species, facilitated by high humidity. The SO42-/SO2 ratio increased with RH, indicating that sulfate was formed at high humidity rapidly via an aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 and results show that O-3 might become an important oxidant. The fine particles were acidic, and the increased O/C ratio also indicates the SOA contribution.

AB This study evaluates the long-term Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level 3 atmospheric aerosol products over land. For this purpose, three monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets, including Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB) and combined DT and DB (DTB) during 2003-2017, are collected. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 2 Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and quality-assured) monthly measurements at 431 sites around the world are selected for comparison. This study attempts to provide a better understanding of the different MODIS products for their applicability at multiple spatial scales and their suitability for representing the long-term trend of aerosol characteristics. Experiments are performed with direct comparisons between MODIS retrievals and AERONET measurements at global, local to site scales. Meanwhile, the spatial and temporal variations are also compared and discussed. Our results illustrate that C6.1 MODIS AOD retrievals are well correlated with AERONET AOD measurements globally, while the DTB product performs best at most regions, yet the DB product is superior at the site scale. In general, Terra AOD products always overestimate while Aqua AOD products are more accurate in describing the annual mean AOD loadings over land. For long-term aerosol trends, there are small differences between Terra and Aqua aerosol products. Among the three aerosol datasets, neither one can consistently outperform the others in both spatial and temporal aerosol variations over land. In general, DTB products can more accurately capture the correct aerosol changes and are strongly recommended for selection in related aerosol studies at the global scale.

AB Ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured hourly by the photochemical assessment monitoring station (PAMS) in Taichung were collected to analyze characteristics and provide source apportionment of VOCs. In this study, aromatics and alkanes were found to be the major VOC categories. The major species included toluene, m,p-xylene, propane, ethane, n-butane, and isopentane, which came from the east and southeast. VOC concentrations were highest in March and lowest in July, due to temperature, accumulated precipitation, boundary layer effects, and photochemical reactions. Positive matrix factorization analysis showed that industrial emissions (solvent usage and industry) were the major source, which originated from the northwest to south. Traffic emissions (fuel evaporation and vehicular emissions) were the second highest source and came from the southeast. An estimation of ozone formation suggests that industrial emissions were still a key source. Therefore, effective abatement strategies for industrial emissions should be given priority for VOC control.

AB Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a significant component of organic aerosol (OA), formed majorly via aqueous-phase processing (aqSOA) during winter fog period yet it persist as a significant source of uncertainties within climate models due to lack of sufficient knowledge about its ambient formation and evolution processes. Kanpur is situated at the center of Indo-Gangetic Plain which witnesses several fog episodes every year during winter time. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of aqueous-phase processing on the formation pathway of OA, its composition and oxidative properties during five fog processing periods, i.e., Pre-Fog-Period (Pr-F-P), Activating-Fog-Period (A-F-P), Fog-Period (F-P), Dissipating-Fog-Period (D-F-P), and Post-Fog-Period (Po-F-P). A-F-P was observed as heavily polluted period (249.8 +/- 47.8 mu g/m(3)) while F-P period was least polluted (153.1 +/- 37.8 mu g/m(3)) indicating the wet removal through grown fog droplets. Oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA-1) processed mainly through biomass burning (BB) emission suggesting is a good surrogate of aqueous SOA, and it gets enhanced significantly during high biomass-burning emissions during A-F-P and D-F-P under acidic aerosol conditions. Also, in contrast to formation mechanism, our results proposing specific formation process (fragmentation, functionalization, or oligomerization) for different fog processing periods. A-F-P and DF-P periods are crucial possibly for the formation of OA dominant through oligomerization mechanism in which functionalization of -OH moieties occurs in A-F-P periods, whereas oligomerization mechanism with the addition of carbonyl (aldehyde/ketone) moieties could occur in D-F-P periods, accompanied by acidic aerosol as well as high aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). In contrast, during OA evolution process, Van Krevelen (VK) slope, O/C ratio, SOA O/C ratio (O/CooA), average oxidation state of carbon for bulk-aerosol (OSc) and SOA (OSc)(ooA), substantially varies throughout all the fog processing periods.

AB Size-resolved elemental measurements were conducted for the water-soluble fraction of particulate matter at a central California coastal city, Marina, during two separate summertime field campaigns: the Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) in 2013 and the Fog and Stratocumulus Evolution (FASE) campaign in 2016. Two Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactors (MOUDIs) were used to quantify mass size distributions of 29 elements and a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed six characteristic sources during the measurement periods: (i) Crustal Emissions (3.9% of total mass), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (24.4%), (iii) Biomass Burning (13.1%), (iv) Waste Facilities (8.7%), (v) Vehicular Emissions (4.4%), and (vi) Marine Emissions (45.4%). Characteristic elements from each of these sources included the following: (i) Crustal Emissions (Fe, Al, Ti, Pt), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (Zn, As, Rb, K, Cu, V), (iii) Biomass Burning (Rb, K, Cu, Pt), (iv) Waste Facilities (Ag, Cd, Ni, Al), (v) Vehicular Emissions (Zn, Zr, V, Mn), and (vi) Marine Emissions (Na, Sr, V, Mn). Temporally-resolved results revealed higher PM levels associated with Vehicular Emissions (day/night mass concentration ratio = 31.3), Crustal Emissions (day/night = 20.0), and Secondary Aerosol (day/night = 27.2) during the day compared to night due to some combination of more daytime anthropogenic activity, wind speed/directional factors, and photochemistry. The Marine Emissions factor exhibited a day/night concentration ratio of exactly 1.0. Mass size distributions revealed characteristic peaks in four diameter ranges: 0.1-0.18 mu m, 0.32-0.56 mu m, 1.0-1.8 mu m, and 3.2-5.6 mu m. The number of modes varied depending on the species and degree of wildfire influence, with additional differences observed between the NICE and FASE wildfire periods.

AB We statistically assessed temporal variations of observed concentrations of eight atmospheric pollutants (SO2 , NO, NO2 , NOy, O-3 , CO, NH3 , and HNO3) at three urban sites and one rural site in the eastern United States for a ten-year period (4 years for NH3). Diurnal/seasonal patterns of observed mean concentrations and their decade scale trends under different weather conditions were evaluated. Concentrations of pollutants decreased consistently during the observation period (as long as 1997-2013), although night time ozone during winter appears to increase because of reduced NO-O-3 titration. This study shows that the decay time of major air pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NOx can be short as a few hours to one day. We also identified substantial differences between the mean concentrations of pollutants at clear sky and overcast conditions that could introduce biases into satellite observations. Surface concentrations of SO2 and CO are distinctly higher under cloud free than under overcast conditions by similar to 30% and similar to 20% respectively. NO2 shows a complex pattern, but demonstrates lower daytime concentrations under cloud-free skies. All of these estimates are important for understanding the chemical climatology of these atmospheric pollutants, especially their diurnal/seasonal cycles under different weather conditions. For four-year measurements, NH3 shows a substantial difference, with clear sky observations roughly a factor of two higher than those under overcast conditions. To track changes in the future, the full daily cycle of atmospheric pollutants monitored by geostationary satellite such as the future TEMPO mission may better capture patterns and trends.

AB Phase and amplitude of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes of reactive nitrogen compounds are poorly understood due to a lack of suitable observation methods. Understanding the biophysical controls of the surface nitrogen exchange is essential for the parameterization of process-based and chemical transport models that can be used for the determination of regional or national nitrogen budgets. In this study, we investigated similarities in time series of net total reactive nitrogen (Sigma N-r) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes above forest with regard to their variability and driving factors. We found corresponding shapes of the mean diurnal summertime patterns of Sigma N-r, and CO2. While ecosystem respiration leads to a net CO2 release at night, Sigma N-r, was on average deposited throughout the entire observation period. Using artificial neural network analysis, global radiation (R-g) was identified to be the main control for both Sigma N-r, and CO2. While the concentration of Sigma N-r, substantially improved the coefficient of determination for IN, fluxes when used as a secondary driver, only minor improvements of 2-3% were found for CO2 fluxes when using for example temperature or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) as secondary driver. Considering two dominant drivers, 41 and 66% of the variability in Sigma N-r, and CO2 fluxes, respectively, could be explained. Further data stratification for Sigma N-r revealed that higher concentrations, higher temperature, and higher VPD as well as dry leaf surfaces tend to favour higher deposition of Sigma N-r,N- whereas lower concentrations, lower temperature, and lower VPD as well as wet leaf surfaces mainly correspond to situations when less Sigma N-r, was deposited or even emitted. Our results support the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions, their driving factors, and establish a link between Sigma N-r, and CO2 exchange, which may be beneficial for future developments in state-of-the-art exchange modelling.

AB China implemented the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan since 2013, aiming at significantly improving air quality in major areas and cities in 2017. To investigate the changes of the characteristics of PM2.5 and its major chemical components, formation mechanisms, and sources apportionment during 2013-2017 in urban Handan, which was one of the top polluted cities in China, we analyzed the chemical compositions of PM2.5 samples for the entire year of 2013 and 2017, as well as a comprehensive dataset including continuous online hourly observations of the meteorological parameters and major air pollutants, i.e., SO2, NO2, and O-3 in this study. Potential Source Contribution function (PSCF) analysis was applied to investigate the potential source regions contributing to high PM2.5 pollution episodes. The results showed that the concentration of major air pollutants except ozone decreased, and the proportion of PM(2.5 )decline in Handan (37.0%) had reached the requirements (25%) of the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. The major chemical compositions of PM2.5 decreased significantly, but the percentage of secondary organic aerosols increased from 37.0% in 2013 to 40.0% in 2017. The higher proportion of secondary components implied more severe secondary pollution. The PSCF analysis indicated that the significant local contribution and short-range transport in the surrounding areas were the major sources of heavy pollution episodes in Handan. This study highlights the importance of emission reduction of atmospheric organic compounds and joint control actions on a regional basis during heavy pollution episodes.

AB The main objective of this work is to better understand the increase of ozone (O-3) in the surface by the influence of density currents formed by downdrafts from mesoscale convective systems, using as tool the JULES-CCATT-BRAMS model. Initially, the superficial increases of O-3 were investigated with the ECMWF Era-Interim reanalysis that showed a plume rich in O-3 located at middle troposphere along with the increase of this gas' concentration in the surface during the rainy period in Central Amazon. GOES satellite images and surface synoptic charts showed the formation of a squall line (SL) in the interior of the Continent by the influence of a Frontal System that reached the southeast of South America in this period. The numerical simulation results provided an understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the chemistry and thermodynamics of the atmosphere during the passage of this SL at dawn on April 14, 2014. The downdrafts from SL bring cooler, drier, dense air to near the surface. This downdrafts air column passed by the O-3 "plume" in the middle troposphere, formed rich gas density currents and low level jets were induced near the surface and spread the O-3. Finally, this cleaner air column decreased the surface carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and as a result of the increase in O-3 concentration resulted in an increase in surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2).

AB Black carbon (BC) mitigation can reduce adverse environmental impacts on climate, air quality, human health, and water resource availability. To facilitate the identification of mitigation priorities, we use a state-of-thescience global chemistry-climate coupled model (AM3), with additional tagged BC tracers representing regional (East Asia, South Asia, Europe and North America) and sectoral (land transport, residential, industry) anthropogenic BC emissions to identify sources with the largest impacts on air quality, human health and glacial deposition. We find that within each tagged region, domestic emissions dominate BC surface concentrations and associated premature mortality (generally over 90%), as well as BC deposition on glaciers (similar to 40-95% across glaciers). BC emissions occurring within each tagged source region contribute roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude more to their domestic BC concentrations, premature mortality, and BC deposition on regional glaciers than that caused by the same quantity of BC emitted from foreign regions. At the sectoral level, the South Asian residential sector contributes 60% of BC associated premature mortality in South Asia and similar to 40-60% of total BC deposited on southern Tibetan glaciers. Our findings imply that BC mitigation within a source region, particularly from East and South Asian residential sectors, will bring the largest reductions in BC associated air pollution, premature mortality, and glacial deposition.

To investigate these potential issues, five instruments reporting BC were compared in well-mixed smoke during the FIREX laboratory campaign in 2016, including two filter-based absorption instruments; one in situ absorption instrument; a laser-induced incandescence instrument; and a thermal-optical instrument. BB aerosols were generated using fuels common to wildfires in the Western US in a relatively controlled environment, with BC concentrations ranging from roughly 10-100 mu g m(-3) (55 total fires). Applying the Bland-Altman graphical approach, systematic biases and proportional biases were identified between the selected reference instrument (in situ absorption) and the other four instruments. BC emission factors (EFBC) derived from the thermal-optical instrument, laser-induced incandescence instrument, and filter-based absorption instruments were, on average, 83%, 39% and 66%, greater than the in situ absorption instrument, respectively. To understand why these differences exist, principal component analysis combined with a K-means clustering algorithm was implemented to group different fires into three clusters based on several co-dependent fire related parameters (modified combustion efficiency (MCE), single scattering albedo (SSA) at 870 nm, organic carbon/elemental carbon ratio (OC/EC ratio), and absorption Angstrom exponents (AAE)); clusters are nominally referred to as "Black", "Mixed", and "Brown" based on the mean SSA and AAE values for each. The best agreement among all instruments was observed for the "Black" cluster (mean EFBC ratio = 1.89, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.31 and AAE = 1.44); this agreement worsened for the "Mixed" (mean EFBC ratio = 2.94, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.80 and AAE = 1.92) and "Brown" clusters (mean EFBC ratio = 3.12, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.96 and AAE = 2.50), likely due to the increased presence of externally (or internally) mixed aerosols that altered the chemical and optical properties of the aerosols. In general, the discrepancies observed among the BC instruments from this work agree with or slightly exceed the ones from previous ambient and laboratory studies. Care should be taken when interpreting different BC measurements in BB smoke because large artifacts can occur due to coemitted materials.

AB Currently, haze events in winter occur more frequently than decades ago, especially in Eastern and Central China, including the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). WRF-Chem is applied in this study to explore the discrepancies of the simulated air pollutants induced by employing different emission inventories, particularly during haze events. Two inventories are involved in this study, MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China) and GlobEmission (inventory from GlobEmission project emission estimates), representing the emission inventories based on quite different ways. We first compared monthly emissions of SO2 and NOx in two inventories during January over YRD, and found the mean differences of SO2 (NOx) are 20% (7%), with the ranges of 0%-47% ( -100%-100%). The largest differences are both found in Shanghai, with 47% for SO2 (MEIC in 2010, GlobEmission in 2014), and 45% for NOx (MEIC in 2010, GlobEmission in 2015), respectively, partly because the reduction of emissions was large during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) in this area. By comparing the simulated air pollutants mass concentrations using two inventories with in-situ observations during January 2015, we found that the simulated SO2 using MEIC and GlobEmission are both higher than observations, with mean normalized biases of 207% and 121% over YRD, respectively, and much larger in the city cluster of Nanjing-Shanghai, where are nearly four (MEIC) and three times (GlobEmission) higher than observations. In contrast, NO2 simulations using GlobEmission are lower than observations (22%) and MEIC simulations (45%) over YRD. The largest biases of GlobEmission simulation are found in Zhejiang province (over 70%). The biases of simulated monthly mean PM2.5 are 38% (MEIC) and 30% (GlobEmission) over YRD, respectively. A case study during heavy haze event shows that the biases increase to 61% (MEIC) and 39% (GlobEmission), and spatial correlation coefficient in the simulation using GlobEmission increase to 0.69 over YRD. Temporal correlation coefficients in the city cluster of Nanjing-Shanghai increase from 0.5 (MEIC) to 0.7 (GlobEmission).

AB The oxidative potential (OP) of fine and coarse fractions of ambient aerosols was studied in the urban environment of Athens, Greece. OP was quantified using a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, applied to the water soluble fraction of aerosol that was extracted from 361 fine and 84 coarse mode of 24-h and 12-h filter samples over a one-year period. During the cold period, samples were collected on a 12-h basis, to assess the impact of night-time biomass burning emissions from domestic heating on OP. The chemical characteristics of aerosols were measured in parallel using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitoring (ACSM) and a 7-wavelength Aethalometer. A source apportionment analysis on the ACSM data resulted in the identification of organic aerosol (OA) factors on a seasonal basis. A good correlation of OP with NO3-, NH4+, BC (Black Carbon), Organics and LV-OOA (low volatility oxygenated OA) was found during winter, revealing the importance of combustion and aging processes for OP. During the summertime, a good correlation between OP and SO4-2 and NH4+ indicates its association with regional aerosol - thus the importance of oxidative aging that reduces its association with any characteristic source. Multiple regression analysis during winter revealed that highly oxygenated secondary aerosol (LV-OOA) and, to a lesser extent, fresh biomass burning (BBOA) and fossil fuel HOA) organic aerosol, are the prime contributors to the OP of fine aerosol, with extrinsic toxicities of 54 +/- 22 pmol min(-1) mu g(-1), 28 +/- 7 and 17 +/- 4 pmol min(-1) mu g(-1), respectively. In summer, OP cannot be at- tributed to any of the identified components and corresponds to a background aerosol value. In winter however, the regression model can reproduce satisfactorily the water soluble DTT activity of fine aerosol, providing a unique equation for the estimation of aerosol OP in an urban Mediterranean environment.

AB The irradiation under simulated sunlight of some phenolic compounds typically emitted in ambient air by biomass burning, namely vanillin and acetosyringone, yielded intermediates with humic-like fluorescence properties that can be assimilated to humic-like substances (HULIS). Evidence was obtained by ultra-high-re-solution mass spectrometry of the occurrence of oligomerization processes up to the formation of trimeric species. In contrast, the irradiation of other biomass-burning compounds such as vanillic acid, m-cresol and guaiacol did not yield either HULIS-type fluorescence or oligomers. We suggest that the photolysis of biomass-burning compounds is a potential HULIS source in the atmosphere, if the relevant substrates undergo photo-induced oligomerization reactions.

AB Local air pollution in Norwegian wintertime is characterized by an increase in NO2 concentrations, due to poor dispersion and increased vehicle emissions. The focus of this study is therefore the characterisation of exhaust vehicle emissions in cold ambient temperatures. Euro 6 Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) cars and diesel cars were tested in the laboratory in cold temperatures, including with cold start of the engine. Results show high emissions of CO2, PM and NOx. For the first time, we report also elevated NOx values for GDI vehicles. Further measurements are required to investigate whether these results are the beginning of a new trend of high NOx emissions from GDIs, or if these results represent singular events, but it may indicate that further NOx traps or catalysts are required for these vehicles. Understanding the relationship of cold ambient temperatures and vehicle emissions is also particularly important for air quality dispersion modelling, which do not currently account for emission temperature dependence.

AB Concentrations of PM2.5 in Tokyo, a densely populated megacity, often increase because of NH4NO3 formation under low-wind conditions during winter. To obtain source information of NH3 as a NH4NO3 precursor, hourly NH3 and NH4+ concentrations were measured at an urban site in Tokyo in December 2017. Results show that PM2.5 and NH4+ concentrations increased simultaneously under low-wind and low-temperature conditions along with NH3, NOx, CO, and optical black carbon (OBC) concentrations. The remaining NH 4 + (herein, Delta NH4+) subtracted from observed NH4+ to equivalent SO42- concentration correlated well with NO3- in PM2.5, indicating the existence of fine NH4NO3 particles. Regression analysis of hourly NH3 + Delta NH4+ concentrations with CO, NOx, and OBC showed significant correlation. Virtual emission rates (VER) of NH3 per motor vehicle in Tokyo were estimated using observed relations between NH3 + Delta NH4+ and OBC, etc. with data from vehicular statistics: they were 3.7-32 mg/km. The regression of NH3 + Delta NH4+ with OBC concentrations indicated an intercept of about 3.2 ppb, which is about half of the monthly average in December. This result implies that the non-vehicular source strength was nearly the same strength as the bulk vehicular emissions of NH3 during winter in Tokyo.

Aerosols sampling for molecular marker study was conducted from June 2015 to May 2016 at Xieyang Island in the northern South China Sea (SCS), to learn the impact of outflow from Indo-China Peninsular (ICP) and South China (SC). Xieyang Island was under the influence of air masses from ICP and SC nearly 70% of the year. Levels of anhydrosugars were higher during October to early March. They were lower in April and May, although biomass burning events in ICP were most intensive and half of air masses back trajectories passed through ICP in this period. Significant correlations between levels of anhydrosugars, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, high molecular weight n-fatty acids and terephthalic acid were observed, suggesting co-emissions of these compounds. Source types of aerosol primary organic matter (POM) tracked by these markers, namely open burning of municipal wastes, fossil fuel combustion, higher plant emissions and biomass burning, largely contributed in fall and winter with SC to be an important source region. However, levels of sugar alcohols (a group of biogenic aerosol tracers) were higher in warm seasons with ICP and SCS to be the main source regions, and were poorly correlated with levels of other molecular markers. Carbon preference index of n-alkanes also increased in warm seasons, indicating enhanced higher plant wax emissions. It suggested that there was a close link between biogenic emissions of sugar alcohols (or n-alkanes) and the growing activities of related organisms. Besides continental outflow, there were marine sources of steranes, hopanes (fossil sources tracers) and mannitol (a sugar alcohol), since their levels were higher for aerosol samples basically influenced by air masses originated from SCS.

AB In this work, we propose and evaluate a one-particle Lagrangian stochastic model for the assessment of the concentration-fluctuation variance, which is often used to predict odour hours for example. The main challenge is to provide a suitable parameterisation for the concentration-variance dissipation time scale. While the particle mass is conserved along the particle trajectory, the concentration variance dissipates. The concentration variance in a Lagrangian particle model evolves according to the same Langevin equation used for the simulation of the turbulent dispersion resulting in a mean concentration field. The variance dissipation is taken into account via a decay term with a finite time scale. We herein discuss and compare different parameterisations of the variance-dissipation time scale against observations from a field experiment. It was found that best results are obtained prescribing the ratio between the concentration-variance dissipation time scale and the Lagrangian time scale, which depends on the travel time.

AB Vegetable fields exhibit contrasting characteristics of high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) compared with other croplands due to intensification. A three-year field experiment consisting of eleven successive vegetable crops was conducted to investigate the effects of wide range of overdose fertilization and chlorinated pyridine (CP, a nitrification inhibitor) on the N2O emissions, agronomic NUE, yield-scaled N2O emissions, marginal yield and marginal N2O emission. Five urea N input rates, combining without (U) or with CP (U-CP), were applied at 0, 587, 880 (the conventional N rate), 1173, and 1760 kg N ha(-1 )yr(-1). Results showed that N2O emission responses to N rate fitted well with cubic models in both the U and U-CP group treatments. Meanwhile, CP addition significantly reduced annual cumulative N2O emissions and the N2O emission factor from 39.1 to 79.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 2.7-3.6% to 31.6-56.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.5-2.2%, respectively, in relation to the U treatments at the same N rate. Moreover, CP addition significantly decreased the yield-scaled N2O emissions from 0.30 to 0.52 kg N t(-1) to 0.22-0.35 kg N t(-1) without obvious influence on vegetable yield. The 587 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was the optimal N rate for both the U and U-CP treatments as indicated by the agronomic NUE and yield-scaled N2O emissions. Thus, one third reduction of the conventional N fertilizer rate combined with CP was recommended to mitigate N2O emissions and maintain the yield for the sustainable development of intensified leafy vegetable production.

AB The personal exposure concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), black carbon (BC), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) were measured in often-used transport vehicles and routes in Istanbul, Turkey. Exposure to these pollutants were estimated for four different travel modes (bus, metrobus, car, light rail) and five travel routes. Pollutant measurements were simultaneously conducted in the vehicles, and the relationship between pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables, and environmental factors were investigated. The seasonal statistically correlation results indicated that the relation between the meteorological variables and in-vehicle pollutant concentrations were variable with the seasonal differences. UFP concentrations were significantly higher in winter, while in-vehicle BC concentrations were significantly higher in summer. No significant difference was found between the summer and winter in-vehicle PM2.5 concentrations for bus, metrobus and light-rail. There was a significant positive correlation between UFP and BC with transport over roads. The highest average concentrations of UFP, BC, and PM2.5 were observed when car windows were open while traveling, and wind speed negatively affected pollutant concentrations and accounted for between 1 and 29% of their variability. Atmospheric pressure was significantly negatively correlated with BC but positively correlated with UFP and PM2.5. Humidity was a significant factor for UFP (1-12%) and PM2.5 (0-10%), but was not a factor for BC. The pollutant concentrations at the station/platform were the common significant factor for those concentrations in buses, metrobuses and light rail; the variability was determined between 4 and 66% for BC, 3 and 36% for UFP, and 1 and 75% for PM2.5. The time of day was also significant for BC (variation of 3-10%) and UFP (variation of 2-10%) for bus, metrobus, and car trips. The highest average exposures per kilometer for all pollutants was in buses, with exposure levels of UFP, BC, and PM2.5 at 12.3 x 10(8) particles km(-1), 0.40 mu g km(-1), and 1.33 mu g km(-1), respectively, while the lowest average exposures per kilometer for all pollutants were in the car with the windows closed and on light rail. It was observed that the metrobus near the highway provided the least concentrations of pollutant exposure.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate femtosecond filamentation induced particle formation and growth in particle-free air as well as in the presence of pre-existing ammonium sulfate aerosols. The ability of laser induced particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) was explored. The influence of water vapor and the pulse energy on the production efficiency and activation properties of particles were also examined. In particle-free air, laser filaments could lead to a significant production of new particles, the number concentration of which was comparable to or larger than that in polluted ambient air, depending upon the pulse energy and humidity. Total particle number and mass concentrations within 20-708 nm were predominantly contributed by particles with a diameter smaller than 100 nm. Remarkably high NOx up to an order of similar to 10(1) ppm was generated in the chamber, allowing sufficient production of HNO3 and probably subsequent HNO3-H2O binary nucleation. In the presence of pre-existing particles, the yield of particle number was largely enhanced in laser filaments, especially in humid air. Particle number size distribution shifted towards smaller particle size, leading to a slight increase in particle mass. It was found that a considerable portion of laser induced particles, no matter generated with or without pre-existing particles, could act as CCN. The amount of CCN at 0.80% supersaturation was in the magnitude of 10(4) similar to 10(5) cm(-3) in all experiments, nearly one order larger than the average ambient level even in severely polluted regions. Overall, increasing the pulse energy and water vapor would favor particle formation and growth as well as the production of CCN. Raising the pulse energy also resulted in a decline of the hygroscopic parameter kappa, implying the modification of aerosol chemical composition. Though more investigative studies are still needed to explore mechanisms underlying some of these experimental results, laser filaments are undoubtedly capable of inducing substantial particle formation and modifying microphysical/chemical properties of pre-existing particles. By influencing these crucial properties and thereby aerosol direct/indirect climatic and environmental effects, laser filamentation would provide a promising potential for related atmospheric applications.

AB As human encroachment increases in the Amazon rain forest, it is important to determine how anthropogenic emissions of reactive gases affect regional atmospheric chemistry. In the present study, we investigate the extent to which urban air plumes modify the levels of ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the downwind rain forest. The median mixing ratios of the background O-3, NOx, and NOx oxidation products (NOz) were 20 (15 parts per billion on a volume basis, ppbv), 0.6 ppbv (0.6 ppbv), and 1.0 ppbv (0.5 ppbv) during the dry (wet) season at the study site. Compared to the background environment, air plumes from the city of Manaus had enhanced median mixing ratios for O-3 and NOz by 30-50% and 40-90%, respectively. However, the enhancements of NOx in the air plumes were less than 20%, indicating that the majority of NOx was chemically converted to O-3 and NOx during transport. Results from a photochemical model showed that an injection of 8 ppbv of NOx into the rain forest can cause up to 260% and 150% increases in O-3 and hydroxyl radical (OH) levels compared to the background conditions, indicating the likely extent that NOx can modify the air quality and oxidative capacity in the Amazon rain forest. Slopes of the 0 3 -temperature linear relationships increased with NOx levels from 3.7 to 6.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the dry season and 1.7-5.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the wet season. Average rates of change of the slope with respect to NOz were approximately 1.8 and 2.3 times higher than those with respect to NOx for the dry and wet seasons. One key conclusion of this study is that NOz substantially contributed to the O-3 formation in response to temperature under enhanced NOx conditions in the forested environment.

AB To investigate aerosol optical properties relevant to pollutant level controls in place in Beijing, particulate matters with diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) mass concentration, aerosol absorption (sigma(ap)) and scattering (sigma(sp)) coefficients were continuously measured from January 2014 to March 2017 at an urban site Peking University Atmosphere Environment MonitoRing Station (PKUERS). Our results showed that PM2.5, sigma(ap), and sigma(sp) all decreased, especially from 2014 to 2015. Note that, a significant decrease of d ap in autumn and a y in winter was responsible for the decrease of the year by year average. PM2.5, sigma(ap) and sigma(sp) exhibited a pronounced bi-peak diurnal variation, which was attributed to the traffic emissions. The wind dependence analysis revealed that sigma(ap) was mainly influenced by local emissions but sigma(sp) was influenced by both local emissions and regional transport. The potential spatial source origins of asp in Beijing were investigated using the potential source contribution function (PSCF). The results indicated that the potential source regions that influence sigma(sp) of Beijing were mainly from south and west of Beijing but slightly varied with different years and seasons.

AB A unique event of long-range transport of biomass burning aerosol over Europe is detected by EARLINET and CALIPSO during 18-23 June 2017. The origin of these layers was a series of deadly wildfires that started in Portugal on 17 June 2017. This is the first time that smoke layers originating from West Europe are found at such long distances reaching up to Crete. In this work we use remote sensing (Polly(XT) lidars, CALIPSO, MSG) and modeling synergies (FLEXPART-WRF) to describe the properties of the emitted smoke and its atmospheric transport. Emission fluxes and injection heights are parameterized based on the hourly MSG-SEVIRI detections of Fire Radiative Power (FRP). Atmospheric dynamics is the main cause for this event; smoke particles are uplifted to the upper tropospheric layers due to convective activity over the Iberian Peninsula and this indirect pyro-Cb formation favors their transport to very long distances westward.

AB The "Llanos" is a complex savanna ecosystem that occupies most of the Orinoco River Basin, from the Colombian Andes foothills almost to the Orinoco River Delta at the Atlantic Ocean in Venezuela. It undergoes periodic, human-Induced and natural biomass burning during the thy season, which is shorter in Colombia. Northeast trade winds that prevail during the dry season can transport biomass burning plumes from Venezuela to Colombia, even during the Colombian Llanos wet season. Our analysis is based on ambient air measurements at two middle size Colombian Llanos cities located 266 km apart, during April-May 2015, right after the end of the dry season in Colombia, but when there was still high fire activity in Venezuela. Observed 24-h averaged PM10 concentrations in the two cities were unexpectedly high (up to 112 mu g/m(3)), particularly when considering their relatively small size, and low industrial and road traffic activity, and their trends were very similar, which indicates a common remote source. Ozone enhancements of up to similar to 94 ppbv (7.day average) were also observed. A reasonably good correlation was found between PM(10 )and a proxy of fire emissions within footprints calculated using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model. There is currently no permanent air quality surveillance system in the Colombian Llanos. Our findings imply that such a system should be established and incorporate near real-time, synoptic scale biomass burning remote sensing information.

   CHARACTERISTICS
AB This study was conducted to explore the aging behavior of biomass burning (BB) emitted brown carbon (BrC) during an aqueous hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation process in the absence of light. The evolution characteristics of rice straw (RS) and pine wood (PW) emitted BrC were monitored by UV-vis, synchronous fluorescence and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopies combined with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. The results indicated that OH radical oxidation could greatly weaken the absorption and fluorescence intensity of both BB BrC, implying the significant degradation of chromophoric BB BrC. EEM-PARAFAC analysis identified one humic-like (C2) and two protein-like (C1, C3) components from BB BrC. The intensities of these fluorescent components all steadily decreased with oxidation, in which the tryptophan-like substance (Cl) presented pronounced reduction for both BB BrC. However, the C2/C1 and C3/C1 intensity ratios exhibited an increasing trend with oxidation time, suggesting that the distribution of humic-like (C2) and tyrosine-like (C3) components within BrC could be enhanced during dark OH oxidation processes. These findings suggested that the levels and types of chromophores and fluorophores within BB BrC had been transformed once they were emitted to atmosphere, resulting in the change of optical properties of BB BrC. 2D-absorption-COS demonstrated that the decomposition of chromophores within the high ultraviolet region (275-310 nm) occurred preferentially to those within the low ultraviolet region (225-260 nm). In addition, the 2D-COS combined with fluorescence spectra for both BrC showed that the oxidation of types of fulvic-like fluorophores (340-380 nm) occurred before protein-like fractions (250-300 nm). These results provide detailed knowledge of the aqueous OH radical oxidation process of BB BrC in the atmosphere and are of great significance for understanding the climate and environmental effects of BB BrC and refining the atmospheric models established on the optical properties of BrC.

AB Accurate identification of source parameters (source strength and location) of sudden air pollution accidents (SAPAs) is important for implementation of adequate responses. However, the potential impact of atmospheric diffusion conditions on source parameter identification may be significant. An Inversion model that combines the hybrid particle swarm optimization and the Nelder-Mead simplex search method (PSO-NM) with the Gaussian dispersion model was proposed to identify the source parameters and to investigate the influences of different atmospheric conditions on the identifications. A case study based on 68 SO2 leakage tests from the Prairie Grass field experiment was conducted. The source strengths and locations of the 68 tests were estimated by the combined inversion model. The results indicated that the inversion model can effectively get accurate and robust source parameter estimations. The average absolute value of relative deviation of source strength was 13.8% +/- 11.4%; the average absolute deviations for parameters x(0), y(0), z(0) and the total distances were 18.9 +/- 36.9 m, 2.7 +/- 5.2 m, 3.5 +/- 9.7 m and 19.6 +/- 38.1 m, respectively. A comprehensive evaluation method was also proposed for analyzing the impacts of atmospheric conditions on source parameter estimations. The results showed that the source parameter estimations under atmospheric stability classes E and C have the best accuracy and robustness, followed by stability classes A and D; while the worst occurred under atmospheric stability classes B and F. The analysis results can provide scientific support for the formulation or adjustment of emergency response strategies used in sudden air pollution accidents. The new inversion model proposed is a supplement to the methodology of inversing source parameters.

AB Studying the effects of air-pollution on health is a key area in environmental epidemiology. An accurate estimation of air-pollution effects requires spatio-temporally resolved datasets of air-pollution, especially, Fine Particulate Matter (PM). Satellite-based technology has greatly enhanced the ability to provide PM assessments in locations where direct measurement is impossible.
   Indirect PM measurement is a statistical prediction problem. The spatio-temporal statistical literature offer various predictive models: Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) and Linear Mixed Models (LMM), in particular. GRF emphasize the spatio-temporal structure in the data, but are computationally demanding to fit. LMMs are computationally easier to fit, but require some tampering to deal with space and time.
   Recent advances in the spatio-temporal statistical literature propose to alleviate the computation burden of GRFs by approximating them with Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs). Since LMMs and GMRFs are both computationally feasible, the question arises: which is statistically better? We show that despite the great popularity of LMMs in environmental monitoring and pollution assessment, LMMs are statistically inferior to GMRF for measuring PM in the Northeastern USA.

AB Chemical profiles from burning of raw biomass materials (i.e., maize straw, wheat straw and wood branch) and their processed products (i.e., briquette and charcoal) were determined with a customized cleaning stove in a combustion chamber. Inorganic species such as water-soluble ions and elements, and carbonaceous fractions including saccharide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were quantified. Organic carbon (OC) was the highest fraction with a mass contribution to PM(2.5 )ranging from 17.65 +/- 0.15% to 40.17 +/- 3.83%. Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) were the two most abundant water-soluble ions (4.31 +/- 1.57% and 3.05 +/- 1.29%, respectively). Most elements (e.g., heavy metals) had relatively low fractions ( < 0.01%) or below detection limit. For organics, levoglucosan averagely accounted for over 60% in total quantified saccharides, while 4-ring PAHs was the most dominant fraction. The proportions of OC, sum of quantified PAHs (EPAH5) and levoglucosan, as well as diagnostic ratios such as OC/element carbon (EC), K+/ EC, and sum of quantified saccharides (Sigma saccharides)/PM2.5 showed a characteristic descending order of raw fuels > briquette > charcoal. In comparison, charcoal burning had lower fractions of the organics since most volatile matters and moisture had been removed during carbonization. In addition, the similarities of chemical profiles from different bio-fuels burning were assessed by calculating the coefficient of divergence (CD) and their correlations. Relatively low CD (0.21-0.36) and high correlation (R > 0.97) suggest that the chemical profiles from straw and their briquettes were similar. However, the profiles from charcoal burning showed significant differences between their corresponding raw fuels (CDs = 0.26-0.47, R = 0.69-0.99) and also large variations from each other (CDs = 0.40-0.49, R < 0.90). The results of this study summarize that the processed fuels especially charcoals are unique in source apportionment and inventory studies.

AB A sequential extraction test was used to evaluate the manganese (Mn) species in PM10 samples collected in an urban area impacted by a Mn alloy plant, where the annual guideline value for Mn in air according to the World Health Organization (WHO) is frequently exceeded (i.e. > 150 ng m(-3)). The average Mn level in this campaign was 208.6 ng m(-3), reaching maximum daily values up to 1138.9 ng m(-3). Manganese species were dominated by water-soluble Mn (49.9%), followed by metallic Mn (Mn-0) and Mn (2+) (27.1%), insoluble Mn (14.6%), and Mn3+ and Mn4+ (8.8%). This study reveals, on one hand, the higher fraction of water-soluble Mn species present in atmospheric aerosols in comparison with aerosols collected in work environments of the Mn alloy industry, which is attributed to the reaction between emitted Mn oxides and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2 and HCl) during transport in the atmosphere. On the other hand, there was a non-negligible fraction of more toxic species (Mn3+ and Mn4+), which are more potent than Mn2+ to induce reactive oxygen species.

AB In order to describe the means, variability and trends of the aerosol radiative effects on the southwest Atlantic coast of Europe, 11 years of aerosol light scattering (sigma(sp)) and 4 years of aerosol light absorption (sigma(sp)) are analyzed. A 2006-2016 trend analysis of sigma(sp) for D < 10 mu m indicates statistically significant trends for March, May-June and September-November, with a decreasing trend ranging from -1.5 to - 2.8 Mm(-1)/year. In the 2009-2016 period, the decreasing trend is only observed for the months of June and September. For scattering Angstrom exponent (SAE) there is an increasing trend during June with a rate of 0.059/year and a decreasing trend during October with - 0.060/year. The trends observed may be caused by a reduction of Saharan dust aerosol or a drop in particle loading in anthropogenic influenced air masses. The relationship between SAE and absorption Angstrom exponent is used to assess the aerosol typing. Based on this typing, the sub-micron particles are dominated by black carbon, mixed black and brown carbon or marine with anthropogenic influences, while the super-micrometer particles are desert dust and sea spray aerosol. The mean and standard deviation of the dry aerosol direct radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere (DRETOA) are -4.7 +/- 4.2 W m(-2). DRETOA for marine aerosol shows all observations more negative than - 4 W m(-2 )and for anthropogenic aerosol type, DRETOA ranges from -5.0 to -13.0 W m(-2). DRETOA of regional marine aerosol ranges from -3 to -7 W m(-2), as it consists of a mixture of sea salt and anthropogenic aerosol. The variability in DRETOA is mainly dependent on AOD, given that variations in backscatter fraction and the single scattering albedo tend to counteract each other in the radiative forcing efficiency equation. The results shown here may help in interpretation of satellite retrieval products and provide context for model evaluation.

AB The planetary boundary-layer (PBL) structure was investigated using observations from single aerosol lidar, eddy covariance (EC) system, and automatic meteorological station (AWS) in the north of Nanjing city during an air pollution episode in 2016-2017 winter. Based on seven days' observations under clear to polluted day, we present the temporal variations of the aerosol extinction profiles observed by lidar, and then inter-compare PBL depth retrieved from individual gradient methods. The results show that the gradient method (GM) generated the lowest PBL depth. In contrast to the cubic root gradient method (CRGM), which determined PBL depth ranging from 172 m to 1575 m during the observation period, the logarithm gradient method (LGM) and normalized gradient method (NGM) generated similar results and both tended to overestimate PBL depth on polluted days. The CRGM performed better than LGM and NGM in case of multiple backscatter layers and could detect low level layers, while the GM was biased at low heights probably due to the effect of lidar overlap function. Based on these measurements, the evolution of boundary layer structures and PBL depth over clean days and polluted days were compared. The results show that (1) on clean days, the strong surface turbulence exchange make the PBL depth fully developed and the PBL depth had obvious characteristics of diurnal variation; the maximum depth of PBL was 1560 m for CRGM; and (2) on polluted days, the high pressure system and lower wind was favorable to the accumulation of air pollutants, and thus generating less turbulence by reducing surface radiation. These conditions on polluted days led to smaller PBL depth than those on clean days, and the maximum depth of PBL was 660 m for CRGM. Besides, the diurnal variation of PBL depth on polluted days was weaker than those on clean days.

AB Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important parameter characterizing the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols and can be used to indicate aerosol loading and evaluate air quality. In this study, a FY-3/medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI) AOD data assimilation (DA) system was developed using a three-dimensional variational DA method to assess the impact of Chinese FY-3/MERSI AOD data assimilation on air quality forecasts. Two typical sand-dust weather events occurred during the spring season of years 2010 and 2011 were selected as case study. The DA system and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a chemical model (WRF-Chem) were used to evaluate the impacts of FY-3/MERSI AOD DA on air quality forecasts. This was based on comparisons between modeled AOD data and AOD data acquired by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites. Results from both case studies revealed that FY-3/MERSI AOD DA apparently improved the air quality forecasts. Key findings of the FY3/MERSI AOD DA experiments included: (1) FY-3/MERSI AOD DA adjusted the simulated aerosol particle content of the WRF-Chem model and efficiently improved the extinction coefficient fields below 500 hPa. Moreover, AOD DA had the strongest effect on adjusting the extinction coefficients at 750 hPa (approximately 2km). Compared with the AOD background field, the AOD analysis field was similar to the satellite observation field. (2) Compared with the control experiments without DA, the AOD DA experiment produced more accurate 24-h AOD forecasts, more consistent with the AERONET and satellite observations. (3) Due to the spatial distribution and intensity difference of satellite AOD data, satellite AOD data assimilation has obvious individual characteristics for the improvement of particle concentration prediction. Our study findings suggest that the developed DA system can facilitate the effective use of AOD data acquired by Chinese satellites in air quality forecasting models and can improve dust forecasting results.

AB A large part of oceanic biological production is limited by the scarcity of dissolved iron. Mineral dust aerosol, processed under acidic atmospheric conditions, is the primary natural source of bioavailable iron to oceanic life. However, synergistic and antagonistic effects of non-Fe-containing minerals on atmospheric processing of Fe-containing minerals and Fe solubilization are poorly understood. The current study focuses on mineralogical influences of non-Fe-bearing semiconductor minerals, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the dissolution of iron in selected natural mineral dust aerosols under atmospherically relevant conditions. Further, the role of elevated Ti concentrations in dust is evaluated using magnetite, a proxy for Fe(II) containing minerals, under both dark and light conditions. Our results highlight that relatively higher Ti:Fe ratios, regardless of their total Fe content, enhances the total iron dissolution in mineral dust aerosols as well as in magnetite. Moreover, elevated Ti percentages also yield high Fe(II) fractions in mineral dust systems under dark conditions. Upon irradiation however, dissolved Fe(II) is suppressed by high Ti levels due to the involvement of photochemical redox cycling reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH). These synergistic and antagonistic effects of Ti are further evaluated by altering the chemical composition of natural dusts with artificially added anatase (TiO2) and synthetic amorphous titania. The current study reveals important mineralogical controls by non-Fe-bearing minerals on dust iron dissolution to better understand global iron mobilization.

AB We developed a nation-wide exposure model to NO2, PM10, and PM(2.5 )at a fine spatial and temporal resolution for France in order to study air pollutants exposure during pregnancy for the French Longitudinal Study of Children (ELFE).
   The exposure to air pollutants was estimated daily for years 2010 and 2011 by combining three simulation models at the national and regional scale (CHIMERE) and at the local urban scale (ADMS-Urban or SIRANE). The spatial resolution was 41cm for the national scale model, 3-4 km for regional models and from 10 to 200 m for urban-scale models. We developed a confidence index (from 0 to 10) based on the target plot to identify the best model to estimate exposure for a given address, year and pollutant. Air pollution exposure during pregnancy was then estimated using each modeling scale for the 17,427 women participating in the ELFE cohort. We described the exposure of the women during different time windows of pregnancy using each of the three models and using the most suitable model as estimated by the confidence index.
   The exposure estimates obtained from the three models were quite similar and highly correlated (spearman correlation between 0.64 and 0.96), especially for the national and regional models. For NO2 and PM(10 )predicted by the urban models, the minimum values were lower and the maximum values and the variability were higher, compared to the regional and national models. The averaged confidence indexes were comprised between 5.6 and 8 depending on the pollutant, year and exposure model considered. The best confidence index was observed for urban modeling (10) and the lowest for the regional modeling (0). In average during pregnancy, using the most suitable model, women were exposed to 21 mu g/m(3) for NO2, 16 mu g/m(3) for PM(2.5 )and 24 mu g/m(3) for PM10.
   To our knowledge, this is the first study combining three modeling tools available at different scales to estimate NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at a fine spatial and temporal resolution over a large geographical area. The confidence index provides guidance in the choice of the exposure model. These exposure estimates will be used to investigate potential effects of air pollutants on the pregnant woman health and on health of the fetus and development of the child.

AB Vertical variation in aerosol optical properties [e.g. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and aerosol extinction coefficient] over a polluted environment is extremely important for better understanding of columnar radiative characteristics. The present case study over a typical polluted environment (New Delhi) discusses the vertical profile (ground to 700 m) of modelled optical properties of atmospheric particles at different altitudes. Here, we used the aerosol physico-chemical data generated in the tethered balloon-based observation conducted at CSIRNPL, New Delhi (28 degrees 38' 10 '' N, 77 degrees 10' 17 '' E) from 21st -27th February 2014. Based on the microscopic observations of individual particles, we developed the aerosol model shapes (coated spheres) for simulating their optical properties. Total three cases were considered for simulating the aerosol optics at varying altitude; Case A: External mixture of coated dust and coated sulfate particles; Case B: External mixture of coated dust, coated sulfate, coated OC (Organic Carbon) and coated EC (Elemental Carbon) (with assumption that 6% EC at ground level); Case C: External mixture of coated dust, coated sulfate, coated OC and coated EC (with assumption that 10% EC at ground level). At 550 nm wavelength, the value of SSA has been found to be highest (i.e. 0.985) at 200 m altitude for Case A while Case B (i.e. 0.9523) and Case C (i.e. 0.9291) show highest values at 500 m altitude. SSA was found to be maximum at 500 m altitude for both Case B and Case C due to the presence of lowest graphitic counts at that particular altitude. Case B and Case C exhibit similar pattern but differ in magnitude, this is due to two EC extremities at ground level i.e. minima (6%) and maxima (10%). The percentage deviation in SSA from ground level to 700 m was found to be highest for Case C (i.e. 5.95%) followed by Case B (i.e. 4.19%) and Case A (i.e. 1.4%). Modelled aerosol optical properties within boundary layer may improve our understanding about the thermodynamics of lower atmosphere.

AB We developed a new modeling framework to simulate aerosol microphysics by incorporating a volatility basis set (VBS) organic aerosol (OA) module into a three-dimensional (3-D) atmospheric transport model, namely, Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System with an Advanced Particle Microphysics (NAQPMS + APM). The new model calculates not only the condensation of sulfuric acid, nitrate, and ammonium and the coagulation of five types of particles (namely secondary, sea salt, dust, black carbon and organic carbon particles) but also the condensation of low-volatility organic vapors and the equilibrium partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds. The new model was applied to simulate new particle formation (NPF) in summer in Beijing. The new model could noticeably improve the NPF simulation. On comparing the simulation with observation, the ion-mediated nucleation scheme was found to underestimate nucleation rates in summer in Beijing. By incorporating a nucleation formula involving the participation of organic compounds, NPF events could be reproduced satisfactorily. Reasonably calculating nucleation rates is essential for successfully simulating NPF. Accounting for the condensation of anthropogenic low-volatility organic vapors and the volatility of primary OA (POA) can improve the temporal variation of the number concentrations of particles in Aitken and accumulation modes. On a regional scale, anthropogenic low-volatility secondary organic gases (LV-SOGs) and the volatility of POA have large impacts on the aerosol number concentration and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration. Both anthropogenic LV-SOGs and volatility of POA must be considered to quantify the contribution of NPF to the aerosol number concentration and CCN concentration.

AB A tropical maritime case of deep convective clouds was studied using a state-of-the-art aerosol-cloud model in order to evaluate the microphysical mechanisms of aerosol indirect effects (AIE). The aerosol-cloud scheme used is a hybrid bin/bulk model, which treats all phases of clouds and precipitation allowing a detailed analysis of process-level aerosol indirect effects on targeted cloud types. From the simulations, a substantially huge total AIE on maritime clouds of -17.44 +/- 6.1 Wm(-2) was predicted primarily because maritime clouds are highly sensitive to perturbations in aerosol concentrations because of their low background aerosol concentrations. This was evidenced by the conspicuous increases in droplet and ice number concentrations and the subsequent reductions in particle mean sizes in the present-day. Both the water-only (-9.08 +/- 3.18 Wm(-2)) and the partially glaciated clouds (-8.36 +/- 2.93 Wm(-2)) contributed equally to the net AIE of these maritime clouds. As for the partially glaciated clouds, the mixed-phase component (-14.12 +/- 4.94 Wm(-2)) of partially glaciated clouds was dominant, whilst the ice-only component (5.76 +/- 1.84 Wm(-2)) actually exhibited a positive radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). This was primarily because ice water contents aloft were diminished significantly owing to increased snow production in the present-day.

AB Open burning of crop residues is a strong seasonal source of air pollutants in many parts of China, but the large day-to-day variability of the associated emissions pose a great challenge for air quality forecasts. Here we developed back-propagation neural network (BPNN) ensembles to forecast the daily fire pixel counts in Southern China during the month of January. The BPNN ensembles were trained using daily assimilated surface meteorological data (including air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and winds) and daily fire pixel observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the month of January during the years 2003-2012. We showed that the BPNN ensembles successfully forecasted the day-to-day variability and the interannual variability of fire pixel counts over Southern China in January of the years 2013-2015, with correlation coefficients of 0.6-0.8 against the MODIS observations. We used the forecasted daily fire pixel counts in January 2014 and January 2015 to scale the climatological January biomass burning emissions from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) and applied the resulting forecasted daily biomass burning emissions to drive the WRF-Chem regional air quality model. The use of BPNN-ensemble-forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions led to significant improvements in the daily forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations in Southern China for January 2014, with the mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from -9.1% to -1.2%. We repeated the sensitivity simulations for January 2015 and also found a modest improvement when using the forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions (mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from -5.8% to -2%). Our approach can be applied to other source regions of biomass burning emissions to improve the accuracy of daily air quality forecasts.

AB This study investigated the gas-particle partition and spatial characteristics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ambient air of a prototype coking plant. High-volume samplers with glass fiber filters (GFFs) and polyurethane foams (PUFs) were used to collect PAHs in both gaseous and particulate phases. The EPA's 16 priority-controlled PAHs were measured using gas chromatography equipped with a mass-selective detector (GC-MS). The total PAH concentrations ranged from 1.32 mu g m(-3) to 9.41 mu g m(-3), with an average of 4.20 mu g m(-3). PAH abundance at the various sites of the coking plant was determined to be in the following order: coke side > machine side > leeward site; the lowest values were at the reference site and factory boundary. The medium-molecular-weight PAHs had the highest fraction at the coke side, whereas the low-molecular-weight PAHs were predominant at other sampling sites. Considerable amount of chrysene was detected at the coke side, fluorene at the machine side, acenaphthene at the leeward site (240 m downwind of the coke oven), and naphthalene at the other three sites. The gaseous fractions of PAHs at the six sampling sites ranged from 46.3% to 85.8% of the total PAHs in the gas-particle systems; and gaseous PAHs were predominant in the ambient air of the coking plant-except for the coke side, where the PAHs were dominantly partitioned to the particles. In addition, the particulate benzo(a)pyrene equivalence (BaPeq) fraction was high in the coking plant air. The slope (m(r)) values ranged from -0.59 to -0.39 in the plant, indicating that the absorption mechanism, rather than the adsorption mechanism, dominated the gas-particle partitioning. The intercept (b(r)) values carry the information on the gaseous-particulate phase distribution of semivolatile organic compounds when the m(r) values are similar. The organic matter fraction in particles, particulate phase fraction of PAHs, and toxicity of particulate matter were found to increase with an increase in b(r) values at similar m(r) values. The predominant mechanism was absorption for dibenz(a,h)anthracene, benzo(ghi)perylene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, but adsorption for benzo (b)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, and benzo(k)fluoranthene at the coke and machine sides. By contrast, for most high-molecular-weight PAHs, absorption into the organic matter was the predominant mechanism at other sites. The gas-particle partitioning mechanism of individual PAHs was closely related to the distance from the coke oven, rather than the orientation to the oven. These results may be of great importance in understanding the pollutant process and atmospheric transport of PAHs and may provide guidance to decision makers regarding air pollution control.

AB A ground-based tropospheric O-3 lidar with unique vertical near-range capabilities was deployed in support of the larger OWLETS 2017 campaign on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. It was sited in close proximity to a shipping channel with an ensemble of additional instrumentation including Pandora spectrometer systems, ozonesonde launches, and in-situ trace gas monitors - one flying on a drone. This unique combination enabled successful observation of a near-surface maritime ship plume emission event on August 01, 2017. The observations demonstrate an NO2 enhancement coincident with O-3 depletion in the low altitude range of lidar data, allowing for quantification of ship plume height behavior as well as the evolution of trace-gas concentrations. The technological improvements enabling the observation are presented and discussed, demonstrating that a single observation platform would not have been able to fully capture and contextualize the emission event. This synergistic ground-based sampling approach shows great promise for future verification and validation of satellite air quality and atmospheric composition measurements.

AB We investigated the influence of long-range transboundary transport (LRTT) on the aerosol concentrations in the Korean peninsula using the ground- and satellite-based remote sensing with back-trajectory calculations during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Specifically, aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from a geostationary satellite can directly provide the progression and evolution of aerosol plume transport. During high pollution cases in western Korea, we found the AOD enhancement over the Yellow Sea and east-central China, at maximum > 200% over the pathway of LRTT compared to the mean condition. Particularly, high AOD in the Shandong peninsula appears coincidentally with the high AOD over South Korea in a day, revealing the strong influence of the east-central Chinese emission. Back-trajectory patterns remarkably capture the movement of high AOD bands detected by the geostationary satellite monitoring. LRTT cases through the inside of boundary layer at east-central China usually contribute to the high AOD in Korea, while air masses above the boundary layer in north China and Mongolia do not much relate to the Korean pollution, showing the importance for both the direction and height of the air-mass movement. Travel speed is another significant factor to describe the LRTT effect. Despite the large effect of LRTT to both urban and rural sites in Korea, sometimes urban sites are more affected by the domestic emission when the air-mass travels shorter than similar to 250 km per day, notifying that the effect of Korean domestic emission cannot be negligible as well. Our findings reveal that usage of geostationary satellite observations enables us to better evaluate the influence of LRTT on the local air pollution.

AB In this study, we performed meteorological and chemical sensitivity studies employing two different Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations: one with the standard Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) Yonsei scheme (YSU), and one with a modified YSU PBL scheme proposed in a previous work. The WRF-Chem results were compared to observational temporally highly resolved boundary layer data obtained during the Vertical Mixing Experiment (VME) which was part of the 2006 TexAQS-II radical and aerosol measurement project (TRAMP) campaign. The analysis of meteorological variables indicates that in particular during the morning transition of the PBL (at 10 CDT), which is a critical time period for pollutant dispersion, the statistical scores presented improvements for all variables, when the modified YSU PBL scheme was used. Overall, the sensitivity of pollutant concentrations in the WRF-Chem model towards the representation of diffusion processes of the evening transition in the vertical mixing calculation showed reasonably good agreement with observations during the VME period. The comparison of vertical profiles of O-3 showed appreciable differences (up to similar to 8 ppbv) between the standard and modified YSU scheme during the morning hours; in the afternoon, the modified YSU presented only a slight improvement in the simulation of O-3 precursors concentrations such as CO and NOx. These improvements were possible without a significant increase in complexity or computer time. However, the model still oversimplifies the vertical mixing within the PBL, and uncertainties in the turbulence structure of the PBL in the WRF-Chem still remain.

AB Nutrient availability greatly regulates ecosystem processes in salt-affected soils. However, few studies have explored the impacts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and N x P interactions on CO2 and N2O emissions from salt-affected soils in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), which is one of the three biggest deltas in China. An incubation study was conducted to test the effects of N or P addition alone, as well as combined NP application, on CO2 and N2O emissions from the soils taken from four sites: bare land (BL) with no vegetation cover and three adjacent vegetation communities, Tamarix chinensis (TC), Suaeda salsa (SS) and Phragmites auswalis (PA) in the YRD. The results showed that N and its interaction with P showed significant and identical effects on both CO2 and N2O emissions in all soils. Nevertheless, the significant effect of P on CO2 production was found in soils covered with vegetation. N addition tended to augment CO2 and N2O emissions. However, the significant positive correlation between cumulative CO2 emissions and P addition was only found in soils collected from different communities. Compared with soils collected from BL, soils from different vegetation communities emitted more CO2 and more N2O. Moreover, soils of woody communities produced more CO2 than those of herbaceous communities. On the contrary, N2O emissions in soils of herbaceous communities were higher than in woody communities. Therefore, more attention, should be paid to the pulse GHG emissions that result from nutrient addition during the reclamation of saline soils, especially those covered with vegetation.

AB Accurate assessment of wetland ecosystem carbon sinks is an estimation of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, prediction of climate change and its impact on wetland ecosystems. In this study, using remote sensing data and 351 wetland sample sites in 2015, a remote sensing multiple linear regression model (RS-MLRM) was constructed to clarify the carbon storage capacity and its changing process from 2000 to 2015 and their controlling factors in arid regions wetlands. The results are as follows: (1) The studied wetlands acted as atmospheric carbon sinks from 2000 to 2015, increasing by 3.88 x 10(4) tC/a. Moreover, the soil carbon sink (0-40 cm) was approximately twice that of the vegetation carbon sink. (2) Carbon sinks had a clear spatial distribution, with high concentrations in Helan and Pingluo Counties in the central Ningxia Plain. From 2005 to 2015, constructed wetlands significantly increased the carbon sink (P < 0.05) and were the main contributors to carbon sequestration, indicating that positive human intervention enhances the carbon sink effect of wetlands. (3) Human activities, policy factors, soil physical and chemical properties and nutrients were the main factors affecting carbon sink in Ningxia Plain Wetland in arid regions. (4) The results provides a scientific basis for the protection and management of wetland ecosystems in arid areas.

AB Glyphosate, AMPA, its main metabolite, and Glufosinate-ammonium were monitored in ambient air samples collected for two years (2015-2016), at four sampling sites in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur Region (PACA, France) in different areas typologies (non-agricultural areas: city center, 'zero pesticide' policy, and industrial area but also agricultural sectors: mainly orchards and vineyards). Neither Glufosinate-ammonium nor AMPA were detected. Glyphosate was detected at a global frequency of 7% with frequencies ranging from 0% (Nice) to 23% (Cavaillon), according to the sampling site. Glyphosate concentration reached a maximum level of 1.04 ng m(-3) in the rural site of Cavaillon. This is despite the physicochemical characteristics of Glyphosate which are not favorable to its passage into the atmosphere. The absence of simultaneous detection of Glyphosate and AMPA suggests that drift during spraying operation is the main atmospheric source of Glyphosate and that resuspension from soil particles is minor. The present study offers one of the few report of Glyphosate, Glufosinate-ammonium, and AMPA in the air.

AB Fixed-site monitoring of particulate matter is often used as a surrogate of individual-level exposure, due to the high cost and logistic inconvenience of personal monitoring. However, studies have been limited to validate this approach in specific populations. This study aims to corroborate that centralized outdoor measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can be a surrogate of personal exposures in individuals living in a non-industrial area with high outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The personal exposure monitors (PEMs) were first validated with a reference high-volume Andersen sampler for PM2.5 sampling. Then personal samples were collected on 113 nonsmoking participants in Beijing, China, over a period of 3.5 years. Simultaneously, outdoor PM2.5 samples were collected at a central urban location. Indoor PM2.5 samples were also collected in select microenvironments where study participants frequently stayed. PM2.5 was collected onto a 37 mm quartz fiber filter in the PEM, and the mass was determined gravimetrically. Participants recorded their time-activity patterns. PEM measurements showed a high correlation with measurements from the regulatory reference method (R-2 = 0.98, slope = 1.21, and a non-significant intercept). PM2.5 had mean concentrations of 196, 139, and 156 mu g/m(3) in outdoor, indoor and personal air, respectively. Personal exposures displayed large within-person variability (97.5% of the total variance) and negligible between-person variability (2.5%). Personal exposures were determined by outdoor concentrations (p < 0.0001), but not by indoor concentrations or the time activity pattern (p > 0.05). Linear regressions show that outdoor concentration contributed 72% of personal exposure and explained 84% of variability of personal exposure. We conclude that centralized outdoor measurement of PM2.5 is a good surrogate of personal exposure; however, the overestimation of personal exposure using outdoor concentration warrants the need for personal monitoring if the actual exposure (amount) is needed. In populations of similar lifestyle, focusing on longitudinal measurements, rather than measurements in a large number of individuals, would be a more effective exposure assessment approach, given that personal exposure variability was largely driven by temporal variability.

AB The European Solvents Industry Group (ESIG) has established volatile organic compound emission inventories for solvents for individual countries or groups of countries within the European Union for 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2015. A top-down approach has been adopted starting with EU-wide solvents industry sales data as supplied by solvent manufacturers, to which atmospheric release factors were applied for each solvent use sector. ESIG total solvent emissions for the EU ranged from 2159 thousand tonnes year(-1) in 2008 to 1981 thousand tonnes year(-1) in 2015. Comparison with internationally-agreed solvent emissions suggests that official estimates of total solvent emissions across the EU are over 30% too high by comparison with ESIG estimates and showed too high a trend with time. Using official statistics on chemical exports and imports for each country, ESIG has been able to compile solvent emissions for each European country or groups of countries. The over-estimation by the internationally-agreed solvent emissions compared with the ESIG estimates for Europe as a whole was mirrored in the individual country estimates for 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2015. No simple, uniform relationship between national solvent emissions and per capita population for either total or domestic sector solvent emissions was found. Assumption of uniform solvents emission factors on a per-head of population basis, has led to the introduction of inaccuracies in internationally-agreed solvent emission inventories. More detailed work with Member States has shown that non-solvents are also being included in the official solvent VOC inventories indeed these VOC inventories are for 'solvents and other product use'.

AB Nighttime secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation was investigated for unburned vapors of three different fuels (Fuel #1, Fuel #2, and Fuel #3) in the presence of NO and ozone. Fuel #1 and Fuel #2 contained gasoline range components with Fuel #1 being rich in aromatics and Fuel #2 being rich in olefins. Fuel #3 contained diesel-range components. The SOA formation from Fuel #1 and Fuel #3 showed a continuous increase in the aerosol mass loading as a function of initial NO concentration. However, for Fuel #2, while the aerosol mass loading increased at higher NO concentrations, the results from this study indicated they were initially suppressed by the presence of olefins that can rapidly react with nitrate radicals. The evolution of the mass spectra of the formed aerosols indicated that their chemical composition continued to change even after termination of aerosol formation due to additional oxidation reactions during the aging process. Off-line Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectrometry (DART-MS) was conducted on the formed SOA collected on filters and the analysis indicated that the SOA was mainly composed of highly oxidized compounds. It is hypothesized that olefins could interact with NO3. leading to the formation of heavier organic nitrates through addition or oligomerization reactions. Insights from the current study may help to improve regional air quality control policies and methodologies for future multi-day modeling studies.

AB Experimental and computational simulations are conducted to assess the atmospheric gaseous deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their uptake by four leafy vegetables (spinach, Chinese cabbage, Shanghai green cabbage, and romaine) during their growth in a greenhouse located in Shanghai. Sixteen individual PAHs on the US EPA priority list were measured in the aerials and roots of vegetables, air (both gas-and particle-phase), settled dust, and soil samples. Results showed that 2-3 ring PAHs were similarly dominant in the vegetable leaves, roots and airborne gas phase. However, 4-6 ring PAHs were dominant in the soils, dust, and airborne particle phase. Results also showed that the PAH concentrations in the vegetables were highest during the middle of the growth period. Both phenanthrene and anthracene in the vegetables had a significant positive correlation with chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b, indicating that the growth process influenced PAH concentrations in the vegetables. Furthermore, increasing dust-fall doses promoted PAH accumulation in Shanghai green cabbage and romaine, but inhibited PAH uptake in spinach and Chinese cabbage. Analyses using multivariate regressions and physical models found that gas-phase PAH absorption and soil absorption contributed to 90.6% and 9.4% of total PAH vegetable uptake, respectively. Although PAHs in the air were the dominant contributor to the total uptake, 13.2% of gas-phase PAHs resulted from soil volatilization. Atmospheric dust fall contributed to PAH uptake indirectly by increasing soil PAH concentrations. In addition, PAH uptake by vegetables via the air-shoot pathway displayed higher toxicity than the other pathways. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the pathways through which atmospheric PAHs lead to PAH contamination in a sample of commonly eaten leafy vegetables.

AB The Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) is among the most polluted areas in the world. We tracked ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) build-up in Delhi NCR during the dry season (October-June) by analysing 15 years (2001-02 to 2015-16) of high-resolution (1 km) satellite data that has been bias corrected using coincident in-situ data. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations are 1.25 times lower in the upwind regions compared to the downwind areas of Delhi NCR, with the difference being attributed to outflow from the Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT). We identify two major peak pollution episodes - the first occurs from the end of October to early November, while the second occurs toward the end of December through early January. Mean ambient PM2.5 concentrations remain > 300 mu g/m(3) (five times the Indian 24-h national standard) for several weeks around the two peak pollution episodes. The first peak is attributed to pollution transport from upwind areas affected by open biomass burning, coupled with stable atmospheric conditions, while the second is attributed to enhanced local emissions and perhaps secondary aerosol formation under favorable meteorological conditions. The implementation of the "Sub-soil Water Preservation Act" in 2009 in Punjab (a state upwind of Delhi NCI) reduced the time between paddy and wheat cultivation seasons; as a result, open biomass burning increased, resulting in a 9% increase in weekly PM2.5 concentration over Delhi NCT since 2009 during the first pollution episode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time MODIS MAIAC 1 km satellite data are used to generate pollution statistics over India. Our results demonstrate the potential of high resolution satellite data in tracking pollution build-up at an urban scale and may help in air quality management.

AB To investigate the characterization of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous aerosols as well as the regulation of formation and transition in the haze episode, daily PM2.5 samples (from Nov.2017 to Feb. 2018) were collected from an industrialized district in Shanghai, China. The average concentrations of PAHs and element carbon (EC) were 10.4 +/- 4.55 ng/m(3) and 8.08 +/- 2.97 mu g/m(3) during haze episodes, which were 1.33 and 2.27 times higher than those during clear period, respectively. Secondary organic carbon (SOC) consisting of 52.2% organic carbon (OC) were the main chemical constitution of the aerosols resulting in heavy haze in Shanghai. Spearman correlation coefficient indicated that low temperature and relative humidity were the crucial factors attributing to the severe haze events. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model indicated that vehicle emissions (33.2%) were the predominant sources during haze period, followed by coal and biomass combustion (32.5%), coking (25.5%) and petroleum spill and leakages (8.87%). Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces were identified as potential major source areas of PAHs and EC according to potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) models. This study made contributions to target the prevention of pollutants in terms of severe haze event and long-range transportation as well as putting forward control measures and policies.

AB Nitrated phenols (NPs) are regarded as a major component of brown carbon and affect the earth environment. Previous studies have suggested that NPs in the atmosphere partially originate from coal combustion; however, the direct emissions have not been validated. In this study, the emissions of ten NPs from ten kinds of coal for residential use were investigated via laboratory combustion experiments in which PM2.5 samples were collected and analyzed by UHPLC-MS. The fine particulate NPs emitted from coal combustion were dominated by nitrocatechols and the methyl substituents under most conditions, while the emission profile of nitrated phenols varies with different rank of coals. Based on the emission ratios of NPs/PM2.5 obtained from this study and the PM2.5 emission factors in the literature, the emission factors of fine particulate NPs for chunks of lignite, bituminite, and anthracite and for briquettes of anthracite were calculated as 0.2-10.1 mg kg(-1). According to the residential coal consumption in 30 provinces in China in 2016, the total emission of fine particulate NPs from the residential coal combustion was estimated to be 178 +/- 42 Mg.

AB Pollen sampling has been performed using various sampling methods around the world. However, the sampling efficiencies of these methods remain unclear. In this study, we compared the sampling efficiency of a Sigma-2 two-layered aerosol sampling inlet and a Hirst-style wind vane inlet to reveal the relationship between sampling efficiency and samplers' physical characteristics. The initial results show a higher sampling efficiency for the former. To further explore this finding, we developed a theory based on 1) continuity equations for pollen grain concentrations and 2) impaction theory. Applying our developed theory to the experimental results revealed that impaction is a significant contributor to the relatively higher sampling efficiency of the two-layered sampling inlet, due to the larger cross-sectional area of the two-layered inlet and slower sampled pollen grain speed within the sampler. Additionally, applying a correction based on the theoretical impaction effects improved the experimental results. Our experiment demonstrated the possibility of a pollen sampler showing discrepancies in airborne pollen concentrations and explained the mechanism of this inaccuracy. The application of these results to pollen sampling will aid understanding of actual airborne pollen concentration.

AB Continuous high frequency in situ observations of hydrogen have been made at the Mace Head atmospheric research station on the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Ireland from April 1994 through to December 2017. These 40-minute observations represent one of the most comprehensive records of this trace gas carried out anywhere in the world. Hydrogen mixing ratios in northern hemisphere baseline air masses had a mean value of 508.81 ppb and exhibited a highly statistically significant upwards trend of + 0.44 + 0.16-0.28 ppb year-1. Trends were strongest during the months of January, February and November and weakest during the months of May-July, inclusive. Monthly mean baseline mixing ratios exhibited a seasonal cycle with a spring maximum and an autumn minimum, the latter being relatively unusual at this baseline station. The transport of European regionally-polluted air masses to Mace Head historically brought elevated levels of hydrogen above baseline. Over the years of this study, these elevated levels have declined to the extent that the hydrogen levels in European regional pollution events are now almost indistinguishable from baseline levels. Photochemical Trajectory Model studies have confirmed that the decline in European excess hydrogen levels accurately reflects the widespread fitting of three-way catalysts and evaporative cannisters to petrol-engined motor vehicles across Europe and the reductions in emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds that they have brought about.

AB The performance of aerosol classification schemes based on intensive optical parameters and applied to mixed particle populations monitored at the surface has been investigated to test the ability of optical parameters to identify different types of particles/particle mixtures and explore their complex features. The results show that the combination of two intensive optical parameters does not allow for the unique identification of different particle types. The classification scheme based on the Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) as a function of the Scattering Angstrom Exponent (SAE) and color-coded by the Single Scattering Albedo difference (dSSA) is a good graphical framework to discriminate between different types of particle/particle mixtures. This aerosol classification scheme has been applied to study the optical properties of heterogeneous PM2.5 particles that were monitored at a coastal site of the Central Mediterranean and were significantly affected by both natural and anthropogenic sources also because of long-range transport from surrounding countries. The calculated AAE, SAE, and dSSA hourly means smoothly and continuously vary within their respective range (0.6-3.4, -0.7-3.0, and -0.33-0.52, respectively) because of the different mixing degree of different types of particles. Consequently, the main features of the particle populations depend on the range of the AAE, SAE, and dSSA values. Eight different clusters have been selected within the used graphical framework to identify four key particle populations (dust, marine, OC-dominated, and BC-dominated particles) and four particle mixtures dominated by key aerosol populations. In addition, their main features have been characterized. Particle mixtures consisting of large and low-absorbing particles (LLAP), small and high-absorbing particles (SHAP), dominated by dust, and large organic particles have been characterized. Marine, LLAP, and mixed dust clusters with a SAE value below 1 are responsible for aerosol scattering coefficients (sigma(s); at 470 nm) below 100 Mm(-1). Conversely, SHAP, BC-dominated, and OC-based mixtures are responsible for the highest sigma(s) values and represent dominant particles species.

AB A high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was deployed during wintertime (5 February to 15 March 2016) at a suburban site in Douai, northern France, in order to investigate the characteristics and sources of the organic matter (OM). The campaign average concentration of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1) was 11.1 +/- 9.3 mu g m(-3), and composed of 38% OM, 36% nitrate, 16% ammonium and 9% sulfate. The average values for the OM:OC, O:C and H:C ratios were 1.60 +/- 0.15, 0.32 +/- 0.11 and 1.55 +/- 0.14, respectively, indicating a moderate level of aerosol oxidation. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment method was applied to the high-resolution organic aerosol (OA) mass spectra, resulting in four factors: a hydrocarbon-like (HOA) factor, one associated with oxidized biomass burning (oBBOA); and two oxygenated factors (OOA) denoted as less oxidized (LO-OOA) and more oxidized (MO-OOA), with average contributions to OA of 20%, 28%, 17% and 35%, respectively. The oBBOA factor was found to be mainly local as shown by non-parametric wind regression (NWR) analysis, and to correlate well with relative humidity (RH), suggesting fast aqueous processing of locally emitted primary biomass burning emissions. During most part of the campaign, the sampling site was affected by different air masses. However, during the last period of the campaign (5-16 March 2016) the site was heavily impacted by air masses from Eastern Europe which were rich in secondary inorganic and organic aerosols. The H:C versus O:C (Van Krevelen, VK) diagram highlighted that the aerosol followed an oxidation process throughout the whole campaign, with an average slope of -1.05. The impact of continental air masses towards the end of the campaign confined the aerosol towards a narrower space in the VK diagram, suggesting a homogenization of the different aerosol sources due to OA ageing during transport. Several nocturnal NPF (new particle formation)-like events were observed and associated to the fast processing of BBOA emissions and the formation of ammonium nitrate.

AB In order to understand the electrostatic charging state of atmospheric hundreds nanometer particles that has particular impact on health, we have observed the atmospheric particles charge distributions intermittently for one year. To easily estimate particle charge distribution, first of all, we have developed a simple instrument and calculation method. We confirmed by comparison with stationary charge distributions that the distributions obtained by our method can be used to easily determine the relative variation of particle charging states, although the proportion of particles with a small charge number was quantitatively underestimated. The charge distributions of the atmospheric particles observed from April 2017 to February 2018 were different from the generally accepted stationary charge distribution. Moreover, the observed distributions changed significantly throughout the year. This variation was found to correlate with seasonal variations in temperature, relative humidity, volumetric humidity, and air mass trajectories. Present result suggests that the seasonal variation of the charging state is possibly due to the seasonal variation of the atmospheric ion number concentrations. Thus, it is important to consider the variation in the charging state of atmospheric particles due to dynamic changes of atmospheric conditions, as the charging state can dramatically influence the deposition of particles in the lungs.

AB Remote sensing is an effective means of observing and detecting global aerosol distribution and changes over time, which impact human health and climate change. However, aerosol optical depth (AOD) always has low spatial coverage, which not only affects the analysis of AOD but also harms many relevant applications of the data, such as utilization to estimate PM2.5. In our study, we utilize the random forest model, which is an effective ensemble learning method, to estimate the gaps of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD data with a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees in a typical contaminated region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during 2010-2016. Our model performs accurately in that the results of R-2 testing exceed 0.9 and the final estimated AOD coverage achieves 100%. The average value of the AOD is 0.44 (0.41-0.47 by year) over the study period. The simulation values of AOD have an obvious seasonal distribution, with the highest AOD in summer. The AOD estimations in the southern region are higher than those in the northern region. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD observations are compared with MODIS AOD (R-2 = 0.44) and AOD estimations (R-2 = 0.36). We analyze and screen each of the variables to compute their contributions. Specifically, the elevation and 2-m dew point are the most important in modeling the AOD, while road data, snowfall depth and snowfall have the least impact on modeling the AOD. Practical applications of AOD data include estimating the various impacts of PMPM2.5 concentrations on health based on the AOD observations in China's typically polluted areas that have cloud influence. We compare two measurement ranges that will most accurately model and fill the AOD data missing in areas. After careful consideration, we determine that our preferred range is 0-2.

AB The long-range transport of bioaerosols takes place in the free troposphere and has lately gained a renewed interest in both environmental and health-related disciplines. Sampling free troposphere bioaerosols has been, however, historically challenging and requires of expensive and complex facilities. We analysed different bacterial bioaerosols studies carried out by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, available from the literature. The dataset was compared with bacterial bioaerosols present in rain and dry deposition passively collected at high elevation sites in Sierra Nevada along a set of sampling periods lasting 3 years. Up to 65% of OTUs and 82% of the bacterial genera were shared between wet and dry bioaerosols. Interestingly, only Oxalobacteraceae were notably more abundant in wet deposition, with Noviherbaspirillum and Massilia as dominant genera. We demonstrated that the bacterial composition of bioaerosols collected by passive natural deposition at high-elevated mountains were closer to the bacterial microbiome from the free troposphere. Interestingly, the meta-analysis showed a different bacterial composition and community structure in bacterial bioaerosols collected at low elevated areas, over the open ocean, or during desert dust events. Since the boundary layer can be easily reached in high mountain areas, and the local landscape is surrounded by rocks and meadows, alpine stations are potentially optimal research sites with reduced influence of surface aerosols, minimizing local contaminations. Consequently, sampling alpine bioaerosols could be a good proxy for bioaerosols monitoring, long-range dispersal studies, and the dynamic characterization of the free troposphere microbiome.

AB Fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) are major air pollutants in China, especially in developed city clusters. A comprehensive field campaign, the Campaign on Air Pollution and Urban Meteorology in Yangtze River Delta (CAPUM-YRD), eastern China is carried out in 2016 to enhance the understanding of regional PM2.5 and O-3 pollution. Two super sites in Shanghai, one in Hangzhou, as well as nineteen national monitoring stations in Nanjing and Hefei jointly participate in the campaign. In this study, regional PM2.5 and O-3 pollution episodes are characterized based on summer and winter experiments during the CAPUM-YRD. Further, trajectory simulation and source apportionment technology in Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) are applied to explore the source of the pollution episodes. We find that regional synchronous PM2.5 pollution episodes (over 120 mu g/m(3)) occur frequently in YRD. Secondary inorganic and carbonaceous components account for a major proportion (70-80%) in PM2.5. Nitrate concentration is significantly higher (lower) than sulfate in winter (summer). The secondary conversion of sulfur and nitrogen increases alongside elevated PM2.5 levels, with a maximum ratio of 0.28 and 0.18 in winter, respectively. Source apportionment results suggest that the contribution of emissions within YRD dominates in PM2.5 (over 60%) compared to other regions. The inter-regional transport from the north-northwest in eastern China can contribute over 20% to PM2.5 in YRD, with a maximum of 28.4% in Nanjing. Under the transport by enhanced northerly winds, PM2.5 concentrations may increase explosively, with observed peak values in Hefei (312.6 mu g/m(3)) and Nanjing (255.7 mu g/m(3)). Moreover, high levels and remarkable spatial heterogeneity of O-3 are observed over YRD in summer, with daily maximum 8-h average O-3 above 300 mu g/m(3) in Nanjing. The occurrence of O-3 pollution episodes is significantly impacted by favorable weather conditions and transport at multiple spatial scales. Regional contribution results demonstrate that super regional transport is prominent (29.4-50.7%) in O-3 pollution, especially in coastal cities like Shanghai (30.3-63.0%). Our results suggest that enhanced regional collaboration and efforts are of extreme necessity in long-term and optimized control of severe PM2.5 and O-3 pollution in YRD.

TI The significance of incorporating unidentified vessels into AIS-based
   ship emission inventory
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT

DE Ship emission inventory; AIS; Unidentified records
ID RIVER DELTA; SEA
AB Automatic Identification System (AIS) data have been widely used to estimate ship emission inventories. However, although the MS dataset can provide high spatial and temporal ship activities, the estimation of ship emission inventory requires vessel information that may not always be available in the vessel parameter database (e.g. engine power). Hence, earlier AIS-based emission inventory studies mainly included vessels with engine specifications (referred to as identified vessels); the significance of emissions from vessels without engine or other pertinent specifications (referred to as unidentified vessels) has not been studied in detail.
   In this study, we develop an emission inventory of all vessels with installed AIS instruments, including both identified and unidentified vessels. In particular, missing ship parameters for unidentified vessels are estimated through categorical regression with vessels with similar ship types and sizes in the AIS database. Using this approach, we estimate the ship emission inventory for the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 2015. Our results show that unidentified vessels contributed significantly, accounting for almost 49% of the overall ship emissions of CO2, NOx, CO, and hydrocarbon in the PRD. Overall, we find that identified vessels contributed more over the open ocean and near port areas, whereas unidentified vessels contributed significantly along inland waterways with clear emission tracks and hot spots.

AB Atmospheric dry nitrogen (N) deposition is a key process in the N cycle of the earth, and the land-use type might profoundly affect N deposition. However, little is known about the relationship between local land-use types and dry N deposition in an urban-rural region. Therefore, this study observed atmospheric dry N deposition in continuous 24 months (from January 2015 to December 2016) and then applied space influence area analysis to explore the multi-scale relationship between land use types and dry N deposition. The results showed that the key land use areas in the range of 41cm of monitoring point were closely related to dry N deposition flux. The spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric dry N deposition was explained by "source" and "sink" land use types. For "source" land use type, agro-facility area contributed to dry NH4+-N deposition, while dry NO3--N and dry organic N deposition was attributed to urban and high way areas. On the other hand, agricultural land with suitable and limited fertilizer application, country road without hardening and forests were considered as the "sink" for N deposition. These "sink" land use types should be considered actively in urban and rural planning.

AB The metal elements in alpine ice can provide historical information about natural mineral dust and anthropogenic pollutant emissions. To determine how the Fe concentration and flux variations relate to natural sandstorms and anthropogenic emissions from 1956 to 2004 A.D., Fe, Al, Pb and other element records were measured in a shallow ice core from the Miaoergou Glacier in East Tienshan, central Asia. The results indicate that the dissolved Fe (DFe) and total dissolved Fe (TDFe) peaks are well correlated with sandstorms from the surrounding Taklamakan Desert since at least 1956 A.D. The concentrations and fluxes of Pb show continuously increasing trends since 1995 A.D. due to the accelerating progress of the industrial revolution in China during this period, while the DFe and TDFe concentrations and the fractional Fe solubility exhibit no significant variations during this period. These results provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the effects of the natural Fe record in an arid region.

AB Biomass burning emissions have a substantial impact on regional air quality and climate. The region of Amazonia in South America has long been identified as one of the largest contributors to short lived pollutants globally. However, massive natural wildfires and agricultural burns also occur every year in the grassland plains of Northern South America during the dry season (November to April). The regional-scale air quality impact of these biomass burning emissions has not been studied in depth and is analyzed in this study. We used PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from three large urban areas: Bogota, Medellin, and Bucaramanga, for the period 2006-2016. Carbon monoxide data was only available for the city of Bogota for the analysis period. These cities are located hundreds of kilometers westward of the emission areas. The spatio-temporal distribution of fires was obtained from MODIS Active Fire Data. The back-trajectories of air masses reaching the receptor sites were computed with two different meteorological datasets. Radiosonde data, available only for Bogota, was used to account for local meteorological factors impacting pollution dispersion. A novel analysis algorithm was developed to combine active fire data with back-trajectory locations to select those active fires in the vicinity of the air masses arriving at each city. This analysis allows the selection of only those upwind fires that can be related to the air quality in the selected locations. We show that anomalously high PM and CO levels occurred when air masses originated from the Orinoco grasslands during the times when the largest number of fires in the region were active. The correlation between number of fires and PM10 concentration was found to decrease with increasing distance from the sources, ranging from 0.6 to 0.25. Our results are insensitive to the meteorological dataset used to generate back-trajectories. For Bogota it was found that mixing height variations can explain an important fraction of the observed seasonal variations in PM10, PM2.5, and CO concentration. The number of upwind fires can explain 11%+/- 5% of the seasonal variability in CO concentrations. Estimates of the seasonal variability of PM10 and PM2.5 explained by fires are 45%+/- 7% and 39%+/- 8% respectively. However, covariance between occurrence of fires and non-combustion local sources of PM imply that the latter estimates are likely an overestimation of the actual contribution. Our findings support the possibility that fires in the Orinoco river basin deteriorate air quality in highly populated urban centers hundreds of kilometers away from the sources.

AB The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network collects aerosol samples for gravimetric and composition analysis in support of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Haze Rule and for long-term trend studies and model evaluations. Reconstructing PM2.5 mass or extinction from composition measurements requires assumptions of the molecular form of the individual species assumed to compose the bulk of PM2.5 mass. The IMPROVE reconstruction algorithm includes sulfate as ammonium sulfate, nitrate as ammonium nitrate, organic mass calculated with an assumed organic carbon (OC) to organic mass (OM) multiplier (OM/OC) of 1.8, elemental carbon, fine dust assuming common mineral oxides in soil, and sea salt calculated from chloride. Comparisons of reconstructed fine mass (RCFM) to PM2.5 gravimetric fine mass (FM) provide a check on these assumptions as well as help identify possible biases in gravimetric or speciated measurements. Significant changes in aerosol concentration and composition have occurred over time, leading to decreased FM across the United States. However, within the IMPROVE network, annual mean FM and RCFM have decreased at different rates from 2005 through 2016 (-29% versus -43%, respectively), causing the network median residuals (FM-RCFM) to increase by 0.49 mu g m(-3) over the 12-year period. The residual shifted from mostly negative before 2011 to mostly positive after 2011, with a strong summer peak. A multiple linear regression analysis indicated that FM biases increased due to the presence of particle-bound water (PBW) after 2011, associated with increased laboratory relative humidity during weighing. Results also suggested that the OM/OC ratio increased across the network after 2011, unrelated to the influence of PBW. While temporal behavior in the OM/OC ratio was similar across the network and for all seasons, values were highest in the East and during summer. Fine dust also appeared to be underestimated by similar to 20%. Identifying the source of the trends in the FM residual is essential for accurately estimating contributions by individual species to RCFM and visibility degradation.

AB This study investigated the elemental composition of PM10 collected in a polar environment (Ny-Alesund, Norwegian Arctic), to identify its sources and to understand the effects of short- and long-range transport processes. Natural (crustal and marine) and anthropogenic Arctic PM sources were identified, and specific emission sources were recognised by means of Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis: airborne pollution deriving from ship fuels, local vehicle (non-exhaust) and continental emissions (e.g. incinerators or industries) were the main sources of anthropogenic elements. The results obtained so far from samples collected during four successive spring-summer sampling campaigns (2010-2013) show a remarkable seasonal trend for most of the investigated elements. For both geogenic and anthropogenic elements, concentrations are generally higher in March and April, when the ground is almost entirely covered by snow and ice, suggesting that long-range transport processes might be taking place. On the other hand, the concentrations of anthropogenic metals related to ship emissions (i.e. Co, Ni and V) peak in late spring and summer, when the marine traffic in the fjord is generally higher. For most of the analytes, the four campaigns were not significantly different; therefore, in the studied period, the composition of PM10 in Ny-Alesund did not vary remarkably. Finally, the behaviour of Rare Earth Elements was discussed in terms of parent material mineralogy.

AB In 2017, during spring and summer, the concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) were monitored over a period of 6 months in Kodungaiyur, Chennai, India and compared with the National Ambient Air Quality standard (NAAQS) of India. The maximum mean daily concentration values of NO2, SO2, CO and PM2.5 were found to be 66 mu g/m(3), 96 mu g/m(3), 180 mu g/m(3) and 425 mu g/m(3) respectively. In this work, a survey of the diseases onset in the locality Kodungaiyur was conducted to bring out the effects mainly due to PM2.5 on human beings. The diseases surveyed include mostly allergic complications in the lungs, eye and ENT. The results showed associations between pollution exposure and increased percentage of infection in the age group from 21 to 30 years, with a confidence level of 95%.

AB With the development of urbanization and industrialization, the degradation of air quality has become a serious issue that impacts human health and the environment; thus, it has attracted more attention from scholars. At present, the mass concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m and 2.5 mu m (PM10, and PM2.5) are used to evaluate air quality in China. A commonly used data-driven regionalization framework for studying air quality, identifying areas with similar air pollution behavior and locating emission sources involves an incorporation of the principal component analysis (PCA) with duster analysis (CA) methods. However, the traditional PCA does not consider spatial heterogeneity, which is a notable issue in geographic studies. This article focuses on extracting the local principal components of air quality indicators based on a geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) method, which is superior to the PCA with considering spatial heterogeneity. Then, a spatial cluster analysis (SCA) is used to identify the areas with similar air pollution behavior based on the results of the GWPCA. The results are all visualized and show that the GWPCA has a higher explanatory ability than the traditional PCA. Our modified framework based on the GWPCA and SCA for assessing air quality can effectively guide environmentalists and geographers in evaluating and improving air quality from a spatial perspective. Furthermore, the visualization results can be used by city planners and the government for monitoring and managing air pollution. Finally, policy suggestions are recommended for mitigating air pollution via regional collaboration.

AB Aliphatic amines are important constituents of the marine environment. However, their biogenic origins, formation processes and roles in atmospheric chemistry are still not well understood. Here we present measurements of monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and diethylamine (DEA) from two intensive sampling campaigns at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO), a remote marine station in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The amines were measured in the sea surface microlayer (SML), in bulk seawater, in the gas and the submicron particulate aerosol phase. Additionally, a 24-month record of amine concentrations in aerosol particles, together with other particle constituents and biological and meteorological parameters, is presented. In the SML, mean amine concentrations were in the range 20-50 nmol L-1. The correlation of the amines to chlorophyll-a (R-2 = 0.52) and the abundance of the diatom pigment fucoxanthin may indicate that amines were formed via algal production. Amine concentrations in the gas and particulate aerosol phases were dominated by DMA, with average concentrations of 4.5 ng m(-3) and 5.6 ng m(-3), respectively. Average MMA concentrations were 0.8 ng m(-3) in the gas phase and 0.2 ng m(-3) in the particle phase. DEA was present in the particle phase with an average concentration of 3.9 ng m(-3), but was not detected in the gas phase. Sea to air fluxes for MMA and DMA were calculated from the seawater and gaseous amine concentrations; these varied from -8.7 E-14 to +4.0 E-13 mol m(-2) s(-1) and from -1.9 E-12 to +2.17 E-12 mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. While the flux for MMA was mainly positive, suggesting an oceanic source for this analyte, the flux for DMA could be both positive and negative, indicating that 2-way transport may be occurring. Principal component analysis of the 24 month dataset of amines in aerosol particles revealed that the particulate amines were not directly linked to the identified sources. It seems that the transfer of amines was being determined by gas to particle conversion rather than via primary processes. The correlation of both seawater- and gas phase-amines with biological indicators suggests that they were partly linked and that the amine abundance in the atmosphere (gas phase) reflected biological processes in seawater. In contrast, particulate amine concentrations did not show such a direct response and might have other significant sources and environmental drivers.

AB High concentrations of PM2.5 have become a serious environmental issue in South Korea, which ranked 1st or 2nd among OECD countries in terms of population exposure to PM2.5. Quantitative understanding of PM2.5 source attribution is thus crucial for developing efficient air quality mitigation strategies. Here we use a suite of extensive observations of PM2.5 and its precursors concentrations during the international KORea-US cooperative Air Quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) in May-June 2016 to investigate source contributions to PM2.5 in South Korea under various meteorological conditions. For the quantitative analysis, we updated a 3-D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, and its adjoint with the latest regional emission inventory and other recent findings. The updated model is evaluated by comparing against observed daily PM2.5 and its component concentrations from six ground sites (Bangnyung, Bulkwang, Olympic park, Gwangju, Ulsan, and Jeju). Overall, simulated concentrations of daily PM2.5 and its components are in a good agreement with observations over the peninsula. We conduct an adjoint sensitivity analysis for simulated surface level PM2.5 concentrations at five ground sites (except for Bangnyung because of its small population) under four different meteorological conditions: dynamic weather, stagnant, extreme pollution, and blocking periods. Source contributions by regions vary greatly depending on synoptic meteorological conditions. Chinese contribution accounts for almost 68% of PM2.5 in surface air in South Korea during the extreme pollution period of the campaign, whereas an enhanced contribution from domestic sources (57%) occurs for the blocking period. Results from our sensitivity analysis suggest that the reduction of domestic anthropogenic NH3 emissions could be most effective in reducing population exposure to PM2.5 in South Korea (effectiveness = 14%) followed by anthropogenic SO2 emissions from Shandong region (effectiveness = 11%), domestic anthropogenic NOx emissions (effectiveness = 10%), anthropogenic NH3 emissions from Shandong region (effectiveness = 8%), anthropogenic NOx emissions from Shandong region (effectiveness = 7%), domestic anthropogenic OC emissions (effectiveness = 7%), and domestic anthropogenic BC emissions (effectiveness = 5%).

AB Air pollution is a frequent problem in sport Mega-events (e.g., Word Cup and Olympic Games). Information on air quality before, during and after these Mega-events can offer a meaningful contribution to our knowledge of the environmental impacts associates to major sporting event. In this study, we evaluated ambient air pollution (PM10, SO2, CO, O-3, and NOx - NO and NO2) during three periods in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: (period A) before the games, July 1st-August 4th, n = 35 days; (period B) during the games, August 5th-September 18th, n = 44 days; and (period C) after the games, September 19th - October 31st, n = 43 days. Our results showed that during the Olympic period, PM10, SO2, CO, NO and NO2 were reduced by 17, 26, 13, 49, and 12%, respectively. After the games (comparing the period B and C), these pollutants were reduced by 19, 17, 31, 36, and 25%. In contrast, O-3 concentrations increased 26% and 7% during (comparing period A and B) and after (comparing period B and C) the games, respectively. The concentration of most of the pollutants did not exceed the limits of the Brazilian guidelines in the three periods. Our findings show reduction of concentration for some pollutants during and after the games due to the emission reduction control implemented by the local government.

AB In the present study, the seasonal and vertical distributions of key aerosol types and its extinction coefficient (EC) are investigated with an emphasis on the impact of desert dust aerosols on the microphysical properties of cirrus. For this, we obtained near-simultaneous and collocated datasets retrieved from the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations), CloudSat, and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Taklimakan Desert (TMD) area situated in Northwest China during 2006-2011. We found that the main aerosol types prevalent over the TMD region are desert dust (DD), polluted dust (PD), and polluted continental/elevated smoke (PC/SE) which accounted for similar to 88.38%, similar to 10.81%, and similar to 0.47%, respectively. The DD type was the most dominant aerosol type during the total observational period due to the nature of the desert underlying surface, and the frequent dust activities occurred over the region. Further, the concentrations of PD and PC/SE were observed larger in winter compared to the other seasons contributing similar to 25.66% and 1.42%, respectively. This is likely attributed to increased burning of fossil fuels used for combustion processes in the cold season over Northwest China. On the other hand, the latitudinal distribution total aerosol loading of EC presented the south-to-north gradient with a declined tendency in all seasons due to enhanced amount of dust aerosols transported from the TMD area. Further, the seasonal mean values of total EC over TMD showed a maximum of 0.021 km(-1) appeared in spring, with a minimum (0.017 km(-1)) in autumn. In addition, we also investigated the impact of dust aerosols on the cirrus micro physical properties namely, ice water content (IWC), ice water path (IWP), ice cloud effective radius (IER), ice number concentration (INC), and ice distribution width (IDW). The results showed that dust aerosol can possibly change the microphysical properties of cirrus over the study domain.

AB During the first Intensive Observation Period (IOP1) of the SHADOW (SaHAran Dust Over West Africa) campaign carried out during March-June 2015, the Mbour site (Senegal) was reinforced with a large setup of in-situ and remote sensing instruments to measure the aerosol optical, physical and chemical properties as well as the atmospheric dynamical features over the site. Here, we use this dataset to study the impact of Sea Breeze (SB) on the aerosol properties.
   Two case studies were selected: (i) one representative of SB events observed during typical Harmattan conditions, (ii) and one representative of SB events observed during a Harmattan desert dust event. Both cases show a strong influence of the SB period on the dry Mass Scattering Efficiency (MSE), which increases by a factor of up to 1.4. Given the fact that SB occurred every other day at this coastal site during IOP1 (dry season) and that the relative humidity may reach 96%, the effect of such event on the radiative forcing may not be negligible.
   In order to evaluate the effects of different flows on aerosol transport, recirculation and stagnation factors were retrieved from wind components. The air mass recirculation factor implies that aerosols previously transported from the land over the sea are then brought back inland. In both cases, high recirculation factors were calculated (between 0.84 and 0.98) and air mass stagnation was observed right before the SB establishment. However, this stagnation is observed over the sea during the first case while it is located near the coast during the second case, which has a significant impact on the aerosol evolution. Indeed, a stagnation of air masses over the sea is associated with an increase in fine aerosol mass concentrations (PM1, PM2.5) due to a higher contribution of marine and anthropogenic sources notably for organic aerosols, and a higher contribution of more-oxidized organics. This contribution is lower when the air mass stagnation occurs over the shoreline during the desert dust event.

AB The so-called "enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers" were developed to mitigate ammonia losses from surface-applied urea (UR) and thereby increase N use efficiency and crop yield. However, research is needed to assess the efficiency of these products in mitigating ammonia emission. The aim of this study was to compare volatilization losses of ammonia following application of UR treated with B and Cu (B-Cu-UR), UR treated with dicyandiamide (DCD) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) (DCD-NBPT-UR), UR treated with humic substances (HS-UR), UR treated with NBPT (NBPT-UR), polymer S-coated UR (PSCUR), S-coated UR (SCUR), and untreated and uncoated UR (UR). Fertilizers (at a rate of 2355 mg N kg(-1)) were applied over the soil surface, and volatilized ammonia was quantified for 60 d under controlled conditions using a static closed chamber. Use of DCD-NBPT-UR increased ammonia emissions in comparison to UR by blocking nitrification and keeping the soil pH high, the latter resulting from UR hydrolysis. Urease complexation by the inhibitor and gradual N release resulted in low losses of ammonia by NBPT-UR and PSCUR, respectively. Compared to UR, B-Cu-UR delayed and slightly decreased ammonia volatilization. HS-UR, SCUR, and UR fertilizers had similar ammonia losses. Humic substances most likely did not act on urea-N complexation or even on decreasing urease activity, whereas immediate release of the nutrient by SCUR was noted. NBPT-UR and PSCUR could substitute for UR, aiming to mitigate ammonia volatilization.

AB In this study, the temporal variations of sources of black carbon (BC) concentrations were evaluated in the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, during three distinct seasons over 2017-2018. We measured BC concentrations using Aethalometers at two sampling sites, one in the city center of Milan, and one in the less densely populated suburb of Bareggio, approximately 14 km to the west of Milan's urban center. PM samples were also collected for elemental carbon (EC) and C-14 analyses. The Aethalometer model was used to apportion BC concentrations to the fossil fuel combustion (BCff) and biomass burning (BCbb) originated BC. Additionally, radiocarbon C-14 analysis was performed on the PM samples, allowing us to refine our estimates of the contributions of both BCff and BCbb to total BC concentrations and assess the dependence of the mass absorption cross section (MAC) of BC on its source. Overall, our results indicated that the annually averaged BC concentrations were higher at the Bareggio site (2763 +/- 1050 ng m(-3)) than at the Milan site (1921 +/- 876 ng m(3)). The Aethalometer model results demonstrated that in all of the sampling seasons, fossil-fuel-originated BC (BCff) concentrations were slightly higher in Milan (e.g., a summertime average of 1045 +/- 150 ng/m(3)) than in Bareggio (e.g., a summertime average of 940 +/- 89 ng/m(3)); however, black carbon (BCbb) concentrations from biomass burning were considerably higher at Bareggio (e.g., a wintertime average of 3284 +/- 713 ng/m(3)) than in Milan (e.g., a wintertime average of 1154 +/- 103 ng/m(3)). Diurnal variation plots indicated that both in Milan and Bareggio, BCff peaked during the morning and, to a lesser extent, afternoon traffic rush hours, while BCbb peaked during nighttime when residential wood burning for heating purposes is prominent. Our results also highlight the significant impact of residential wood burning on ambient BC concentrations in the Milan metropolitan area.

AB This paper has aimed to evaluate the air pollution emissions from maritime transportation arrive in/depart from Port of Incheon using two different approaches; fuel-based (Tier 1) and activity-based (Tier 3) methodologies. So far, Tier 1 or 2 level of estimation approaches, based on the fuel consumption provided by national fuel supply statistics, have been reasonably supported for environmentalists and policy makers at national level of emission inventory analysis, even for the global analysis. When considering the local air quality such as in a port area, however, the fuel based approach would not be properly estimating the shipping air emission sector due to the characteristic of maritime transportation. In this study, the fuel-based air emission inventory provided by Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS), South Korea was compared and analyzed with the activity-based emission estimation produced by Portal Air Quality Management System (PAQman (c)). As a result, there discovered a significant gap in the air pollution emissions between fuel-based and activity-based estimations. The findings in this study implies the necessity and significance of local/regional level focused implementation for air quality improvement and regulatory framework especially in a port-city region e.g. Incheon. Although this paper still contains some limitations and assumption described, the results are confident enough to emphasize the application of the activity-based shipping emission estimation approach to discover the potential limitation, which has been unknown and not listed on the national air emission inventory using fuel-based approach.

AB In anticipation of the expanding appreciation for air quality models in health outcomes studies, we develop and evaluate a reduced-complexity model for pollution transport that intentionally sacrifices some of the sophistication of full-scale chemical transport models in order to support applicability to a wider range of health studies. Specifically, we introduce the HYSPLIT average dispersion model, HyADS, which combines the HYSPLIT trajectory dispersion model with modern advances in parallel computing to estimate ZIP code level exposure to emissions from individual coal-powered electricity generating units in the United States. Importantly, the method is not designed to reproduce ambient concentrations of any particular air pollutant; rather, the primary goal is to characterize each ZIP code's exposure to these coal power plants specifically. We show adequate performance towards this goal against observed annual average air pollutant concentrations (nationwide Pearson correlations of 0.88 and 0.73 with SO42- and PM2.5, respectively) and coal-combustion impacts simulated with a full-scale chemical transport model and adjusted to observations using a hybrid direct sensitivities approach (correlation of 0.90). We proceed to provide multiple examples of HyADS's single-source applicability, including to show that 22% of the population-weighted coal exposure comes from 30 coal-powered electricity generating units.

TI Comparing associations of respiratory risk for the EPA Air Quality Index

AB To communicate health risks associated with short-term changes in air pollution, the US EPA reports local air quality through the Air Quality Index (AQI). However, it remains unclear whether the current regulatory-based, single-pollutant AQI fully represents the actual risks of air pollution-related illness. A revised index using a multi pollutant approach based on health effects could potentially improve public health by better reflecting the health risks associated with exposure to multiple pollutants. Using time-series analysis, daily AQI values of four criteria pollutants (NO2, O-3, PM2.5, and SO2) in Bronx and Queens Counties of New York from 2005 to 2010 were regressed against total respiratory emergency department (ED) visits using a Poisson generalized linear model to generate region-specific coefficients (NO2: 0.011; O-3: 0.0027; PM2.5: 0.0022; SO2: 0.0013), which were used to develop a multi-pollutant health-based air quality index. Multi-pollutant index models and single-pollutant EPA AQI values were regressed against total respiratory ED visits from 2011 to 2013 to determine the association of index values with population-level health outcomes. Based on time-series analysis, each pollutant considered was shown to have significant positive associations with respiratory ED visits for at least part of the year and was therefore eligible for potential inclusion in a multi-pollutant index. A log-transformed, multi-pollutant health based model with NO2, O-3, PM2.5, and SO2 was found to have more consistent associations throughout the high O-3 (April-September) (1.03, 95% CI [1.01-1.05]) and low- O-3 (October-March) (1.03, 95% CI [1.01-1.05]) seasons with total respiratory ED visits as compared to AQI values. Associations between respiratory ED visits and the AQI were not significant during the high-O-3 season (high-O-3: 1.00, 95% CI [0.99-1.02]. These results indicate that a single-pollutant index may at times inadequately communicate the full adverse health risks of air pollution. A multi-pollutant index, that was adjusted to ensure a relatively normal distribution of index values, was able to reflect population level health outcomes during the high-O-3 season when air pollution mixtures become more complex, while the currently utilized AQI could not represent population-level air pollution health risks during the high-O-3 season. The development and validation of a multi-pollutant index for use in the US is something that may merit consideration in future updates to air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. Local jurisdictions may wish to act sooner to improve risk communication of outdoor air pollution.

AB Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new aerosol algorithm developed to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land using the time series data to dynamically isolate aerosol and land contributions. However, there are still no comprehensive research on the quality of MAIAC AOD over China. In this paper, 1 km MAIAC AOD over China were examined against ground-based measurements to evaluate the performance of the data. In general, Aqua and Terra MAIAC retrievals have a high correlation coefficient (0.924 for Aqua and 0.933 for Terra) with ground-based observations and there are more than 72% of retrievals falling within the Expected Errors (EE = +/- (0.05 + 0.2*AOD)). We found that the accuracy of MAIAC AOD is related with the AOD magnitude, aerosol size, seasons and surface types. In spring and summer, the AOD bias was influenced by both aerosol model and surface reflectance estimation. We also found that the aerosol model is the main source of AOD bias over desert regions. These results indicated that the MAIAC AOD could be used as a new aerosol data source for air quality and climate studies in China.

AB Environmental cycling of the toxic metal mercury (Hg) is ubiquitous, and still not completely understood. Volatilisation and emission of mercury from vegetation, litter and soil during burning represents a significant return pathway for previously-deposited atmospheric mercury. Rates of such emission vary widely across ecosystems as they are dependent on species-specific uptake of atmospheric mercury as well as fire return frequencies. Wildfire burning in Australia is currently thought to contribute between 1 and 5% of the global total of mercury emissions, yet no modelling efforts to date have utilised local mercury emission factors (mass of emitted mercury per mass of dry fuel) or local mercury emission ratios (ratio of emitted mercury to another emitted species, typically carbon monoxide). Here we present laboratory and field investigations into mercury emission from burning of surface fuels in dry sclerophyll forests, native to the temperate south-eastern region of Australia. From laboratory data we found that fire behaviour - in particular combustion phase - has a large influence on mercury emission and hence emission ratios. Further, emission of mercury was predominantly in gaseous form with particulate-bound mercury representing < 1% of total mercury emission. Importantly, emission factors and emission ratios with respect to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, from both laboratory and field data all show that gaseous mercury emission from biomass burning in Australian dry sclerophyll forests is currently overestimated by around 60%. Based on these results, we recommend a mercury emission factor of 28.7 +/- 8.1 mu g Hg kg(-1) dry fuel, and emission ratio of gaseous elemental mercury relative to carbon monoxide of 0.58 +/- 0.01 x 10(-7), for estimation of mercury release from the combustion of Australian dry sclerophyll litter.

AB The rate coefficients for the reactions of OH radicals and Cl atoms with 3-methoxy-1-propanol (3-M-1-POL) and 3-methoxy-l-butanol (3-M-1-BOL) in the gas-phase have been measured at (298 +/- 2) K and atmospheric pressure. A conventional relative-rate technique was used to determine the rate coefficients: k(1) (OH + 3-M-1-POL) = (2.15 +/- 0.28) x 10(-11), k(2) (OH + 3-M-1-BOL) = (2.38 +/- 0.31) x 10(-11), k(3) (Cl + 3-M-1-POL) = (2.66 +/- 0.23) x 10(-10) and k(4) (Cl + 3-M-1-BOL) = (2.95 +/- 0.27) x 10(-10), all in units of cm(3) molecule(-1)s(-1). The present work provides the first kinetic study of the reactions of Cl atoms with 3-M-1-POL and 3-M-1-BOL, and of the reaction of OH radicals with 3-M-1-POL. The kinetic results are presented and compared with those calculated (k(SAR)) using the structure-reactivity relationship (SAR) method, and reactivity trends are discussed. Additionally, products identification under atmospheric conditions was performed for the first time for the reactions cited above in the presence of NO, using two sampling methods and GC-MS-FID. 3-methoxypropanal, methyl formate and glycolaldehyde were identified from the 3-M-1-POL + OH/Cl reactions, while 3-methoxybutyraldehyde, methyl acetate and glycolaldehyde, were identified from the 3-M-1-BOL + OH/Cl reactions. From these identified products, a general scheme of the reaction mechanisms is proposed. Finally, based on the kinetic results and radiative efficiencies (REs) of the titled compounds, a discussion on the atmospheric implications due to its emissions into the troposphere is also presented.

AB Urban areas emit large amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, waste dump and consumption and infrastructure of natural gas. CH4 emissions from India are increasing, especially from the urban regions due to fast socioeconomic developments. Therefore, the total emissions of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) from these regions need to be continuously monitored. However, the systematic measurements of GHGs at urban regions in India are lacking to record the current emission scenarios. We have initiated high-frequency measurements of atmospheric CH4 dry-air mole fraction (DMF), along with carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) at Ahmedabad, a representative urban site in western India, using laser-based cavity ring down spectrometer from July 2014 to July 2015. The time series analysis suggests that the study region exerts very high emissions of CH4, and the tracer-tracer correlations of CH4:CO2 and CH4:CO indicate that the combustion related anthropogenic and fugitive sources are the two main sources of CH4 in the study region. The seasonally high (low) values of CH4 DMF are observed during October February (May August) months, and the diurnally high (low) CH4 are observed during midnight (afternoon) hours. We compute the total CH4 emission from Ahmedabad to be similar to 58 +/- 16 Gg for the year 2014, which is similar to 45% higher than the EDGARv4.2 FT2010 inventory estimates. The observed time series are compared to simulations from two global atmospheric chemistry-transport models (i.e. ACTM and LMDzINCA). Both of the models perform very well in simulating the seasonal cycle of CH4 when the afternoon mean observations are used but fail to simulate the evening to mid-night buildup in CH4 owing to coarse resolutions of the global models and limitations in capturing the dynamical and physical processes in the boundary layer.

AB High ozone episodes have become a serious issue specially in megacities of developing countries. In this study an attempt has been made to understand the changes in the extreme ozone concentration due to different precursor compounds and meteorological variables in a given time period by applying Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theory. The return probabilities of the extreme ozone concentrations were estimated for both classical stationary assumption as well as nonstationary assumption given the fact that ozone time series have both trend and multiple periodicities. Under stationary case, the distribution parameters were allowed to remain stationary, but in nonstationary case, distribution parameters were allowed to vary as a function of precursor compounds (Benzene, Toluene, mp-Xylene, NO, NO2) and meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity). Daily maximum ozone concentrations were found to follow heavy tailed Frechet distribution in both stationary and nonstationary conditions. The inclusion of covariate into the classical model explains the dynamic nature of ozone depending on its precursor variables. Principal components were also used as covariates in nonstationary GEV distribution model. The estimated return levels of ozone from the stationary model, were found to be 97.89, 144.34, 188.44, 232.10, 310.33, 366.47 and 429.97 mu g/m(3) for 3, 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365-day return period, respectively. In case of non-stationary GEV model the estimated return levels for 3, 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 day period were in the range 38.38-140.96, 84.31-184.35, 115.92-225.26, 166.61-337.21, 189.46-388.30 and 214.98-445 mu g/m(3), respectively. The highest median return level of O-3 for 3-day return period (100.35 mu g/m(3)) was observed due to temperature as covariate, for 7-day (146.04 mu g/m(3)) and 15-day (189.85 mu g/m(3)) return period, it was observed due to Benzene as a covariate and for rest of the 4 different return periods, NO was found responsible for the highest median return level of O-3 (233.52, 312.40, 369.02 and 433.06 mu g/m(3) for 30, 90, 180 and 365-day respectively). Seasonal analysis finds O-3 extremes to be high in monsoon and premonsoon seasons and low in winter period. The impact of nonstationary condition is exemplified by the fact that the 365 day return level of maximum ozone concentration was found to exceed within just 20 days for a lower concentration of precursor Benzene (i.e. 214.48 mu g/m(3)). Results underline the role of the principal components of the precursor compounds in governing the maximum ozone concentration in any city.

TI Aerosols impact on the convective and non-convective rain distribution

AB The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to simulate rainfall pattern over the Indian landmass during a normal monsoon year (June-September 2010). Sensitivity analysis is performed using three different microphysical (MP) schemes (Thompson, Morrison, and Lin) to simulate the rainfall pattern and distribution over India. A significant difference in the rainfall amount, as well as distribution, is observed among the MP schemes, despite using the same model configuration and the meteorological and chemical initial and boundary condition. Lin MP scheme performed better than other schemes in simulating the rainfall over the Indian domain. Heavy rainfall along the foothills of the Himalayas, the mountainous coastal region of western India, and the northeastern part of India and sparse rainfall over northwest India are captured realistically in the model, which agrees well with the observed rainfall pattern over India. The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depths retrieved from the MODIS satellites is broadly well simulated by the model.
   The model simulated convective and non-convective rainfall characteristics over the Indian landmass are found to be consistent with the monsoon precipitation climatology. It is shown that the change in both convective and non-convective rainfall due to aerosols and chemistry is non-negligible over India during monsoon season. The total rainfall is found to increase significantly over the entire Western Ghats and some part of northeast India, while it is diminished over the northwest, north and east India when aerosol chemistry effects are considered in the model simulation. Additional analysis is performed to simulate the perturbations in convective and non-convective rainfall due to aerosols (e.g., dust, sea salt, black carbon etc.). Results show that the effect of aerosols on convective and non-convective rainfall distribution over India is non-linear. Depending on the meteorological conditions, topography, and the type of aerosol, the aerosol impact and feedback on monsoon rainfall can be positive, negative, or neutral.

AB To fill the blank on vertical profiles of carbonaceous aerosols during winter, the first in situ vertical measurements of organic and elemental carbon (OC, EC) from ground level to 620 m were conducted by means of high topographic relief in a typical valley city of Lanzhou, northwest China. The key factors (meteorology and sources) affecting the vertical distributions also were revealed by clustering technique and principal component analysis. Mean OC and EC concentrations were (16.2 +/- 8.9) mu g m(-3) and (5.1 +/- 2.1) mu g m(-3) during the study periods near the ground. More uniformly vertical distributions of carbonaceous aerosols during daytime than those during nighttime with OC (EC) decreasing rates of similar to 1.45 (similar to 0.32) mu g m(-3) 100 m(-1) during nighttime and similar to 0.84 (similar to 0.09) mu g m(-3) 100 m(-1) during daytime. Three distinct types of OC (EC) vertical profiles were determined by clustering technique. The cluster with high concentrations of OC (33.7 +/- 5.7 mu g m(-3)) and EC (10.5 +/- 7.7 mu g m(-3)) near the ground surface was induced largely by temperature inversion around the ground. The OC (EC) differences between the surface and the hilltop increased by 14.21 (2.45) mu g m(-3) when inversion layer depth increased by 100 m. Winter carbonaceous aerosols were more significantly affected by atmospheric stratification near the ground, while those were impacted together by vertical and horizontal dispersions at the hilltop. The primary emissions from coal combustion or biomass burning for heating at the hilltop and motor vehicles near the ground also had an important effect on OC (EC) vertical profiles. The emissions from coal burning and gasoline vehicles accounted for 60%-70% of carbonaceous aerosols in urban areas of Lanzhou. Furthermore, the contributions of gasoline vehicles during daytime near the surface(similar to 20%) and biomass burning at the hilltop (similar to 15%) were larger due to the impact of human activities.

AB Atmospheric deposition is considered to be the major pathway by which substances from the atmosphere enter to the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This study constitutes the first exhaustive report on trace metal deposition in Cuba and is aimed to determine the monthly atmospheric flux of 47 major and trace elements in a Caribbean coastal site and investigate the main sources contributing to deposition.
   Bulk deposition (average of 46 018 mu g m(-2) day(-1)) and fluxes of studied elements showed a high variability and no seasonality with the dry and wet periods, results that we attributed to the fluctuations of the emissions from their main sources rather than to meteorological factors controlling the deposition processes. However, stronger correlations were found between typical crustal elements, which showed a marked seasonality with the presence of African cloud dust in the Caribbean. Lanthanoids element (Eu anomalies and La-N/Lu-N ratios) helped us to confirm the seasonal influence of African dust in the geochemical composition of bulk deposition in Cienfuegos. Most of the analysed elements were found in the range of variation of those reported in rural environments around the world but, the elements V, Ni, As and Sb reached higher levels, typically found in urban and industrial areas. The elements Sb, Pb, W, Sn, S, Cu, Mo, Nb and P were moderately enriched (10 < EF < 100) and Zn was highly enriched (EF > 100), indicating they were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The La/V ratios were found to be exclusively lower than 0.06 suggesting a strong influence of anthropogenic V emissions from industries with oil and/or petroleum-coke combustion processes. However, we found that V have a predominantly natural origin in the studied region which appear to be related with deposition processes dominated by large particles.
   Finally, Principal Component, Multilinear Regression and Cluster analyses led the identification of 5 main sources contributing to the bulk deposition: crustal matter (39.5%), marine aerosol (38.2%), combustions including the wastes incineration, wood and fossil fuel burning (6.7%), industries (8.7%) and road traffic (1.4%).

AB Commonly large shifts of wind direction in low-wind conditions are poorly understood and are not sufficiently captured by air-quality dispersion model AERMOD. In the low-wind conditions, the observed concentration distribution is multi-peaked and non-Gaussian due to the large variability in the wind direction. To account the variability in the wind direction, a segmented approach is used by assuming that a shorter time period (2 min) mean wind direction estimate the plume more closely than the hourly mean wind. For illustration, concentration measurements from the low wind diffusion experiment conducted at Idaho are utilized. The qualitative performance of AERMOD with all the three options (FASTALL, LOW-WIND1, and LOW-WIND3) using segmented approach is reasonably good in terms of explaining the key characteristics such as multiple peaks and large plume spread of the observed concentration and is relatively better than the hourly approach (using hourly mean wind). The statistical measures for all the three options of AERMOD using segmented approach are found good in agreement with the observations, and a quantitative analysis based on ANOVA (analysis of variance) shows that the results from all the three options of AERMOD using segmented approach are found to be comparable at 5% significance level.

AB This work documents the extremely high concentrations of fine aerosol particles (PM2.5), equivalent black carbon (eBC) and carbon monoxide (CO) experienced by commuters in one of the world largest Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, located in Bogota, Colombia. A strong relationship between vehicle emissions standard and in-vehicle concentrations was established. Extensive measurements of PM2.5, eBC, and CO were carried out inside the system buses and stations. Measurements were performed during eleven months covering all the system lanes and a significant fraction of the bus fleet and stations. Based on the observed in-bus and in-station concentrations, travel times, and urban ambient levels, the contribution of a typical round trip in the BRT system to the daily inhaled dose was estimated to be 60% for PM2.5, and between 79% and 90% for eBC. The mean PM2.5 dose inhaled by commuters in a typical round trip in the system is 1.2 times the dose a subject would inhale over 24 h exposed to WHO guideline of 25 mu g m(-3). In 52 out of 180 buses sampled the mean in-cabin concentration of eBC was in excess of 100 mu g m(-3). Measurements show that mean ratio of in-bus to urban ambient concentration is 8:1 for PM2.5 and 4:1 for CO. These ratios were observed to be much larger when traveling inside the older fraction of the BRT fleet, reaching 11:1 and 7:1 for PM2.5 and CO respectively. These older buses consist exclusively of Euro II and Euro III nominal emission standard vehicles. Average exposure levels inside Euro II and III buses was twice as large as those measured inside vehicles with stricter emission standards, Euro IV or superior. Overall, the measurements suggest that the entrainment of polluted pockets of air to the semi enclosed micro-environments in the system, namely, buses and stations, explains the extreme observed exposure concentrations. Measurements inside an underground bus-station where traffic is restricted to only BRT buses, and on-board a zero emission fully electric BRT bus suggested most of the pollution in the system comes from entrainment of the exhaust of the diesel-powered BRT buses. The significantly lower exposure and inhaled dose of PM2.5, eBC, and CO observed for commuters in newer vehicles suggests that a fleet renewal could have a disproportionately large impact on reducing population exposure to air pollutants. The extent of the reduction in exposure and inhaled dose through fleet renewal is proportional to the gradient of in bus to urban ambient air pollution levels.

AB In this study, the importance of lightning-generated NO over Europe in the year 2010 is assessed with the COSMO-CCLM - SMOKE-EU - CMAQ chemistry transport modeling system. Lightning data from TRMM satellite flash density data climatologies are taken and linearly fitted to convective precipitation climatologies. With the resulting linear model, lightning activity in 2010 is calculated based on the convective precipitation rate from model data. This approach combines the globally available satellite observations with the simplicity of linear convective rain parameterizations. It provides a new method for fitting lightning data for linear flash density parameterizations. Compared to other linear flash rate approaches or the very common cloud top height parameterization, the data for 2010 derived by the climatologies and actual 2010 precipitation data better matches the TRMM observation data. Lightning was found to be the second most important natural source after nitrogen monoxide emission from soil, with an annual average amount of 0.295 Tg N per year and an amount in 2010 of 0.278 Tg N. While it is less important for near-surface concentrations, it has a considerable effect on the nitrogen deposition in southern and eastern Europe and a large effect on the NO2 concentration in higher model layers. The effect in higher atmospheric layers over eastern Europe is 6 times larger than the effect of aircrafts on the air concentration of NO2 in the mid- and high altitudes. Comparisons with NO2 observations from the OMI satellite revealed that lightning NO emissions have an observable impact on the NO2 column density over Europe.

AB Air pollution is associated with stroke, but few previous studies have explored the impact of exposure to a sustained high air pollution level (which we define as an air pollution wave) on stroke. We decomposed the effect estimates of air pollution waves into a main effect estimate and an added effect estimate. The main effect estimate was due to the absolute daily level of air pollution, and the added effect estimate was due to the duration of high-level air pollution. PM10, SO2, NO2 and the Air Pollution Index (API) were chosen as indictors to explore the comprehensive evaluation indictor. The generalized additive model was used to evaluate the impact of air pollution wave on years of life lost (YLLs) due to stroke in Tianjin, China, from 2006 to 2011. Finally, we adopted different air pollution wave definitions to explore features of the association. When using the API as an indicator of air pollution, the association between the air pollution wave and stroke YLLs were significantly increased. When the duration of persistent pollution became longer, the main effect estimate did not change much, but the added effect estimate continued to increase. When the duration was 3 days, the added effect estimate was a maximum of 36.47 years (95% CI: 6.46, 66.48), while the main effect estimate was only 27.87 years (95% CI: 7.62, 48.11). For the other air pollution indicators, the added effect estimate of PM10 were not statistically significant, whereas that of SO2 was significant. The mortality risk associated with the different indicators showed a similar pattern. The comparison results between different indicators suggest that API can better reflect impacts of air pollution waves. Sustained exposure to air pollution had main and added impacts on stroke. The government and public should attach importance to air pollution wave and take individual protection to reduce exposure to pollutants.

AB We studied the effect of aerosols inorganic chemical composition on the aerosol hygroscopicity of urban pollution in Brazil, where biofuels have been used in large scale. We applied size segregated inorganic chemical composition analysis using ISORROPIA II model and kappa-Kohler theory to determine the hygroscopicity parameter (kappa) of submicrometer aerosols measured in Sao Paulo city. The size dependence of organic and black carbon (BC) mass were estimated by chemical mass balance and mean observed values.
   Results showed ultrafine mode particles with diameter smaller than 100 tun with a relatively K2SO4 and Na2SO4 large amount inducing further growth by diffusive condensation and coagulation of low-volatile organic compounds. The process could lead to modifications of aerosol size distribution and also to formation of more active Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) due to the formation of aerosols with considerably increase of hygroscopicity (> 40%). The contribution from BC can decreases up to 40% of the observed hygroscopicities values of particles around 100 nm in diameter.
   Moreover, we present a parameterization based on aerosol mass fraction to accurately predict kappa derived from data of Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) collected in urban pollution in Brazil. Results are compared to hygroscopicity derived from observations of the pollution plume downwind Manaus, on the northern region of Brazil. Both cases were analogous indicating that, despite the fact of receiving influences of organic components from the forest, the pollution plume of Manaus shows the same characteristics of hygroscopicity, and can be modeled following the same parameterization.

   PERFORMANCE
AB A custom-built steam-based aerosol collector (SBAC) was developed to improve the detection limits in aerosol chemical analysis. The SBAC was coupled with wet chemical analytical instruments to characterize the chemical composition of ambient particulate matter with high-time resolution. The particulate matter was mixed with a jet of steam and formed large droplets because of the supersaturation condition in the cooling chamber. The enlarged droplets were subsequently collected using an inertial aerosol separator and delivered to selected instruments for chemical analysis. Experiments were subsequently conducted to evaluate our custom-built SBAC under various sampling flow rates. In particular, particle growth and particle collection efficiency experiments were conducted, and the SBAC was compared with a filter-based sampler. Sample solutions were collected, extracted, and analyzed to determine the influence of sampling flow rate, particle size, and aerosol chemical concentration on the SBAC's collection efficiency. The SBAC was found to provide data with a higher time resolution, to exhibit an improved detection limit, and to effectively perform aerosol chemical analysis compared with the filter-based samplers, although the effect of flow rate on SBAC performance is complicated and further experiments on this aspect are warranted. This paper contributes to the literature by providing guidelines for designing a SBAC for aerosol chemical analysis.

TI Improving ozone simulations in the Great Lakes Region: The role of
   emissions, chemistry, and dry deposition

AB The Great Lakes Region of the US continues experiencing exceedances of the ozone (O-3) standards, despite years of emissions controls. In part, this is due to interactions between emissions from surrounding large cities (e.g., Chicago) and meteorology, which is heavily influenced by the presence of the Great Lakes. These complex meteorology-emissions interactions pose a challenge to fully capture O-3 dynamics, particularly near shores of the lakes, where high O-3 levels are often experienced. In a simulation with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, using inputs as typically constructed, the model tends to be biased high. A literature review indicated that NOx emissions from mobile sources, possibly overestimated in the 2011 National Emission Inventory (NEI), or the version of the Carbon Bond chemical mechanism used in CMAQ could be responsible for high biases of O-3. As such, a series of sensitivity tests was conducted to identify potential causes for this bias, including emissions biases (e.g., biogenic VOCs, anthropogenic NOx), chemical mechanism choice, and O-3 dry deposition to fresh water, for high O-3 periods in July 2011. The base model/emissions configuration used the following: Carbon Bond mechanism CB05, biogenic emissions using Biogenic Emission Inventory System (BETS), and anthropogenic emissions from the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Meteorological inputs were developed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (version 3.8.1). Simulated daily maximum 8-h average O-3 without and with a cutoff of 60 ppb (referred to as MDA8 O-3 and elevated MDA8 O-3 hereafter, respectively) were evaluated against measurements. The evaluation showed a high bias in MDA8 O-3 across the domain, particularly at coastal sites (by similar to 6 ppb), while elevated MDA8 O-3 (i.e., greater than 60 ppb) was biased low, with exceptions centered along the shore of Lake Michigan. Using the CB6 chemical mechanism or 50% reduction of NOx emissions from on-road mobile sources led to substantial domain-wide decreases in O-3 from the base case, and the model performance improved, particularly along the Lake Michigan shoreline and for the western domain. However, elevated MDA8 O-3 was more biased against measurements, compared to the model performance in the base case, except at a few sites along the shoreline. Using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) instead of BEIS to estimate biogenic emissions, or increasing dry deposition of O-3 to fresh water by a factor of ten (which is unrealistic), had minor impacts on simulated O-3 over land. But, combining MEGAN with CB6 resulted in improved elevated MDA8 O-3 simulation along the western coast of Lake Michigan. Finally, using CB6 combined with a 30% reduction of on-road mobile NOx emissions and MEGAN led to the best performance. Two companion papers investigate how meteorological modeling can be improved. Together, the recommended modeling system could serve as a starting point for future O-3 modeling in the region.

AB Several studies have attempted to predict ground PM2.5 concentrations using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. However, over 70%-90% of aerosol retrievals are non-random missing, which limits and biases the estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been well resolved to date.
   The aim of this study was to develop an interpolation technique to handle the missing data retrieval problem and to estimate the daily PM2.5 for a high coverage dataset with 3-km resolution in China by fitting the complex temporal and spatial variations.
   We developed a two-step interpolation method (i.e., the mixed-effect model and inverse distance weighting technology) to replace the missing values in AOD. Next, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) technique that includes a non-linear exposure-lag-response model (NELRM) was proposed and validated to estimate the daily levels of PM2.5 across China during 2014-2015.
   After two steps of interpolation, the missing value rate of daily AOD data was reduced from 87.91% to 13.83%. The cross-validation (CV) R-square, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage prediction error (MAPE) of the interpolation were 0.76, 0.10 and 21.41%, respectively. The cross-validation for the prediction of daily PM2.5 resulted in R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 14.98, and MAPE = 23.72%.
   The results of this study indicate that the two-step interpolation method can largely resolve the non-random missing data problem and that the combined XGBoost methods have a good ability to estimate fine particulate matter concentrations.

AB The first multi-instrument nocturnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) intercomparison campaign was held at the high-mountain Izafia Observatory (Tenerife, Spain) in June 2017, involving 2-min synchronous measurements from two different types of lunar photometers (Cimel CE318-T and Moon Precision Filter Radiometer, LunarPFR) and one stellar photometer. The Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was compared with the open-access ROLO Implementation for Moon photometry Observation (RIMO) model. Results showed rather small differences at Izatia over a 2-month time period covering June and July, 2017 (+/- 0.01 in terms of AOD calculated by means of a day/night/day coherence test analysis and +/- 2% in terms of lunar irradiance). The RIMO model has been used in this field campaign to retrieve AOD from lunar photometric measurements.
   No evidence of significant differences with the Moon's phase angle was found when comparing raw signals of the six Cimel photometers involved in this field campaign.
   The raw signal comparison of the participating lunar photometers (Cimel and LunarPFR) performed at coincident wavelengths showed consistent measurements and AOD differences within their combined uncertainties at 870 nm and 675 rim. Slightly larger AOD deviations were observed at 500 nm, pointing to some unexpected instrumental variations during the measurement period.
   Lunar irradiances retrieved using RIMO for phase angles varying between 0 degrees and 75 degrees (full Moon to near quarter Moon) were compared to the irradiance variations retrieved by Cimel and LunarPFR photometers. Our results showed a relative agreement within +/- 3.5% between the RIMO model and the photometer-based lunar irradiances.
   The AOD retrieved by performing a Langley-plot calibration each night showed a remarkable agreement (better than 0.01) between the lunar photometers. However, when applying the Lunar-Langley calibration using RIMO, AOD differences of up to 0.015 (0.040 for 500 nm) were found, with differences increasing with the Moon's phase angle. These differences are thought to be partly due to the uncertainties in the irradiance models, as well as instrumental deficiencies yet to be fully understood.
   High AOD variability in stellar measurements was detected during the campaign. Nevertheless, the observed AOD differences in the Cimel/stellar comparison were within the expected combined uncertainties of these two photometric techniques. Our results indicate that lunar photometry is a more reliable technique, especially for low aerosol loading conditions.
   The uncertainty analysis performed in this paper shows that the combined standard AOD uncertainty in lunar photometry is dependent on the calibration technique (up to 0.014 for Langley-plot with illumination-based correction, 0.012-0.022 for Lunar-Langley calibration, and up to 0.1 for the Sun-Moon Gain Factor method). This analysis also corroborates that the uncertainty of the lunar irradiance model used for AOD calculation is within the 5-10% expected range.
   This campaign has allowed us to quantify the important technical difficulties that still exist when routinely monitoring aerosol optical properties at night-time. The small AOD differences observed between the three types of photometers involved in the campaign are only detectable under pristine sky conditions such as those found in this field campaign. Longer campaigns are necessary to understand the observed discrepancies between instruments as well as to provide more conclusive results about the uncertainty involved in the lunar irradiance models.

TI Rethinking NOx emission factors considering on-road driving with

AB This study aims to quantify the differences between the standard laboratory-based NOx emissions factor (EF) and on-road measurements, and to estimate how much NOx emissions exceed the current EF under typical Korean road traffic conditions. Four Euro 4 light-duty diesel vehicles (LDVs) manufactured in Korea were driven on a chassis dynamometer and on test routes that included urban and rural roads and a motorway. NOx emissions, average speed, and acceleration were measured and calculated for each 1 km trip. We focused in particular on the possibility of vehicle malfunctions causing increased NOx emissions, and compared NOx emissions before and after the repair of faulty exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves, which are a key NOx reduction system for LDVs. The current NOx EF for Euro 4 LDVs only estimates 27-31% of on their on-road NOx emissions, and low acceleration during the standard driving cycle is a part of the reason for this weak representativeness. Another is the lack of tools with which to monitor EGR valve degradation. Even with fully functioning EGR valve hardware, the capability of vehicles to control NOx emissions differ in laboratory and on-road conditions; it is weaker for the latter compared to the former because the software controls are different. The findings here provide insights for different regions where Euro 4 LDVs are still in use, depending on their age. For Korea and the EU, where the fleet is old, accurate assessments of the real risk of NOx emissions are beneficial in terms of increasing the effectiveness of control measures. In countries where the Euro 4 fleet is still young, comprehensive changes are recommended for the on-board diagnostic system and the subsequent maintenance of the hardware and software of EGR valve.

AB Karachi, Pakistan is one of the largest and most polluted metropolitan cities in south Asia. Air quality was assessed using 24-hr fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected from two sites, Korangi (industrial/residential) and Tibet Center (commercial/residential). Spatial and temporal characteristics and sources of pollution were evaluated from August 2008 through August 2009 using samples analyzed for PM2.5, black carbon (BC), trace elements, and water-soluble ions. Elemental enrichment factors (EFs) and a receptor model/positive matrix factorization (PMF), were used to delineate the anthropogenic and natural sources. The mean 24-hr PM2.5 was 101 +/- 45.6 mu g m(-3) at Korangi and 76.5 +/- 38.4 mu g m(-3) at Tibet Center. Every 24-hr sample analyzed from both sites exceeded the WHO 24-hr guideline value of 25 mu g m(-3). Average PM2.5 levels were higher during winter, suggesting increased combustion activity and decreased air dispersion. EFs suggest significant contributions of trace elements from anthropogenic activities. Air pollution levels were higher at the Korangi site than Tibet Center, highlighting major contributions from industrial activities near the site. From PMF analysis, five sources and their relative contributions were determined at Korangi and Tibet Center, respectively: 1) oil combustion (25% and 21%); 2) soil and urban dust resuspension (28% and 25%); 3) vehicular emissions (23% and 5%); 4) sea spray (13% and 26%); and 5) industrial emissions (11% and 23%). The evaluation of health risk associated with exposure to air pollution indicated some major air pollution concerns in Karachi, stressing the need for the formulation and implementation of strict laws on PM2.5 emission.

AB Mineral dust aerosols can substantially influence the Earth's climate by altering the radiation budget and modifying cloud microphysical and radiative properties. Through long-range transport, dust aerosols could have a global impact. Here, using a fully coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) and the tracer-tagging technique, we conduct quasi-global simulations to investigate the characteristics of dust intercontinental transport in the Northern Hemisphere and the source contributions to dust outflow from East Asia. Model results show that total dust emission from the main deserts (i.e., North Africa desert (NFD), Middle East desert (MED) and East Asia desert (EAD)) is about 4531 Tg yr(-1), in which 66% is from NFD, 24% is from MED and 10% is from EAD. During long-range transport, the NFD and MED dust plumes are separated into two branches by the Tibetan Plateau, with higher dust concentration of 4 mu g m(-3) in the northern branch (37 degrees N-60 degrees N). The imported dust mass from NFD and MED to East Asia is 16.0 Tg yr(-1) and 33.8 Tg yr(-1), respectively; the local dust mass emitted from EAD can circumnavigate and import about 0.41 Tg yr(-1) of dust into East Asia. As part of the "Asian outflow", the MED and NFD dust is transported above 600 hPa with concentration of 2 mu g m(-3), while the EAD dust is mainly transported below 600 hPa with concentration of 3 mu g m(-3). The total outflow dust mass from East Asia is 12.0, 9.7 and 7.7 Tg yr(-1) from EAD, NFD and MED, respectively. Dust particles dominate the aerosol mass concentration with a fraction of 56.5% in southern East Asia and 75.4% in northern East Asia. Moreover, dust number from EAD dominates the total aerosol number north of 37 degrees N below 600 hPa, with a size range of 0.156-0.625 mu m, but the NFD dust number is mainly above 600 hPa. MED dust number dominates the total column aerosol number south of 37 degrees N, with a size range of 0.312-0.625 mu m. Quantifying dust source contributions and the associated dust number loading and size distribution over East Asia is important for understanding the role of East Asian dust outflow in climate and hydrological cycle.

AB Organic aerosol is one of the dominant components of PM2.5 in megacities. In order to understand the sources and formation processes of aliphatic carbonyl compounds, the concentrations of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and carbonyl compounds were determined in the PM2.5 from an urban area of Beijing sampled in November-December 2016 and analysed using two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). The data were separated into non-haze and haze days (PM2.5 >= 75 mu g m(-3)). n-Alkanes (C-10-C-36) and n-alkenes (C-12-C-26) were abundant in the samples during the sampling campaign regardless of non-haze and haze conditions, and the middle chain length n-alkanes (C-25-C-34) were the most abundant. Aliphatic carbonyls, specifically n-alkanals (C-8-C-29), n-alkan-2-ones (C-8-C-31) and n-alkan-3-ones (C-8-C-30) were also detected in the PM2.5 at concentrations much lower than n-alkanes. The n-alkanals were the most abundant compounds amongst the aliphatic carbonyls, accounting for 65.4% on average of the total mass of aliphatic carbonyls. For the non-haze days, it seems likely that the OH oxidation of n-alkanes was a source of carbonyl compounds, whereas vehicle exhaust makes a significant contribution to the n-alkanes and n-alkanals, but makes a much smaller contribution to the n-alkan-2-ones and n-alkan-3-ones. It appears that primary sources are likely to be a major contributor to concentrations of the high molecular weight carbonyl compounds during the haze episodes, probably deriving from coal combustion. In addition, furanones (gamma-lac-tones) and phytone (6, 10, 14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one) were also detected in our samples and are oxidation products of hydrocarbons and a marker of biogenic input, respectively. Cooking emissions also appear to be a likely contributor to the furanones. This study provides new information on the profiles of PM2.5-associated aliphatic hydrocarbons and carbonyl compounds, and gives insights into their sources. Differences in the concentrations and ratios of carbonyl compounds between Beijing and London are discussed.

AB This work reports the first statistical analysis of multi-annual data on tropospheric aerosols from the German Ultrafine Aerosol Network (GUAN). Compared to other networks worldwide, GUAN with 17 measurement locations has the most sites equipped with particle number size distribution (PNSD) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) instruments and the most site categories in Germany ranging from city street/roadside to High Alpine. As we know, the variations of eBC and particle number concentration (PNC) are influenced by several factors such as source, transformation, transport and deposition. The dominant controlling factor for different pollutant parameters might be varied, leading to the different spatio-temporal variations among the measured parameters. Currently, a study of spatio-temporal variations of PNSD and eBC considering the influences of both site categories and spatial scale is still missing. Based on the multi-site dataset of GUAN, the goal of this study is to investigate how pollutant parameters may interfere with spatial characteristics and site categories.

AB With the stringent emission control measures implemented in recent years, the overall air quality in China has been improved greatly. However, high ozone (O-3) concentrations have become a more and more severe air pollution issue in the rapidly developing Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. The 90th percentile of O-3-8 h concentration in the YRD region increased from 144 mu g/m(3) in 2013 to 168 mu g/m(3) in 2017. To investigate the sources of O-3 within the YRD region, we use a tagged-species method in the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) called Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) to quantify O-3 contributions by source regions and sectors in Spring, Summer and Fall. We find that the O-3 pollution in Shanghai, southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang is caused by the joint effect of local to regional precursor emissions combined with super-regional O-3 transport. However, these contributions vary among seasons and pollution events. Super regional transport is the major contributor to average O-3 concentration while local and upwind adjacent area contributions can dominate during high O-3 concentration episodes. Source sector analysis indicates that industry and vehicle emissions are major anthropogenic sources. Within the industrial sector, power plants, boilers, and petroleum industry are the top three contributors. Reducing super-regional O-3 transport is of the most importance to lowering the O-3 background but local to regional precursor emission reductions are also of great significance to control O-3 episodes with collaboration at the regional level offering potential for synergistic benefits to adjacent cities.

AB The depositional fluxes of Be-7 and Pb-210 were measured at Mangalore (12.82 degrees N, 74.92 degrees E) on the South West Coast region, which is one of the highest rainfall regions in India. This region receives pristine air masses from the Southern Indian Ocean (oceanic) and polluted air from Asia (continental). The activity concentration for individual rain events collected during the monsoon season varied between 0.15 and 4.3 Bq L-1 (with geometric mean, GM = 1.1 Bq L-1, geometric standard deviation, GSD = 2.6) and 0.01-0.71 Bq L-1 (GM = 0.12 Bq L-1, GSD = 2.8) for Be-7 and Pb-210, respectively. The GM value for monthly (dry period) Be-7 and Pb-210 concentrations in air were 6.9 mBq m(-3) (GSD = 1.3) and 1.2 mBq m(-3) (GSD = 2.1), respectively. The dry deposition flux of Be-7 varied in the range of 0.081-0.184 Bq m(-2) d(-1) (GM = 0.12 Bq m(-2) d(-1), GSD = 1.3) and that of Pb-210 varied in the range of 0.026-0.293 Bq m(-2) d(-1) (GM = 0.11 Bq M-2 d(-1), GSD = 1.8). The GM value of the wet deposition flux of Be-7 was higher by two orders of magnitude when compared with that of the dry deposition flux, whereas, that in the case of Pb-210 it was higher by an order of magnitude. The mean annual deposition fluxes of Be-7 and Pb-210 were 2026 Bq m(-2) y(-1) and 221 Bq m(-2) y(-1), respectively. The large variability observed in the wet deposition fluxes was attributed to the large variations in the intensity of the rainfall. The wet deposition velocities of the aerosols, estimated based on the concentrations of these radionuclides in air and their corresponding deposition fluxes, were found to be 6.8 cm s(-1) for Be-7 and 6.5 cm s(-1) for Pb-210, Although the two radionuclides originate from distinct sources, a strong positive correlation was observed between the temporal variability of their deposition fluxes. In addition to this, a high degree of correlation was observed between the deposition fluxes of both Be-7 and Pb-210 and rainfall. This points at the dominating effect of scavenging by rainfall in controlling their fluxes.

AB This study concerned a 25 yr continuous record of bulk precipitation and throughfall composition in a medium-altitude forested environment. The 1986-2012 survey from the more intense acid rain period in the mid-eighties until the present allowed the quantification of the interaction between atmospheric deposition and vegetation and the long-term evolution following pollutant emission trends.
   The long-term monitoring evidenced some significant temporal trends (pH, conductivity, SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+). Significant decreases in the concentrations and fluxes of several ions were observed (H+ and SO42-, Cl-, and Ca2+) in open field precipitation and throughfalls. The regular and strong decrease in protons and sulfate followed the decreases in anthropogenic SO2 and NOx (proton precursors) since the 1980s. The decrease in Cl- concentrations was weaker and could have been related to the regional reduction in HCl emissions and/or to changes in the precipitation regime. The annual calcium fluxes were reduced from approximately 15 to 9 and 6 to 2 kg ha(-1) under spruces and beeches, respectively, as a consequence of reductions in anthropogenic industrial dust. In such calcium-limited resource soils, the atmospheric Ca flux exceeded the Ca flux from mineral weathering and was highly bioavailable for vegetation growth. This decrease in nutrient input had strong consequences for soil nutrients and may thus have participated in forest decline.
   The two tree plantations had contrasting effects on the physico-chemical parameters of the incoming precipitation with higher water interception and chemical concentrations under spruces than under beeches, which underlined the role of tree species in atmospheric inputs to soils. The structure and persistence of spruce needles enhanced the capture of particles and water, accentuating the acidity of the deposition and leading to the intensification of acidification processes, nutrient leaching in soils and forest decline. In contrast, beech leaves were able to neutralize a portion of the atmospheric protons, which minimized and reduced the negative effects of acid rain. In addition, the throughfalls represented an important part of the biological cycle of trees for some elements such as K or N, as indicated by the contrasting patterns at year and long-term scales regarding the vegetation type. However, our study indicated that the influence of tree species might change over time with changes in atmospheric pollution, in precipitation regime, or in stand structure.
   This study outlined the importance of the long-term record of open field precipitation and throughfalls under various tree types to better evaluate the real inputs of elements to forest ecosystems and among them, essential mineral nutrients.

AB Our previous study illustrated that the operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) combined products (denoted as DTB0) are not always the best in most regions due to its unsuitable merge approach. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an improved merge approach to increase the spatiotemporal data coverage and reduce the estimation uncertainty. For this, three tests, i.e., a land-use-type test, a surface-relief test, and an aerosol-type test are performed according to the strengths and weakness of the performances of the DT and DB algorithms with their high-quality assurance retrievals (QA = 3 for DT and QA >= 2 for DB) against the newest Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 measurements. Based on this, new merged DT and DB products (denoted as DTB1) are generated. The Terra and Aqua DTB1 products are then validated against AERONET measurements at 286 sites on site, continental, and global scales, and for varying underlying surfaces and elevated terrains from 2013 to 2017. The DTB0 products for the same period are collected for comparison. More than 90% of the sites now have more data points, and the performances of the DTB1 products are improved with an increased percentage of the data falling within the expected error [+/- (0.05 + 15%)] envelope and reduced mean absolute errors and root-mean-square errors compared with DTB0 products at most sites. Separate- and equal-number comparisons show that the DTB1 products significantly improve both the data coverage and data quality. The new merged products are more accurate and less affected by varying surface structures than the operational products. These results suggest that the improved merge approach is more robust and can be used for generating more accurate global aerosol products.

AB Urban green spaces function as biological filters in reducing atmospheric particles. Yet there is a profound requisite to identify the most effective plant species by their leaf traits that can enhance particle capture and improve ambient air quality. In this study, we investigated leaves of 96 perennial urban plant species consisting of 43 deciduous broadleaf trees, 32 deciduous broadleaf shrubs, 14 deciduous and evergreen needle/scale-like, 5 evergreen broadleaves, and 2 climber species for their differences in net particle accumulation. Leaf saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), a proxy for traffic and industry induced particle accumulation, along with morphological and anatomical leaf traits were analyzed in a common garden experiment in June and September 2016. Leaf SIRM varied significantly between plant species. The most effective net particle accumulating plant species with a median value of 23.0 mu A were Buddleja davidii, Viburnum opulus, Carpinus betulus, Quercus ilex, Viburnum lantana, Rosa rugosa, Sorbus aria, Aesculus hippocastanum, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Acer campestre. The least effective net particle accumulating plant species with a median value of 10.4 mu A were Populus alba, Alms glutinosa, Larix kaempferi, Larix decidua, Plantanus x acerilifolia, Acer pseudoplatanus, Robinia pseudoacacia, Quercus palustris, Rosa canina, Liquidambar styraciflua. The "variable importance" in net particle accumulation for the investigated plant species was achieved using (R) randomForest. The presence of leaf trichomes and specific leaf area were identified as important leaf traits for categorization of the selected plant species in low, medium, and high net particle accumulators. The extensive analysis of plant species at leaf-level with distinct micro-morphology contributes to a better understanding of plant species behavior in net particle capture and their contribution in reducing atmospheric particulate matter. Furthermore, this study has practical implications for policymakers in making informed choices when planning urban green infrastructures. Lastly, our study can become a basis to validate atmospheric deposition model using species-specific information.

AB New particle formation (NPF) events are important phenomena that generate nanoparticles and even fine particles via gas-to-particle conversion. These events have clear effects on aerosol loading, atmospheric chemistry and global climate. Long-term field measurements were used to characterize aerosol size distributions and to examine the role of atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in NPF events in the urban environment of Shanghai. Aitken and accumulation particles are dominant and account for 85-95% of the total particles, whereas coarse particles are negligible. Particles in the four size-models show the same seasonality: highest in winter and lowest in autumn. The mean particle size distributions display different patterns of diurnal fluctuation, including bimodal in spring and winter, tri-modal in autumn, and "banana" shaped in summer due to highly frequent NPF events. The geometric mean diameter (GMD) is often 20-30 nm or 40-60 nm. Overall, NPF events occur on 89 days out of 335 measurement days (26.5%), and the newly formed particles have a mean growth rate of 6.28 nm h(-1). Two typical anthropogenic aromatics, benzene and toluene, from traffic emissions closely match the occurrence of NPF events and have a weakly positive correlation with the nucleation particle number concentrations, The enhanced VOCs as precursors of organic vapors may contribute to the growth process of NPF events to some extent (e.g., growth rate) so that newly formed particles can grow into a detectable size.

AB This study investigated the influence of holiday characteristics and numbers of vacation days on the "holiday effect" of three crucial Chinese holidays in Taipei. Surface measurements of NOx, CO, NMHC, O-3, SO2, and PM10 from 13 air quality-monitoring stations of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) in the Taipei metropolitan area during holiday and non-holiday periods of 1994-2012 were used.
   All six pollutants were proven to exhibit holiday effects between Chinese New Year (CNY) and non-Chinese New Year (NCNY) periods. However, almost all pollutants exhibited holiday effects for the two other holidays; the exceptions were O-3 between Tomb Sweeping Day (TSD) and non-Tomb Sweeping Day (NTSD) periods and CO and P-10 between Mid-Autumn Day (MAD) and non-Mid-Autumn Day (NMAD) periods. Air pollutants, including NOx, CO, NMHC, SO2, and PM10, that exhibited holiday effects had consistently lower concentrations in holiday periods than in non-holiday periods, whereas O-3 concentrations were higher in holiday periods than in non-holiday periods. A widespread holiday effect with consistent signs indicates a high degree of urbanization in the study area. Compared with CNY-NCNY and MAD-NMAD periods, the TSD-NTSD period had a considerably lower difference of the titration effect, lower NOx resulting in less ozone destruction, in evening traffic hours and an inconsistent holiday effect in the daytime and nighttime, leading to the lack of O-3 holiday effect. Because the MAD period had more nighttime activities than the other two holiday periods did, the MAD-NMAD period lacked CO and PM10 holiday effects. The prevalently higher ratios of CO, NMHC, SO2, and PM10 relative to NOx as a proxy of mobile sources and a lower PMz(2.5)/PM10 ratio in the MAD period than in the CNY and TSD periods indicate different pollution sources oriented from holiday activities.
   The air pollutants exhibited a weakening trend are all associated with a greater improvement in air quality during the non-holiday periods than the holiday periods, which implies successful air pollution control policies. Holiday effects of NOx, NMHC (p < 0.05), and CO (p < 0.10) are associated with mobile sources; the holiday effects for the three holidays tend to have a strong relation with the number of vacation days in a holiday, indicating that a large reduction of air pollution occurs when a holiday has a high number of vacation days, which probably encourages extensive behavioral changes. Moreover, the aforementioned conditions imply that air pollution control strategies are effective with time; pollution reduction for only 1-2 days may fail to improve ambient air quality. Holiday effects of pollutants emitted during long holiday periods have crucial implications in formulating ozone control strategies in Taiwan and in other countries with similar national or cultural holidays.

AB Odor monitoring plays a crucial role in implementing suitable odor mitigation strategies at composting plants. Odor activity value (OAV) analysis is an instrumental-based approach that could simplify and reduce costs of odor monitoring by dynamic olfactometry; yet, the relationship between both methodologies has not been fully explored. In this study, the OAV feasibility to predict odor concentration (CC in OUE m(-3)) was assessed during the active composting phase of six solid wastes and three digestates at pilot scale. To this end, 92 gas samples were analyzed by analytical methods (i.e., GC/MS) and dynamic olfactometry (EN 13725). For 22 quantified odorants, OAV was calculated as the ratio of a compounds chemical concentration to its corresponding odor detection threshold (ODT). OAVs were then correlated to OC by simple linear and partial least squares (PLS) regressions. The sum of all OAVs in the gas samples (OAV(sum)) and the maximum OAV (OAV(max)) yielded moderately strong linear correlations against OC (R-2: 0.67-0.73), thus providing overall insight into OC trend along composting. A PLS model consisting of weighted OAVs of 10 odorants enhanced OC predictions. OAVs explained from 76% to 74% of the OC variance throughout the PLS model validation. Furthermore, OC values regressed by the PLS model were less underestimated (7%) than those predicted by OAV(max) and OAV(max) (11-13%). Based on results from the OAV(max) and PIS regression analysis, hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, di-methyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide were highlighted as the major odor contributors during composting of organic substrates.

AB Methanesulfonate, an important oxidation product of dimethyl sulfide, is abundant in marine aerosol particles. However, its impact on the cloud condensation nucleation (CCN) activity of marine aerosol is yet to be elucidated, largely because the CCN activity of methanesulfonate has been seldom investigated. In this work, we measured the CCN activities of three common methanesulfonates, and the single hygroscopicity parameters (kappa) were determined to be 0.46 +/- 0.02 for sodium methanesulfonate (NaMS), 0.37 +/- 0.01 for calcium methanesulfonate, and 0.47 +/- 0.02 for potassium methanesulfonate, respectively. In addition, we explored the effect of NaMS on the CCN activities of NaCl and synthetic sea salt. It was found that if presented with a mass ratio of 1:1, NaMS would significantly reduce the CCN activities of NaCl and sea salt, and the K values of binary mixtures could be estimated using the simple mixing rule. Nevertheless, if only presented with a mass ratio of 1:10 (an environmentally relevant value), the effect of NaMS on the CCN activities of NaCl and sea salt was found to be small. Overall, we conclude that from our experimental data and its levels found in the troposphere, methanesulfonate may only have minor impacts on the CCN activity of marine aerosol.

AB The reaction mechanisms of the benzyl peroxy radical (PhCH2O2) with NO, NO2, HO2, and self-reaction in atmosphere, were studied by the quantum chemistry calculations at the cam-B3LYP/dgtzvp and CCSD(T)/CBS levels of theory. The predominant products of the PhCH2O2 + NO reaction were predicted to be PhCHO, NO2 and PhCH2ONO2 with certain amount of HONO, where the proportion of HONO is probably pressure dependent. PhCH2O2NO2, with thermal stability close to that of general alkylperoxy nitrates, is formed by the recombination of PhCH2O2 and NO2, whose reverse reaction is most favorable for PhCH2O2NO2 dissociation. The PhCH2O2+ HO2 reaction will mainly form PhCH2O2H and O-2 by hydrogen abstraction via a hydrogen bonded complex on the triplet potential energy surface. Meanwhile, this reaction on the singlet potential energy surface is also feasible under atmospheric condition. A newfound compound, dibenzyl tetroxide (PhCH2O4CH2Ph) formed from the dimerization of PhCH2O2, was 11.11 kcal/mol more stable than two PhCH2O2 radicals. The pathway of PhCH2O4CH2Ph leading to two PhCH2O radicals and an O-3(2) molecule is the most favorable exit channel, in which O-3(2) can abstract a hydrogen atom from anyone of both PhCH2O radicals to produce PhCHO and HO2, and HO2 then transfers the hydrogen atom to the other PhCH2O to form PhCH2OH with certain probability. The reaction of PhCH2O radical with O-2 in atmosphere is the most probable pathway, which produces PhCHO and HO2. However, as the concentration of PhCH2O is adequate, the self-bimolecular reaction of PhCH2O forming PhCH2O2CH2Ph, PhCHO and PhCH2OH may also be important. The reaction mechanisms of this study are in good accordance with the reported experimental observations.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have an important influence on the formation of photochemical smog and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In this paper, we investigated 104 VOCs in Heshan from 22 October to 22 November 2014 to identify the sources and abatement mechanisms of VOCs in southern China. Weather conditions, species correlations, daytime and nighttime abatement mechanisms, secondary pollutant transformations, air-mass origins and source apportionments were studied. During the observation period, the average concentration of VOCs in the atmosphere of Heshan was 61.0 +/- 35.5 ppbv, and the wind speed played a pivotal role in the diffusion and dilution of VOCs. The study on the rates of OH, O-3 and NO3 radicals found that alkenes, aromatics, hydrocarbons and carbonyl compounds were the most active volatile organic compounds in Heshan. For alkanes, alkynes, and aromatics, removal is determined by their reactions with OH radicals. For highly reactive alkenes and styrene, nighttime removal via O-3 and NO3 radicals was also significant. The backward-trajectory cluster analysis of air masses indicated that pollution mainly derived from the east-northeast. The paint solvent usage, paint solvent usage + liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage, biomass burning, coal burning + industrial combustion sources, gasoline vehicle exhaust, diesel vehicle exhaust, industrial sources, and fuel evaporation (gasoline) contributed 11%, 22%, 13%, 17%, 12%, 8%, 11%, and 6% to VOCs during the observation period, respectively.

   emissions; E10; MTBE; Evaporative emissions; Mexico air quality;
   NOM-016; MOVES-Mexico
AB Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from vehicles are a significant contributor to Mexico's pollution, as a precursor to both ambient ozone and secondary particulate matter (PM). Recent updates to Mexico's gasoline specification NOM-016 allow ethanol blends up to 10 percent (E10) outside of the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, and leave open the possibility of allowing E10 within these areas as well. The NOM-016 updates also permit E10 to have higher volatility (RVP) than previously allowed. The impact of these changes on vehicle emissions in Mexico was assessed, with a focus on evaporative VOC emissions driven by increased RVP and permeation. Roadside remote sensing (RSD) measurements from Mexico City were analyzed, finding that vehicle fleet hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are much higher than U.S. levels, with indication that high evaporative emissions contribute to this. The impact on vehicle emissions of the NOM-016 revisions and potential introduction of E10 in metropolitan zones was assessed for an ozone episode day using the MOVES-Mexico model, which reflects higher evaporative emissions from Mexico's vehicle fleet. Results show an increase in total motor vehicle VOC emissions of 13-18 percent in metropolitan areas and a 23 percent increase in other areas of the country for NOM-016 compliant E10 fuel, relative to fuel sold in Mexico prior to the NOM-016 update. Results for other pollutants showed an increase in PM2.5 and air toxics from E10 blends, a reduction in CO, and NOx impacts mixed depending on area. Total motor vehicle emissions for toluene, identified in prior work as the compound with the highest ozone forming potential in Mexico City, increased by 29-34 percent with E10 fuel in Mexico City and more in other metropolitan areas. Past studies linking emissions change with health outcomes in Mexico City suggest that the increase in vehicle emissions from NOM-016 updates would have a measurable negative effect on premature mortality, chronic bronchitis, hospital visits, and restricted activity days, with societal costs associated with health care and lost productivity.

AB Radon measurements were performed in Huelva, a city located near a phosphogypsum repository in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula, between March 2015 and March 2016. The mean values of this gas oscillate between 5.6 and 10.9 Bq m(-3) and maximum ranges between 36.4 and 53.4 Bq m(-3). Radon shows the expected monthly variation with higher levels in November and December. Typical daily evolutions were also observed, with maximum between 06:00 and 08:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and minimum around noon. To extract daily radon patterns, the cluster technique of K-means was applied. Based on this classification, four different case study periods were analyzed in detail, describing two events with high radon levels and two with low radon. Local meteorology, back-trajectories computed with the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model and meteorological fields from the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model, were used to analyze the four case study periods selected. Low radon periods are characterized by the occurrence of non-pure breezes and maritime air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, whereas high radon periods occur under pure sea-land breezes affected by Mediterranean air masses. Factors such as meteorology or local emission sources alone may not be enough to explain the high radon events in the area. Other factors could be playing a major role in the radon levels. The obtained results indicate the contribution of radon transported from medium-long range, suggesting that, under specific weather conditions, the Gulf of Cadiz could act as a radon trap and the continental areas around the Western Mediterranean Basin could act as a radon source.

AB The accuracy of atmospheric chemical mechanisms used in air quality models is critical for robustly predicting the production and decay of air pollutants and developing strategies to reduce concentrations that are above levels harmful to humans and ecosystems. In this study we document, evaluate and analyze an application of the CB6r3 chemical mechanism in a 3-D air quality model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and demonstrate the impact of this updated chemical mechanism on predictions of ozone, oxidized nitrogen and formaldehyde. In general, CMAQ-CB6 slightly improves the predictions of ozone over much of the dynamic range, while providing updates that are more consistent with current scientific understanding. For these reasons, CMAQ-CB6 is recommended in place of earlier versions available in CMAQ. Nitric acid is generally overpredicted in both winter and summer, and ongoing work continues to address this overprediction and update other aspects of the mechanism.

AB Urban parks have long been considered places of refuge from the bustle, noise and pollutants of the surrounding city. Parks were labelled the lungs of the city, a metaphor which gained support as studies revealed the deposition of pollutants to leaf surfaces. More recently air purification by urban vegetation came to be seen as an ecosystem service, that add to the other important services it provides. However, the significance of deposition to foliage in reducing air pollutant concentrations in cities and the service this provides is often questioned. Although pollutants deposit on vegetation, the change in turbulence and wind speed brought about by increased friction can often limit dispersion and means that pollutant concentrations can be higher than expected. This paper re-analyses pollutant transects away from roads and into parks to compare the relevance of deposition and dispersion to lowered concentrations in park interiors and shows that pollutant concentrations typically decline more rapidly along transects with vegetation than those without. This may support the notion that deposition to vegetation rapidly reduces pollutant concentrations, but simulations using ENVI-MET reveal that even dense foliage offers little improvement to air quality via removal of pollutants in small urban parks with length scale less than 100 m. New field observations show the dominance of aerodynamic factors in changing air quality in urban parks and the way vegetation affects pollutant concentrations through altering air flows. Deposition is generally not important for parks although it plays a role in the rapid removal of large particles with rapid settling velocities (> 10 cm s(-1)) at the park borders (< 5 m). Across cities as a whole rarely more than a percent or so of individual pollutants are removed by urban vegetation. Deposition on foliage is not an important contribution to improved air quality. Vegetation can alter the dispersion of pollutants from roads into parks and effectively increase pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless stands of trees or flower beds can affect the distribution of park users, so may change exposure to air pollutants by altering the spatial distribution of occupants.

AB Atmospheric pollutants are deposited onto the landscape as either wet or dry deposition. However, traditional monitoring methods can be expensive; moss biomonitoring offers an efficient and simpler tool to evaluate regional patterns in atmospheric deposition. This study carried out a spatial analysis of metal deposition within a region in northwestern British Columbia dominated by emissions associated with aluminium smelting. In total 61 sites were sampled for the moss Hylocomium splendens. Tissues were analyzed for 13 metals (Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and Pb). The concentrations of four metals, i.e., Al, V, Ni and Pb, were significantly correlated with each other and with modelled sulphur deposition. Moreover, these metals were elevated above background concentrations, suggesting that 30% of study sites (covering and area of 20 km north and 10 km south of the smelter) were impacted by smelter emissions. Tissue concentrations of Mn in Hylocomium splendens should be used cautiously, as results suggested that they did not accurately reflect atmospheric deposition. In addition to the traditional wider-scale surveys, moss biomonitoring can be used to efficiently evaluate regional patterns in atmospheric metal deposition associated with industrial emissions sources.

AB The 5-year (2011-2015) spaceborne lidar CALIOP (cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization) data were aggregated to obtain a seasonal three-dimensional (3-D) distribution of aerosols over the Northern Pacific (NP). Superior to the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product, which provided only the bulk Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), the vertical high-resolution Aerosol Extinction Coefficient (AEC) obtained from the CALIOP product enabled us to determine the AOD for the prescribed layers. By integrating the AEC at the prescribed height interval, the AOD beneath and above 2 km was obtained to characterize the aerosol loading in the surface layer (SL) and the free troposphere (FT), respectively. The AOD in the SL and FT present different seasonal variation patterns over the NP. The SL AOD exhibited the highest level in the winter, which was caused by sea salt emissions driven by the strongest winds. However, a much higher FT AOD occurred over the NP in the springtime compared with that of other seasons, indicating that the most significant transpacific transport occurred in the springtime, mainly in the FT. Fine resolution aerosol distributions in cross section along a transpacific direction were extracted from the CALIOP product as well. Along the cross section, aerosol loading was most abundant below 2 km for all the seasons. However, the detectable aerosol layer may extend to 10 kin high in the springtime, which is much higher than that in the other seasons, and the aerosol layers below and above 2 km were separated over the remote NP. The CALIOP data demonstrated that dust plays a role in aloft aerosol transport. In terms of aerosol transport in the FT, an 8-fold decrease in the FT AOD occurred during the journey from East Asia to the Eastern Pacific in the summer, which was the sharpest decrease compared with the smallest one, which has 3-fold decrease occurred in the spring. Aerosol transport in the FT contributed 19% of the AOD over western North America (NA) in the spring, which was much higher than that in other seasons, and the aloft aerosol transport between 2 and 4 kin high corresponded to a fine PM concentration of 1-2 mu g m(-3) as a contributor to air quality over western NA.

AB Gasoline emissions are the largest source of urban atmospheric VOCs, which are critical precursors of ozone (O-3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Besides vehicle exhaust, emissions from gasoline evaporation also have a potentially significant effect on SOA formation. However, there are still few studies on the relationship between gasoline vapor composition and SOA formation, especially for gasoline in China. In this study, SOA formation from three unburned gasoline vapors were investigated in a 30 m(3) indoor smog chamber. The experimental results showed that with the increase of aromatic content (especially toluene and C2 benzenes) in gasoline from 23% to 50%, the SOA yield was significantly enhanced by a factor of 4.0-6.7. This phenomenon might be related to the higher amounts of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) formed, which promoted the gas-particle partitioning and SOA formation. Additionally, the synergistic effects between precursors in the mixtures might also be a key factor, which could be supported by the higher SOA yield accompanied by a higher ratio of toluene/benzene. Meanwhile, there were more oxygenated organic aerosols (OOA) observed when using high-aromatic gasoline. This work will help in understanding the effect of aromatic content or gasoline quality on the SOA formation from gasoline evaporation emissions, and in providing the scientific basis for taking corresponding control measures to relieve haze events in China.

AB The United States has experienced substantial air pollutant emissions reductions in the last two decades. Among others, emissions produced by electricity generation plants and industries were significantly lowered. Ultralow (< 15 ppm) sulfur fuels were introduced for road vehicles, nonroad, rail, and maritime transport. New heavy-duty diesel trucks have been equipped with particle traps and NOx controls. Residual oil (No. 6) for space heating and for any other purpose was replaced with cleaner No. 2 and No. 4 oils. Chemical speciation of PM2.5 has been measured since 2005 at eight sites across the New York State. A prior study has identified and apportioned the major sources of PM2.5 across the State using receptor modelling (positive matrix factorization). This present study aims to investigate the long-term trends of those source-apportioned PM2.5 mass contributions from 2005 to 2016 at the eight sites: two rural sites (Pinnacle and Whiteface), three medium sized cities (Buffalo, Albany, Rochester), and three sites in the New York City metropolitan area (Bronx, Manhattan and Queens). Negative trends from 2005 to 2016 were detected across the state for secondary sulfate (from -0.19 mu g/m(3)/y in Rochester to -0.36 mu g/m(3)/y at BRO and QUE) and secondary nitrate (from -0.02 mu g/m(3)/y at the rural sites to approximately -0.2 mu g/m(3)/y at BRO and MAN). Spark-ignition vehicles were the only source type experiencing upward annual trends at all urban sites with slopes ranging from 0.02 mu g/m(3)/y (ROC, not statistically significant) to similar to 0.2 mu g/m(3)/y (Albany, Bronx, Manhattan). Other sources exhibited different trends among the sites. The relationships of source contributions with emissions inventories were explored with regression analysis. A new trajectory model, differential concentration-weighted trajectories (DCWT), was used to examine spatial changes in sources of secondary aerosol affecting the rural sites.

AB With a rapid increase in air traffic, aviation has become an increasingly important contributor to anthropogenic air pollutants (particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx)) over China. This study provides the first overall estimation of the aviation emissions from all civil airports in mainland China as well as the associated contribution to ambient air quality. First, aircraft emissions (NOx, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydro-carbons (HC), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), volatile organic carbons (VOCs) and black carbon (BC)) during landing and take-off cycles (below 3 km) are estimated for both recent (2000-2016) and future (2020) scenarios. Second, the corresponding environmental impacts are measured by the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx). The results have insightful policy implications for China's aviation planning. (1) Generally, China's aviation emissions and their effect on air quality have been and will continue to increase. (2) Among species, NOx dominated China's aircraft emissions in terms of both emission amount and environmental impact, while PM2.5 generated an extensive influence. (3) With respect to spatial distribution, the air quality effect was highly concentrated at emission-intense airports that served economic zones and/or tourist spots.

AB Many people live, work and spend time during their commute in near-road environments (< 50 m) where pollutant concentrations usually remain high. We investigated the influence of roadside green infrastructure (GI) on concentrations of particulate matters <= 10 mu m (PM10), <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), <= 1 mu m (PM1), black carbon (BC) and particle number concentrations (PNC) under three GI configurations - (i) hedges only, (ii) trees only, and (iii) a mix of trees and hedges/shrubs-separately in close (< 1 m) and away (> 2 m) road conditions. These configurations gave us a total of six different real-world scenarios for evaluation. The changes in concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, BC and PNC at all six sites were estimated by comparing simultaneous measurements behind and in front of GI (or adjacent clear area). A portable battery-operated experimental set-up was designed for measuring the pollutant concentrations for 30 full days over a field campaign period of three months. On each day, around 10 h of continuous data were recorded simultaneously behind and in front of GI/adjacent clear area, capturing both morning and evening traffic peaks. Our objectives were to: (i) assess the effectiveness of different types of GI in reducing various pollutants; (ii) evaluate the impact of wind directions and density of vegetation on reducing different pollutant concentrations behind GI; (iii) investigate the changes in fractional composition of sub-micron (PM1), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles; and (iv) quantify the elemental composition of collected particles before and after the GI. In away-road conditions, all three configurations showed reductions behind the GI for all pollutants. The 'hedges only' configuration showed higher pollutant reductions than the other two configurations, with maximum reductions of up to 63% shown for BC. In close-road conditions, the results were mixed. The 'trees only' configuration reported increases in most of the pollutant concentrations, whereas the combination of trees and hedges resulted in reduced pollutant concentrations behind the GI. Among all pollutants, the highest relative changes in concentration were observed for BC (up to 63%) and lowest for PM2.5 (14%). Categorising the data based on wind directions showed the highest reduction during along-road wind conditions (i.e., parallel to the road). This was expected due to the sweeping of emissions by the wind and the wake of road vehicles whilst the barrier effect of GI enhanced this cleansing, limiting lateral diffusion of the pollutants. However, cross-road winds that took vehicular emissions to pass through the GI allowed us to assess their influence, showing up to 52, 15, 17, 31 and 30% reduction for BC, PM10, PM2.5, PM1 and PNC, respectively. The largest reductions were consistently noted for the mixed 'trees and hedges' configuration in close-road conditions and the 'hedge only' configuration in away-road conditions. The assessment of various fractions of PM showed that 'hedges only' and a combination of trees and hedges lowered fine particles behind GI. The SEM-EDS analysis indicated the dominance of natural particles (50%) and a reduction in vehicle-related particles (i.e., iron and its oxides, Ba, Cr, Mn) behind GI when compared with the in-front/adjacent clear area.
   The evidence contributed by this work enhances our understanding of air quality modifications under the influence of different GI configurations, for multiple pollutants. In turn, this will support the formulation of appropriate guidelines for GI design, to reduce the air pollution exposure of those living, working or travelling near busy roads.

AB New particle formation (NPF) and growth is an important phenomenon in terms of the global particle number concentrations. However, our knowledge about NPF events at the top of the boundary layer is particularly weak in heavily polluted conditions. In this study, the aerosol size distributions, black carbon (BC), chemical components of single particles, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and meteorological data were collected from May 12 to June 8, 2017 at the summit of Mt. Tai by using a wide-range particle spectrometer (WPS), Aethalometer (AE-33), a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), a beta-ray continuous ambient particulate monitor and an automatic weather station. Twelve new particle growth (NPG) events occurred during the observation period, accounting for 46.2% of the total observation days. The average relative humidity (RH) was 52% on NPF days and was 11.5% lower than the value on non-NPG days. The average temperature and wind speed were 18 degrees C and 5.3 m s(-1) on NPG days, respectively, which were 12.2% and 18.9% higher than those on non-NPG days. The PM2.5 concentration differed slightly on NPG and non-NPG days. However, the concentrations of PM10 and BC were relatively high on NPG days, with average values of 88.0 mu g m(-3) and 1849.9 ng m(-3), respectively, which were 1.2 and 1.3 times higher than those on non-NPG days. The NPG events had major influences on the size distributions of aerosol number concentration at 10-60 nm and surface area concentrations at 100-300 nm. During the NPG events, the average formation rate (FR), growth rate (GR), condensational sink (CS), vapor source rate (Q) and condensing vapor concentration (C) were calculated to be 1.30 cm(-3) s(-1), 14.54 nm h(-1), 3.21 x 10(-2) s(-1), 7.34 x 10(6) cm(-3) s(-1) and 19.92 x 10(7) cm(-3), respectively. The NPG events were influenced mostly by foreign transport processes and less impacted by local surrounding pollutants. The meteorological factors varied with different types of NPG events. The chemical components varied greatly during different types of NPG events. Sulfate had a small influence on three types of NPG events. Nitrate and ammonium had comparatively great impacts on local and southerly transport NPG events. The organic matters contributed more significantly to the northerly transport NPG events.

AB Daily atmospheric concentrations of benzene, measured during the years 2008-2012 in 11 European cities, were analyzed in terms of atmospheric circulation. Benzene levels in central continental Europe and Northern Europe were clearly enhanced by extended anticyclones located over North West Russia (NWR), whereas weak gradient conditions, which are associated with light winds, were connected with the degradation of air quality across Southern Europe due to recirculation of polluted air. The calculated Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) indicated potential health risks for humans due to the inhalation of benzene at all areas, whilst not recommendable ILCR values were detected at all traffic sites. The estimated ILCR was also allocated in the produced atmospheric circulation regimes, based on an approach which took into account the average benzene concentration corresponding to each synoptic pattern along with its frequency of occurrence. Synoptic regimes associated with increased benzene levels commonly accounted for large fractions of the total risk however in some cases the impact of highly polluted atmospheric regimes on ILCR was reduced, due to the lack of appearance of these atmospheric circulation types.

AB Agricultural soils are a dominant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). A clear understanding of N2O emission from fruit cropping systems is urgently needed to improve the global budget and establish mitigation options. The primary aims of this study were to (i) quantify the variations in N2O emissions from fruit orchards, (ii) evaluate the major controls of N2O emissions, and (iii) discuss potential mitigation strategies across climates, soil types and field managements. We summarized 123 determinations of N2O emissions under perennial fruit trees from peer-reviewed publications from 1997 to 2019, with measurement periods covering at least one whole growing season. Cumulative N2O emissions ranged widely from -0.116-26 kg N ha(-1) per year or growing season and increased linearly with nitrogen (N) fertilizer input rates on a global basis (r(2) = 0.39, p < 0.001). Climate and form of N fertilizers also contributed to the large variability. In particular, tropical orchards should be a priority for N2O management because they display a large emission factor (approximately 2% of applied fertilizer N). A meta-analysis revealed that the application of nitrification inhibitors significantly reduced N2O emissions by 73% on average (95% confidence intervals: -87% to -51%). The effects of mulching and cover cropping were not significant, mostly depending on the mulch material and species of cover crop along with the management of cropping, which modified the availability of soil water and nutrients. More measurements are highly needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation options across diverse experimental environments.

AB Recently, Haze-fog as an atmospheric phenomenon associated with high level of air pollutant has negative impacts on human health and environment, which arises the society attention. This paper is aimed at investigating the haze-fog dispersion in the urban environment from the physical view. The wind flow and particle dispersion in the urban environment are simulated by using the Delayed Detached-eddy Simulation (DDES) turbulence model and the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) under the atmospheric boundary layer flow. The results show that the particle dispersion is dominated by the wind flow including the velocity and vortex distribution and the gravity can slightly influence the particle deposition. The particle-empty areas around the buildings are identified during the dispersion and then they disappear gradually mainly through the recirculation function. When the wind direction changes, the blockage cross-section area derived from the building group becomes larger resulting in the larger low wind velocity area. Furthermore, the different reference inlet velocities directly affect the vorticity magnitude and the particle dispersion periods. It Is concluded that the DDES model is a promising approach to simulate the haze-fog physical development in the urban environment.

AB In this study, black carbon (BC) was measured in the northern suburb of Nanjing from January to December 2016 using a seven-channel Aethalometer (AE33). BC sources in different seasons are quantified based on the Aethalometer model. The results indicate that the seasonal average BC concentration is 980 +/- 810 ng/m(3) (the average value +/- the standard deviation), 1062 +/- 986 ng/m(3), 1168 +/- 937 ng/m(3) and 2117 +/- 1549 ng/m(3) during spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The source apportionment results reveal that liquid fuel (e.g., traffic) has higher seasonal contributions (ranging from 70% in autumn to 84% in winter) to total BC concentrations than solid fuels do (e.g., coal and biomass, ranging from 16% in winter to 30% in autumn). The relative contribution of liquid fuel to total BC concentrations was higher in winter and summer, whereas solid fuel has higher contributions in autumn and spring. The diurnal variations in total BC concentrations and the contributions of liquid fuel revealed a major increase during traffic rush hours in all seasons. However, solid fuel has higher contributions to total BC concentrations from 22:00-4:00, particularly during autumn. Meteorological parameters (wind speed and wind direction) provide supportive evidence from BC sources that BC emissions are mainly from local traffic sources and industry coal combustion in the southeast. Moreover, long-range transport from the southwestern regions (mainly Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan) of the sampling site also plays a role in total BC concentrations, especially in autumn and winter. The episodes of high BC concentrations under high wind speed in winter are caused by long-range transport from Hebei and Shandong Provinces. High BC in June is from biomass burning activities in the southeastern region of Nanjing and Zhejiang Province.

AB To comprehensively analyze the characteristics and sources of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Sr, V and Co), urban road dust samples from nine roads were collected in Nanchang, China in September 2013. The average concentrations of above heavy metals were 0.4 (V)-5.4 (Cd) times of their corresponding soil background values. The distribution patterns of Cu, Zn, Sr showed higher values mainly located in the northern and eastern parts of the study area, which indicated heavy metals in polluted industry areas migrated easily to near road dust. Enrichment factors (EFs) indicated that Cd, Cu, Sr, Zn and Pb in the road dust of Nanchang presented enrichment to some extent. Although the concentrations of Cd and Cu in the road dust were much lower than those recorded in urban areas of foreign researches, the highest mean EF of Cd (EF = 9) and the maximum EF of Cu (EF = 30) should be taken into consideration seriously. Based on isotopes source apportionment, Pb was mainly from vehicular traffic and industrial emissions, with the contribution rates of 61% and 26%, respectively, and Sr originated from anthropogenic source and soil source, with contributions of 59.7% and 40.3%, respectively. Based on multivariate statistical analysis, total heavy metals primarily originated from vehicular traffic for 43%, industrial emissions for 29%, soil source for 21%, and unknown sources for 7%, and Pb derived from traffic emissions with mean contribution of 62%, and Sr from soil-derived dust with mean contribution of 58%. The isotope tracing results were in good agreement with the multivariate statistical analysis.

AB The present study uses 18 years (March 2000-May 2017) of satellite-derived relevant parameters to examine the impact of aerosols on cloud properties, radiative fluxes and ACI (aerosol-cloud interaction) over Indian region. The study includes consideration of shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCRF), longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCRF) and net cloud radiative forcing (NetCRF) from CERES (Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System). Also, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud properties such as ice/liquid CER (Cloud Effective Radius), CF (Cloud Fraction), COD (Cloud Optical Depth), CTP (Cloud Top Pressure) and ice/liquid CWP (Cloud Water Path; i.e., ICWP and LCWP) are also considered. Moderate to high aerosol loading and the significant increasing trend of AOD is observed over several parts of Indian region depending upon the seasons. CF is found to be moderate to higher during monsoon months with increasing trend over several parts of the country. Optically thicker high-level clouds have low SWCRF value; whereas, middle-level and low-level clouds have low to moderate SWCRF value. In the majority of cases, Twomey effect is observed whereas in some scenarios Anti-Twomey effect is seen.

AB Black carbon (BC) is a descriptive term that refers to light-absorbing particulate matter (PM) produced by incomplete combustion and is often used as a surrogate for traffic-related air pollution. Exposure to BC has been linked to adverse health effects. Penetration of ambient BC is typically the primary source of indoor BC in the developed world. Other sources of indoor BC include biomass and kerosene stoves, lit candles, and charring food during cooking. Home characteristics can influence the levels of indoor BC. As people spend most of their time indoors, human exposure to BC can be associated to a large extent with indoor environments. At the same time, due to the cost of environmental monitoring, it is often not feasible to directly measure BC inside multiple individual homes in large-scale population-based studies. Thus, a predictive model for indoor BC is needed to support risk assessment in public health. In this study, home characteristics and occupant activities that potentially modify indoor levels of BC were documented in 23 homes, and indoor and outdoor BC concentrations were measured twice. The homes were located in the Cincinnati-Kentucky-Indiana tristate region and measurements occurred from September 2015 through August 2017. A linear mixed-effect model was developed to predict BC concentration in residential environments. The measured outdoor BC concentrations and the documented home characteristics were utilized as predictors of indoor BC concentrations. After the model was developed, a leave-one-out cross-validation algorithm was deployed to assess the predictive accuracy of the output. The following home characteristics and occupant activities significantly modified the concentration of indoor BC: outdoor BC, lit candles and electrostatic or high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Predicted indoor BC concentrations explained 78% of the variability in the measured indoor BC concentrations. The data show that outdoor BC combined with home characteristics can be used to predict indoor BC levels with reasonable accuracy.

AB Biomass burning is a significant process in the Earth system, driving ecosystem dynamics and changes in global vegetation, and affecting the carbon cycle and climate. Projections of future fire activities require an understanding of the connection between fire history and climate in the past. Polar snow/ice contain long-term records of past climates and fire activity and hold great promise to improve our understanding of wildfire patterns. Here, using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques, we quantified three organic compounds (levoglucosan, vanillic, and syringic acids) released by biomass burning in snow samples collected along a 1250-km transect from the coast to the ice sheet summit Dome A in East Antarctica. Results indicate that these tracers are ubiquitous and have reached the ice sheet summit from the continental emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. These compounds showed high levels close to the coastal areas and decreased to a low level on the Antarctic plateau. The snow samples had similar levoglucosan/vanillic acid (similar to 45) and levoglucosan/syringic acid ratios ( similar to 243) as aerosols from biomass burning. Multivariate analysis indicates that these compounds were likely derived from the burning of grasses and evergreen broadleaf trees that are widespread in Southern Hemisphere than from evergreen conifers that dominate northern hemisphere fire-prone ecosystems. Snow accumulation rate influenced the levels of these compounds, while coexisting ions had little effect on compound contents in the snow. The low concentrations of levoglucosan at inland sites (mean of 2.7 pg mL(-1); versus 3.5 and 3.7 pg mL(-1) in coastal and transition zones, respectively) could be associated with the oxidation by OH radicals under sunlight. Our analysis demonstrated that the ubiquity of multiple biomarkers from biomass burning in East Antarctic surface snow can provide baseline concentrations for future studies in Antarctica.

AB We address observations of physical and chemical properties of Saharan dust advections (SDA) as observed in the Central Mediterranean basin, within the framework of the LIFE+10, DIAPASON project (www.diapason-life.eu ). DIAPASON aimed at the definition of best practices and tools to detect and evaluate the contribution of Saharan dust to ground particulate matter (PM) loads. Polarization-sensitive, automated lidar-ceilometers (PLC) are one of the tools prototyped and used in the Rome area to reach this goal. The results presented in this study focus on: 1) the effectiveness of various observational tools at detecting and characterizing atmospheric dust plumes, and 2) processes and properties of Saharan dust advections reaching the central Mediterranean region. In this respect, the combination of numerical model forecasts and time-resolved (at least hourly) PLC or chemical observations was found to constitute an efficient way to predict and confirm the presence of Saharan dust. In the period 2011-2014, Saharan dust advections were observed to reach over Rome on about 32% of the days. In some 70% of these days the dust reached the ground in dry conditions, while 30% of advection days involved wet deposition. Dry (wet) deposition was found to maximize (minimize) in summer. The northern Sahara between Algeria and Tunisia (Grand Erg Oriental), was confirmed as the most frequent region of origin of the dust mobilized towards central Italy. Secondary source regions include northern Morocco and Libya. On a statistical basis, Saharan advections to Rome were preceded by increasing atmospheric pressure and stability. These conditions were found to favor the accumulation of aerosols related to local emission sources before the SDA reached the ground. Meteorology (precipitation and turbulence in primis) resulted to be an important modulator of PM concentrations during SDAs. Magnitude and timing of these factors should be well considered to correctly evaluate the dust share in PM loads or the related health effects. Saharan advections observed during DIAPASON affected particle concentrations down to diameters of about 0.6-1 mu m, with number concentrations peaking at the 2.5 mu m diameter range. These advections were associated with a significant increase in Si-rich particles containing a non-negligible fraction of water. Rainfall was observed to preferentially remove dust particles larger than 2 mu m, causing a significant depletion in the Ca-rich fraction with respect to the Si-rich one. The increase in PLC depolarization ratios above 5%, as well as the hourly PIXE records of the Si/Ca ratio increasing above 1 were found to represent good markers for the actual presence of Saharan dust particulate matter, when Saharan advection conditions are occurring.

AB Airborne measurements of vertical distribution of atmospheric CO2 were conducted over India in 2016 from a Super King Beechcraft 200 aircraft of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad, employing a LICOR-7200 (11-7200) instrument for high frequency CO2/H2O measurements and a Trimble 5700 GPS receiver for geo-tagging them. The present study analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of CO2 mixing ratios over the cities of Bhubaneswar, Varanasi and Jodhpur during June 2016. Measurements were conducted over each location for up to 5 days each, between 0900 and 1400 h local time. Significant variation was observed in the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of CO2 from surface to 3.2 km altitude, which was the maximum height at which the aircraft was flown, over all locations. Inter-comparison of airborne measurements against satellite remote sensing retrieved CO2 profiles from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) showed underestimation of IASI by 0.5-1.5% (3-6 ppm) to an overestimation of up to 5% (about 15 ppm), with the Pearson correlation coefficient `r' between airborne and IASI retrieved CO2 varying from 0.34 to 0.95 respectively. The mean relative bias between airborne and satellite measured CO2 profiles are within 1-4%. A variation of 5-15 ppm was observed between dry and wet CO2 measurements, indicating the strong influence of water vapor on CO2 mixing ratios. The CO2 mixing ratio with corresponding altitudes [maximu CO2(height)/minimum CO2(height)] over Bhubaneswar, Varanasi and Jodhpur were [412 +/- 8.23 ppm (1000 m)/389.42 +/- 2.66 ppm (2800 m), 420.34 +/- 15.82 ppm (800 m)/386.89 +/- 7.82 ppm (3200 m), 405.74 +/- 6.77 ppm (200 m )/383.42 +/- 5.58 ppm (3200 m)]respectively.

AB The role of precedent winds over fine mode (0.05-1 mu m) aerosols during 2016 rainfall event is studied in this manuscript. Here, we show that concomitant wind actions influence over scavenging process during south-west monsoon rainfall over Mahabaleshwar at High Altitude Cloud Physics Laboratory (HACPL-17.56 degrees N, 73.4 degrees E, site altitude-1373m). During monsoon, PM1/PM10 mass ratios revealed dominance of PM1 for June, July, August, September and October as similar to 80%, 90%, 98%, 97%, and 95% respectively. Fine mode aerosols and rains associated with lower precedent wind speeds similar to 2 m/s were found to enhance the scavenging from similar to 60 to 90% based (before minus after rainfall event) on Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) mass (SO42-, NO3-) concentrations. Similarly, before rain CCN number concentration and wind speed exhibited, similar to 0.34 correlation coefficient (at 0.99% significance level) suggesting a viable decrease in CCN concentration due to increased wind speed. It was also observed that ventilation coefficients maxima values similar to 12500 m(2) /s to be negatively correlated with before rain minima Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) concentrations falling down to similar to 1000 cm(-3) . Moreover, three major sources such as vehicular, thunder lightning frequency and long range transport were found to control the monthly volume weighted average concentrations of rainwater. The mass (SO42- , NO3-) concentration for the monthly volume weighted averages with relatively high rainwater concentrations of NO3- (9.02 +/- 4.71 mu g/m(3)) and SO42-(11.61 +/- 6.71 mu g/m(3)) for the month of June, with minimum of NO3-(4.11 +/- 1.16 mu g/m(3)) and SO42- (9.91 +/- 7.07 mu g/m(3)) were seen in month of July and September respectively. However, October (16.45 +/- 5.17 mu g/m(3), 8.08 +/- 3.46 mu g/m(3)) displayed an increase in both SO42- and NO3- rainwater concentration due to long range and increased local sources scavenging processes. Our results indicate that aerosol loading are mostly wind speed and direction driven by anthropogenic and natural origin, and have a notable impact on removal processes.

AB Cities are now becoming the focus for CO2 emission reduction efforts worldwide and there is a growing need for establishing emission inventories, developing methodologies for improved CO2 monitoring and understanding of the multiple source, sink and storage processes inside the complex urban environment. This study combines Eddy Covariance (EC) measurements of CO2 flux (F-C) during one year period over the city centre of Heraklion with analytical morphological and land cover data to achieve a thorough investigation of the spatiotemporal variability and the controlling factors of F-C in the urban setting. The detailed characterization of the urban land cover and 3D structure was performed using high resolution Earth Observation data. The urban morphological data was used to parameterize a turbulent flux source area model and the land cover data used to analyse the contribution of the source area components to the measured F-C. Heraklion F-C does not present any specific seasonal trend according to the meteorological or vegetation changes throughout the year. Heraklion centre behaves as a net emitter diurnally and throughout the year. The diurnal variability presents a standard pattern in weekdays with a major peak in midday and a secondary in afternoon, clearly following the traffic rush-hour peaks. Space heating emissions during winter remain low, hardly affecting the seasonal and diurnal F-C patterns. The main CO2 sources are the major roads and the intersections, where the heavy traffic is located. The source area analysis revealed that traffic contributes 69% to the estimated annual CO2 emissions. Space heating contributes only 11.6%, while human metabolism is estimated to contribute 19.4%. Vegetation cover of the source area is very low and was assumed to have minor effect to the annual F-C budget. The estimated total annual emissions of Heraklion case study reach 19.4 kg CO2 m(-2) y(-1).

AB This study evaluated the bio accessibility of 9 high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH(9)) in airborne particulate matter (PM) by employing a physiological extraction test with simulated lung fluids [Gambles solution and artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF)]. Airborne PM samples (PM2.5) were collected during the non-heating and heating periods in Harbin, a city in Northeast China. All PAH(9) were detectable in the PM(2.5 )fractions. Indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene (Ind), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) were the most common PAH(9) species detected. After Gambles solution extraction, PM2.5  -bound PAH(9) bio accessibility was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to its after ALF extraction. We estimated the lifetime excess inhalation cancer risks per million people owing to exposure to total PAH(9) to be 29.1-69.8 and 141-477 cancer cases per million people during the non-heating and heating periods, respectively, while these numbers were reduced to 1.90-11.3 and 5.90-32.8 after Gambles solution extraction (decreases of 90.7% and 92.7%) and 2.10-7.00 and 2.80-19.9 after ALF extraction (decreases of 92.6% and 97.3%). Predictions of pulmonary toxicity caused by airborne PM upon inhalation might be overestimated if the bioaccessibility and potential toxicity of PM2.5-bound PAH(9) are not fully evaluated.

AB Despite being organic-rich, mangrove soils are usually characterized by low rates of CO2 emissions due to waterlogged conditions, mangroves being thus considered as valuable blue carbon sinks. However, these emissions are highly variable, notably depending on climatic parameters. Can Gio mangrove is a tropical one, being the largest in Vietnam, having being replanted after the war in the late 70's. The main objectives of this study were to quantify the seasonal variability of CO2 emissions at different interfaces (soil-air, water-air, and trunk-air) within a mature Rhizophora stand, and to assess the influence of these emissions on the vertical CO2 concentration profiles in the canopy. CO2 emissions from the soil in the dark were the highest of the different interfaces studied, and were among the highest measured for a mangrove soil, with a mean yearly value reaching more than 270 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). We suggest that the very high temperatures characterizing Southern Vietnam all year round were responsible for these elevated CO2 emissions. In addition to temperature, the first rainfall pulse of the monsoon resulted in the highest CO2 fluxes both from the soil, reaching up to 500 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1), and from the trunks, reaching almost 230 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). Because rainfall pulses are usually followed by a period of increasing rates of ecosystem photosynthesis, and a decrease of ecosystem respiration, we measured lower CO2 fluxes during the middle of the wet season. Additionally, it is possible that, during the rainy season, part of the CO2 produced within the soil was exported trough pore-water seepage, which was enhanced because of the higher level of the river. Concerning CO2 emissions at high tide within the Rhizophora stand, the seasonal trend followed the one of precipitation. During the rainy season, estuarine waters are enriched in organic matter and CO2 due to increased runoff in watersheds, and consequently CO2 fluxes from the water column were the highest. However, these emissions were much lower than those from the soil at low tide or from the trunks. Eventually, CO2 concentrations profiles in the canopy varied with the season, the tide, and the night-day alternation. Elevated CO2 concentrations at the root level may imply that prop roots can produce high amount of CO2 but also that they may trap gas emitted from the soil or the water column, possibly acting as physical barriers to air movement. Further studies using eddy-covariance technique should be developed to confirm the hypothesis suggested in this preliminary study.

AB Land Use Regression (LUR) models was developed using fixed site and mobile station data in Dublin Ireland. The uncertainty associated with short term, mobile station data was accounted for using a weighted function, considering the differences in record duration of data across the study. A systematic buffer distance decay curve-based approach was also considered in this study to identify appropriate predictors and their associated buffer distance. The analysis was performed in Dublin city for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) where 10 fixed monitoring stations data were available, with average daily concentration data records of 1-7 years in length. 105 mobile station data were also collected at several locations in the city for durations of 12 h to 3 days. The performance of a developed multiple linear regression based LUR model was evaluated by using the leave-oneout-cross-validation procedure. The model explained variances (R-2) of the LUR model were found to be 0.219 for winter and 0.688 for summer months. One of the primary reasons for poor performance of the LUR model was that the relationship between the predictors and the mean PM2.5 concentration were found to be non-linear which cannot be modelled by using multiple linear regression approach. To address this, a weighted support vector regression (WSVR) approach was also considered that can account for non-linearity while developing the LUR model. The model performance in terms of R-2 was found to improve to 0.912 for winter and 0.916 for summer using this method. The developed WSVR model can be used to predict PM2.5 concentration at any ungauged locations in the study area with considerable accuracy, which can be the basis for future epidemiological studies.

AB Though sulfuric acid and ammonia/alkyl amines are recognized as main contributors to new particle formation (NPF), models and observations have indicated that other organic species may be involved. In this study we introduced a suitable flow tube system to investigate the effect of formaldehyde (CH2O) on NPF from sulfuric acid and water at 297 K. Our results showed that nucleation rates are slightly enhanced when adding CH2O of 0.31-2.40 ppbv (in the range of atmospheric CH2O peak concentration) to stable sulfuric acid and water system at relative humidity (RH) of 30%, i.e., a rise of the particle number only by a factor of about 2, which is small in comparison to the millionfold increase caused by methylamine in similar conditions. And the promoting effect was weak under different RH. Cluster growth flux at experimental conditions, obtained from quantum chemistry-based cluster evaporation rate constants applied in a cluster population dynamics model, showed H2SO4-CH2 Obased clusters are hard to grow. Therefore, the effect of CH2O on NPF via directly involving in the nucleation can be eliminated. In addition, the derived information may provide new insight into the impact of aldehydes on NPF.

AB Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal and a 'hotspot' of urban air pollution in South Asia. Its bowl-shaped structure (altitude 1300 m above sea level (masl); floor area 340 km(2)) surrounded by tall mountains provides a unique case study for analyzing pollution trapped by topography and local meteorology. In the absence of long-term in-situ observations, for the first time the columnar aerosol loading trend of the Kathmandu Valley was analyzed using satellite-derived aerosol optical depths (AOD). AOD from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard Aqua and Terra (3 x 3 km, Level 2) was used during the dry season (November-June) in 2000-2015. Trend analysis of Kathmandu AOD (K-AOD) (the Kathmandu Valley AOD (KVal(AOD)) + background AOD (B-AOD)) suggested an increase of similar to 35% during the study period. To derive the KVal(AOD) trend, B-AOD was subtracted from K-AOD. The KVal(AOD) trend indicated an increase of similar to 50-60% during the study period, based on MODIS Aqua and Terra data. Thereafter, the background contribution only at the valley layer (1300-1400 masl) was determined using Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) profiles, in-situ observation and modeling techniques. The CALIPSO-based analysis indicated that background pollution contributed an additional 20-25% to local pollution. This finding was further supported by short-term in-situ measurements from Dhulikhel (the site where Kathmandu background measurements were taken) and Ratnapark (a Kathmandu city center site). Case studies were conducted using chemical transport models (WRF-STEM and WRF-Chem) to quantify the contribution of background air pollution to the Kathmandu valley pollution. These model results contradicted the satellite and in-situ observation by highly underestimating the Kathmandu Valley pollution levels. Comparison of visibility in Kathmandu with AOD suggests a profound role of B(AOD )on decreasing long-distance visibility in particular months.

AB Despite that Heavy-Duty Vehicles (HDVs) represent a small part of the overall vehicle population they have been identified as one of the most important contributors to air pollution. This is one of the reasons why HDV emissions regulations are becoming more and more stringent worldwide. Following this trend, Europe introduced the Euro VI standard which includes more stringent emission limits for hydrocarbons, PM and NOx, while for the first time a limit for solid PN emissions was set. At the same time increased concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions led to a series of initiatives including HDVs CO2 certification and monitoring with the latest being the submission of a proposal for CO2 emission targets for 2025 and 2030. Despite the general concern, published data regarding Euro VI HDV emissions are scarce, while real-world emission factor measurements of regulated and unregulated pollutants are even more difficult to find. The main objective of this paper is to present real-world diesel Euro VI HDVs emissions of both gaseous pollutants and solid PN. For that reason five HDVs, including four trucks and one bus, were tested on-road under typical driving conditions. A breakdown of the emissions to low, medium, and high speed conditions was also performed with the aim investigating the performance of aftertreatment systems under different speed conditions. All tested vehicles performed better compared to older technology diesel HDVs, thus reflecting the technological improvements introduced over the last years. However, relatively high emissions were observed for some of the pollutants over low speed phases due to reduced effectiveness of the corresponding emission control systems. Calculated emission factors were also compared to existing emission inventories and good correlation was found for NOx, CO2 and solid PN emissions.

AB The real-time continuous measurements of non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) species including organics (Org), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+) and chloride (Cl-) in winter from 10 December 2015 to 30 January 2016 in Beijing were performed with an Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). The average concentration of NR-PM, was 81.24 mu g m(-3), with the mean concentration in heavy haze days being 220.00 mu g m(-3), similar to 3 times higher than that in light haze days and similar to 15 times higher than that in clean days. Org was the most significant component of NR-PM1 species, accounting for 53% of the total NR-PM1 for the entire study. SO42- was also a significant component, accounting for 23% of the total NR-PM1. However, NO3-, NH4+ and Cl- composition together accounted for 25% of the total NR-PM1. All NR-PM1 species presented remarkably diurnal cycles in haze days, characterized by the highest concentrations occurring at midnight, and the lowest concentrations occurring at daytime. Note that the sulfur oxidation ratios were higher than the nitrogen oxidation ratios for the entire study, especially during the haze periods. The formation of sulfate was mainly affected by relative humidity (RH), while that of nitrate was more associated with NH3. Heterogeneous oxidation of NO(2)on the surfaces of aerosol particles might be a significant pathway of nitrate formations during haze periods. NR-PM1 was mainly from secondary chemical reactions contributing 46.1%, vehicle emissions contributing 22.3%, coal combustion contributing 16.1%, and biomass burning contributing 15.6% in clean days. However, compared to the clean-day source contributions, the haze-day secondary source contribution to NR-PM1 increased to 66.8%, indicating that NR-PM1 in haze days was dramatically dominated by the secondary pollutants.

AB The effects of humidity, wind, and InterTropical Discontinuity (ITD) movement on seasonal distribution of atmospheric aerosols were assessed over different ecological zones in Nigeria. Satellite-observed aerosol optical depth (AOD), humidity, wind speed, and precipitation/ITD data were used. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD time series of dataset were used. The MODIS AOD retrievals were at the wavelength of 550 nm and AOD data was re-scaled and sub-divided into seasonal and annual distributions to investigate the variations in Aerosol. Kriging spatial interpolation model was used to analyze the aerosol seasonal distribution. Correlations analysis was used to evaluate the degree of influence of humidity, wind speed, and precipitation/ITD on the seasonal distribution of aerosol over six ecological zones; Sahel, Sudan, Guinea, Rainforest, Freshwater, and Mangrove zones in Nigeria. The results show that the AOD over Nigeria is influenced by meteorological factors, but much more influenced by dust source outside the country. AOD appears much more during Harmattan season than Wet and Dry seasons; with AOD >= 0.46, with considerable concentration in Sahel ecological zone than other ecological zones. The results show a strong significant relationship between aerosol distribution and meteorological, principally humidity with R-2 >= 0.65 @ p < 0.05. The study reveals that for daily variation of AOD, wind speed, humidity and precipitation as well as spatial distribution of dust source in and outside the country are important drivers.

AB The cloud structure determined from ground-based measurements is generally important to the better understanding of the climate system. This study examines vertically-resolved cloud structures and their characteristics over Beijing using one year (1 December 2016 to 30 November 2017) of ground-based Ka-band (35 GHz) millimeter-wave cloud radar (MMCR) measurements. MMCR-derived cloud-base heights (CBHs) and cloud-top heights (CTHs) are compared with those derived from a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer (CL51) and those retrieved from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite (HW8). Overall, the MMCR-derived CBHs are slightly higher (by 0.08 km) than those derived from the CL51. By contrast, the MMCR-derived CTHs are significantly higher (by 0.82 km) than those retrieved from the HW8 satellite. In the presence of precipitation, the MMCR-derived cloud boundaries are generally lower than those obtained by the CL51 due to the much larger rain-induced attenuation of MMCR signals. In particular, the discrepancy between MMCR- and CL51-derived CBHs decreases with rainfall intensity, as opposed to CTHs from the MMCR and the HW8 satellite that increase with rainfall intensity. CL51 and HW8 data can be used to complement MMCR data when there is rainfall or when MMCR data is missing. This enables the development of a seasonal cloud climatology for Beijing. CTHs reach a peak in summer, and CBHs are lowest in winter. The observed cloud properties reported here will not only facilitate future cloud forcing studies but also provide a validation data source for climate models.

AB We studied the impacts of an increasingly common change in land use from paddy field to jasmine fields on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have supposed the transformation of more than 1200 ha only in the last decade in the surroundings of Fuzhou city in response to economic changes. The possible increases that this can suppose constitutes and environmental concern in China. We studied areas dedicated to rice crop that have been partially converted to jasmine cultivation with some parts still kept as rice fields. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O varied significantly among the seasons. CO2 and CH4 cumulative emissions and the global-warming potential (GWP) of these emissions were significantly lower in the jasmine than the paddy field. N2O emission, N2O cumulative emission, however, were higher in the jasmine than the paddy field, despite in some concrete studied periods the differences were not statistically significant. The total decrease in GHG emissions from the conversion from rice to jasmine production was strongly influenced by the indirect effects of various changes in soil conditions. The expected changes due to the great differences in water and fertilization use and management and organic matter input to soil between these two crops were in great part due to modified soil traits. According to structural equation models, the strong direct effects of the change from rice to Jasmine crop reducing the emissions of CO2 and N2O were partially decreased by the indirect effects of crop type change decreasing soil pH and soil [Fe2+] for CO2 emissions and by decreasing soil salinity and soil [Fe3+] for N2O emissions. The negative effects of the crop conversion on CH4 emissions were mostly due to the globally negative indirect effects on soil conditions, by decreases in soil salinity, water content and [Fe2+]. Soil salinity, water content, pH, [Fe2+], [Fe3+] and [total Fe] were significantly lower in the jasmine than the paddy field, but temperature had the opposite pattern. CO2 emissions were generally correlated positively with salinity, temperature, and water content and negatively with [Fe3+] and [total Fe] in both fields. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with salinity, temperature, water content and pH in both fields. N2O emissions were positively correlated with temperature and were negatively correlated with water content, pH, [Fe2+], [Fe3+] and [total Fe] in both fields. CO2 was the most important GHG for the GWPs, and the total GWP was significantly lower for the jasmine than for the rice cropland field. The change in the land use in this area of paddy fields will decreased the global GHG emission, and the effect on the GWPs was mostly due to changes in soil properties.

AB This study explored effective methods to control NO2 and O-3 concentrations in a manufacturing city, Foshan, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. A "double high" pollution episode (i.e., both NO2 and O-3 concentrations exceeding the ambient air quality standards of China) was selected as a typical case to identify a collaborative control method for NO2 and O-3 by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA). Considering the nonlinear relationship between O-3 and its precursors; we scaled down the volatile organic carbons (VOC) and NO2 emission inventories to investigate O-3 responses. The results showed that Foshan is VOC-sensitive and that the VOC-NOx reduction ratio more than 1:1 not only helped to steadily reduce O-3 concentrations but also to avoid an increase in NO2 concentrations. On-road and Non-road mobile sources and ports were found to be the dominant sources of NO2, while O-3 was mostly affected by organic solvents in Foshan. Controls on ports and the organic solvents are key to achieving a synergetic control of NO2 and O-3 pollution in Foshan. About 2.5% and 2.0% reduction in NO2 and O-3 concentrations, respectively, were found to require only a 3.6% reduction in NOx emissions from ports and a 10.6% reduction in VOC emission from organic solvents. In addition to the "double high" episode, this control scheme has been extended to verify the effects of NO2 and O-3 pollution controls under various synoptic weather conditions.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust. It can be harmful to human health when released in large quantities and/or converted to the neurotoxicant methyl mercury in aquatic ecosystems. This study analyzes global and regional trends in anthropogenic Hg releases to the atmosphere between 2010 and 2015, as well as the associated trends in modeled and measured Hg concentrations at sites around the world. In general, we find that global Hg emissions and concentrations have grown slightly in this period, as declines from the phase-out of commercial Hg use in the developed world have been more than matched by increases in Hg-related activities in the industrializing countries of the world. We estimate that global Hg emissions between 2010 and 2015 have grown at a rate of 1.8%/yr, from 2188 Mg ( + 44%/-20%, 80% CI.) in 2010 to 2390 Mg ( + 42%/-19%, 80% C.I.) in 2015. Regionally, emissions declined over this period in the U.S. ( - 10%), OECD Europe ( - 5.8%), and Canada ( - 3.2%), while they increased in Central America ( + 5.4%), South Asia ( + 4.6%), and Eastern Africa ( + 4.0%). East Asia remained the largest emitting region at 1012 Mg in 2015, though growth there has slowed significantly in recent years. The production of Hg ( + 7.9%), caustic soda ( + 6.3%), and cement ( + 6.3%) showed the highest increases by source type, though artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) was the single largest source of emissions in 2015 (775 Mg). The commercial use of Hg in dental applications ( - 5.6%) and electrical equipment ( - 5.2%) continued to decline. These emission trends show a continuation of the regional and sectoral shifts that began in the 1970s, but with a resulting reversal in global trends, because the benefits from Hg phase-out in North America and Europe have been largely realized and industrial growth in developing countries has begun to dominate. The emission trends are in agreement with trends in modeled and measured concentrations, which show small declines in surface air total gaseous Hg concentrations in eastern North America and Western Europe between 2010 and 2015, but slight increases for much of the rest of the world, driven by the continued increases in emissions from Asia and from ASGM. Our results suggest that reductions of Hg in the North Atlantic region have been largely successful, and focus now needs to shift to Asia and to the continued practice of ASGM worldwide.

AB Recently, the newest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were available with various refinements and improvements made to both the radiation calibration and Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms. A combined DT and DB dataset (DTB) was also added based on piecewise fixed thresholds using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for taking advantage of one's merits. This study provides a cross-comparison and evaluation of these Terra MODIS aerosol products with reference to the enhanced ground-based AOD measurements by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Level 3 Version 2.0 data at 384 ground stations. Their absolute and relative performance are evaluated in the period of 2013-2017 among the products, as well as between the current (C6.1) and previous (C6) releases. In general, the C6.1 aerosol products are found to be superior over the C6 products for three datasets from all scales, but the differences and improvements are rather non-uniform that varies with region. Overall, the DB AOD products show the best performance in most regions at about half of the sites, especially in Europe and North America. Meanwhile, besides bright surfaces (i.e., deserts and arid/semi-arid areas), DB products match more closely with the AERONET AODs than that of DT over medium or densely vegetated areas. The dependences of retrieval errors illustrate that the performance of three datasets deteriorates as surface reflectance, elevation and aerosol loading increase. However, the DB algorithm remains relatively more stable and less affected by changes in atmospheric and surface conditions. While the merged product using NDVI has some improvements over individual ones in general, worse performance is also shown in many cases. A more optimal method is thus wanting.

AB A real driving emissions test procedure was introduced as a supplement to the chassis dynamometer test to diminish the discrepancy between on-road emissions and type approval certification emissions. In this study, on-road NOx emissions from a 2.2 L diesel vehicle equipped with a lean NOx trap were measured not by a portable emissions measurement system but by NOx sensors and an exhaust flow meter. This method provides a strategy for analyzing on-road NOx emissions with a measurement system that is relatively cheap, light and simple. The effects of ambient temperature, diesel particulate filter regeneration, traffic congestion, NOx conversion efficiency and uphill/downhill sections on NOx emissions were evaluated by comparing the NOx emissions characteristics using engine-out and lean NOx trap-out NOx sensors. NOx emissions in congested traffic conditions were 29% higher than those in smooth traffic conditions. NOx emissions at 33 degrees C were 55% higher than those at 27 degrees C. Additionally, NOx emissions under specific conditions with diesel particulate filter regeneration were 30% higher than those under normal conditions. The average on-road NOx emission factor for all test cases was 7.35, but this value decreased to 5.7 when an ambient temperature corrective factor (1.6) was applied for extended test conditions.

AB Long chain fatty acids and alcohols are low volatile species in continental and marine aerosols. We established a surface film model by Langmuir trough to investigate the interfacial properties of sea salts droplets coated by surface active molecules-stearic acid (SA), oleic acid (OA), 1-octadecanol (C18OH) and their mixtures. The aim of this work was to verify the impact of the head group, saturation degree, mixing ratio of different surfactants on miscibility and stability between these compounds in monolayers at the air-water interface. Compared to the organic-coated water droplets, the surface properties of mixed fatty acid and alcohol-coated aqueous sea salt particles are substantially different. Mixed SA/C18OH monolayers are less stable than pure SA or C18OH monolayer at high surface pressure. From the point of view of the geometry, steric hindrance of unsaturated chain is the crucial factor in loose packing of OA monolayer. The negative values of excess mixing areas (Delta A(ex)) for OA/C18OH monolayer on artificial seawater result from the attractive interaction between tail groups. The maximum negative value of excess Gibbs free energies (Delta G(ex)) appears at the equimolecular OA and C18OH. Surface pressure - area (pi-A) isotherm combined with equilibrium spreading pressure (ESP) confirms that the tightly packed monolayer formed by C18OH molecules can minimize water evaporation rate of the potential droplet. Different surface properties of organic films coated on aqueous aerosol must have a significant impact on interaction droplet growth. The interactions between fatty acid and alcohol at the air-water interface provide an insight into the nucleation and growth mechanism of droplets covered by film-forming species.

AB The current understanding of Hg(II) photolytic reduction in atmospheric particles is inadequate. This study addresses the impacts of the particle chemical composition (e.g. anions, trace elements, and carbon concentrations) and water content on the Hg(II) photolytic reduction process under ambient conditions. The results showed that Hg(II) in particles was significantly reduced under irradiation and this process could be prohibited by certain heavy metals and promoted by increasing water content in particles. Negligible evolved Hg(0) amount was observed from particles under dark condition (occupying for < 0.5% in particle-bound mercury). With a 10% increase in water content, the corresponding Hg(II) reduction rate increased by 1-5% after 30 min of light exposure (at an irradiance of 1000 W/m(2)). The Hg(II) photolytic reduction in particles generally correlates with first-order reaction kinetics, with a half-life in a clear sky of 1.6 and 12.2 h for particles collected in the summer and winter, respectively. This study demonstrates that Hg(0) evolves quickly under light exposure regardless of whether the particles are wet or dry, and these processes need to be specified in future atmospheric Hg modelling.

AB The climatic effect of atmospheric particles is greatly dependent on their hygroscopicity and chemical composition. Although the hygroscopic behavior of individual components of aerosol has been widely studied, the effect of coexisting species on the hygroscopic behavior of mixed constituents is still not clear. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy to investigate how particles with different hygroscopic behaviors affect each other when they are combined together in mixtures. The effect of coexisting hygroscopic components, e.g. NaCl, NH4NO3, and (NH4)(2)SO4, on the hygroscopic behavior of externally mixed H2C2O4/CaCO3 was studied. We found that coexisting NH4NO3 can promote the conversion of H2C2O4/CaCO3 to CaC2O4 center dot H2O in the humidifying process by providing a deliquesced solution to dissolve H+ in the oxalic acid matrix. Moreover, competition and blocking effects existed in the case of coexisting (NH4)(2)SO4. Reactions between (NH4)(2)SO4 and CaCO3 led to the formation of CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O and (NH4)(2)C2O4 instead of CaC2O4. NaCl reacted with H2C2O4 in solution to form Na2C2O4. These results suggested that synergistic effects between coexisting components in mixed particles during the humidifying-dehumidifying process may change their chemical composition, mixing state, and hygroscopicity. In addition, chemical reactions should be considered in future studies on the hygroscopic behavior of mixed particles.

AB Missing data from air quality datasets is a common problem, but is much more severe in small cities or localities. This poses a great challenge for environmental epidemiology as high exposures to pollutants worldwide occur in these settings and gaps in datasets hinder health studies that could later inform local and international policies. Here, we propose the use of imputation methods as a tool to reconstruct air quality datasets and have applied this approach to an air quality dataset in Temuco, a mid-size city in Chile as a case-study. We attempted to reconstruct the database comparing five approaches: mean imputation, conditional mean imputation, K-Nearest Neighbor imputation, multiple imputation and Bayesian Principal Component Analysis imputation. As a base for the imputation methods, linear regression models were fitted for PM2.5 against other air quality and meteorological variables. Methods were challenged against validation sets where data was removed artificially. Imputation methods were able to reconstruct the dataset with good performance in terms of completeness, errors, and bias, even when challenged against the validations sets. The performance improved when including covariates from a second monitoring station in Temuco. K-Nearest Neighbor imputation showed slightly better performance than multiple imputation for error (25% vs. 27%) and bias (2.1% vs. 3.9%), but presented lower completeness (70% vs. 100%). In summary, our results show that the imputation methods can be a useful tool in reconstructing air quality datasets in a real-life situation.

AB Dust emission acts as a crucial part in the dust cycle that determines dust related processes at both regional and global scale, such as long-range transport, dry/wet deposition, and radiation forcing. However, most dust emission simulations utilizing dust emission scheme merely investigate natural dust, neglecting the contributions of anthropogenic dust induced by direct or indirect anthropogenic activities, resulting in great uncertainties in estimating dust emissions by previous numerical modelling. To comprehensively reproduce the anthropogenic dust emissions process, both "indirect" and "direct" anthropogenic dust emission schemes were constructed to simulate anthropogenic dust emissions originated from diverse kinds of source regions in the study. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) retrievals were utilized as the constraint of anthropogenic dust simulations. Results showed that using both indirect and direct anthropogenic dust emission schemes show good performance on reproducing the spatio-temporal distributions of anthropogenic dust at the global scale during 2007-2010. High value centers of anthropogenic dust emission fluxes locate in India, the east of China, North America, and Africa. Compared with natural dust emissions, indirect anthropogenic dust emissions show an indistinctive seasonal variation, with seasonal differences generally less than 0.42 mu g m(-2) s(-1). Among indirect anthropogenic dust emissions, pasturelands produce more anthropogenic dust particles emission into the atmosphere than croplands at approximately 0.28 mu g m(-2) s(-1), contributing 75.9% of indirect anthropogenic dust emissions. The developing regions emit much higher direct anthropogenic dust emissions than those from developed regions. This study reveals the non-negligible environmental problems especially in urban areas due to anthropogenic dust.

AB To assess the factors influencing indoor exposure from outdoor PM2.5-bounded elemental carbon (EC), we developed a Monte Carlo framework to investigate the ambient exposure factor (the ratio of exposure concentration to ambient concentration) of PM2.5-bounded EC. The framework integrates outdoor PM2.5-bounded EC concentrations, the probability of window opening, dependence on outdoor parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, PM2.5 concentration), EC infiltration factors, and population time-activity patterns. We investigated the population exposure in Beijing, which suffers from heavy air pollution, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. The average population exposure to outdoor PM2.5-bounded EC modified by ambient exposure factor was 2.24 mu g/m(3) (95% confidence interval (CI):1.06-4.30 mu g/m(3)) in winter, 1.91 mu g/m(3) (CI:1.43-2.74 mu g/m(3)) in the transition seasons, 1.53 mu g/m(3) (CI:1.51-1.56 mu g/m(3)) in summer, 2.92 mu g/m(3) (CI:2.02.-4.53 mu g/m(3)) on haze days, and 1.02 mu g/m(3) (CI:0.82-1.39 mu g/m(3)) on non-haze days. Increases in outdoor temperature and humidity increased ambient exposure factors, whereas an increase in outdoor PM2.5 concentration decreased the ratio of exposure concentration to ambient concentration. This implies that lower temperatures in winter and higher PM2.5 concentrations on haze days result in a population exposure to a lower proportion of outdoor PM2.5-bounded EC.

AB Biochar application is proposed having a potential of inhibiting greenhouse gases emissions from paddy fields, which is considered to be a main source of atmospheric greenhouse gases. However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gases from paddy field have not been investigated under controlled irrigation (CI). Field experiments were conducted during 2016-2017 to determine the effect of biochar application combined with controlled irrigation on rice yield and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China. Four treatments (0 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, 20 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, 40 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, and 40 t ha(-1) biochar + flooding irrigation (FI), named CA, CB, CC and FC, respectively) were designed in this study. The results showed that the effect of biochar application on greenhouse gases emissions from paddy fields under controlled irrigation had significant interannual differences. In the first season, CC decreased the global warming potential(GWP) of CH4 and N2O emission, and the CB increased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission compared to CA, but these differences were not significant. For the second season, CB and CC decreased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission by 35.7% and 21.5% significantly compared to CA due to the significant mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission. Biochar application significantly increased CH4 emission and decreased N2O emission from paddy fields under flooding irrigation compared to controlled irrigation (CC), which led to the FC's GWP was 1.70 and 5.47 times higher than CC's in the first and second season. In addition, biochar application increased soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of paddy fields under controlled irrigation. And CB and CC increased rice yield by 16.7% and 24.3% and irrigation water productivity by 26.1% and 30.8% compared with CA (mean of two seasons). These results suggest that 20 and 40 t ha(-1) biochar can be utilized under controlled irrigation not only for mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission but also to increase rice yield, soil fertility and irrigation water productivity. Therefore, the combination of biochar amendment and controlled irrigation might be a good option for mitigating greenhouse gases emission and realizing the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources of paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China.

AB The kinetics and products of the oxidation of four aromatic compounds, i.e. styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, trans-beta-methylstyrene and indene, with Cl atoms were determined at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Kinetic experiments were carried out in a 400 L Teflon reaction chamber using GC-FID for the analysis of reactants and products were determined using a 56 L quartz-glass reactor coupled to FTIR spectrophotometer. The rate constants at 298 K, using different reference compounds, were (in units of cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)): k(styrene) = (1.29 +/- 0.52) x 10(-10), k(alpha-methylstyrene) = (1.55 +/- 0.27) x 10(-10), k(trans-beta-methylstyrene) = (1.09 +/- 0.23) x 10(-1) and k(indene) = (1.01 +/- 0.30) x 10(-1). Observations with FTIR suggest that the main reaction is the addition of the CI to the aliphatic chain of the aromatic molecules. We found benzaldehyde, benzoyl chloride, formaldehyde and formyl chloride from styrene; acetophenone, formaldehyde and formyl chloride from alpha-methylstyrene; and benzaldehyde, formaldehyde and acetyl chloride from trans-beta-methylstyrene as the main oxidation products. OFT theoretical calculations were performed in order to shed light on the identification of the reaction products. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first determination of the rate coefficients and products for the reaction of the Cl atoms with these compounds, except for the rate constant of styrene which has been studied previously. The loss processes of the title compounds in the atmosphere are mostly controlled by reactions with OH radicals during the day and with NO3 at night, but in coastal areas and some polluted environments, Cl reactions became comparable with OH and NO3 radicals, with lifetimes of 2.2 h for styrene, 1.8 h for AMS, 2.5 h for TBMS and 2.8 h for indene.

AB In today's Indoor generation', most human activities take place within an enclosed space, characterised by a chemically diverse and complex air quality. Although source control is the universally preferred approach to reduce contaminants, this is becoming increasingly insufficient, technically unfeasible or economically unviable. The provision of adequate ventilation is also being challenged by invariably poor outdoor air quality and our quest for a low carbon economy. Whilst the former directly adds to the burden of indoor air pollution, both factors attract mitigation measures that are leading to efforts to seal off indoor spaces, which can increase exposure to endogenous indoor air pollutants, heighten health risks and curtail concentration, learning and productivity. Research to date on the role of air purification technologies in key indoor microenvironments demonstrates that air filtration produces clear reductions in indoor pollution concentrations. To confirm the optimistic modelled health/performance benefits associated with air purification further research is required, evaluating longer term interventions particularly in vulnerable populations, employing real-time sensors to quantitatively assess complete exposure profiles and optimizing technologies/strategies to remove specific indoor air pollutants (eg infiltrated versus endogenous particles, gases, chemically transformed organics) within the unique spaces where people live, learn, work and travel.

AB The objective of this study is to characterise urban refractory black carbon (rBC) mixing state relative to hygroscopic growth factor (HGF) of size selective aerosols to better constrain the aerosol indirect effect. The Aitken mode range (<= 100 nm) is dominated by particles that have relatively low hygroscopicity and comprised freshly emitted hydrophobic rBC, however, our observations suggest that BC mixing states in Aitken range (down to 70 nm) still govern the hygroscopic properties. Conversely, the accumulation mode range (> 100 nm) dominated by particles that have relatively high hygroscopicity consisted of oxidized organic compounds and inorganic salts. Single particle soot photometer (SP2) measurement further revealed that particles at lower size are mostly incandescent type dominated by refractory component whereas higher size particles are mostly scattering type dominated by nonrefractory component. The lower hygroscopicity parameter (kappa) (0.26 +/- 0.08) obtained for Aitken mode particles suggests that they may contain levoglucosan and levoglucosan-OH oxidation products, and are possibly from biomass burning sources whereas accumulation range particles with higher kappa value (0.39 +/- 0.03) have ammonium sulfate, ammonium bisulfate and malonic acid in their composition and their possible source would be secondary in origin. These findings are important because for the first time, BC mixing state and the impact of size selective rBC on HGF are determined directly over an urban region which have implications to precipitation.

AB Trans-boundary PM10 transport into eastern Germany was quantified by comparing mean PM10 concentrations during western and eastern air mass inflow under similar meteorological conditions and calculating an "increment East" as a proxy for the trans-boundary PM10 fraction. Data of 10 measurement stations located in Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony were used for winter 2016/17 and revealed trans boundary PM10 increments of 0-30 mu g m(-3) on average, depending on meteorological conditions. On average over all days with positive increments, trans-boundary transport contributed 13 mu g m(-3) or 44% to the total PM10 concentration in the regional background. During pollution periods with elevated PM10 concentrations of > 30 mu g m(-3) at rural background sites, this contribution lied between 44 and 62%, while it decreased to about 20% for moderate PM10 concentrations between 20 and 30 mu g m(-3) and was negligible for PM10 concentrations < 20 mu g m(-3). Based on its chemical composition, PM10 was apportioned to 6-7 different sources by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) receptor modelling. It was found that typically > 80% of the trans boundary PM10 fraction imported from eastern neighbouring countries can be explained by combustion emissions and formation of secondary particle mass, i.e. ammonium sulfate and organic matter, with the latter typically exceeding the contributions from combustion. Source contributions of these two PMF factors within the increment East were correlated, indicating combustion-related emissions of SO2 and volatile organic compounds leading to the observed secondary trans-boundary PM10 mass. Higher increment East values for cold than for warm days imply emissions from domestic heating in eastern European countries, presumably from the combustion of solid fuels such as wood and coal, as the dominant source for trans-boundary PM10 in eastern Germany. A case study for a traffic-impacted pollution hotspot in the city of Berlin showed an average contribution of about 30% from trans-boundary transport, while regional background, urban background and local traffic emissions explained about 40, 10, and 20% of PM10 mass concentrations during days with eastern air mass inflow where the increment East approach could be applied together with the incremental Lenschow approach. The results of this study reinforce the need of PM10 mitigation measures at different spatial scales, ranging from municipal to international levels.

AB Globally, electricity systems are responsible for two-thirds of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This area has become one of the main focuses for a wide range of scientific communities, and a large number of articles have been published that reported GHG emissions from the electricity sector using different approaches. Even though some review articles have been published on particular GHG emissions approaches, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), studies that investigated overall approaches are much rarer. A scoping review of these GHG emissions accounting approaches has thus been conducted in this study to explore their limitations and indicate possible future scope. From the review, it was found that the majority of the studies considered the LCA approach to investigate GHG emissions from electricity systems. Although the time-varying carbon intensity approach has potential features, it has received less attention. Furthermore, this review has highlighted some issues that need to be addressed by any new or existing approach that would deal with GHG emissions accounting in the near future. In addition, this review would be helpful for policymakers and electricity authorities when selecting appropriate approaches in accounting GHG emissions from the electricity system.

AB Measurements of inorganic precursor gases (NO, NO2, HONO, NH3, SO2 and HCl) and PM2.5 inorganic water-soluble ions (NO3-, So(4)(2-), NH4+, Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+) were performed at a suburban site in northern France for the first time using a MARGA is with an hourly time-resolution from August 2015 to July 2016. The observations were compared with other independent methods: HR-ToF-AMS, BAM-1020, SO2 and NH3 gas monitors over shorter time periods. The dominant particulate species were NO3-, So(4)(2-) and NH4+, with average annual mass contributions to PM2.5 of 28.0%, 13.1% and 9.9%, respectively. The highest concentrations of SIA were found in spring likely due to increased agricultural emissions of precursor gases. A strong formation of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) over nighttime was observed for every season and attributed to the condensation of its gaseous precursors NH3 and HNO3. The partitioning of NH4NO3 between the gas and particulate phases was compared with that obtained with the thermodynamic module ISORROPIA II and generally found to agree well except for HNO3. The local or distant origin of each species was determined by means of Non parametric Wind Regression (NWR) polar plots and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) maps. SIA main origins were regional with significant contributions from Belgium, the Netherlands and western Germany. Additionally, several high PM2.5 episodes that lasted more than 2 days were analyzed, showing some common features.

AB A field study on fog chemistry and aqueous-phase processing of aerosol particles was conducted in Fresno, California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV) during wintertime. Fog droplets were collected while interstitial submicron aerosol was characterized in real time using a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-AMS). The fog samples were later analyzed using HR-AMS, ion chromatography (IC), and total organic carbon analyzer (TOC). Compared to interstitial aerosol, dissolved solutes in fog waters were composed of higher fractions of ammonium, nitrate, sulfate, methanesulfonic acid, and oxygenated organic compounds, likely due to aqueous formation of secondary species as well as enhanced gas-to-particle partitioning of water-soluble gases under humid conditions. The low-volatility dissolved organic matter in fog water (F-OA) was moderately oxidized with an average oxygen-to-carbon (o/C) ratio of 0.42. The chemical composition of F-OA appeared to be overall similar to that of oxygenated organic component in interstitial aerosol (OOA) and the HR-AMS mass spectra of F-OA and OOA are highly similar (r(2) > 0.95). However, there are also significant chemical differences as F-OA appeared to contain a larger fraction of carboxylic functional groups than OOA, indicating enhanced organic acid formation through aqueous-phase reactions. In addition, F-OA was composed of substantially more nitrogen-containing compounds, with an average N/C ratio 4 times that of OOA. Most strikingly was that the F-OA spectra showed substantial enhancements of the CxHyN2+ (x >= 0; y >= 0) ions, which were likely contributed by imidazole- and/or pyrazine-based compounds formed from the aqueous reactions of aldehydes with amino compounds. The results of this study demonstrated that aqueous reactions in atmospheric droplets can significantly modify aerosol composition and contribute to the formation of oxygenated and nitrogen-containing organic compounds in atmospheric aerosol particles. This finding is important for understanding aerosol's effects on human health, air quality, and climate.

AB Aerosol particle number size distributions (PNSD) were investigated to verify, if extremely low-volatility organic vapors (ELVOC) from natural sources alone could induce new particle formation and growth events over the remote boreal forest region of Siberia, hundreds of kilometers away from significant anthropogenic sources. We re-evaluated observations determined at a height of 300 m of the remote observatory ZOTTO (Zotino Tall Tower Observatory, http://www.zottoproject.org). We found that new particle formation events occurred only on 11 days in a 3-year period, suggesting that homogeneous nucleation with a subsequent condensational growth could not be the major process, maintaining the particle number concentration in the planetary boundary layer of the remote boreal forest area of Siberia.

ID NUCLEI
AB The ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the ambient air in Beijing during the spring of 2017 were observed using an improved 5-L version of Bigg's mixing cloud chamber. The characteristics of the diurnal INPs concentrations are analyzed and compared with measurements made in 1963, 1995 and 1996. The particle number size distribution was also measured simultaneously. The correlation between the concentration of INPs and the aerosol number concentration in different size ranges is discussed. Moreover, the relationship between the concentration of INPs and different meteorological factors, such as wind speed, air pressure, temperature, humidity and weather conditions, are analyzed.
   From the results of observation, in general, the concentrations of INPs at -20 degrees C, -25 degrees C and -30 degrees C temperatures trend with each other on a day to day basis, although there are slight differences in some cases at -20 degrees C. As the activation temperatures decrease by 5 degrees C, the concentration of INPs increases by about one order of magnitude. The concentration of INPs increases significantly when air pollution is severe, but the specific relationship between INPs and pollution needed to be verified in the follow-up work, which is related to the source of pollution and the aerosol components. Compared with historical experimental data, interpreting trends using short sampling periods in individual years over decadal time frames, the average concentrations of INPs in Beijing increased by approximately 15 times from 1963 to 1996, but in the past 20 years, the concentration of INPs has decreased significantly. For aerosols with particle size that exceeds 0.5 mu m, the correlation coefficient between aerosol number concentration and INPs increases significantly with increasing aerosol particle size; however, it tends to stabilize at approximately 0.6 for aerosol particles larger than approximately 2 mu m. A comparison with meteorological parameters shows that the concentration of INPs is inversely correlated with wind speed, and displays a positive correlation with relative humidity. These results indicate that conditions that favor dispersion lead to reduced concentrations of INPs.

AB The forecasting system based on the WRF-Chem model and the GSI assimilation tool was applied for the first time over Europe. We aimed to evaluate the differences in impact of 3D-Var assimilation of PM2.5 ground base concentrations to different aerosol chemical schemes (GOCART and MADE/SORGAM) on modelled PM2.5 and PK10 concentrations and to assess the impact of data assimilation during the winter and summer period. For both seasons and both chemical mechanisms, the simulations with data assimilation give better results than the simulations without data assimilation. The improvement of the statistics between the simulations is higher for PM2.5 than for PM10, and the differences are bigger and last longer during the summer than during the winter season. Influence of data assimilation to different chemical schemes (GOCART and MADE) varies between the seasons, however we suggest further tests for different regions and seasons as the results might vary for different regions.

AB Emerging researches found that air pollution had some effects on childhood allergic rhinitis, but the associations between gestational and early life exposure to air pollution and childhood allergic rhinitis are unclear. This study aimed to analyze the association between gestational and early life exposure to air pollutants and childhood allergic rhinitis. There are 3165 preschool children from Wuhan and Ezhou during November to December 2017. Parents or guardians reported information on childhood allergic rhinitis, lifestyle, the health status of children and family members. The concentration of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10(2011-2016) were estimated by a spatiotemporal model with satellite remote sensing and land use information. We used binary logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for 1 mu g/m(3) of increase in each air pollutant during pregnancy and early life. We found that 639 (20.2%) children were diagnosed as allergic rhinitis among 3165 children. After adjusting for covariates, exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and the first year of life were significantly associated with childhood allergic rhinitis. Excessive exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 both increased the prevalence of childhood allergic rhinitis during pregnancy PM2.5: aOR = 1.232, 95%CI: 1.201-1.263; PM10: aOR = 1.063, 95%CI: 1.052-1.075) and in the first year of life (PM2.5: aOR = 1.032, 95%CI: 1.006-1.059; PM10: aOR = 1.018, 95%CI: 1.005-1.031). The relationship of exposure to NO2 and childhood allergic rhinitis was only significant for exposure during the first year of life (aOR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.002-1.025). In summary, our findings suggested that gestational and early life exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for childhood allergic rhinitis.

TI Socioeconomic and atmospheric factors affecting aerosol radiative

AB There exist substantial differences in top-of-atmosphere direct radiative forcing of aerosols due to a region's economic production (RFp) and consumption (RFc), in the context of economic globalization, trade and globalizing air pollution. Yet an explicit systematic analysis of all socioeconomic and atmospheric factors determining the RF difference is lacking. Here, we evaluate five socioeconomic (population, per capita output, emission intensity) and atmospheric (chemical efficiency and radiative efficiency) factors that determine a region's RFp, RFc and their difference. We consider the RF of secondary inorganic aerosols, primary organic aerosols and black carbon by 10 regions worldwide in 2007. The population size varies by a factor of nine across the regions, and per capita output by 40 times from both production- and consumption-based perspectives. The cross-regional spread reaches a factor of 181 (species dependent) for production-based emission intensity and a factor of 96 for consumption-based intensity. From one region to another, production-based chemical efficiency changes within a factor of 5 and consumption-based efficiency within a factor of 3.5. Radiative efficiency varies slightly across the regions (within 2) from both production- and consumption-based perspectives. Although socioeconomic factors are often a greater driver for the difference between a source region's RFp and RFc, the atmospheric factors are also important for many source regions and species. Our results contribute to regional attribution of climate change and establishment of effective international collaborative mitigation strategies.

AB Cooking oil fumes is an important source of VOCs pollution in urban area in China. The research of the emission characteristics of NMHC and benzene series which are the representative substances of VOCs in cooking oil fumes was very little. In this study, three kind of most commonly used edible oils (soybean oil, peanut oil and blend oil) were used to generate cooking oil fumes. The concentrations of NMHC and benzene series in cooking oil fumes were detected by GC and GC-MS, and were used to calculate the emission factors of these. The concentration of NMHC in soybean oil was significantly higher than that of the other two edible oils so the emission factors were higher than others. The emission polynomials of NMHC and benzene series were obtained by fitting the emission factors. The NMHC emission polynomials are binomial equation and the benzene series emission polynomials are best for trinomial. The emission polynomials of VOCs in cooking oil fumes can not only conveniently and quickly calculate the emissions of the substances but also provide a data basis for subsequent processing.

AB Waste woody biomass is one of the most readily available yet underutilized renewable energy sources. Small quantities of wood waste in remote locations are often openly burned when they are not economical to transport and burn in large-scale facilities. Small-scale (10-100 kW) distributed gasifier-generator systems offer an alternative use for this biomass. In this work, we present emissions factors experimentally measured from a commercially available gasifier-generator system. Average emissions factors per mass of dry biomass with high quality producer gas were found to be 1.53 kg-CO2, 11.3 g-CO, 8.7 g-CH4, 2.4 g-NOx, and 0.01 g-soot per kg of feedstock. On an energy basis, emissions were 2.04 kg-CO2, 30.3 g-CO, 18.6 g-CH4, 5.0 g-NOx, and 0.02-g soot per kWh of electricity produced at a maximum load of 15 kW. Our research found that producer gas heating value is inversely proportional to both power output and biomass moisture content. Low quality producer gas was found to significantly increase CO, CH4 and soot emissions from the system but decrease NO. emissions. Small-scale biomass gasification emits less CO2, CO, and soot than open burning, but further improvements are required before emissions from small-scale systems are competitive with emissions from large-scale biomass power generation.

AB In this paper, we present a quantitative determination of the NO. emission in Hefei using mobile Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. The measurements were carried out during winter time from December 2016 to February 2017. The measured NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) show a strong spatial gradient with higher values within the city center, indicating the majority of NOx emission sources are located at the city center. A significant "holiday effect" was found by comparing measurements taken during weekdays and weekend. The weekend reduction is more significant in the suburban (similar to 28%) compared to the city center (similar to 13%). Mobile measurements of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) were analyzed together with meteorological data to determine the NOx emission by applying the loop-integral method. Detailed error analysis of the NOx emission shows the variation of wind field and large measurement gap dominated the total error of NOx emission calculation. The result shows the NOx emission in Hefei during winter time varies in a wide range from 10 x 10(24) to 40 x 10(24)molecs(-1) with an average of 18.44 x 10(24)molecs(-1). Our estimation is about 43% lower than the number reported in the previous emission inventory in 2012. The reduction of NOx emission reflects the successful implementation of emission control measures in recent years. Our result also shows about 73% of the total NOx in the city were transported from outside of the city during winter. The impacts of transported NOx are especially large when air masses originated from heavily polluted regions, i.e. North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta. The result presented provides a better understanding of the impacts of local emissions and transportation of pollutants on the local air quality of Hefei.

AB Unsaturated esters are emitted into the atmosphere from biogenic and anthropogenic sources. Their atmospheric degradation through reactions with the main atmospheric oxidants (OH, O-3, NO3, Cl) contributes to the formation of important secondary pollutants. Kinetic and mechanistic parameters for these reactions are highly required in order to estimate the atmospheric lifetimes and hence the impacts of these important classes of VOCs. In this study, the gas-phase rate coefficients of the reaction of OH radical and 03 with a series of unsaturated esters are reported. The esters investigated include methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethyl methacrylate (EMA), n-propyl methacrylate (nPMA), n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA), iso-propyl methacrylate (iPMA), iso-butyl methacrylate (iBMA) and fully deuterated methyl methacrylate (MMA-D8). The measurement combined the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence for the OH studies in the temperature range 257-376K and a 7300 L atmospheric simulation chamber for the O-3 reactions at 291 +/- 2K. This work provides the first temperature dependence studies of OH reaction with EMA, nPMA, iPMA and iBMA and of O-3 reaction with nPMA, iPMA and iBMA at room temperature. The obtained data are discussed in terms of the structure reactivity relationships and their atmospheric consequences by estimating the atmospheric lifetimes for the studied esters with respect to O-3, OH radical and other oxidant in the troposphere.

AB Studies on long-term effects of air pollutants in China are limited, in part due to a lack of appropriate spatial exposure models. Elsewhere, Land Use Regression (LUR) models have been used extensively to estimate individual-level air pollutant exposure variation within urban areas by combining air pollution measurements with geospatial predictors. Here, LUR models were developed to estimate spatial variation in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations during the heating and non-heating seasons in Beijing, China. Daily routine PM2.5 and NO2 measurements at 35 monitoring stations from October 2012 to December 2013 were collected as dependent variables, with 191 geospatial measures generated as potential independent variables. The PM2.5 LUR model included latitude and forest land (within a 5000m buffer) in the heating season; and latitude, residential land use (5000m) and main road length (100m) in the non-heating season. The NO2 LUR model included latitude, population density (5000m), water bodies (2000m) and road network factors in the heating season; and residential land use (5000m), water bodies (1000m) and road network factors in the non heating season. Adjusted R-2 and cross validation R-2 values of all seasonal models were above 0.80, except for the heating season NO2 model (adjusted R-2 = 0.87, cross validation R-2 = 0.77). Different spatial patterns between NO2 and PM2.5 were evident in Beijing, with a more distinct local pattern for NO2 than PM2.5 and during the non heating season, when regional pollution was less dominant. These 250m resolution LUR models can be used for health impact assessment or to estimate PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations at the residential addresses of participants in epidemiological cohorts of Beijing.

TI Hybrid algorithm for short-term forecasting of PM2.5 in China

AB In recent years, the forecasting of particles with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) has been a popular research topic, and involves multiple sources of pollution, making it difficult to determine all of the contributing meteorological and environmental factors. When only the PM2.5 concentration time series is considered without other exogenous information, accurate forecasting is important and should be efficient. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm consisting of multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. The innovation of the proposed hybrid algorithm is to decompose the original single one-dimensional (1D) PM2.5 data into multi-dimensional information which effectively mines information hidden in the 1D data. Then, it uses traditional prediction methods to forecast each sequence and to reconstruct its forecasting results to obtain the final forecasting results. Three hybrid models, Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM, are developed to forecast the 2016 PM2.5 trends in 5 Cities in China. The results showed that: (1) Hybrid models (Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM) can forecast short-term PM2.5 concentrations in China. Compared with the traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, hybrid models can significantly improve prediction accuracy. (2) The Wavelet-ARIMA model has higher accuracy with respect to predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In particular, it can more accurately capture the mutational points of PM2.5 concentrations, which can provide effective information support for generating warnings about atmospheric pollution. The hybrid algorithm proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the short-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations and can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction.

AB In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and compared them with the Collection 6 (C6) products over regions in China with multifarious underlying surfaces during 2001-2016. The AOD retrievals were validated against 20 AERONET (V3) sites, and the results show that the correlation coefficient (R) for dark target (DT) retrievals in C6.1 is 0.946, while the fraction within the expected error (EE) can be considered relatively low at only 54.03%. Deep blue (DB) retrievals in C6.1 have a slightly lower R value (0.931), but the other criteria are superior to DT. Comparing the results over urban and vegetation areas in C6.1, the overall quality of the DB retrievals is better than the DT retrievals in urban areas. The performance of DT is significantly superior to DB in the low elevation vegetation (LEV) areas. For the high elevation vegetation (HEV) areas, DB performs integrally better than DT. In the spatial distribution aspect in C6.1, most of the DB AOD values are less than those of DT, and the relationship between DT and DB varies with the land cover types and surface reflectance. For the AOD coverage in C6.1, DT retrievals with high coverage mainly distribute in east-central China. However, the effects of high surface reflectance lead to low AOD coverage in the southwest. In contrast, the AOD coverage of DB tends to be high in areas where the main land cover type is arid or semiarid and tends to be low in areas affected by snow. In terms of the comparison between C6.1 and C6, the overestimation of DT over urban areas in C6 is effectively mitigated in C6.1. However, a nearly systematic decline in DT is discovered in C6.1 as well. With respect to DB, consistent AOD coverage distribution is observed, with only subtle distinction. The AOD coverage of DB in C6.1 appears higher than that in C6 in the middle, south, and northeast of China. The quality of the DB retrievals in C6.1 increases slightly compared to C6, and the major improvements are observed for the coarse aerosol particles and for high elevation areas at surface reflectance from 0.11 to 0.2, respectively.

AB Organic pollutants from ship exhaust have significant health and air quality impact in coastal areas; their profiles are also in urgent need. Studies on organic pollutants from ships are still rare, especially in China. Therefore, 21 PAHs and 29 n-alkanes in PM emitted from 15 ships with different types and fuels under different operating modes in China were tested in this study. The results showed that: (1) Identified organic matters accounted for 0.15%-23.3% of PM. Fuel-based emission factors (EFs) for Sigma 16PAHs ranged from 0.095 to 5.80 mg (kg fuel)(-1), with low-engine-power fishing boats and heavy fuel oil (HFO) training ship had higher values compared with light diesel vessels. EFs for Sigma n-alkanes ranged from 5.22 to 1589 mg (kg fuel)(-1), with low-engine-power fishing boats had higher values compared with other vessels. (2) The dominant PAHs were medium molecular weight components of Pyr, Flua, Phe, and Chr. N-alkanes from C15 to C33 accounted for more than 97% of the total n-alkanes. (3) Ratios of typical PAHs and n-alkanes parameters in this study showed typical diagnostic characteristics of oil combustion source. Profiles and diagnostic characteristics of PAHs together with n-alkanes could provide a more precise source apportionment result in the future. (4) Besides, PAHs in PM emitted from ships inferred non-ignorable health influence.

AB A simultaneous observation of the water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) in the gaseous and particulate phases was conducted at a forested site in Japan for two years to clarify the generation mechanism and possible sources of the gaseous and particulate WSON. The concentration of the WSON in the aerosols was 0.070 mu g m(-3) on average, ranging from the concentration below the detection limit (DL) to 0.302 mu g m(-3). A large portion (about 73%) of the particulate WSON was distributed in the fine-mode range (d < 2.0 mu m). The concentration of the gaseous WSON was 0.041 mu g m(-3) on average, ranging from the concentration below the DL to 0.195 mu g m(-3) About 37% of the atmospheric WSON was distributed in the gas phase, and about 595% of the gaseous WSON was basic. The coarse-mode (d = 2.0-10 mu m) WSON showed an unclear seasonal trend, but increased in the summer. Its concentration showed a significant correlation only with the WSOC concentration among the measured species in the coarse aerosols. Suspended organic materials from primary sources, such as plant debris, would be a possible source for the coarse-mode WSON. The WSON in the fine-mode range showed a clear seasonality with enhanced concentrations from the spring to summer. The fine-mode WSON concentration showed a strong correlation with the acidity of the fine particles and the concentration of the gaseous basic WSON, suggesting the secondary production of the WSON in the acid fine particles from the gaseous basic WSON. The basic WSON in the gas phase showed a similar seasonal trend with the gaseous ammonia and strongly correlated with the temperature, which suggests the temperature dependent-volatilization of the gaseous basic WSON species from terrestrial vegetation and/or soil. The seasonal trend of the gaseous acid WSON was unclear, and its concentration did not show significant correlations with any parameters. The possible source and chemical forms of the gaseous acid WSON cannot be deduced at the present time.

AB Beijing has experienced increasingly frequent heavy air pollution caused by high loadings of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in recent decades, especially in autumn and winter. In this study, the formation mechanisms of air pollution episodes between late September and early October were investigated on the basis of observations and reanalysis data from 2006 to 2015. During the transitional period from the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) to the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), an abrupt change in meteorological conditions resulting in heavy PM2.5 pollution episodes was regularly observed in autumn (around October 4-5). Thereafter, pollution episodes with higher PM2.5 concentrations and more frequent and longer duration occurred after October 4-5. In particular, another marked increase in the PM2.5 concentration occurred around mid-November when city heat supply began. We applied the moving t-test (MTT) and Mann-Kendall (MK) methods to investigate the role of meteorological factors affected by the Asian monsoon. The abrupt change in the PM2.5 concentration in autumn (around October 5) was closely related to the monsoon transition, during which the atmospheric circulation and diffusion conditions were undergoing a transition from summer to winter type. This could be favorable for the transport, accumulation and secondary formation of PM2.5. The PM2.5 concentration increased obviously around November 15, and it could be caused by the combination of more emissions from city heat supply and the more stable winter atmosphere. This study revealed significant differences between the two mechanisms that produced increases in the PM2.5 concentration in autumn and winter, and indicated close connections between the variation of monsoon type and air pollution characteristics to some extent. When considering emission reductions, attention could also be given to the monsoon transition period when the atmospheric circulation pattern and diffusion conditions begin to change.

AB This study was undertaken to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of sixteen priority Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as per the classification of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA); bound to size-fractionated particles along with their sources and probabilistic risks in urban environments of Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) of India, where quantification of PAHs was carried out through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the samples collected during the period 2015-16. PAHs were observed to be highly concentrated in the smaller size ranges of particles throughout the analyses. Benzo[a]pyrene (12%) contributed the highest mean concentration, whereas Acenaphthene (2%) contributed least among the PAHs in size fractionated particles. Relative abundances of PAHs revealed that higher amount were associated with fine particles (< 2.5 mu m). Pyrene dominated in the particles of fine fraction with highest proportions than the corresponding particles of coarse fraction (> 2.5 mu m) among the priority PAHs. Winter registered considerably maximum concentration of PAHs, whereas it was minimum during the rainy season. Spatial distribution of PAHs was interpolated by applying the spatial analyst extension Arc Geographic Information System (GIS) software (version 10.1). Molecular Diagnostic Ratio (MDR) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed for source apportionment of PAHs; where pyrogenic and petrogenic emissions were found to be the major contributors in the monitored sites. Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCR; in terms of inhalation exposure) and Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations were investigated for toxicity assessment of PAHs. The priority PAHs having inhalation unit risk [(mu g/m(3))(-1)] were used for the investigation of ILCR associated with children and adults, where Benzo[a]pyrene possessed the maximum ILCR of all the PAHs.

AB This paper presents the results of research on the impact of various projected scenarios for urban bus transportation modernization in Krakow, in regards to air emissions. The research was carried out on the fleet of urban buses operating within the Krakow metropolitan area. The levels and amounts of the 16 substances were evaluated using the CORINAIR methodology. The scenarios were determined based on the data measured between 2010 and 2015 and according to the plans created by Krakow's carriers. An analysis of the plans for the urban bus fleet modernization in Krakow shows that it will have a positive influence on the reduction in particulate matter and gas emissions into the air. The implementation of the projected scenarios, which involves the replacement of old buses with modern, low or zero emission vehicles, will reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 60%, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by more than 82%, carbon monoxide (CO) by nearly 52%, and particulate matter from fuel combustion (PMex) by more than 77% by 2025. Research also shows an increase N2O emissions (by almost 43%) as a result of modernization. This phenomenon is characteristic for modern engines. Moreover, introducing electric buses into a fleet contributes to the gradual reduction of benzo(a)pyrene emissions. Even though the replacement of a bus fleet is a long-term and costly process, taking such action for Krakow and the neighboring municipalities is essential to improving the air quality in that area, especially in terms of excessive concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.

AB In this study we examine the application of a factor analysis technique for datasets recorded by the chemical ionization instrument Proton Transfer Reaction - Time-of-Flight - Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Numerical simulations were carried out to test and optimize the performance of the factorization method Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS). The simulations demonstrated that the choice of initial estimates for the factor analysis are crucial for the outcome of the factorization. For this purpose we describe a new method based on the Pearson correlation coefficient which, compared to the other tested methods, yields the best factorization results. Overlapping contributions of different substances to a certain mass bin and large uncertainties in the data deteriorate the performance of the factor analysis. The deconvolution technique was also applied to data obtained with a PTR-ToF-MS employed at a smog chamber. The response from single substances (fragmentation patterns) such as alpha-pinene, alpha-pinene oxide and pinonaldehyde as well as a more complex experiment involving the ozonolysis of alpha-pinene are investigated. For the single substances, the factorization method points to the presence of impurities which could be differentiated from the masses affiliated with the actual substances. The alpha-pinene ozonolysis experiment was analysed with the factorization technique and yielded four factors, one representing the decay of the reactant and three different products. The matrix factorization technique appeared to be a valuable tool allowing for a detailed analysis of complex mass spectra without the need of any prior information.

AB High temporal resolution (every 10 min) aerosol observations are rarely provided by satellite sensors. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8 can provide aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China with this frequency. The sensor provides great opportunity to retrieve the particle matter near the ground and improve air quality modeling using the aerosol products. However, there is still lack of quality validation about AHI AOD. A comprehensive research was conducted to evaluate the performance of AHI aerosol products based on sixteen sun-photometers stations in AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) over China. The overall comparison of AHI AOD and ground AOD shows a high correlation (R-2 = 0.67). However, there is only 55% of AHI AOD falling in the expected error envelops ( +/- 0.05 +/- 0.2*AOD( ground)). AOD bias between AHI AOD and ground AOD increases with the AOD magnitude. The accuracy of AHI AOD is also highly depend on seasons and surface land cover types. Best performance of AHI aerosol retrievals is shown in summer and for urban region. The diurnal variability validation shows that AHI AOD catch the diurnal AOD variations well, especially for summer. Large differences between AHI AOD and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) aerosol products are shown, especially for northwest China. The analysis indicates that the uncertainties of AHI aerosol retrievals are induced by large errors of aerosol models and surface reflectance estimation in the algorithm.

AB A major challenge in understanding radiative forcing of aerosols is accurately monitoring the light absorbing components and clarifying the main reasons of their spatial and temporal variations. In this study, the optical properties of light-absorbing carbon (LAC) in aerosols were measured over one year and the impacts from various emission sources and other influencing factors were analyzed at three sites (suburban (NJU), urban (PAES) and industrial (NUIST) in Nanjing, a typical polluted city in eastern China. With an improved method that combines online and offline techniques, we revised the multiple scattering correction factors and significantly reduced the uncertainty in measurement of absorption coefficients of black carbon (BC). The result reveals the necessity of developing the regional dependent factor for estimation of BC absorption. Relatively large mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of BC was found in summer and industrial region (NUIST), and the mixing state and coating relevant with secondary aerosol formation were the main reasons for such seasonal and site dependent variations. Distinct seasonal variations existed in the MAE of brown carbon (BrC) at NJU. In the winter, BrC from primary emissions such as diesel vehicles had a stronger absorption ability than that from secondary aerosol formation. The lowest MAE values of BrC appeared in summer, reflecting the formation of the non-absorbing biogenic secondary organic aerosol, and the effect of photobleaching. At the urban site PAES, BrC was expected to be mainly from gasoline vehicles and transport of biomass burning emissions, and had a stronger light absorbing ability than the other two sites. The results of simultaneous observations at NJU and PAES indicated that the formation of fresh secondary organic aerosol enhanced the optical absorption of BC but reduced that of BrC. The impacts of various influencing factors on LAC provided effective ways to alleviate their regional radiative forcing at the city scale.

AB As cities embark upon greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation efforts, there is an increasing need for accurate quantification of urban emissions. In urban areas, transport and dispersion is particularly difficult to simulate using current mesoscale meteorological models due, in part, to added complexity from surface heterogeneity and fine spatial/temporal scales. It is generally assumed that the errors in GHG estimation methods in urban areas are dominated by errors in transport and dispersion. Other significant errors include, but are not limited to, those from assumed emissions magnitude and spatial distribution. To assess the predictability of simulated trace gas mole fractions in urban observing systems using a numerical weather prediction model, we employ an Eulerian model that combines traditional meteorological variables with multiple passive tracers of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic inventories and a biospheric model. The predictability of the Eulerian model is assessed by comparing simulated atmospheric CO2 mole fractions to observations from four in situ tower sites (three urban and one rural) in the Washington DC/Baltimore, MD area for February 2016. Four different gridded fossil fuel emissions inventories along with a biospheric flux model are used to create an ensemble of simulated atmospheric CO2 observations within the model. These ensembles help to evaluate whether the modeled observations are impacted more by the underlying emissions or transport. The spread of modeled observations using the four emission fields indicates the model's ability to distinguish between the different inventories under various meteorological conditions. Overall, the Eulerian model performs well; simulated and observed average CO2 mole fractions agree within 1% when averaged at the three urban sites across the month. However, there can be differences greater than 10% at any given hour, which are attributed to complex meteorological conditions rather than differences in the inventories themselves. On average, the mean absolute error of the simulated compared to actual observations is generally twice as large as the standard deviation of the modeled mole fractions across the four emission inventories. This result supports the assumption, in urban domains, that the predicted mole fraction error relative to observations is dominated by errors in model meteorology rather than errors in the underlying fluxes in winter months. As such, minimizing errors associated with atmospheric transport and dispersion may help improve the performance of GHG estimation models more so than improving flux priors in the winter months. We also find that the errors associated with atmospheric transport in urban domains are not restricted to certain times of day. This suggests that atmospheric inversions should use CO2 observations that have been filtered using meteorological observations rather than assuming that meteorological modeling is most accurate at certain times of day (such as using only mid-afternoon observations).

AB In this paper, the real driving particle number (PN) emissions from two China-6 compliant hybrid electrical vehicles (HEVs) were measured using a certification-level portable emission measurement system (PEMS) and strict adherence to the regulatory procedures for real driving emission (RDE) testing. The results show that the trip-averaged PN emission factors for the port fuel injection (PFI) HEV and the gasoline direct injection (GDI) HEV were 1.15E + 12 and 1.71E + 12#/km respectively, much higher than the engine-only counterparts and failing the existing RDE limits. Enriched air-fuel mixtures and probably lowered catalyst conversion efficiencies as a result of more frequent engine stop-and-goes of the HEVs are found to be the underlying reasons for the extra PN emissions. The test results also suggest the necessity to amend the power management strategy currently widely used in HEVs to deal with the PN issue.

AB The legal commercialization of Cannabis for recreational and medical use in certain US states has effectively created a new and nearly unregulated cultivation industry. Within the city limits of Denver, Colorado, there are now more than 600 registered Cannabis spp. cultivation facilities (CCFs) for recreational and medical uses, each containing thousands of plants. Ambient measurements collected inside growing operations pre-legalization have found concentrations as high as 50-100 ppbv of terpenes; a group of highly reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and known precursors for the formation of ozone and particulate matter (PM). Due to its illicit nature there has been insufficient experimental data produced to determine Cannabis spp. emission rates. This study used, for the first time, an enclosure chamber and live Cannabis spp. plants during a 90-day growing period consisting of four different strains of Cannabis spp.: Critical Mass, Lemon Wheel, Elephant Purple, and Rockstar Kush. These measurements enabled characterization of terpenes and estimates of emission capacity (EC, mu gC g(-1) hr(-1)) at standard conditions. During peak growth, the percentages of individual BVOC emissions were dominated by 13-myrcene (18-60%), eucalyptol (17-38%), and d-limonene (3-10%) for all strains. Our results showed large variability in the rate and composition of terpene emissions across different strains. For the Critical Mass and Lemon Wheel, the dominant terpenoid was eucalyptol (32% and 38%), and it was fi-myrcene (60% and 45%) for the Elephant Purple and Rockstar Kush. Critical Mass produced the highest terpene emission capacity (8.7 mu gC g(-1) hr(-1)) and Rockstar Kush the lowest (4.9 mu gC g(-1) hr(-1)). With 600 CCFs in Denver, and assuming 10,000 plants per CCF, an emission capacity of 8.7 mu sC g(-1) hr(-1) would more than double the existing rate of BVOC emissions to 520 metric ton year(-1). Using Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) values the total ozone formation potential from all these emitted species could produce 2100 metric tons year(-1) of ozone, and based on published secondary organic aerosols yields 131 metric tons year(-1) of PM. It is likely that the ECs calculated here are lower than those achieved in CCFs where growing conditions are optimized for rapid growth and higher biomass yields. Further studies including a greater number of the 620 available Cannabis spp. strains and a wider range of treatments are needed to generate a representative dataset. Such a dataset could then better enable assessments of the potential impacts of this new industry on indoor and regional air quality.

AB Vertical mixing processes as simulated by atmospheric models affect the prediction of vertical profiles of reactive trace gases and oxidants and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry throughout the boundary layer. Specifically, the vertical transport of these oxidants is important for understanding where in situ chemistry occurs. Simulations of the vertical transport are influenced by many factors, including the horizontal and vertical grid resolution, planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, and the use of cumulus parameterization to represent sub-grid scale cloud processes. Here, we compare simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) with the NCAR Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and the NASA P-3B measurements over the Baltimore-Washington region to evaluate the performance of WRF-Chem in simulating vertical mixing of chemical oxidants in the PBL. For two different PBL schemes, WRF-Chem simulates a weaker convective environment and lower PBL height than LES. Comparing WRF simulations, the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme simulates higher and drier PBL than the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme. The stronger vertical mixing in the LES model simulates higher concentrations of chemical oxidants aloft than WRF-Chem, leading to a constant O-3 vertical profile up to the top of the LES domain (4.8 km). Weaker vertical mixing in WRF-Chem prohibits upward transport of the key chemical precursors, therefore resulting in low in situ chemical production of O-3 and OH aloft in the WRF-Chem simulations with both PBL schemes and reducing the oxidative capacity in the buffer or cloud layer.

AB To reveal PM1 vertical profiles and key affecting factors in a typical urban valley, daytime and nighttime PM1 (the particles with diameters less than 1 mu m) samples were collected with medium volume air samplers during 26 December 2017 to 11 January 2018 at five different altitudes by means of high topographic relief at urban areas of Lanzhou. The synchronous boundary layer temperature and humidity profiles were observed by a microwave radiometer. Daytime PM1 concentrations reduced by about 3.86 mu g m(-3) when the height above the surface increased by 100 m, which was much lower than that for nighttime (5.68 mu g m(-3 )100 m(-1)) as particles were easily accumulated near the surface when the air was stable during the nighttime. The three typical PM1 vertical profiles were identified by K-means clustering technique. The most frequent cluster with elevated PM1 concentrations near the surface was closely related to temperature inversion around the ground, while the cluster with relatively uniform PM1 within the boundary layer was mainly induced by unstable atmospheric stratification and thus relatively good vertical dispersion. About 50%-60% of PM1 variations could be attributed to atmospheric stratification near the surface in the valley city, which was much higher than that at the hilltop. The PM1 difference increased by 47.14 (36.91) mu g m(-3) when inversion layer thickness (intensity) increased by 100 m (1 degrees C 100 m(-1)). The newly calculated inversion index considering both inversion layer thickness and intensity explained about 87% of PM1 differences between near the surface and at the hilltop. The vertical dispersion had a more significant effect on PM1 than horizontal dispersion near the surface, while PM1 was more largely affected by horizontal dispersion at the hilltop, which was closely related to the valley terrain.

AB Weekday/weekend mixing ratios of ozone (O-3) and the O-3 precursors of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were recorded at the Guangzhou Panyu Atmospheric Composition Station (GPACS), a suburban site in Guangzhou, during the summer (June, July, and August) and autumn (September, October, and November) of 2011. In both summer and autumn, weekday/weekend O( )differences in the morning and at midday largely depend on how much the O-3 precursors are affected by anthropogenic emissions. In the mornings (6:00-9:00 LT), pollutants (i.e. NOx and NMHCs) were more strongly influenced by vehicular emissions in autumn than in summer. In autumn, O-3 titration and lower NOx on weekends in NMHCs-limited regimes lead to more rapid O-3 production, which resulted in the O-3 weekend effect during autumn morning. No O-3 weekend effect occurred on summer mornings because O-3 formation was in a NOx-limited regime, although O-3 titration still existed. At midday (10:00-16:00 LT), the increase of biogenic NMHCs emissions reversed the sensitivity of O-3 production from NMHCs-to NOx-sensitive. The weekday/weekend diurnal pattern of vehicular sources was the same at midday, more intense other human industrial activities in autumn not only gave rise to the higher mixing ratios of high-reactive anthropogenic NMHCs (e.g. aromatics) on weekdays, but also could affected the temperature in the city, leading to higher isoprene mixing ratio on weekdays. All these factors are likely to contribute to the O-3 weekday effect in autumn. Meanwhile no weekday O-3 effect occurred in summer due to the low-intensity industrial anthropogenic activities. Our results show that high-reactive NMHCs and NOx control can be effective for reducing peak O-3 mixing ratios in Guangzhou. Further investigation based on numerical models is required to reach more robust conclusions.

AB High temporal aerosol optical depth (AOD) is useful for inversing modelling of emissions and for comprehensively understanding the climatology of aerosol. Geostationary satellite has been used to derive AOD over land and ocean. In this study, a novel simplified aerosol retrieval algorithm for Advanced Himawari-8 imager (SARAHI) is developed to retrieve hourly AOD over Beijing from a new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite-Himawari-8, which carries the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). The algorithm is based on a simplified radiative transfer model and surface reflectance derived from one-month AHI apparent data. Measurements from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites and JAXA Himawari Monitor Version 2.0 Aerosol Retrieval product (L2ARP2.0) are used to evaluate the performance of AOD retrievals from SARAHI algorithm. There are 73.5%, 78.2%, 74.7% of AOD retrievals falling in the Expected error lines at Beijing CAMS, Beijing_RADI, and Xianghe sites, respectively. The correlation coefficient is larger than 0.92 with small root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.134-0.164. The retrievals can also reflect the temporal variations of AOD very well. The results indicate that the SARAHI AOD algorithm can derive the regional AOD accurately and is better than the L2ARP2.0 AOD.

AB Ammonia emissions cause several negative impacts on the quality of air, water and soil, while secondary ammonia formed on three-way catalysts (TWCs) of gasoline vehicles has not been sufficiently investigated, especially in the developing countries. In this paper, tailpipe ammonia emissions from seven China-6 certified, low-mileage gasoline vehicles were measured over the World Harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC). The results demonstrated that ammonia emissions from the seven test vehicles ranged from 0.65 +/- 0.38 mg/km to 8.01 +/- 3.12 mg/km. A comparison with the emission factors reported in other research indicates that these China-6 certified vehicles emitted similar or less ammonia emissions compared to the vehicles certified to older EU and federal regulations. The ammonia emissions from the test vehicles showed very weak linkage with their engine or transmission technologies. For all the test vehicles, the vast majority of ammonia emissions were emitted within the engine warm-up period due to already lighted-off catalysts but still enriched air/fuel mixtures. No ammonia emissions were noticed within any engine-start events. The masses of ammonia-converted ammonium salts were estimated assuming that all the tailpipe ammonia emissions will transform into ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, and compared to the primary PM emissions measured with filters. The masses of salts were drastically higher than the primary PM, which underscored the significance of vehicle-related ammonia emissions as a key ambient PM contributor.

TI An accurate and ultrafast method for estimating three-dimensional
   radiological dose rate fields from arbitrary atmospheric radionuclide

AB The three-dimensional (3D) distribution of radiological dose rate is important for assessing the biological hazard of atmospheric radionuclides in the environment. Because of the complexity of such scenarios, existing methods only estimate one- or two-dimensional dose rates, and trade accuracy and generality for acceptable speed. The lack of efficient 3D estimation methods prevents the 3D biological effect assessment of atmospheric radionuclides. This paper presents a 3D dose rate field estimation method that accelerates the computation by several orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy or generality. This method reformulates the time-consuming 3D integral in the dose rate model as a convolution and uses a fast Fourier transform to accelerate its solution. The convolution form provides a new receptor-oriented insight into dose rate estimation that can flexibly describe the radiological response of biological tissues. The proposed method makes no approximations or assumptions, so it is accurate and applicable to arbitrary atmospheric dispersion models and radionuclide distributions. Our approach is validated by both simulations and a field experiment. The results show that the proposed method is accurate and fast in both simple and highly complex air dispersion scenarios, and provides better quantitative and qualitative agreement with the experimental data than RIMPUFF's tabulated method. This method bridges the long-standing gap between the refined 3D atmospheric radionuclide transport modelling and the corresponding 3D biological hazard evaluation.

AB The atmospheric concentration of elemental carbon (EC) in aerosol particles is a key parameter related to global warming and health effects. Emission regulations for diesel exhaust intended to reduce EC concentrations have been strengthened in recent years. To investigate regulation effects in Japan, daily EC concentrations in the megacity of Nagoya, central Japan, were measured during April 2003-March 2016. The EC concentrations showed a decreasing trend with changing seasonal variation: high concentrations were found in autumn and winter before 2011, but no seasonal variation was discernible after 2012. Strong correlation was found for annual vehicular EC emissions and annual mean EC concentrations during 2003-2009. However, the relation after 2010 was weaker in spring and summer. Based on the relation of EC with trace element (Pb, V, Sb, etc.) concentrations and the backward air trajectories on high concentration days, EC sources other than vehicles were found to be related to long-range transport of air pollution from China in spring and combustion of heavy oil, including ship engine exhaust, in summer.
