AB Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 ceramics added with different amount (0-10 wt%) of ZrP2O7 addition were successfully prepared and characterized, to determine the effects of ZrP2O7 addition on the structure, mechanical and thermal expansion properties of Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 ceramics. X-ray diffraction results show that Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 and ZrP2O7 can coexist in a sintered body without any other phases. The addition of ZrP2O7 can effectively improve the flexural strength and Vickers hardness relative to pure Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 ceramics. Moreover, a low thermal expansion coefficient of 1.3 x 10(-6)/degrees C is observed for the ceramics. Considering the low thermal expansion and excellent mechanical properties, Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 ceramics added with ZrP2O7 can be a promising low thermal expansion material. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nano-ZnO/regenerated cellulose (NZRC) films were prepared via the formation of Zn-5(OH)(8)Cl-2.H2O/regenerated cellulose (ZHCRC) film from cellulose-ZnCl2 aqueous solution by using NaOH aqueous solution as both the regeneration agent and the reactant, and the subsequent transformation of the Zn-5(OH)(8)Cl-2.H2O into nano-ZnO at a low hydrothermal temperature of 100 degrees C. The morphology of nano-ZnO changed from hexagonal nanosheets to nanorods as the hydrothermal treatment extending from 0.5 to 4 h. The NZRC films exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency for methyl orange and 1.53 x 10(-5) mol methyl orange was completely degraded in 40 min by using 1 g of hexagonal catalyst. The NZRC film photocatalytic composites can be applied in the large-scale industrial treatment for degrading organic dye wastewater with good prospects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of benign solvents composition on poly(epsilon-caprolactone)

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Green electrospinning; Benign solvents; Poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
AB Green electrospinning is a flourishing trend in the field of electrospinning (ES) of polymeric/composite materials for biomedical applications. The use of non-toxic solvents instead of the most commonly used solvents in electrospinning is needed to avoid the possible presence toxic solvents traces in the electrospun mats, enhancing their cytocompatibility. It was found that a single solvent or solvent mixtures have a critical role in fiber formation and properties. In this work, fibers in the micro/nanoscale were obtained by electrospinning technique from different poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) solutions. Benign solvents (i.e. acetic and formic acids, water and their mixtures) and standard organic solvents for ES (i.e. chloroform) were explored in order to compare the fiber characteristics and properties. Morphology, size, crystallinity, thermal and polymer stability of fibers were analyzed. The obtained results showed the suitability of the use of benign solvents for ES, highlighting that for the use of formic acid the degradation of PCL should be taken into consideration.

ID MICROSPHERES
AB Due to the high temperature resistance, the SiC nanowires have been widely considered as a potential electromagnetic-wave absorbing material, but their absorption ability is still unsatisfactory. In this work, the Pt nanoparticles with the size of 3-5 nm are decorated on the SiC nanowires surface by the facile magnetron sputtering in a very short time and without the post-treatment processes. By controlling the sputtering time, the dielectric and microwave absorption properties of the SiC nanowires are effectively regulated and improved. At the sputtering time of 60 s, the Pt-decorated SiC nanowires achieve an effective absorption (reflection loss < - 10 dB) bandwidth of 3.7 GHz (8.5-12.2 GHz), covering most of the X-band at a low filling ratio of 10 wt%. Such an improvement is attributed to the enhancement of the conductance loss and interface polarization loss induced by the Pt-decoration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanisms governing the microstructural evolution during friction stir welding of Monel at different heat inputs and the corresponding mechanical properties were investigated. In the low heat input condition, both continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallizations caused the formation of fine grains with an average grain size of 1.7 mu m and closely random texture. A high heat input condition resulted in larger average grain size of 23.5 mu m with shear texture by only the continuous dynamic recrystallization. Low heat input led to the simultaneous increase of strength and elongation. The origins of the tensile behavior of the joints have been discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly aligned nonwoven vapor grown carbon fibre (VGCF) based polyurethane (PU) fibrous membrane (VGCF@PUFM) was fabricated by rotation spinning based on DMF-H2O exchange for directional microwave shielding. This VGCF@PUFM showed obviously different electrical conductivity and mechanical strength in parallel and perpendicular directions. Variational microwave shielding effectiveness (SE) could be observed by changing the rotation angles of VGCF@PUFM with vibrational direction of electromagnetic (EM) wave. There was the shielding difference more than 10 dB (above 20 dB in 0 degrees, below 8 dB in 90 degrees). Greater shielding effectiveness could be expected by enhancing the anisotropy of electrical conductivity of the VGCF@PUFM. In addition, oriented alignment of VGCF in fibre is promising for further improvement of the electrical conductivity in fibre direction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution of shallow traps within the sol-gel synthesized ZnO nanoparticles was investigated using thermoluminescence (TL) experiments in the 10-300 K temperature range. TL measurements presented two overlapped peaks around 110 and 155 K. The experimental technique based on radiating the nanoparticles at different temperatures (T-exc.) between 60 and 125 K was carried out to understand the trap distribution characteristics of peaks. It was observed that peak maximum temperature shifted to higher values and activation energy (E-t) increased as irradiating temperature was increased. The E-t vs. T-exc. presented that ZnO nanoparticles have quasi-continuously distributed traps possessing activation energies increasing from 80 to 171 meV. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigated the suppression mechanism of delta-ferrite using a nickel interlayer during fiber laser welding. The fraction of primary solidification delta-ferrite was reduced to 57% with a 5.85% Ni in welding pool, and completely transformed into austenite during peritectic reaction (L + delta -> gamma) and solid phase transformation (delta -> gamma). Full martensite microstructure was obtained in welded seam and fusion line without Al-segregation. Tensile strength of welded joint had a similar to 17.1% improvement compared to as-received welded, similar to that of removing Al-Si coating. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phase equilibria in the Al-Ni-La system and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys with varying La and Ni contents were investigated by using thermodynamic calculations (Thermo-Calc software), electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer and tensile test. It is shown that the microstructure of the most promising alloys with La contents of up to 8 wt% and Ni contents of up to 5 wt% consists of Al primary crystals and ultrafine ternary eutectic (particle thickness is about 3070 nm) which in turn consist of binary Al3Ni and Al4La compounds. However, at an excessive concentration of La and Ni, the formation of the previously undescribed Al9LaNi2 ternary compound is observed. The actual structure of the ternary diagram is proposed based on experimental data. Uniaxial tensile testing of the promising Al7La4Ni alloy in as-cast state revealed an ultimate tensile strength of about 250 +/- 10 MPa, a yield strength of 200 +/- 10 MPa and a ductility of 3.0 +/- 0.2%.

AB A novel molten salt method was employed to synthesize 10% Nb doped La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSFN). The assynthesized powders were pure and adopted a porous structure. Using LSFN as the oxygen electrode for a reversible solid oxide cell, the button cell exhibited a peak power density of 0.79Wcm(-2) in H-2 and an electrolysis current density of 0.89 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V in 50% CO2/50% H-2 at 800 degrees C. A large fraction of Fe2+ was found in LSFN, resulting in the improved performance. Our results indicate that the molten salt method is a promising approach for the synthesis of highly active perovskite electrode with a dopant of Nb. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of non-enzymatic glucose sensing (NEGS) received massive attention in the biosensors application because of the selectivity, sensitivity and low cost. The development of NEGS using Conductive Polyaniline Nanosheets (CPANINS) by in-situ polymerization using the structure directing agent (SDA) have summarized in the present study. XRD, FTIR, UV-Visible Spectroscopy and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) characterized the structural, optical and morphology studies of the obtained CPANINS. The CPANINS have coated on the screen-printed electrode (SPE) for the investigation of electrochemical behaviour. The CPANINS/SPE exhibited a remarkable sensitivity 2003.5 mu A/mMcm(2) towards the oxidation of glucose with a broad liner range 1-1000 mu M, detection limit 0.043 lM (S/N = 3) and glucose oxidation with fast response time (T-response < 1 s). The CPANINS showed better selectivity towards the glucose oxidation. As such, the proposed CPANINS could be part of the development of sustainable, eco-friendly, mere and low-cost glucose sensing devices. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, copper-antimony-sulfide (CAS) nanostructures, including CuSbS2, Cu3SbS3, and Cu3SbS4, were synthesized from a Cu-Sb-S solution via ion deposition. The CAS nanostructures changed to more nanosheet-like structures after pH treatment with an ammonia solution (NH4OH). Additionally, the pH increased from 2.1 to 9.2, with the highest exchange current density, J(0), of 0.523 mA/cm(2), indicating high charge-storage capacity. The results revealed a faster response time for the de-intercalation/intercalation current, and improved breakdown potential. Furthermore, a morphological change occurred that yielded a larger active material surface; these changes increased electron transport and ion conductivity, and improved the charge-storage capability, demonstrating the high potential for use in electric double-layer capacitors, batteries, and energy-storage devices.

ID ENERGY-TRANSFER
AB Single-component Eu2+ and Mn2+-codoped Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4 phosphors were firstly synthesized by the solid-state reaction. Under near-ultraviolet excitation, the Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphors displayed an intense blue emission attributed to the 4f-5d transition of the Eu2+ ions along with a characteristic orange-red emission due to the T-4(1)((4)G)-(6)A(1)(S-6) transition of the Mn2+ ions. Increasing the doping concentration of the Mn2+ ions considerably strengthened Mn2+ emission and reduced Eu2+ emission owing to the energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions, thus implementing the continuous tuning of chromaticity coordinates of the Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphors from blue to orange-white and eventually to orange-red. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated that the dipole-dipole interaction was dominantly involved in the mechanism of energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions in the phosphors, and the critical distance was calculated to be 23.61 angstrom. By combining the typical Ba-3(ZnB5O10)PO4: 0.05Eu(2+), 0.07Mn(2+) phosphor with the 370 nm near-ultraviolet chip, the warm white light with the low correlated color temperature of 3720 K was achieved. These results indicate that our phosphors exhibit great potential for use as single-component phosphors for near-ultraviolet-pumped white light-emitting diodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dynamic and quasi-static compression experiments are conducted on a high-density porous titanium with in situ X-ray imaging to characterize its deformation dynamics. The porous titanium exhibits higher strain-rate sensitivity than full-density titanium. Strain field mapping indicates that compaction bands are narrower and denser under dynamic loading, leading to a more homogeneous strain distribution and thus a higher flow stress. The mean Poisson's ratio for dynamic loading is 15% lower than that for quasi-static loading at the same bulk strain, as a result of local inertial confinement which also contributes to the rate hardening of porous titanium.

AB Herein, the Ni composite coating comprised of metallic Ni (Ni-0) and Ni(OH)(2) was rapidly deposited on Ti mesh by facile, low cost and environmental-friendly electrodeposition method with only NiSO4 as electrolyte. HER experiments revealed that Ni composite coating on Ti mesh with electrodeposition time of 360 s (Ni/TM-360 s) exhibited the highest HER activity with overpotential of 205 mV at similar to 10 mA/cm(2), surpassing some previously reported Ni-based electrocatalysts.

AB Ag/LaTiO2N photoanode has been fabricated by a simple and cost effective method. Ag is introducing the reduction sites to prevent the facile recombination of electron-hole pairs, before migrating to the surface for photocatalytic reactions. A cobalt-phosphate based oxygen evolution catalyst (Co-Pi, OEC) was electrochemically deposited onto the surface of resultant Ag/LaTiO2N electrode. The crystalline phase, physicochemical properties and morphologies of the products were characterized by UV-vis DRS, XRD and SEM techniques. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance and electron transfer properties of Ag/LaTiO2N and CoPi/Ag/LaTiO2N electrode was measured under a solar simulated (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)) light sources. Dual cocatalysts modified electrode surface has shown the remarkable effect and significant increment by ca. twofold of anodic photocurrent.

TI Formation mechanism of transition zone and amorphous structure in

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Amorphous structure and transition zone were observed in the magnetic pulse welded Al-Fe weld. Simulations and theoretical analysis were carried out to reveal the formation mechanism of the amorphous structure and transition zone. The wave morphology in the Al-Fe interface was well reproduced in simulations, and local melt was found in the weld interface. The cooling rate in the amorphous layer was much higher than that in the transition zone due to the smaller thickness of the melting layer. Materials in the amorphous layer experienced amorphization, while the materials in the transition zone experienced recrystallization. The current work indicated local melt played an important role in the magnetic pulse welding, which was different from the common perception that magnetic pulse welding was a totally solid-state welding process.

AB 5 Double extrusion with a large plastic deformation was conducted to fabricate Mg-Nd-Zn-Zr (JDBM) micro-tubes (3.5 mm in outer diameter and 0.25 mm in thickness) with high plasticity for biodegradable vascular stents application. After double extrusion, the grain size was greatly decreased to one seventh of the original size and the basal texture intensity was enhanced slightly. The elongation increases from about 23% for the as-extruded JDBM alloy bar to about 48.8% for the as-extruded micro-tubes, which is a 112% increase by double extrusion. The high elongation is attributed to the enhanced activation of non-basal slips contributed by the significant grain refinement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanomaterials are emerging as a promising photothermal and theranostic agent. In this work, uniform Bi2S3 hollow spheres (HS) have been successfully synthesized by using glycerol (Gly) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as morphology regulator, and L-cysteine (L-Cys) as a sulfur source and surface modifier. The resulting L-Cys/Bi2S3 HS shows a stronger near-infrared (NIR) harvesting capability in comparison with its solid counterpart, and the photothermal conversion efficiency reached up to 31.5%. The nature of hollow structure endows the L-Cys/Bi2S3 HS with higher specific surface area and enhanced drugs loading capacity. As high as 86.4% doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded to the outer and inner surfaces of L-Cys/Bi2S3 HS and their controlled releasing behavior follow a pH- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the functional group of L-cysteine imparted the HS with good dispersibility and biocompatibility. The novel hollow materials with simultaneous integrated photothermal ablation and drug therapy may be a promising agent for cancer treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cobalt-doped melt-spun ribbons of Ni50Mn25-xCoxGa25 were prepared to study the influence of cobalt on the magnetic properties of the NiMnGa based Heusler alloy. Bulk specimens were also prepared for a comparative study. The bulk specimens and the melt spun ribbons were annealed at 900 degrees C for 5 h followed by quenching. Microstructural studies revealed an extensively twinned structure which is beneficial for magnetic field induced strain. The magnetization measurements showed a reduction in the moment with an increase in the cobalt content from 78.4 emu/g to 52.7 emu/g for Co (x = 6) and Co (x = 10), respectively. A reduction was also observed in the T-C when cobalt content was increased from Co (x = 6) (T-C = 386 K) to Co (x = 10) (T-C = 263 K). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was surprise found that such NiO nanosheet exhibits a superior gas response towards H-2. The enhanced sensing ability may be benefited from the porous nanostructure, resulting in more sufficient pathways for gas diffusion and larger surface for chemical reaction. We hoped our findings could be in favor of further investigations on the fabrication of perfect two dimensional architectures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, Mn3+ doped InN nanoparticles (InN:Mn NPs) with room-temperature ferromagnetism were successfully synthesized via a vapor - solid phase nitriding reaction. The content of doped Mn3+ can effectively change the ferromagnetic properties of the as-synthesized samples. The saturation magnetization value of InN nanoparicles with various Mn3+ doping concentrations display a parabolic-like change as the Mn3+ doped content increase and reaches the top value of 0.2998 emu g(-1) corresponding to the Mn3+ doped content of 0.91 at.% at room temperature. Magnetic properties originate from the coupling between N 2p orbital and Mn 3d orbital in the conduction bands. Compared with pure InN nanoparticles, half metallic ferromagnetic InN: Mn nanoparticles have smaller electric resistivity, larger hall coefficient and hall mobility, which will be a promising material in spintronic devices.

AB In this paper, the effect of post deposition annealing (PDA) on the chemical, structural, and electrical properties of the high-k Y2O3/Al2O3 stacking dielectric on p-type 4H-SiC were studied. High-k dielectric provides a physically thicker film with equivalent capacitance, therefore better exploits the high breakdown strength of 4H-SiC in its MOSFET devices. The Y2O3/Al2O3 stacking films were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering, with PDA in Ar ambient at 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that an Al5O12Y3 crystal layer was formed in between Y2O3 and Al2O3 films after annealing above 600 degrees C. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was used to investigate the atomic structure and measure the thickness of each layer. Charges and dielectric strength of the stacking films were characterized by high frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurements. The lower charge density and higher dielectric strength were found after PDA at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Titanium-doped Zinc oxide (Zn1-xTixO1+x; x = 0, 0.06, 0.09, 0.15) nanoparticles have been synthesized by sol-gel method at 80 degrees C and further annealed at 450 degrees C in ambient environment to study their structural and optical properties. The XRD data shows that the synthesized ZnO nanoparticle is polycrystalline in nature with average crystallite size of similar to 6.3 +/- 0.1 nm and highly oriented in (1 0 1). Titanium doping in ZnO indeed reduces crystallinity and average crystallite size which can be increased after annealing at 450 degrees C in ambient environment. Optical studies reveal that the value of optical band gap (E-g) for as-prepared Zn1-xTixO1+x samples increases with increasing the Ti more fraction, the value being 3.24, 3.28, 3.30, 4.06 eV, for x = 0, 0.06, 0.09, 0.15, respectively. The value of E-g is laid to lower value upon annealing at 450 degrees C in ambient environment. The defects like zinc interstitials and grain boundaries are controlled by Ti-dopant cations and annealing as confirmed by photoluminescence study. ITO/Zn1-xTixO1+x (x = 0.09)/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al solar cell device is demonstrated with higher power conversion efficiency (eta similar to 2.09%) than its pristine device (eta similar to 1.36%).

AB We report about the fabrication of asymmetrical periodic arrays on stainless steel by means of Direct Laser Interference Patterning. The fabrication strategy consists in irradiating the surface of the material under a certain inclination angle using a two-beam interference setup equipped with a pulsed picosecond laser system (70 ps) operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm. In particular, for tilting angles higher than 30 degrees, well-defined saw-tooth like geometries could be produced. Due to the ultra-short duration of the laser pulses, also Laser Induced Periodic Surfaces Structures are fabricated, which create hierarchical morphologies similar to the one present in nature.

AB In this paper, Nb-25Ti-2Cr-2Al-16Si (at.%) powder was fabricated by mechanical alloying and plasma spheroidization processes. At the 300 min of milling in attritor, a uniform distribution of chemical elements can be obtained. Further increasing of milling time leads to drastically increase of the Fe contamination from grinding media. After plasma spheroidization, the microstructure of the powder consists of uniformly distributed Nb5Si3, Nb3Si and Nb-ss. The melting and rapid quenching process during plasma spheroidization tends to refine the phases and stabilize Nb silicides. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel chromophore based on the phenoxazine and tricyanofuran acceptor linked together via thiophene as the bridges have been synthesized by the conventional technique and systematically investigated. Structure analysis and photophysical properties were carried out to investigate the new structure chromophore. Density functional theory was used to calculate the hyperpolarizability (beta) and the result shows that chromophore A showed a lower energy gap. In addition, chromophore A displayed good thermal stability with the onset decomposition temperature over 240 degrees C. These results showed that chromophore A, which had good thermal stability and nonlinear optical properties was a promising candidate for practical use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INTERFACIAL POLARIZATION
AB Polyamide-based composites with segregated Carbon nanotube (CNT) network were prepared to achieve a high dielectric constant with an ultralow loading of CNTs. Specially, the polypropylene (PP) was introduced into the segregated CNT network to tailor the CNT dispersion. More importantly, the PP layer formed between two neighbored CNTs can enhance the interfacial polarization and suppress the electron conduction, leading to a higher dielectric constant while maintaining the dielectric loss at a low level. In this work, CNT segregated structure was firstly applied to achieve polymer composites with high dielectric constant but low loss. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The dependence of the electrical conductivity on the oxygen partial pressure of alumina films produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method (ADM) was investigated. The samples were contacted in a three-electrode setup according to DIN IEC 60093:1993-12 for high insulating materials and the conductivity was measured as a function of the oxygen partial pressure between 650 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The conductivity increases with the oxygen partial pressure and thus shows p-type behavior. Constant final values are reached even at these low temperatures. In the double logarithmic representation, a slope of approx. 3/16 can be determined. Following a defect chemical approach for M2O3 (M represents a metal) and the assumption of Schottky disorder, a defect chemical model can be established. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Barium acetate (Ba(CH3COO)(2)) and tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(C4H9O)(4)) were used as the starting materials, and the NaOH was used as a pH-adjusting agent. In the aqueous precursor, the NaOH concentration was 2.0 mol/L, and the concentrations of Ba2+ and Ti4+ ions were 0.01 and 0.09 mol/L, respectively. As the precursor was heated at 280 degrees C for 20 h by the hydrothermal method, the white precipitate was formed. The white precipitate was confirmed to be the elongated BaTi5O11 nanocrystals. The single-phase BaTi5O11 nanocrystals were successfully synthesized. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An Al-8Mg-based alloy with high strength and high ductility was developed by adding a grain boundary strengthening element. Zr was predicted to be the most effective element for grain boundary strengthening at 298 K from first-principles calculations. Then, an Al-8Mg-0.2Zr alloy was developed. Grain boundary analysis by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy revealed that the added Zr segregated at grain boundaries in the Al-8Mg-0.2Zr alloy. The Al-8Mg-0.2Zr alloy exhibited tensile elongation of 49% with transgranular fracture, whereas the Al-8Mg alloy exhibited tensile elongation of 28% with intergranular fracture after tensile tests at room temperature. We succeeded in developing a high strength and high ductility Al-8Mg-0.2Zr alloy which compensates for the trade-off between strength and ductility in comparison with commercial Al alloys.

AB In this work, a series of CdS-G-LTO composites were fabricated and characterized using multiple methods, to determine their performance for degrading natural food pigments in industrial wastewater. The optimal composite for the degradation of MO was CdS-G-LTO-2 (20 wt% CdS), with degradation rate of 109 times and 50 times higher than that of LTO thin film and G-LTO. The photocatalytic performance of these composites with regard to gardenia yellow pigment and real wastewater was also investigated. The removal efficiency of chorma and TOC for gardenia yellow reached 83% and 75% respectively after 40 min; while for the wastewater, the removal efficiency of COD and TOC was 62% and 74.4% after 6 h. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the high separation and transfer rate of photo-excited charge carriers. The O-center dot(2)- radicals (as the main species) and h(+) both participated in the photocatalytic degradation reaction of gardenia yellow. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In the past several years, organic-inorganic halide based perovskites has become an exciting topic in the field of photovoltaic community. Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) use 2,2',7,7'-Tetrakis[N, N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole transporting layer (HTL), but the cost and stability of the polymeric HTL affects the scaling-up of PSC. This work, reports a hole-conductor free-ambient processed mixed halide PSCs with promising efficiency by tuning the morphology of the perovskite films by employing different deposition techniques (one step, two-step and dip coating method). In the dip coating method, unique cuboid structured films with good absorption and pin hole free films were obtained. The photovoltaic performances of the devices made by various deposition methods were measured at 1 sun illumination under standard conditions and achieved upto 6.5%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Ensemble patch sparse coding: A feature learning method for
   classification of images with ambiguous edges
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English

DE Sparse coding; Ensemble; Image classification; Ambiguous edge
ID OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB Sparse coding methods with a learned dictionary have been successful in several image classification problems. However, sparse representations from a unit dictionary may not contain full information when images are affected by environmental factors such as light, shadow, background, and so forth. In addition, sparse features formed by one dictionary can fall into a trap of singularity in training. To handle these problems, especially in images with ambiguous edges, we propose a new sparse coding method based on an ensemble of image patches. The proposed method includes an sparse-coding based image classification framework using image patches and their effective ensemble in an attempt to extract inherent structures from ambiguous-edge images. First, we transform such images into overlapped patches for better classification performance. Then, we assign patch-wise weights and seek to obtain optimal weights not by a single sparse representation but by ensemble learning. For obtaining optimal weights, we propose a two-step update scheme. We collectively update the weights of all patches in misclassified images first and then propagate the weights of misclassified patches to those of other overlapping patches in the images. Experimental results on the Northeastern University surface defect dataset and a close-up skin dataset show the proposed method achieved better classification accuracy than some existing methods and demonstrate the potential advantage of the proposed method in ambiguous-edge image classification.

AB Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary the depth of water application in a field to handle different types of soils, crops, and other conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently apply variable rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine management zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option. Thus, this study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on precision irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps to control the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used in this study because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access to information on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed map created using the intelligent decision making system, the pivot can increase or decrease its speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain irrigation zone. Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has made the strategy of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for crop management. The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower leaf development, indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water layer applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could be observed; each zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot must develop for decreasing or increasing the application of the water layer to the crop area. Three quarters of the total crop area had spatial variations during water application. The set point built by the developed system pointed out zones with a decreased speed in the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional control, the relay from pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70% to 35% whenever the central pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed system obtained values of 37% and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore, it is possible to affirm that traditional control models used for central-pivot irrigators do not support the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed control determined by the developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from the edaphoclimatic variables when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties and non-linearities of an irrigation system and establish a control model for high-precision irrigation.

AB Under increasingly challenging circumstances, pharmaceutical companies try to reduce the overproduction of clinical drugs, which is commonly seen in the pharmaceutical industry. When the overproduction is simply reduced without an efficient coordination of the inventories in the supply chain, the stock-outs at clinical sites and clinical trial delay can hardly be avoided. In this study, we propose a multi-objective model to optimize the production quantity, where the clinical trial duration and the total production and operational costs are minimized. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic programming model to capture the dynamic inventory allocation process in the supply chains. Since this problem's solving time and required memory can increase significantly with the increase of the stage and scenario numbers, the progressive hedging algorithm is applied as the solution approach in this paper. In the numerical experiments, we study this algorithm's performance and compare the solving efficiency with the direct solution approach. In addition, we identify the optimal production quantity of clinical drugs and give a discussion about the tradeoffs between the clinical trial delay and total cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID REGRESSION
AB The paper introduces a new technique for growing trees for ordinal responses in the model-based framework. We consider the class of CUB mixtures which is particularly appropriate to model perceptions and evaluations, as it designs the response process as the combination of a personal feeling and an inherent uncertainty. In our proposal, the partitioning process is based on the local estimation of CUBregression models to profile responses according to feeling and uncertainty conditional to the splitting variables. In this regard, two alternative splitting criteria are introduced featuring both inferential and fitting issues. Moreover, the chosen modelling framework allows for advantageous visualization of the classification results. The proposal is illustrated using real data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Statistical Office, with focus on perceived trust towards the European Parliament. A benchmark study is conducted to settle the proposal among the available tree methods for ordinal responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the problem of mining erasable itemsets was identified in 2009, many algorithms have been proposed to improve mining time and/or memory usage. However, algorithms for mining maximal erasable itemsets (MaxEIs) have not been developed, and this article therefore focuses on this problem. Firstly, a GenMax-based algorithm (GenMax-EI) is developed as a baseline algorithm. Secondly, a proposition is developed for fast checking of whether or not an erasable itemset is maximal, and based on this proposition, we develop an algorithm entitled Flag-GenMax-EI for the fast mining of MEIs. Finally, a second proposition for the fast pruning of non-MaxEIs is also developed; based on this proposition, we propose an algorithm entitled PE-GenMax-EI for mining MaxEIs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The growing number of man-made and natural disasters in recent years has made the disaster management a focal point of interest and research. To assist and streamline emergency evacuation, changing the directions of the roads (called contraflow, a traffic control measure) is proven to be an effective, quick and affordable scheme in the action list of the disaster management. The contrafiow is computationally a challenging problem (known as NP-hard), hence developing an efficient method applicable to real-world and large-sized cases is a significant challenge in the literature. To cope with its complexities and to tailor to practical applications, a hybrid heuristic method based on a machine-learning model and bilevel optimization is developed. The idea is to try and test several contrafiow scenarios providing a training dataset for a supervised learning (regression) model which is then used in an optimization framework to find a better scenario in an iterative process. This method is coded as a single computer program synchronized with GAMS (for optimization), MATLAB (for machine learning), EMME3 (for traffic simulation), MS-Access (for data storage) and MS-Excel (as an interface), and it is tested using a real dataset from Winnipeg, and Sioux-Falls as benchmarks. The algorithm managed to find globally optimal solutions for the Sioux-Falls example and improved accessibility to the dense and congested central areas of Winnipeg just by changing the direction of some roads.

AB Emotion is a crucial indicator of the mental state influenced by environmental cognition, health, and intention. Therefore, modeling emotional patterns from daily communications is useful and vital for behavioral studies. This paper presents an analytical system that combines psycho-linguistics, statistical modeling, and computational algorithms to extract, analyze, and rank users' emotions from their emails. A new category of twelve emotions is proposed to identify a balanced set of six positive emotions and their negative counterparts, respectively. A lexicon-based algorithm is proposed to extract emotions from individual emails at the sentence level by combining thesaurus and parts-of-speech. A Markov chain model is then proposed for the time-dependent emotion stochastic process. Statistical characterization of the Markov chain model provides insights from four aspects: repetition, revisits, steady states, and emotional stability. Finally, an algorithm is discussed to compute the relative ratings of user emotions and subsequently ranking them from the most emotional to the least. As the verification that the proposed system is able to distinguish detailed emotional behaviors caused by mental activities, the Enron email dataset is used to model emotional patterns from 22 executives who were deemed guilty in the court of law vs. 21 non-guilty. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed system uncovers emotional patterns that are more distinct compared to the traditional emotion categorizations. It is also observed that the guilty subjects express more positive emotions in their emails compared to their non-guilty counterparts, while they are not more joyous than the non-guilty. Such insights have implications for employee risk assessment in organizations. The proposed approach can also be applied to other related areas such as mental health. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The emergence of "curse of dimensionality" issue as a result of high reduces datasets deteriorates the capability of learning algorithms, and also requires high memory and computational costs. Selection of features by discarding redundant and irrelevant features functions as a crucial machine learning technique aimed at reducing the dimensionality of these datasets, which improves the performance of the learning algorithm. Feature selection has been extensively applied in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning. Although many algorithms have been developed so far, they are still unsatisfying confronting high-dimensional data. This paper presented a new hybrid filter-based feature selection algorithm based on acombination of clustering and the modified Binary Ant System (BAS), called FSCBAS, to overcome the search space and high-dimensional data processing challenges efficiently. This model provided both global and local search capabilities between and within clusters. In the proposed method, inspired by genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, a damped mutation strategy was introduced that avoided falling into local optima, and a new redundancy reduction policy adopted to estimate the correlation between the selected features further improved the algorithm. The proposed method can be applied in many expert system applications such as microarray data processing, text classification and image processing in high-dimensional data to handle the high dimensionality of the feature space and improve classification performance simultaneously. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms using different classifiers on real-world datasets. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method reduced computational complexity significantly, and achieved better performance than the other feature selection methods.

AB Vehicle detection and classification is an important task for street surveillance and scene perception for robot navigation or autonomous vehicles. This research work focuses on traffic detection for real time applications using three components. The first component includes designing convolutional feature map based classifier based on multimodal optical flow features. The second component is to utilize an effective adaptive learning rate technique to deal with saddle points; and to propose an average covariance matrix based pre-conditioning approach. The third component is to separately train multimodal model using blur data which caters blur effect of real time data. Extensive experimental results with different learning rates, architectures are reported using benchmark datasets such as Apollo, KITTI, Cityscapes, Berkeley, Caltech, PASCAL VOC and self created. Experimental results demonstrate that in comparison to fully connected network based classifier, Network on Convolutional (NoC) feature map classifier provided approximately 10% hike in classification accuracy without data per-processing, and almost 18% improvement with pre-processed data. The blur model enhances accuracy by almost 15% on blurred data as compared to normal RGB data. Moreover, multimodal features provide 12% and 2% higher accuracy while using standard classifiers and NoC classifiers respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Mixed-model assembly line; Internal logistics
AB Pen and paper-based value stream mapping (VSM) is the established tool for recording processes, identifying waste and deriving recommendations for action. However, today, its application in manufacturing industry requires a high level of effort and is challenging due to product and process complexity, as well as dynamics. To overcome these shortcomings, we are developing a methodology to apply process mining (PM) to internal logistics for a mixed-model assembly line. The methodology combines multidimensional process mining (MDPM) techniques with proven principles of lean production and VSM. Firstly, internal logistics is modelled using existing event data by automatically mapping physical logistics activities (e.g. transport, store). Secondly, to enable PM, the event data is transformed into enriched event logs. Thirdly, the MDPM approach contains (1) a discovery analysis, (2) a performance analysis and (3) a conformance analysis including a reference process classification for each individual part and process. Finally, a waste analysis and strategy for practitioners is designed to identify and prioritise wasteful parts and processes. The methodology has been applied and evaluated in a case study at a German automotive manufacturer. In the case study, we analysed 7500 parts and 15 reference processes. An analysis for each individual part and process has not been available yet. We could both identify part-specific root causes (e.g. a long lead time) and process-specific root causes (e.g. a low trace fitness). The main contribution of this paper is to provide an MDPM methodology for practitioners to enable a continuous recording, evaluation and waste analysis of each individual part and process within internal logistics.

AB Variable selection is a vital problem in expert systems and in knowledge discovery. However, traditional variable selection methods achieve low accuracies on large and complex datasets because they do not consider the importance of variable combinations. A variable combination is a variable set in which the combined variables fit better than do other, redundant variables, but each of which, considered individually, may fit worse. Therefore, an association-based evolutionary ensemble variable selection method for multiple linear regression is proposed. Both greedy algorithms and stochastic algorithms are applied under an ensemble framework. Instead of ranking variables according to selection frequency, the associations among variables in local solutions are considered to identify important variable combinations. Experiments show that the proposed approach has a competitive performance for variable selection and outperforms some classic methods on large-scale datasets. The study is important for automated feature discovery for complex systems with multiple combined input variables. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Random Forest; Malware; Domain-generated algorithms
AB Malware detection is a challenge that has increased in complexity in the last few years. A widely adopted strategy is to detect malware by means of analyzing network traffic, capturing the communications with their command and control (C&C) servers. However, some malware families have shifted to a stealthier communication strategy, since anti-malware companies maintain blacklists of known malicious locations. Instead of using static IP addresses or domain names, they algorithmically generate domain names that may host their C&C servers. Hence, blacklist approaches become ineffective since the number of domain names to block is large and varies from time to time. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning approach using Random Forest that relies on purely lexical features of the domain names to detect algorithmically generated domains. In particular, we propose using masked N-grams, together with other statistics obtained from the domain name. Furthermore, we provide a dataset built for experimentation that contains regular and algorithmically generated domain names, coming from different malware families. We also classify these families according to their type of domain generation algorithm. Our findings show that masked N-grams provide detection accuracy that is comparable to that of other existing techniques, but with much better performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent development in the area of social networks has sought attention of the researchers to crunch and analyse the data and information of the users to retrieve relevant knowledge for further predictions and recommendations. Edge prediction is one such instance of social network analysis problem exploiting the prevailing data and information pertaining to the network such as: the attributes of the nodes and edges connecting the nodes in order to predict relationships potentially likely to exist in near future. Edge prediction has various applications in significant areas such as: knowledge mining, business recommendation systems, expert systems and bio informatics. In this work, we have classified the edge prediction problem in social network from five aspects: type of SN, feature used for edge prediction, edge prediction method, solution to edge prediction problem and performance measure. The strength of this article is the categorical review of the edge prediction methods in way to draw specific research problems to address further such as: complexity, accuracy, computational overhead and cost, scalability, generalization and performance issues. In addition to this, we have also provided an insightful of edge prediction method applied across various social network categories to understand the advantages and disadvantages to derive future work. The experimental exercise on real world social network particularly Face-book exhibits that the computation time taken in processing large network could be improved significantly may be through distributed techniques or so as the performance of edge prediction methods degrades with the scalability of the social networks. We did not focused upon any appropriate edge prediction methodology as it is out of the scope of the paper because we have exclusively reviewed the existing work done and we are exploring an appropriate ensemble method to precisely predict the future edges between nodes.

AB This paper outlines RSR, a relational social recommendation approach applied to a social graph comprised of relational entity profiles. RSR uses information extraction and learning methods to obtain relational facts about persons of interest from the Web, and generates an associative entity-relation social network from their extracted personal profiles. As a case study, we consider the task of peer recommendation at scientific conferences. Given a social graph of scholars, RSR employs graph similarity measures to rank conference participants by their relatedness to a user. Unlike other recommender systems that perform social rankings, RSR provides the user with detailed supporting explanations in the form of relational connecting paths. In a set of user studies, we collected feedbacks from participants onsite of scientific conferences, pertaining to RSR quality of recommendations and explanations. The feedbacks indicate that users appreciate and benefit from RSR explainability features. The feedbacks further indicate on recommendation serendipity using RSR, having it recommend persons of interest who are not apriori known to the user, oftentimes exposing surprising inter-personal associations. Finally, we outline and assess potential gains in recommendation relevance and serendipity using path-based relational learning within RSR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTERNET; SYSTEMS; KDD99
AB Intrusion detection and network traffic classification are two of the main research applications of machine learning to highly demanding data networks e.g. IoT/sensors networks. These applications present new prediction challenges and strict requirements to the models applied for prediction. The models must be fast, accurate, flexible and capable of managing large datasets. They must be fast at the training, but mainly at the prediction phase, since inevitable environment changes require constant periodic training, and real-time prediction is mandatory. The models need to be accurate due to the consequences of prediction errors. They need also to be flexible and able to detect complex behaviors, usually encountered in non-linear models and, finally, training and prediction datasets are usually large due to traffic volumes. These requirements present conflicting solutions, between fast and simple shallow linear models and the slower and richer non-linear and deep learning models. Therefore, the perfect solution would be a mixture of both worlds. In this paper, we present such a solution made of a shallow neural network with linear activations plus a feature transformation based on kernel approximation algorithms which provide the necessary richness and non-linear behavior to the whole model. We have studied several kernel approximation algorithms: Nystrom, Random Fourier Features and Fastfood transformation and have applied them to three datasets related to intrusion detection and network traffic classification.
   This work presents the first application of a shallow linear model plus a kernel approximation to prediction problems with highly demanding network requirements.

ID LOWER BOUNDS; HEURISTICS
AB In this paper, we address the Bin Packing Problem with Compatible Categories (BPCC), a challenging optimization problem that arises in the context of last mile distribution to nanostores in large cities, particularly in developing countries. By introducing the concept of incompatible categories of items to be delivered (i.e., types of items that cannot be transported together, such as food and cleaning products), as opposed to the item-by-item incompatibility found in previous literature, we aim to determine the best assignment of deliveries of distinct products to a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles in order to minimize the number of required vehicles (bins). To solve large instances of the BPCC that are commonly found in practice, we propose an efficient variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic that relies on a simple greedy heuristic to generate initial solutions and on simple and efficient neighborhoods as well as problem-tailored shaking procedures. We perform extensive computational experiments on a very large set of 8000 instances derived from benchmark datasets. The tested instances differ in terms of number of items (ranging from 201 to 1002), bin capacities, compatibility matrices and proportion of items that belong to the different categories. We also present two new mathematical formulations for the BPCC and compare them to the item-by-item bin packing formulation (Gendreau et al., 2004) using a high performance computer (HPC). The computational experiments indicate that our VNS algorithm can effectively solve the BPCC in very short CPU times. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The search for models to predict the prices of financial markets is still a highly researched topic, despite major related challenges. The prices of financial assets are non-linear, dynamic, and chaotic; thus, they are financial time series that are difficult to predict. Among the latest techniques, machine learning models are some of the most researched, given their capabilities for recognizing complex patterns in various applications. With the high productivity in the machine learning area applied to the prediction of financial market prices, objective methods are required for a consistent analysis of the most relevant bibliography on the subject. This article proposes the use of bibliographic survey techniques that highlight the most important texts for an area of research. Specifically, these techniques are applied to the literature about machine learning for predicting financial market values, resulting in a bibliographical review of the most important studies about this topic. Fifty-seven texts were reviewed, and a classification was proposed for markets, assets, methods, and variables. Among the main results, of particular note is the greater number of studies that use data from the North American market The most commonly used models for prediction involve support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks. It was concluded that the research theme is still relevant and that the use of data from developing markets is a research opportunity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tyres are one of the most important safety components on a vehicle. Ignoring or failing to correctly set the tyre pressure may lead to accidents, and can affect the vehicle's fuel efficiency and tyre lifespan. Hence, there is a need for a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that can effectively monitor the tyre condition. The current threshold-based TPMSs are characterised by a high number of false alarms. This is mainly due to: (i) the non-static and dynamic relationship between tyre pressure and temperature; and, (ii) the measurement error of the pressure temperature sensors that are used for data collection. In this paper, we propose an innovative decision rule-based approach to tyre monitoring. This approach relies on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), which is a well-known multicriteria classification and preference learning method. The DRSA takes a decision table as an input and it generates a collection of if-then decision rules as an output. The issue caused by the dynamic pressure/temperature relationship is solved by fixing one of the parameters and then generating the decision rules based on the other parameter. The problem of false alarms is solved by a discretisation of the scale of the fixed parameter. Based on these solutions, we designed two types of analysis levels: pressure-oriented analysis and temperature-oriented analysis. The proposed approach has been validated and implemented within an important travelling company that operates in the South of England. The real-world tests showed that the proposed approach has improved the current system and has led to a substantial reduction of false alarms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A substantial number of expert and intelligent systems rely on deep learning methods to solve problems in areas such as economics, physics, and medicine. Improving the accuracy of the activation functions used by such methods can directly and positively impact the overall performance and quality of the mentioned systems at no cost whatsoever. In this sense, enhancing the design of such theoretical fundamental blocks is of great significance as it immediately impacts a broad range of current and future real-world deep learning based applications. Therefore, in this paper, we turn our attention to the inter working between the activation functions and the batch normalization, which is practically a mandatory technique to train deep networks currently. We propose the activation function Displaced Rectifier Linear Unit (DReLU) by conjecturing that extending the identity function of ReLU to the third quadrant enhances compatibility with batch normalization. Moreover, we used statistical tests to compare the impact of using distinct activation functions (ReLU, LReLU, PReLU, ELU, and DReLU) on the learning speed and test accuracy performance of standardized VGG and Residual Networks state-of-the-art models. These Convolutional Neural Networks were trained on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, the most commonly used deep learning computer vision datasets. The results showed DReLU speeded up learning in all models and datasets. Besides, statistical significant performance assessments (p < 0.05) showed DReLU enhanced the test accuracy presented by ReLU in all scenarios. Furthermore, DReLU showed better test accuracy than any other tested activation function in all experiments with one exception, in which case it presented the second best performance. Therefore, this work demonstrates that it is possible to increase performance replacing ReLU by an enhanced activation function. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personality is a combination of various characteristics and qualities of an individual. It may be affected by the growth and evolution of one's values, attributes, relationships with the community, personal memories of life events, habits, and skills. Behaviours and decisions of an individual are largely directed by his/her personality. Identification of such a personality trait can be performed based on an individual's handwriting features. Handwriting may be unique for each person and a person's nature, behaviour, and certain psychological aspects can be inferred based on it. It is introduced as the field of graphology, also called graphoanalysis, to analyze personality based on handwriting. We perceived that many researchers have worked on personality and/or behaviour identification based on handwriting, however, most of them were limited to a few numbers of features. According to graphology, there is a vast range of features of handwriting strokes which carry psychological characteristics of the writer. In this survey, we present links between handwriting and personality psychology and examine different mechanisms for features extraction to predict a writer's personality. Psychologically supported handwriting features help to understand personality traits. The paper relates these features and encourages the use of computer-based graphology for personality prediction. It also discusses applications of graphology in various fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) has become a very active research area in recent years. However, minimizing total fiowtime in DPFSP, a very relevant and meaningful objective for today's dynamic manufacturing environment, has not captured much attention so far. In this paper, we address the DPFSP with total flowtime criterion. To suit the needs of different CPU time demands and solution quality, we present three constructive heuristics and four metaheuristics. The constructive heuristics are based on the well-known LR and NEH heuristics. The metaheuristics are based on the high-performing frameworks of discrete artificial bee colony, scatter search, iterated local search, and iterated greedy, which have been applied with great success to closely related scheduling problems. We explore the problem-specific knowledge and accelerations to evaluate neighboring solutions for the considered problem. We introduce advanced and effective technologies like a referenced local search, a strategy to escape from local optima, and an enhanced intensive search method for the presented metaheuristics. A comprehensive computational campaign against the closely related and well performing algorithms in the literature is carried out. The results show that both the presented constructive heuristics and meta heuristics are very effective for solving the DPFSP with total fiowtime criterion. (C) 2019 The Authors.

DE Max-min fair allocation; Indivisible resources; Divisible resources;

ID APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM
AB Resource allocation is a classic problem in economics and computer science. The application scenarios of resource allocation include inheritance settlements, computation resource sharing and so on. This paper focuses on the max-min fair allocation of resources in which m resources need to be allocated to n agents while maximizing the minimum utility of any agent. When money transfer is not allowed, the existing work on max-min fair allocation only focuses on the fair allocation of indivisible resources. However, in real applications, the allocated resource set may simultaneously include indivisible resources and divisible resources, e.g., the allocated resources in distributed systems include the indivisible CPU resources, the divisible storage resource and the divisible bandwidth resource. The combination of indivisible resources and divisible resources creates a new challenge and requires us to consider how to coordinate the allocations of indivisible resources and divisible resources in the allocation process. Therefore, we investigate the combined max-min fair allocation problem in which the allocated resource set consists of both indivisible resources and divisible resources. We present a 6+2 root 10 + epsilon (epsilon > 0)-factor approximation algorithm for the restricted case where u(ij) is an element of {0, u(j)} (i.e., the utility of a resource j is either 0 or u(j) for each agent i) and the agent valuations for the divisible resources are in proximity to each other. Moreover, we propose an approximation algorithm for the general case based on the augmented flow idea. Experiments conducted on real data show that the average performance of the proposed approximation algorithm is better than 80% of the performance of the optimal algorithm, which requires exponential time in the worst case unless P = NP. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first approximation algorithm for the general case of the combined max-min fair allocation problem when money transfer is not allowed. The proposed algorithm can be adopted to design more efficient expert systems that apply to resource allocation in distributed systems, inheritance settlements and so on. The adoption of the proposed algorithm contributes to promoting the broader application of expert systems in the fair allocation of computation resources and social resources. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can perform well in real applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to adapt a well-known interactive and multi-criteria decision-making method, TODIM, to the portfolio allocation process. The proposed method is applied to empirical US equity data by employing variance, correlation and returns calculated on different observation periods as decision criteria. A total of 440 different configurations are applied to analyze the impact of several parameters in TODIM. Based on the results for the test period, outperforming TODIM configurations are elected. In the validation period, it is empirically demonstrated that portfolios based on outperforming TODIM configurations yield significantly better results than equally weighted portfolios (1/N) and insignificantly inferior results than the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) in terms of the Sharpe ratio. However, TODIM may still be a better choice than MVP for investors sensitive to concentration risk and turnover costs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bromelain is an important industrial proteolytic enzyme which has great commercial value and is of wide application in food, beverage, tenderization, cosmetic, textile and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, the core-shell- shell magnetic polymeric microspheres (Fe3O4@SiO2@P(NIPAM-co-AIM)/Ni2+) composed of an SiO2-coated Fe3O4 magnetite core and a Ni2+-immobilized cross-linked poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-propylimidazole) (NIPAM-co-AIM) shell were synthesized via distillation-precipitation polymerization. The Ni2+ cations in the magnetic polymeric microspheres shell provided docking sites for histidine and the microspheres exhibited excellent performance in the separation of bromelain with a binding capacity as high as 198 mg/g, and the recovery of enzyme activity could achieve 80%. It was found that the microspheres showed excellent performance for separation and purification of bromelain from the crude extract of pineapple peel, moreover the enzyme structure remained unchanged before and after elution process.

AB Starch nanoparticles (SNP) were produced employing a simple ultrasound method without chemical additives from cassava, corn, and yam starches, which contain 18%, 25% and 30% amylose, respectively. Simultaneously, starch microparticles (SMP) were also obtained, which were significantly smaller than the native starch granules. The yield of the process for all starch sources was 12 +/- 1% SNP and 88 +/- 5% SMP, starting with aqueous starch suspensions at 10% and 30 min of sonication. Yam starch (higher amylose content) resulted in smaller SMP (1-3 mu m) and SNP (8-32 nm) than did those obtained from corn (SMP = 3-6 mu m; SNP = 36-68 nm) and cassava (SMP = 3-7 mu m; SNP = 35-65 nm) starches. Nanoparticles from all starch sources had lower crystallinity and lower thermal stability than did the native starches or SMP. Ultrasonication was efficient to yield SNP and SMP without the addition of any chemical reagent or employing a purification step.

AB The aim was to determine conditions under which rutin can be retained during production of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) dough. Tartary buckwheat flour was hydrothermally treated by mixing with water at 25, 40, 60, 80 and 95 degrees C, with unprocessed Tartary buckwheat flour as control. With hydrothermal treatments at 25, 40 and 60 degrees C, most of the rutin was transformed to quercetin. However, for hydrothermal treatments at 80 and 95 degrees C, rutin was retained due to denaturation of the rutin-degrading enzymes during hydrothermal treatment. This is the first report to describe a temperature threshold for denaturation of rutin-degrading enzymes in any buckwheat material. Tartary buckwheat dough produced at 95 degrees C contained 12 mg rutin/g dry matter. Based on these characteristics, dough from hydrothermally treated Tartary buckwheat is a promising, rutin-rich functional food material.

AB Aptamer probes provide an opportunity for achieving rapid and on-site detection of food contaminants. Herein, we proposed a general design strategy for aptamer probes enabling enzyme-free amplified, ultrafast and one-test tube homogeneous detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)). The key feature of the aptamer probe is designed with dual-terminal proximity structures, allowing the binding of one molecule to light up two fluorophores, leading to enzyme-free amplification and a remarkable improvement of signal to background ratio and sensitivity for AFB1 detection. This aptamer probe could accommodate quick response to AFB1, and the detection process could be finished within 1 min, ranking one of the quickest assays for AFB1. AFB1 detection of broad bean paste and peanut oil conferred satisfactory recoveries ranging from 90.3% to 114.8%. Contributed to the generality and simplicity of the design strategy, this structure-switching probe could potentially act as a general platform of on-site detection for food safety.

AB The influence of particle size and chemical composition of three different cornmeals on the resistant starch (RS) content formed during the hydrothermal treatment was studied. The changes in reducing sugars and phenolic acids in different fractions caused by the hydrothermal treatment were correlated with RS content. The cornmeal with smaller particle size had higher RS content (202 mg/g). The hydrothermal treatment promoted a reduction in the total reducing sugars (46.7-84.5%), availability of free phenolic acids (256.7%) and reduction of the bound phenolic acids (71.1%). The correlation between RS contents and phenolic acids was determined by multivariate statistics and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that hydroxybenzoic and ferulic acids influence the formation of RS similar to type 5, amylose-phenol complex. The texture profile parameters (TPA) of cornmeal were negatively correlated with RS and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed consistency with this behavior.

ID RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES
AB The influences of atmospheric pressure plasma jet on different physicochemical properties of corn starch were evaluated after treated with the plasma jet (30 min) at different strengths (400W-800 W). Our results demonstrated that residual aging effects of plasma on starch could be eliminated by washing the treated samples with distilled water at a ratio of 1: 30, w/v. After plasma and washing treatments, significant (p < 0.05) reductions in pasting properties including peak viscosity, final viscosity, and setback of starch samples (up to -87.1%, -92.0%, and -93.3%, respectively) were observed with increasing plasma intensity. Apparently, plasma jet could increase the solubility and paste clarity of starch sample. Surface morphological characterization illustrated that plasma etching resulted in some physical changes on starch granules. Modifications in these physicochemical properties of corn starch by employing the plasma jet treatment might be useful in food applications requiring starch ingredients of low viscosity and high paste clarity.

AB The effects of alkali (NaHCO3 or Na2CO3) on the quality and protein polymerization of buckwheat Chinese steamed bread (CSB) were investigated. The alkali addition increased the specific volume of CSB, for NaHCO3 from 1.84 ml/g (control) to 2.66 ml/g. Image analysis showed that alkali increased the pore area fractions. The addition of Na2CO3 exhibited a greater pore count and lower pore average size. The texture properties were improved with the increase of crumb hardness and resilience. The extractability of protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium (SDSEP) decreased. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE showed an obvious decrease in the intensity of protein bands with lower molecular weight, while intensity of higher molecular protein bands increased. This demonstrated that alkali addition promoted protein aggregation in buckwheat CSB. In addition, the content of degydroalanine and lanthionine increased and free SH decreased, which indicated alkali addition prompted protein to form dehydroalanine-derived and disulfide cross-linkings.

AB Purple sweet potatoes are known for its vibrant purple color due to high level of anthocyanins. A polyethylene glycol based ultrasonic-assisted green extraction (PEG-UAE) of anthocyanins from purple sweet potato was proposed. Different types of PEG were tested for anthocyanin extraction along with PEG concentration, liquid-tosolid ratio, ultrasonic temperature and time were investigated for its impact on viscosity and extraction efficiency. The optimum extraction condition, 42 mL/g of ratio, 83% of PEG 200 concentration, 64 degrees C of ultrasonic temperature and 80 min of sonication time, resulted in better extraction of anthocyanins (83.78 mg CE/100 g DW) and phenolics (994.88 mg GAE/100 g DW). Using UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS, ten anthocyanin and six non-anthocyanin compounds were identified and characterized, with the highest peak area for cyanidin-3-caffeoyl-p-hydroxybenzoyl sophoroside-5-glucoside (25.9%). Moreover, the anthocyanins and phenolics extraction yield along with antioxidant activity were negatively correlated with PEG viscosity, on which ultrasonication has profound effects.

AB Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) assisted with electrochemical techniques was applied for simultaneous determination of Sudan II and III at a surface of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) modified carbon paste electrode. Characterization of the ZnONPs and the nanostructured modified electrode was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. Response surface methodology using central composite rotatable design was employed to design of experiments and achieving to optimum values of variables. For simultaneous determination of Sudan II and III, electrochemical second order data were obtained by changing of pulse height in differential pulse voltammetry technique. MCR-ALS was performed on the data to obtain the decomposition peaks of analytes. Then, the detection limits were obtained 1.87 and 2.62 nM for Sudan II and III, respectively. Finally, this method used for the analysis of the two analytes in real samples.

AB The taste and aroma quality of Tieguanyin tea fluctuate seasonally and yearly. However, the compounds responsible for the seasonal and year variations of metabolic pattern and its sensory quality are far from clear. 60 Tieguanyin tea samples harvested in different years and seasons were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and chemometrics. Principal component analysis (PCA) explained 33.2% of the total variance, while orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) can obtain potential metabolites with better discrimination, and with (RX)-X-2 and Q(2) of cross-validation as 0.974 and 0.937, respectively. Subsequently, heat map analysis (HCA) visualized relationships between Tieguanyin teas with these significantly different potential metabolites by Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the best discriminate metabolites contributing to different sensory qualities were revealed by stepwise liner discrimination analysis (SLDA) with 100% accuracy rate. The present strategy also exhibited great potential for untargeted metabolomics of other foods.

K, Ca, Na, and P were found in IJS. X-ray patterns, which showed that nanocrystals form the IJS according to the PDF-4 simulation. The functional properties were affected by the Ca inclusion, which originated electrostatic interactions. The gelatinization temperatures shifted to high values and exhibited an unfolding. The calculation of the IR absorption coefficient (beta) of the gelatinized samples as a function of the Ca2+ for the C-OH showed that the Van der Waals interaction causes the changes in the rheological-mechanical properties. The SEM images demonstrated that starch without alkali exhibited a porous network structure, while the starch with lime exhibited flakes and porous network. The gels of Jicama starch with Ca(OH)(2) showed a viscoelastic behavior (G' > G'') with a reduction of their elastic module.

AB This study was to evaluate the effect of graft copolymer (CTS-g-SA) of chitosan (CTS) and salicylic acid (SA) on the storability of grapefruit fruits during postharvest storage. Results indicate that the graft copolymer treatment significantly depressed green mold caused by Penicillium digitatum. The graft copolymer application kept fruit firmness without impairing the fruit quality. Moreover, the graft copolymer treatment inhibited the activity and gene expression of cell wall-modifying enzymes such as polygalacturonase, cellulase, pectin methylesterase, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, beta-galactosidase, and suppressed the modification of cell wall components including covalently bound polysaccharide (sodium carbonate soluble pectin, 24% KOH-soluble fraction), which were associated with fruit softening. These results suggested that graft copolymer application can be recognized as a postharvest technique to suppress rotting and delay softening through inhibiting solubilization of cell wall polysaccharides.

The resulting protein-enriched fractions had 36-38% protein on a moisture free basis, accounting for 43% of the total available protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of the dry-enriched protein fractions showed a similar protein profile to that of the original navy bean flour. The functional properties of these fractions were examined and compared with the commercial soybean protein concentrate as well as navy bean protein isolate obtained by a conventional wet fractionation process. These electrostatically separated protein fractions exhibited superior solubility at their intrinsic pH as well as superior emulsion stability (ES), foam expansion (FE) and foam volume stability (FVS) compared to the wet-fractionated navy bean protein isolate that was almost depleted of albumins, exhibiting poor solubility and foaming properties. These results suggest electrostatic separation as a promising route to deliver functional protein concentrates as novel food formulation ingredients.

AB After carboxylic acid deamidation upon heating (CADH), wheat gluten still contains a total of similar to 10% insoluble fractions, of which similar to 10% is starch, which depreciate the values of wheat gluten. To elucidate gluten-starch interactions and their role in the deamidation behavior of gluten, the macrostructural characteristics of gluten citric acid suspensions of different concentrations (1% and 10%, w/v) and with different types of residual starch chains (achieved by enzyme hydrolyzed by a-amylase and/or glucoamylase assisted by sonication) were investigated. We found the degradation of long starch chains and branched short chains induced dramatic bond-cleavages in insoluble glutenins and gliadins. FTIR and SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that without these two types of chains in the precipitates, the insoluble deamidated wheat gluten exhibited minimal changes in the molecular force and the conformation. Their glycosylation, hydrophobic force and hydrogen bonds between amylopectin and small proteins, such as LMW-GS and alpha, beta, gamma-gliadins, were detected. FTIR suggested that the associations between gliadins and amylopectin were covalent. Gluten-starch interactions were likely to cause an incomplete dissolution of wheat gluten during CADH. A simple model was proposed to clarify the aggregation state and the relationships between starch granules and wheat gluten components during CADH.

AB The influence of maltitol on the physicochemical properties of wheat flour dough and bread were evaluated in terms of texture, thermal features, water mobility, and retrogradation kinetics. The presence of maltitol could slow down the fermentation rate of dough. Breads with 6% of maltitol exhibited lower hardness and chewiness, with a significant decrease of 42% and 31%, respectively (p < 0.05). The use of maltitol could remarkably enhance the gelatinization temperature (p < 0.05) that was confirmed by DSC tool. Through the approach of LF-NMR, the addition of maltitol could increase the mobility of immobilized water, further retarded bread staling. The k values from chewiness and total signal amplitude in breads with 2% and 4% levels of maltitol were smaller than the control, which was proven through kinetics of retrogradation analysis, revealing an overall retarding effect of maltitol in prevention of bread staling.

AB Bananas are a recommended food source to alleviate vitamin A deficiency because they contain a high ratio of provitamin A precursors. The objective of this study was to investigate carotenoid accumulation pattern in banana fruits during postharvest ripening and the mechanisms regulating this process. Ripe banana pulp had an unusually high alpha-/beta-carotene ratio (1.05), and the carotenoid contents increased (p <= 0.05) under light and high temperature. We analyzed the sequences, transcript levels, and functions of genes involved in carotenoid synthesis. The high ratio of alpha-/beta-carotene in ripe banana fruit was explained by the high flux to the a-carotene biosynthetic pathway, as reflected by high transcript levels of LCYE, and the weak flux to the beta-carotene branch of the biosynthetic pathway due to inactive MaLCYB1.2. High temperature during ripening up-regulated the transcript levels of genes involved in the alpha- and beta-carotene biosynthesis pathways and the activities of their encoded enzymes.

AB Effects of high temperature-high humidity (HT-HH) storage on the flavor profile of rice were investigated. Volatile compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, and furans increased when rice was stored under HT-HH conditions, leading to a pronounced deterioration in rice quality. Correspondingly, the fatty acid content of the rice significantly increased during storage. Lipid oxidation was also accelerated under HT-HH conditions leading to the formation of peroxides. However, catalase activity was reduced under these conditions promoting the accumulation of peroxides. For the first time, insights into the genetic mechanisms responsible for these changes were obtained using RNA-sequencing to establish the flavor metabolic pathways in rice. Under HT-HH conditions, gene expression of lipase increased while that of catalase decreased, leading to faster hydrolysis and oxidation of the rice lipids. As a result, a series of lipid degradation products was formed (such as fatty acids, aldehydes, and ketones) that decreased the rice flavor quality.

AB To explore the mechanism of gastric digestion of surimi gels induced by different adding amount of transglutaminase (TGase), the structures and gastric digestion of surimi gels were studied. With adding amount of TGase increasing, the crosslinking degree of surimi gels increased, the surface hydrophobicity reduced progressively, and high molecular polymers formed. The relationship between content of free amino acids and digestion time of surimi gels showed an S-shaped curve and could fit the Logistic equation (x = Mx(0)/x(0)+(M-x(0))e(-kMt)) well (R-2=0.957-0.998). There were two digestion modes of surimi gels induced by different amounts of TGase. The time that reached to the maximum digestibility was prolonged with the increase of TGase adding amount. The results suggested that adding proper amount TGase to surimi was conducive to sustained release of nutrients and a theoretical foundation of surimi gels gastric digestion was built for surimi industry.

AB This work aims to study the effect of the addition of saffron extract on fresh pasta in-vitro digestibility. Fresh pasta was formulated with different concentrations of saffron extracts (0.2 and 0.4 % w/w), cooked at two different times (1.5 and 3 min), and in vitro digested (oral, gastric and intestinal stages). Oil was added to pasta before digestion to evaluate the presence of lipids on starch and crocin bioaccessibility. Saffron enrichment and oil addition slowed down the digestion of starch, thus, decreasing the glycemic index of pasta. Concentration of saffron and oil addition contributed to crocin release in the digestion fluids, with the opposite effect of cooking time. Isomerization from trans to cis was enhanced by both, cooking and oil addition. Bioaccessibility of total crocins varied from 2.9 +/- 1.1, to 97 +/- 3%. Finally, the trans: cis isomers distribution was only close to 50: 50 in enriched-pasta cooked during 3 min or with oil addition.

The identification of CA in candies was performed through the Raman and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra along with the equivalent spectral data from the natural CA dye. A modified silver colloidal solution was used in order to obtain SERS activity of CA at very low concentration in colloidal aqueous solution. Theoretical calculations allow infer about both the CA/silver surface interaction nature and on the orientation of CA on the surface. The electronic spectroscopic (UV-Vis) data allowed quantify CA in candies; the amount resulted nearly identical to that determined from HPLC traditional measurements. The present results should contribute to the health of children consumers.

AB Maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases ( MFAses) are promising tools for a variety of food industry applications because of their ability to hydrolyze starch into maltooligosaccharides. However, high thermostability is a key requirement for enzymes used in these applications. In this work, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ and Na+ on the thermostability of an MFAse from Bacillus stearothermophilus ( Bst-MFAse). The results showed that Ca2+ and Na+ synergistically prolong the half-life of Bst-MFAse. The most significant improvement, which preserved 71.1% of initial activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for 180 min, was achieved by adding 10 mM Ca2+ and 40mM Na+ simultaneously. The increase in Bst-MFAse thermostability imparted by the addition of Ca2+ and Na+ may be associated with an important Ca2+- Na+- Ca2+ triad structure. This study provides an effective way to enhance the thermostability of Bst-MFAse and related enzymes.

AB The sterols and triterpene dialcohols composition is an important parameter to assess the authenticity of the high value and prone to adulteration extra virgin olive oil. The official methods used to carry out this analysis are time-consuming, labor- intensive and require a high amount of solvents. In this work a simple and time-saving method, based on two solid phase extraction (SPE) steps was developed. After oil saponification, the un-saponifiablematter was purified by polymeric SPE and then the sterols and triterpene dialcohols were isolated by an in-house packed small particle silica gel SPE and analyzed by GC-FID. Results obtained analyzing a sample of extra virgin olive oil, olive oil and refined olive pomace oil with the proposed method showed a good agreement with those obtained with the International Olive Council (IOC) official method. Thus, the use of the proposed method allows a rapid screening for extra virgin olive oils authentication.

AB Lectin was incubated in corresponding acidic buffers (pH 1.0-3.5) for a certain period (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h) at 25 degrees C. Low-pH induced changes in structure, allergenicity and in vitro digestibility of lectin from black turtle bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated in the present study. Results indicated that the alteration in structure was a progressive unfolding process mainly depending on pH environment, and the treated lectin attained a stable state at 8 h. Electrophoretic, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses suggested that lectin monomers appeared in the solutions of pH < 2.0. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed that thermal stability of lectin weakened in low pH environments. Furthermore, ELISA and in vitro digestion assay showed allergenicity and digestibility significantly decreased with the structural alterations. These results showed low-pH treatments have great potential to reduce the damage of legumes protein consumption.

AB A label-free fluorescence assay for resveratrol determination is presented for the first time. The approach was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), via competitive supramolecular recognition, between p-sulfonated calix[6] arene (CX6)-modified reduced graphene oxide (CX6@RGO) and a probe-resveratrol complex. The probe molecule (Rhodamine B or rhodamine 123) had a strong fluorescence signal, and its fluorescence was quenched by CX6@RGO, based on FRET. When the target molecule was added to CX6@RGO, the probe molecule was displaced by resveratrol, and a host-guest complex, CX6@RGO-resveratrol formed, turning-on the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence intensity of the CX6@RGO-probe complex increased linearly with increased resveratrol concentrations (2.0-40.0 mu M). The proposed approach was used to determine resveratrol in red wine with satisfactory detection limits and recoveries. Compared with traditional determination methods, our procedure is advantageous because it saves time, is easy to operate, and does not require sample pretreatment.

ID COOKED RICE; LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS; AMYLOSE; COOKING
AB Autoclave cooking is used to produce "convenience" rice. In this study, autoclaving effects on sensory properties are investigated, and mechanistic explanations in terms of the underlying molecular structure are explored by analyzing this structure by size-exclusion chromatography and fitting the results with models based on bio-synthetic processes. Compared to steam cooking, autoclaving produces stickier texture, and slightly affects hardness. It is found that molecular sizes of leached starch of both autoclaved and steam cooked rice are similar, but significantly smaller than that of the parent grain starch; model fitting parameters of leached amylopectin and amylose structures between autoclaved rice and steam cooked rice display no large variations. The amount of leached amylopectin (an important texture-controlling parameter) of autoclaved rice is higher than that of steam cooked rice. Correlation analysis indicates that, compared to steam-cooked rice, the stickier texture of autoclaved rice is caused by more amylopectin leaching during autoclaving.

AB Broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) is largely cultivated in southern Italy. It is an important source of phytonutrients, which are partially lost during postharvest storage. The aim of this work was to evaluate the overall effect of five different low-intensity light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the quality parameters of broccoli florets over 20 d of cold storage. The level of ascorbic acid, chlorophylls, carotenoids, phenolic compounds and soluble proteins, as well as colour analysis, were evaluated. Green LED increased the chlorophyll and ascorbic acid content; white, red and yellow LEDs had a positive effect on the redox status of broccoli. Globally, only green LED had a statistically significant positive effect when considering all analysed parameters and could be proposed to prolong the shelf life of broccoli during cold storage.

AB Aglianicone is an autochthonous variety of black berried wine grape cultivated exclusively in southern Italy, but with limited information on the molecular composition of its grapes. HRMAS NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the primary metabolome of Aglianicone grape pulp from two different vineyards and the observed metabolomic changes reflected the local terroir conditions or harvesting years. Moreover, the berries pulp metabolome was related to Apparent Electrical Conductivity (ECa) maps deriving from on-site near-surface geophysical measurements of vineyard soils obtained by an electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique. Most of primary metabolites of Aglianicone grape varied systematically as a function of the spatial variability of soil properties as well as vineyards terroir and harvesting years. Therefore, the proposed approach that couples HRMAS NMR spectroscopy with ECa maps of vineyard soils represents an innovative support for wine producers who can select the best vine/soil combination to ensure the maximum wine quality.

AB Physicochemical properties, predicted glycemic index (pGI) and bread qualities of a non-pigmented white rice flour (Hom Mali, HM) and a pigmented rice flour (Riceberry rice flour, RB) were investigated. In the present study, RB (15.3% amylose) contained higher total polyphenolics, anthocyanins, and ferric reduction activity power than HM (21.3% amylose). RB had lower swelling power and higher gelatinization temperatures. In addition, RB contained higher levels of beneficial resistant starch (RS) and lower levels of slowly digestible starch (SDS) with medium pGI. RB provided slower glucose release than HM. The pasting characteristics showed that peak and final viscosity, trough and setback value, and breakdown of RB was lower than HM. RB bread had lower cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and adhesiveness than HM bread. Furthermore, RB bread demonstrated lower starch hydrolysis and pGI than HM bread. These findings suggest that anthocyanin-rich RB could be used as an alternative food ingredient for gluten-free bread.

AB The sequential application of a polymer inclusion membrane (PIM), composed of poly(vinylidenefluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) and the anionic extractant Aliquat 336, and a microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) gas-permeable membrane was utilized for the first time to develop a flow analysis (FA) system, for the automatic determination of trace levels of arsenate (As(V)) in drinking water as arsine. The system incorporated a flow-through extraction cell for separation and preconcentration of arsenate and a gas-diffusion cell for the separation of arsine prior to its spectrophotometric determination based on the discoloration of a potassium permanganate solution. Under optimal conditions the FA system is characterized by a limit of detection of 3.0 mu g L-1 As(V) and repeatability of 1.8% (n= 5, 25 mu g L-1 As(V)) and 2.8% (n= 5, 50 mu g L-1 As(V)). The newly developed FA method was successfully applied to the determination of arsenate in drinking water samples in the mu g L(-)1 concentration range.

AB Power ultrasound as an emerging processing technology has been investigated for stimulating seeds to enhance germination and accumulation of health-promoting metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and phenolic compounds. This work was undertaken to evaluate the effects of power ultrasound (25 kHz) on the nutritional properties of germinated oats, and the microstructure of oat groats after treatment. The changes in the external and internal microstructures of the ultrasound-treated oats kernel were investigated using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and 3D X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT). Physicochemical properties of oats including GABA, free sugars, avenanthramides, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacities were enhanced after germination. Furthermore, the power ultrasound treatment for 5 min after soaking significantly enhanced the GABA (48-96 h), alanine (24-96 h), succinic acid (48-72 h), total phenolic content (24 h), and total avenanthramides (24 h) in the germinated oats.

AB In this study, the impacts of pregelatinized starch (PGS) with different conditions (2-8%, w/w) on the characteristics, microstructures and quality parameters of glutinous rice flour and dumplings were determined. The results indicated PGS favored the formation of elastic gel-like network structure on starch granules. PGS addition, especially at high PGS content, significantly influenced the granular, crystalline and molecular structure of glutinous dumplings, probably due to the structural amorphization of PGS. Accordingly, the dumplings complexation with suitable PGS exhibited a better storage, an increased content of slowly digestible starch (SDS), and integrated quality attributes including transmittance, cracking rate, and textural properties via weakening the water mobility. Pearson's correlation matrix exhibited that the quality of glutinous dumplings could be well predicted by physicochemical properties of rice flour. Thus, it is feasible to improve the textural and nutritional attribute of glutinous rice dumplings via simply complexation with PGS.

AB Phenolic compounds are highly valuable products that remain trapped in grape pomace, an abundant winery by-product. Therefore, efficient extraction procedures of these compounds represent a route for grape pomace valorisation. Here we performed a screening of the factors affecting the aqueous enzymatic extraction of phenolic compounds from Syrah grape pomace, including the following independent variables: temperature, pH, pectinase, cellulase and tannase; and a subsequent optimization through response surface methodology. At the optimal region, the enzymatic treatment enhanced the extraction yield of phenolics by up to 66% and its antioxidant capacity by up to 80%, reducing the incubation time and enzyme doses in respect to previous studies. We found that tannase raises the antioxidant capacity of the extract by the liberation of gallic acid, while cellulose favours the liberation of p-coumaric acid and malvidin-3-O-glucoside. We also tested the procedure in different grape pomace varieties, verifying its wide applicability.

AB The interaction between commercial orange pectin (COP) and sodium caseinate (SC) was studied using FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, and LSCM. The effect of different conditions on the formation and separation of COP-SC complex was determined. The extraction of the orange pectin using SC precipitation (SCOP) was performed, and the physicochemical properties of SCOP were determined and compared with the orange pectin extracted by alcohol precipitation (APOP). The results showed that the electrostatic interaction was the main interaction between these two polymers, and it was strongly dependent on pH, COP/SC ratio, and salt concentration. The mixture of COP and SC formed an electrostatic complex in the pH range of 1.5-6.8 with the absence of NaCl. The recovery rate of SCOP and precipitation rate of SC were 89.43% and 98.33% when the ratio was 1:15. The physicochemical properties of SCOP were almost the same as APOP.

AB In this article, a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI)-based study was designed in order to selectively map and compare the peptides present in slices of Biceps femoris, Istrian dry-cured ham muscles, from the same production batch. A systematic sample preparation process was optimized, which comprises embedding samples of Biceps femoris, cryo-sectioning, glass slide mounting, a nine-step washing protocol, MALDI matrix sublimation and recrystallization. This process efficiently preserved sample morphology and removed the high salt and lipid content, which was present in the samples as a result of the dry-curing production process. We show that MALDI MSI, in combination with principal component analysis, can be used to monitor subtle changes in proteolysis outcome within the same dry-cured ham muscle type, resulting from differentially resolved spatial data. The peptides identified in Istrian dry-cured ham may therefore be studied further, as putative biomarkers for this specific product.

AB The effects of frying temperature and time on the amylose content, thermodynamic properties, crystalline properties, and pasting properties of starch in wheat-flour based noodles were investigated. The amylose content increased when the frying temperature increased or the frying time extended. Differential scanning calorimetry confirmed the formation of starch-lipid complexes Delta H of the complexes increased sharply from 0.91 to 1.40 J/g with increased frying temperature, while it initially increased from 1.01 to 1.40 J/g and then decreased rapidly to 1.17 J/g with prolonged frying time. These observations were consistent with the results of relative crystallinity. Rapid viscosity analysis showed that the viscosities decreased by the increasing frying temperature or the prolonging frying time. The results showed that the deep-frying process destroyed the starch structure and led to the formation of starch-lipid complexes.

AB Honey is the natural sweet substance produced by Apis mellifera honeybees in Europe. Depending on the country/region, the A. mellifera subspecies native to Europe belong to three different lineages: A (A. m. iberiensis), M (A. m. iberiensis and A. m. mellifera) and C (A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica). In this work, two DNA-based approaches were developed with the aim of entomological authentication of European honeys. A cytb specific PCR assay was proposed to identify A-lineage honeybees, while a second method based on real-time PCR coupled to high resolution melting analysis targeting the COI gene was developed to differentiate C- and M-lineages honeybees. The proposed methodologies were validated successfully with honeys of known origin and applied to the entomological authentication of 20 commercial samples from different European countries. The results highlight the predominance of honeys from C-lineage honeybees in Europe, except in Iberian Peninsula countries (honey from A-lineage honeybees).

AB This study aims to prepare water-soluble beta-1,3-glucan (WSG) by hydrolysis of curdlan with H2O2. The hydrolysis conditions were optimised as follows: reaction time of 40 min, H2O2 concentration of 2%, temperature of 85 degrees C and NaOH concentration of 2 mol/l. Under these reaction conditions, WSG yields of up to 83% could be achieved. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of WSG revealed a molecular weight of 5268 Da. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the polysaccharide structure of the WS products. HPLC analysis of the complete hydrolysate of WSG indicated that WSG product consisted of glucose. Taken together, the results demonstrate that preparation of WSG by hydrolysis of curdlan with H2O2 is a promising approach with practical significance.

AB Herein, we improve the procedure for organic rice authentication using compound-specific delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses of fatty acids and amino acids, addressing the increasing demand for accurate methods to confirm organic authenticity. Organic rice (OR) and pesticide-free rice (PFR) featured higher values of delta N-15(bulk) than conventional rice (CR), whereas the corresponding differences between OR and PFR were insignificant. Additionally, OR, PFR, and CR could be discriminated based on some delta C-13(amino-acid) and delta N-15(amino-acid) values. delta C-13(bulk) was correlated with most delta C-13(fatty-acid) (r >= 0.596) values, and delta N-15(bulk) was strongly correlated with most delta N-15(amino-acid) (r >= 0.834) values. The first component in the orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis model allowed for a clear separation between OR and PFR, and good predictability (Q(2)Y = 0.506). Thus, the present study improves the reliability of organic authentication when bulk stable isotope ratio analysis alone is insufficient for the accurate discrimination of OR, PFR, and CR.

AB The reaction kinetics of five primary wine anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, petunidin-3-O-glucoside, and malvidin-3-O-glucoside) and (-)-epicatechin with the presence of acetaldehyde were evaluated in model wine solutions at a range of varying temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees C). The loss of anthocyanins followed first-order reaction model, while the formation of two isomers of anthocyanin ethyl-linked (-)-epicatechin was fitted to zero-order reaction model. The rate constant (k) showed that petunidin-3-O-glucoside was the most reactive anthocyanin, followed by the two 3',4'-substituted anthocyanins (peonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside), while the least reactive were another two 3',4',5'-substituted anthocyanins (malvidin-3-O-glucoside and delphindin-3-O-glucoside). The activation energies (E-a) indicated that the formation of ethyl-linked products from methylated anthocyanins were more sensitive to temperature than that from hydroxylated anthocyanins. Thermodynamic parameters showed a non-spontaneous and endothermic process. Besides, the evolution of the visible color of reaction solution was affected by the stability of anthocyanins and the formation of ethyl-linked products.

AB Relationship among pH, generation of free amino acids (FAAs), and Maillard browning was investigated in Japanese common squid during air drying at 40 degrees C to prevent its discoloration. In the surface color measurement, increase in the b* value which is an indicator for Maillard browning of the dried squid was mitigated at pH 4.0-6.0 and accelerated at pH 7.5-9.0. Adjusting the pH to 5.5 effectively suppressed increasing of the b* value (p < 0.05). Arginine (Arg) generation involved in the Maillard reaction, was inhibited in the dried squid at pH 5.5 (p < 0.05). Maillard reactivities between ribose and amino acids were lower at pH 4.0 than at pH 5.5 (p < 0.05). These results indicate that browning of the dried squid is significantly suppressed at pH 5.5. Moreover, suppression of Arg generation is more effective than weakening of Maillard reactivity between ribose and Arg, in mitigating Maillard browning of the dried squid at an acidic pH.

AB Structured TAGs with palmitic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) at the sn-2 position have various health benefits for infants. In this study, we first compared two enzymatic routes for preparation of the structured TAGs. Results showed that the one-pot and two-step syntheses led to 37.6% and 55.4% oleic acid incorporation, respectively, after 10 h and reaction route had little effect on the sn-2 fatty acid composition. Subsequently, reaction variables of the two-step synthesis were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, 53.5% oleic acid was incorporated into the structured TAGs after 6-h acidolysis. Major fatty acids at the sn-2 position were palmitic acid (68.7%), ARA (9.8%) and oleic acid (7.9%). This is the first study reporting a two-step enzymatic method for structured TAGs preparation. Compared to the one-pot synthesis, current method significantly improves the efficiency of the acidolysis by product inhibition elimination. The synthetic TAGs have potential use in infant formulas.

AB This study developed an ultrasensitive method involving (1) gold nanoparticles encoded with a double-stranded DNA as the first signal amplification and goat anti-staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) polyclonal antibody and (2) magnetic microparticles coated with anti-SEB monoclonal antibody to detect SEB. Both functionalized nanoparticles can capture SEB in a sandwich system. The released DNA barcodes were then characterized through SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction and resulted in the second signal amplification. Under optimized experimental conditions, an ultrasensitive bio-barcode for SEB detection was established, and its detection limit could reach 0.269 pg mL(-1), which was 1000-fold lower than that of conventional enzyme-linked/immunosorbent assay. The proposed method shows great potential in food security.

AB Citrinin (CIT) contamination has been reported in agricultural foods and is known to be nephrotoxic to human and animals. In the present study, the proteomes and transcriptomes of C. podzolicus Y3 treated with or without 10 mu g/mL CIT were compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and RNA sequencing, respectively. The proteomics results showed that there were 23 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 8 DEPs were up-regulated and 15 DEPs were significantly down-regulated. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 1208 genes were differentially expressed, 551 (43.05%) DEGs were up regulated and 657 (56.95%) were down-regulated. These results showed that the CIT treatment caused DNA damage, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in C. podzolicus Y3. CIT treatment also activated the defense response (DNA repair and drug resistance biological process, antioxidative activity and TCA cycle) as well as drug metabolism (synthesize the CIT-degrading enzymes) in yeast cells to respond to CIT stress and degrade CIT.

AB The effects of five phosphate salts (PS) on the pasting properties of flour, mixing properties of dough and qualities of cooked noodles were investigated. Rapid Visco Analysis showed that all types of PS increased the peak and final viscosities of wheat flour. Trisodium phosphate (TSP) significantly increased pasting temperature with increasing concentration. The Farinograph characteristics indicated that TSP markedly increased stability time and progressively decreased the degree of softening of the dough. The cooking yield of the TSP, sodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) and disodium phosphate (DSP) groups clearly increased, and the cooking loss was reduced by adding 0.3% sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), 0.1% TSPP or 0.1% TSP. Texture profile analysis revealed that the hardness of cooked noodles from STPP and TSP groups slightly decreased, while that of TSPP and DSP groups decreased significantly. Overall, PS improved the qualities of noodles mainly by promoting starch gelatinization and strengthening the gluten network.

AB Alternariol (AOH), a secondary metabolites of the genus Alternaria, is a genotoxic mycotoxin. Because the previous "Mannich antigen" for AOH readily underwent unstable induction, a new AOH hapten was designed for inducing a high-quality antibody against AOH using a conjugate of the AOH carboxymethyl derivative with a carrier protein as the immunogen. A competitive indirect chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (ciCLEIA) for AOH was optimized and showed good sensitivity (limit of detection 0.068 ng/mL), a linear range (0.11-1.23 ng/mL), and negligible cross-reactivity with analogues. Average rates of recovery from spiked samples (juice and cereal) were between 72.7% and 115.8%, with coefficients of variation < 14.3%. Results from ciCLEIA correlated well with those of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, meaning the proposed method might be an effective screening tool for detection of AOH in food samples.

AB The abundance of protein markers in different types of meat cuts was explored in the context of authentication of raw meat (pork, beef and chicken) and processed meat products. Peptides originating from myoglobin (Mb) and myosin (My) were analyzed using multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). Analytical protocol was optimized for good repeatability (CV < 10%) and high sensitivity. The MS signal intensity of Mb marker peptides in raw pork depended significantly on the cut type (e.g. ham vs knuckle). Importantly, a similar pattern in the abundance of the marker peptides was found for processed meat products made of different types of pork cuts, despite the food processing applied. This suggests the protocol can be used for authentication of raw pork cuts and processed products made of different cuts of pork. More uniform contents of Mb markers were found in raw beef cuts, and for My markers in raw chicken cuts.

AB In the present study, the effects of different irrigation levels (I50: 50%; I75: 75%; and I100: 100% of depleted water from field capacity) and nitrogen fertilizer concentrations (N1:100, N2:200 and N3:300 kg ha(-1) N) on starch properties (total, resistant and nonresistant starch, amylose-amylopectin ratios) and phytic acid content of maize were investigated. The single and interaction effects of the treatments and also influence of harvesting year were evaluated. Total starch accumulation changed with the treatments and the highest values were obtained from I50 and N3 combination and the lowest levels were recorded for I100-N1 and I100-N2 treatments. Amylopectin increased with the effect of irrigation, while the amylose decreased with the irrigation treatment in parallel to amylopectin content. Besides, the lowest phytic acid level was also obtained from the treatments of I100 and N1. This study would provide some valuable information for agricultural and nutritional applications of maize.

AB Lack of synthetic enantiospecific triacylglycerols (TAGs) has hindered our understanding of the impact of TAG structure on the absorption and metabolic fate of fatty acids (FAs). In a five-day feeding trial with mildly (n-3) deficient rats, the bioavailability of docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3), DHA] and stearic acid (18:0) from the two different enantiomers of TAG: sn-22:6(n-3)-18:0-18:0 and sn-18:0-18:0-22:6(n-3), and their regioisomeric TAG: sn-18:0-22:6(n-3)-18:0 was compared. Less secretion of fecal DHA was detected from the sn-2 position compared with the sn-1 and sn-3 positions, but no difference was found in DHA content of the fasting plasma or in the weight of the body or organs. 18:0 was lost to feces mainly as cleaved from the primary positions but also as glycerol-bound. The 5-day intervention in rats was long enough to modify the fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids.

AB To examine the effect of starch variety and structure-related attributes on noodle starch digestibility, cooked Japanese commercial noodles, such as Harusame (mung bean starch), Malony (potato starch) and Udon (wheat flour), were kinetically analyzed during simulated in vitro digestion. The kinetic constant of the homogenized noodle slurry (10.8 x 10(-2)-22.9 x 10(-2)) was 10-20 times higher than that of the intact one (0.9 x 10(-2)-1.5 x 10(-2)), whereas the equilibrium starch hydrolysis (%) was equivalent. Therefore, the noodle microstructure, which is influenced by the present of binding agent and enhancer, should relate to the starch digestibility. Also, the starch digestibility at the early small intestine phase was associated with the cohesiveness and water retention ability of the cooked noodles. These results indicate that the internal microstructures of cooked noodles and the binding agent properties play an important role in the starch digestibility of noodles.

AB To deal with serious environmental pollution resulting from plastic packaging materials, biodegradable films using chitosan (CS) are gaining considerable increase gradually. However, chitosan films lack important properties to meet the preserved demands. This study aimed to develop new bio-based films incorporated with carboxymethyl chitosan-ZnO (CMCS-ZnO) nanoparticles and sodium alginate (SA) to overcome the weakness of CS films. CMCS-ZnO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized in the matrix of CMCS through direct precipitation method, which showed an average diameter of 100 nm. Multilayer films with CS film as the outer layer and SA film as the inner layer were prepared by solution casting method. The addition of CMCS-ZnO nanoparticles led to enhanced tensile strength, and to better water vapor resistance. The as-prepared films exhibited distinctive antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. The results suggested that the as-prepared film is expected to be a promising material for food packaging.

AB The grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) berry coloring mechanism in response to seasonal rain during grape ripening remains poorly understood. Therefore, anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation, dynamic changes in anthocyanin accumulation, biosynthetic enzyme activities, and related gene expression patterns were investigated in Cabernet Sauvignon grown under rain-shelter cultivation and open-field cultivation. Results showed that anthocyanin biosynthesis was strongly repressed during the rainy season. Environmental fluctuation from seasonal rain provoked metabolic responses in grapes, and there was a significantly greater accumulation of most of the anthocyanins, mainly the compositions of non-acylated and non-methylated, under rain-shelter cultivation; these findings indicate that rain-shelter cultivation may help improve tolerance to seasonal rain-induced stresses. Obvious resilience was observed in anthocyanins of open-field-cultivated grapes at harvest. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated strong correlations between anthocyanin contents, CHI and DFR activities, and VvMYB5b transcriptional level. These findings provide novel insight into the crucial factors that directly modulate anthocyanin biosynthesis and consequently control grape coloration.

AB The mode of delivery of curcuminoids in the manufacture of curcuminoid-fortified buttermilk yoghurts was investigated. Curcuminoids were added prior to the addition of yoghurt cultures as powdered curcuminoids or curcuminoids pre-dissolved in ethanol and added to buttermilk prior to or after yoghurt manufacture. Only a small portion (4.6-7.7%) of the total added curcuminoids in yoghurts (299 mg/100 g) was bioaccessible after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids compared to 10.9% when curcuminoids in ethanolic buffer were delivered. The total potential curcuminoid bioavailability (i.e. bioaccessible curcuminoids + curcuminoids converted by faecal bacteria) delivered in yoghurts was 19-34%, depending on the delivery formats, compared to 37% for curcuminoids delivered in ethanolic buffer. The addition of powdered curcuminoids into buttermilk prior to yoghurt fermentation had 33% total potential bioavailability. This study demonstrated the feasibility of preparing curcuminoid-fortified yoghurt for the functional food market.

AB The endocrine system is highly sensitive to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) which interfere with metabolism, growth and reproduction throughout different periods of life, especially in the embryonic and pubertal stages, in which gene reprogramming may be associated with impaired development and control of tissues/organs even in adulthood. Acrylamide is considered a potential EDC and its main source comes from fried, baked and roasted foods that are widely consumed by children, teenagers and adults around the world. This review aimed to present some aspects regarding the acrylamide formation, its toxicokinetics, the occurrence of acrylamide in foods, the recent findings about its effects on different systems and the consequences for the human healthy. The challenges to characterize the molecular mechanisms triggered by acrylamide and to establish safe levels of consumption and/or exposure are also discussed in the present review.

AB Hydrogen peroxide is widely used for disinfection purposes by food industry enterprises. Apart from other purposes it is also used to sterilize the packaging of dairy products. In some countries hydrogen peroxide is added to milk as an adulterant for shelf life extension. However, in most countries the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in milk is limited or it is even prohibited to add this substance to the product. This study is the first one to describe the method of determination of hydrogen peroxide in milk using high performance liquid chromatography. Indirect quantitative evaluation of hydrogen peroxide is carried out according to the amount of triphenyl oxide produced after the reaction between hydrogen peroxide with triphenylphosphine. It has been shown that interaction of triphenylphosphine and hydrogen peroxide required about 40 min. The detection limit of this method is 0.28 mg/L. The recovery of hydrogen peroxide was from 97.8% to 103.8%.

AB The present study aimed at investigating the effects of octenylsuccinylation and particle size on the emulsifying properties of starch granules as Pickering emulsifiers. Starch spherulites (1-5 mu m), native rice starch (5-10 mu m), waxy maize starch (10-20 mu m) and waxy potato starch (20-30 mu m) were modified with octenylsuccinic anhydride. Results showed that octenylsuccinylation caused a significant increase in the contact angle, and there was a weak positive linear correlation with the emulsifying capacity of the starch granules. After octenylsuccinylation, smaller particles of octenylsuccinate-starch granules exhibited better emulsifying properties with smaller droplet size and lower creaming index. Overall, both octenylsuccinylation and particle size have important effects on the emulsifying properties of starch granules as Pickering stabilizers. This study could be useful in the design and development of starch-based Pickering emulsifiers, and provide potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

AB Enzymatic browning is a crucial reaction affecting the quality of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables. Purslane is an edible Chinese folk medicine with extensive distribution and containing a lot of polyphenols and alkaloids. However, little research on its' anti-browning effect on fresh-cut food was reported. In this study, the effectiveness of 0.05% (w/w) purslane aqueous extract treatment efficiently inhibited the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), the membrane integrity was effectively maintained, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content increases was retarded during whole storage period at 4 degrees C. Oddly, the higher purslane extract concentration, the lower endogenesis phenolic content. Additionally, thirty polyphenols and fifty-six alkaloids were found in purslane aqueous extract by LC-MS/MS. All results suggest that purslane aqueous extract is a promising nutritive anti-browning agent for fresh-cut potato.

AB The influence of microwave treatment of hydrated durum wheat kernels of two different cultivars (cv Aureo and Sfinge), on wholemeal flour and pasta quality was addressed. Size exclusion-HPLC and electrophoresis analysis were used to investigate changes in the gluten network arrangement as affected by the microwave treatment. Rheological properties of dough, cooking quality and sensory properties of pasta were also assessed. Results suggested that the microwave treatment on hydrated durum wheat kernels blocks gluten protein conformation through S-S bonds formation and the free -SH are no longer able to create a strong network during pasta processing, due to the conformational changes. Rheological study of dough confirmed that the modifications induced by microwave treatment greatly affected pasta making characteristics of wheat flour, with significant negative consequences on product quality, especially for pasta cooking quality. Pasta from treated durum wheat showed low sensory quality, mainly due to high bulkiness and adhesiveness.

AB Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) is known to accumulate in most meat products during storage. However, the pathway of its formation is not yet completely clarified. To gain more insights into the specificity of ZnPP occurrence, a SEC-HPLC-UV-fluorescence setup was established to screen the proteins in aqueous meat extracts for their ZnPP fluorescence during incubation. In accordance with previous studies it was identified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS that ZnPP formation takes place in myoglobin. In this study, valuable new insights into the ZnPP forming pathway were gained, as our results indicated that a significant part of ZnPP - after being formed within the protein - is transitioned into free ZnPP during incubation. Additionally, the obtained results implied that ZnPP may also occur in proteins of higher molecular weight (> 100 kDa).

AB The binding interactions between young apple polyphenols and porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase were investigated through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and molecular docking. The results obtained were compared with those obtained through inhibition kinetics and fluorescence quenching. It was found that binding of tannic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and epicatechin with alpha-amylase is an exothermal process, with the binding constants in the order of tannic acid > chlorogenic acid > caffeic acid > epicatechin. This is consistent with the orders of reciprocal of competitive inhibition constant and fluorescence quenching constant. The binding energy obtained through molecular docking showed the same order, except for epicatechin. These results are consistent with the inhibition of alpha-amylase being caused by the binding of the polyphenols with the enzyme. In addition, from the fluorescence quenching and DSC data, total polyphenols, tannic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid were found to partially unfold the enzyme structure.

AB We investigated the effect of Fe(II)-assisted acetic acid treatment on improvement of nutrition quality of soybean meal (SBM) by degrading antinutritional factors (ANFs) and maintaining initial nutrition quality. Fe(II)-assistance reduced trypsin inhibitor (TI) content significantly from 5.20 to 0.86 mg/g, and allergenic proteins were completely degraded at 55 degrees C, due to changes in the conformation of soybean protein isolate (SPI) that renders proteins more prone to acetic acid-mediated degradation. The red-shift of maximum emission wavelength indicated that Fe(II)-assisted acid induced molecular unfolding of SPI and increased surface hydrophobicity. Investigation of protein secondary structure revealed that Fe(II)-assisted acid treatment decreased the beta-sheet structure by 4.65% and increased the alpha-helical content by 7.37%. This demonstrated that Fe(II) and acetic acid synergistically degrade ANFs by altering protein conformations in SBM.

AB High-energy milling (HEM) was used to produce nixtamalized corn flours, the traditional nixtamalization process was used as a control. Four creole grains were stone-milled, adjusted to an appropriate moisture content and calcium hydroxide concentration and milled using HEM. The physicochemical, thermal, and rheological characteristics of the flours and corn masas were affected by the HEM process. Negritas and Ahualulco creole grains nixtamalized by HEM showed similar viscosity profiles as a control. HEM reduced the gelatinization enthalpy compared to control and raw flours. Diffractograms showed changes in the crystalline structures and FT-IR demonstrated different regions for lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates in all control and treated grains. The texture of corn masas revealed significant differences according to the grain type. ESEM analysis showed smaller particles of HEM flours compared to those of the control. HEM could be a faster, non-pollutant, energy-saving, alternative nixtamalization process.

AB The detection of adulteration and mislabeling of food products, including intensively processed meat, is a challenge which needs urgent solutions to protect consumers' rights. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of species-specific peptide-based LC-MS methods for monitoring duck, goose and chicken in processed meat products. Food commodities of various compositions, subjected to various treatments, including homogenization, cooking, roasting, drying, and sterilization during production, were examined to ensure that MS-based methods are resistant to matrix composition changes. A qualitative LC-QQQ multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was developed which allows high-confidence monitoring of duck, goose and chicken meat (ten specific peptides), simultaneously with beef and pork (seven peptides), in the presence of turkey meat, in highly processed food. The developed LC-MS methods can be used for food authentication, monitoring of the food composition conformity with label statements and detection of adulteration of poultry-containing food products.

AB Sangiovese red wines produced from organic (ORG) and biodynamic (BDN) vineyards over two consecutive vintages (2011 and 2012) were compared for chemical and sensory parameters to investigate a sustainable approach to grape production. The effects of management practice, vintage, and their interaction were investigated. The ORG wines showed higher total acidity and lower volatile acidity and pH. Although trained panelists highlighted some differences in astringency and odor complexity between ORG and BDN wines, consumers had no preference. The concentrations of anthocyanins, phenolic and cinnamic acids, and flavonols, as well as colour components, did not differ-contrary to results from the conversion period from ORG to BDN (2009 and 2010) in the same vineyard (Parpinello, Rombola, Simoni, & Versari, 2015). Together, these two studies demonstrate that ORG and BDN wine characteristics tend to be similar after the first year of conversion, indicating that the BDN method can produce high-quality Sangiovese wine.

The same five PAEs were detected in all tested samples, values ranged from 0.003 to 0.292 mg/kg; however, higher concentrations existed in BRMs compared to Baijiu samples. Using multivariate statistical analysis, detailed distinctions between different varieties of Baijiu and BRMs and separation-related PAE markers were revealed. PAEs concentration during Baijiu distillation showed a decreasing trend. The highest concentrations detected in distillate heads, were 1.6-, 2.3-, and 8.1-fold higher than those in heart1, heart2, and tail distillates, respectively. These findings revealed that PAEs may migrate from BRMs; moreover, that PAEs content can be regulated by distillation.

AB A simple and highly sensitive lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFICA) towards microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was proposed in this study. Molecular imprinting technique was combined with enzyme assisted colorimetric method to substantially enhance the sensitivity of traditional LFICA. The target, i.e., MC-LR molecular, was first separated from the complex matrix by molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIPs). Then, the obtained MC-LR was detected by LFICA based on the blue color generated by an enzyme-substrate reaction. Using the proposed assay, under optimal conditions, the determination of MC-LR was doable in a wide linear range from 0.1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.04 ng/mL. In addition, the reliability of the developed method was validated by determining MC-LR contents in real samples. The overall results suggested that the neoteric LFICA method possess great potential in sensitive detection of MC-LR.

AB The effects of frozen storage on the quality of frozen cooked noodles were investigated. Texture analysis showed hardness and tensile force reduced during frozen storage. An increasing cooking loss and a decreasing water uptake ratio were determined when testing cooking qualities. As storage time prolonged, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) detected more freezable water, and an increased relaxation time was recorded by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed water distribution was more heterogeneous. A ruptured microstructure with large pores of frozen cooked noodles was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) photographs demonstrated gluten network lost its integrity and compactness. Size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) indicated the amount of SDS-soluble proteins increased. The present study showed water characteristics and protein network underwent some changes during frozen storage, which had major effects on the quality of frozen cooked noodles.

AB In this study, a novel core-shell structured Fe3O4@TA@P(NVP-co-NIPAM) magnetic microsphere has been successfully developed for polyphenol extraction employing tannic acid (TA) directed copolymerization. The TA directing strategy guided copolymerization preferentially on the surface of the magnetic core and facilitated formation of the shell for coating the magnetic core. It was unveiled that the amount of TA, the ratio of the two monomers, and the amount of surfactant were critical for the preparation of the magnetic microspheres. The identity and proportion of the shell were analyzed by FT-IR and TGA. Magnetic hysteresis loop measurement confirmed the superparamagnetic nature and no loss of magnetization after coating. The prepared magnetic microspheres demonstrated outstanding absorption ability to typical polyphenols. Kinetic studies suggested that the adsorption behavior followed Langmuir absorption model. The developed magnetic microspheres should be useful for biological studies. The TA directing strategy would be valuable for synthesis of core-shell structured particles.

AB Chinese quince seed protein isolate (CPI) was extracted using aqueous extraction and the isoelectric precipitation method, and its physicochemical and functional properties were investigated. Results showed that CPI contained all essential amino acids with exception of methionine which met the minimum recommendations for adults (World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization). The electrophoresis analysis of sodium do-decyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel indicated that the molecular weights of protein fractions were approximately 15-60 kDa. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis was conducted, and the denaturation temperature of CPI was 103.4 degrees C. The surface hydrophobicity of CPI was found to be 932.80. The experiments showed that CPI had high emulsifying capacity, foaming stability, water holding capacity and oil adsorption capacity. Moreover, CPI also had outstanding gel formation capacity since its least gelation concentration of CPI was only 8%. All these results implied that CPI could be a nutritional protein resource and functional ingredient in the food industry.

AB The aim of this work was to verify the usefulness of multielemental and isotopic fingerprint to differentiate the origin of milk samples from different areas, linking milk fingerprint with those corresponding to soil, water, and forage. Samples from four production areas in Argentina were analysed: 26 elements, delta H-2, delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta O-18. Milk provenance was assessed using 16 variables (Na, Mg, Al, V, Co, Ni, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Hg, delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 and K/Rb). Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) demonstrated the consensus between soil, water, forage and milk, in addition to differences between studied areas. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) demonstrated significant correlations between the milk-drinking water, milk-forage, and milk-soil. So far, we report a feasible method to establish the milk provenance, assessing the follow up from environmental matrixes (soil + water) to dairy products through the food web (forage) by a combined chemical-isotopic fingerprint.

AB A response surface methodology was applied to study the effect of precursors on o-quinone and phenylacetaldehyde formation in wine model systems stored at 40 degrees C during 24 h. The results confirmed that glucose plays an important role in reducing aldehyde formation by inhibiting the formation of o-quinone. The regression equations showed that oxygen consumption followed a 2nd polynomial equation whereas phenylacetaldehyde and o-quinone were best fit with a polynomial function containing quadratic terms. These behaviors indicate that different pathways are involved in the respective aldehyde formation and oxygen consumption. RSM has been shown to be a powerful tool to better understand key chemical reactions. By considering a number of factors, individually and in combinations, the derived equations predicted that the best combination to minimize phenylacetaldehyde was achieved for high glucose levels and low amounts of gallic acid and metals. This is valuable information when trying to improve wines sensorial properties during shelf-life.

AB Although Nordic wild edible mushrooms offer a wide range of different odors their scientific examination has been scarce. The aim of this study was to characterize the aroma compounds of four Finnish wild mushroom species with trained assessors using gas chromatography-olfactometry as well as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Headspace volatiles were extracted from sous vide cooked mushroom samples (Boletus edulis, Lactarius camphoratus, Cantharellus cibarius and Craterellus tubaeformis) using solid-phase microextraction. Odor-contributing compounds were measured with two columns of differing polarity using the detection frequency method. Compounds were identified based on reference compounds, linear retention indices, odor descriptions, and mass spectrometry. Both the volatile compound profiles and the aromagrams were distinct with characteristic compounds for each species. The results demonstrate that especially saturated and unsaturated aldehydes and ketones contribute to the odor of the studied wild mushrooms. This thorough comparison also indicates compounds linked to the sensory properties of mushrooms.

AB The objective of this study was to develop both a possible process and a spray-dried coffee product with a balanced content of bioactive compounds. Spray-dried coffees were prepared by mixing different ratios of medium-roasted Coffea canephora (R) with green Coffea arabica (A) beans. Overall, quality characteristics of spray-dried coffees were not different. The dominant signals of 1D H-1 NMR were identified as trigonelline, caffeine and chlorogenic and organic acids. Principal component analysis explained 81.8% of the total variance. Roasted Robusta spray-dried coffee was clearly distinguished from blended coffees. Forty-two volatile compounds were identified. An increase in green Arabica mixed with roasted Robusta in the blends resulted in an increase in 5-caffeoylquinic acid but a decrease in caffeine contents. Spray-dried coffee prepared from a A35:R65 showed greater total phenolic content and antioxidant activity due to a balance in bioactive compounds. In addition, its coffee brew obtained the highest overall liking score.

AB Pitaya fruit is susceptible to fungal attack and shrivelling during storage. This study investigated the individual and combined effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and carvacrol (CVR) on red pitaya. Fruits were treated with 1 mu L L-1 1-MCP, 20 mu L L-1 CVR or their combination (1-MCP + CVR), and then storage at 7 degrees C for 30 days. 1-MCP + CVR was more effective in suppressing decay and maintaining quality during storage than individual treatment of 1-MCP or CVR. In addition, 1-MCP + CVR treatment led to decreased levels of O-2(center dot-), H2O2, and lipid peroxidation, concomitant with increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, and elevated total phenolic content, as compared to the individual application. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy observation showed that the combined treatment protected cell ultrastructure from oxidative damage. This study suggests 1-MCP combined with CVR may be a useful method for the preservation of pitaya fruit.

AB The spice made from the fruits of Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) has high economic value since the beginnings of international trade. Because its price has been increasing, adulterations with papaya seeds, cayenne pepper and maize flour were reported. These have been screened by methodologies dedicated to the detection of single adulterants lacking sensitivity and specificity. Herein we propose a specific, highly-sensitive, high-throughput and affordable qPCR-based methodology for the detection of P. nigrum contaminants (Carica papaya, Zea mays and Capsicum annuum) using plant DNA barcodes trnL and psbA-trnH. The method enables the specific detection of contaminants in a short time with low limits of detection (LOD6 values of 1, 2 and 10 Haploid Genome Equivalents). A market survey (29 samples) revealed 41% of samples contaminated, though about 3/4 at very low levels indicating accidental contamination. The proposed tool will contribute to the improvement of quality of this much traded spice.

AB Fuzzy controller artmap based algorithms via E-nose selective metal oxides sensor (MOS) data was applied for classification of S. oryzae infestation in rice grains. The screened defuzzified data of selective sensors was further applied to detect S. oryzae infested rice with PCA and MLR techniques. Reliability of data was cross validated with reference methods of protein and uric acid content. Out of 18 MOS, 6 sensors namely P30/2, P30/1, T30/1, P40/2, T70/2 and PA/2 showed maximum resistivity change. Defuzzified score of 62.17 for P30/2 and 59.33 for P30/1 MOS further confirmed validity studies of E-nose sensor response with reference methods. The PCA plots were able to classify up to 84.75% of rice with variable degree of S. oryzae infestation. The MLR values of predicted versus reference values of protein and uric acid content were found to be fitting with R-2 of 0.972, 0.997 and RMSE values of 2.08, 1.05.

AB The comprehensive mechanistic understanding of pungency and the binding interactions between pungent capsaicinoids from foods and their receptors have attracted increasing attention in food sensory and pharmaceutical fields. In this study, linear and quadratic statistically significant quantitative structure-pungency correlations have firstly been established for capsaicinoids by combining genetic function approximation and brute force approach and subsequently validated by the tests of cross validation, randomization, external prediction, Roy's r(m)(2) metrics and Golbraikh-Tropsha's criteria. The resultant optimal predictive correlation models have strong internal and external predictive capacities (r(2) = 0.949-0.989, r(CV)(2) = 0.860-0.955, r(pred)(2) = 0.859-0.904), which elucidate the elementary electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and steric structural requirements for the pungent perception of capsaicinoids. Finally, a series of new capsaicinoids was designed based on the insights from the established correlation models, and most of which showed excellent predicted pungency potency and acceptable ADMET properties.

AB Bitter sensation is mediated by various bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), thus T2R antagonists are actively explored. Our objective was to look for novel T2R blockers in hen protein hydrolysate (HPH). We screened the least bitter HPH fractions using electronic tongue, and analyzed their peptide sequences and calcium mobilization in HEK293T cells expressing T2Rs. The results showed that the HPH fractions with higher bitterness intensity had higher hydrophobicity, more hydrophobic amino acids, and more positively charged peptides, but fewer known umami peptides. The peptide fractions from the least bitter HPH fraction significantly inhibited quinine bitterness (P < 0.05), and also significantly inhibited quinine- or diphenhydramine-dependent calcium mobilization of HEK293T cells expressing human T2R4, T2R7, or T2R14 (P < 0.05). Among them, the first eluted (least bitter) peptide fraction showed the strongest bitter-inhibitory effect. In conclusion, HPH peptides are the blockers of T2R4, T2R7, and T2R14.

Obtained extracts were characterized by HPLC analysis, while antioxidant capacity was determined by ORAC method. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity of prepared extracts was assessed by antiproliferation assay on two tumour cell lines, whereas for investigation of type of cell death or cell cycle arrest a flow cytometric analysis was applied. In addition, a detection of compounds with DNA/RNA-binding affinity in extracts was investigated by UV/Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Grape pomace extract in NADES showed to be the best of all extracts tested, with regard to extraction of total polyphenolic compounds (p < 0.05) and related biological activities such as antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. Prepared polyphenolic extracts in NADES could be considered as ready-to-use in food and pharmaceutical industry without demanding and expensive downstream purification steps.

AB Significant amount of bran is discarded from sesame processing plants and yet it is seen as waste or animal feed. This study for the first time designed to recover protein and antioxidant compounds from sesame bran. In this respect, effectiveness of four different techniques i.e. viscozyme L, alcalase, ultrasound and ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extractions were tested and compared with standard alkaline method. RSM was used to investigate the effects of extraction parameters and to determine optimum process conditions. All of the independent parameters (enzyme concentrations, pH, ultrasound power, temperature and time) had significant effects on all of the responses. Alcalase exhibited higher recovery efficiency than viscozyme L. The highest protein yield, total phenolic compound and antioxidant capacities were found in ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction at 836 W ultrasound power, 43 degrees C, 98 min, 9.8 pH value and 1.248 AU/100 g enzyme concentration. SDS-PAGE and SEM analyses were also carried out to compare extraction techniques.

AB The effects of a hydroxyl radical generating system (Fe3+/H2O2) at different H2O2 concentrations (0, 1 and 10 mM) on the chemical and structural properties of isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP)-isolated PSE (pale, soft, exudative)-like chicken protein were investigated. Both acid and alkaline treatments effectively reduced the pro-oxidant contents in PSE-like meat systems, such as lipids, pigments and myoglobins. The ISP samples generated less carbonyl derivatives and Schiff base but yielded higher sulfhydryl and free amine loss in response to oxidation. Correspondingly, sulfur-contained amino acids in ISP samples were more easily converted, even at the 1-mM H2O2 concentration, than in the PSE-like meat paste. Moreover, the ISP-isolated proteins have possibly maintained their gelling properties after oxidation compared to the PSE-like meat paste. In regards to chemical and structural modification, the ISP treated protein showed a different susceptibility to oxidation in vitro.

AB The aim of this study was to prove the usefulness of multielements as provenance markers of olive oils by evaluating their link with soil composition and their discriminatory power. Eleven elements in twenty-one olive oils and their paired soils from four Tunisian regions were characterized. Chemometrics have been implemented for ICP-MS data processing. Principal component analysis identified the predominant geochemical source of the elements in the oils based on their associations according to Goldschmidt's rule. Although a clear correlation was not proven, correspondence was identified between the discriminating elements for both the soils and olive oils, which included Fe, Rb, Mg, and Pb. Linear discriminant analysis achieved classification and prediction rates of 92.1% and 87.3%, respectively. Our study substantiates the validity of multielements as markers of the olive oils' provenance, and that an elemental fingerprinting approach can be successfully applied in the construction of a database of Tunisian olive oils.

AB Abscisic acid (ABA) has been advocated to play substantial role on ripening of non-climacteric fruit. Here we report that alginate oligosaccharide (AOS) postharvest treatments delayed the accumulation of ABA and ABA-conjugates and restrained the expression of ABA signaling genes, resulting enlarged storage life of strawberry. In addition, AOS postharvest treatments also increased the quality and reduced the degradation of cell wall components and repressed the expression of cell wall degradation genes. AOS treated fruits exhibited significant delays of hardness, decay percentage, titratable acidity, pH, total soluble solids and vitamin C content compared to untreated fruits. Moreover, AOS had a positive effect on retaining higher amount of anthocyanin, total phenol and flavonoids contents. The finding of this study suggests that AOS postharvest treatments are very useful for preserving fruit quality and enhancing shelf life by delayed ABA accretion, restrained the gene expression related to ABA signaling and cell wall degeneration.

AB Carob is a legume tree of a considerable commercial importance for the flavor and sweet industry. In this context, it is cultivated mostly for its pods, which are known for their nutritive value and multiple health benefits. However, metabolite patterns, underlying these properties are still mostly uncharacterized. In this study, the role of geographical origin, ontogenetic changes and thermal processing on the Ceratonia siliqua pod metabolome was assessed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics. Thereby, a total of 70 fruits primary metabolites, represented mainly by carbohydrates, organic and amino acids were detected. Analysis of secondary bioactive metabolites assessed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HR-MS) revealed in total 83 signals. The major signals, most significantly contributing in discrimination of C. siliqua specimens were assigned to tannins and flavonoids. PCA models derived from either UHPLC-MS or GC-MS proved to be powerful tools for discrimination of C. siliqua specimens.

AB Although there has been an extensive research on vaccine development over the last decade and some vaccines have been commercialized for canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), but as yet no effective vaccine is available for anthroponotic VL which may partly be due to the absence of an appropriate adjuvant system. Vaccines alone yield poor immunity hence requiring an adjuvant which can boost the immunosuppressed state of VL infected individuals by eliciting adaptive immune responses to achieve required immunological enhancement. Recent studies have documented the continuous efforts that are being made in the field of adjuvants research in an attempt to render vaccines more effective. This review article focuses on adjuvants, particularly particulate and non-particulate ones, which have been assessed with VL vaccine candidates in several preclinical and clinical trials outlining the induction of immune responses obtained from these studies. Moreover, we have emphasized the applicability of multiple adjuvants combination for an improvement in the potential of a VL vaccine. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Improving vaccine procurement performance has been a priority concern of national health authorities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for years particularly in terms of its role in accessing new vaccines and assuring a steady supply of quality vaccines at affordable prices. This article reviews the vaccine procurement mechanisms in the MENA region; analyzes the factors and drivers affecting demand for and supply of vaccines; discusses the main challenges; and suggests measures which can increase efficiency gains and generate the budgetary room to introduce life-saving vaccines. Based on in-depth analysis of available data and interviews with key informants at the regional and country level, this paper explains why most of the current strategies do not sufficiently recognize the specific characteristics of vaccine markets and best practices in procurement given these markets. The paper suggests potential efficiency gains for governments and global partners from pooling demand and moving from transaction-based purchasing to strategic purchasing in order to strengthen immunization services and introduce more life-saving vaccines.

AB The candidate pan-Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine RG1-VLP are HPV16 major capsid protein L1 virus-like-particles (VLP) comprising a type-common epitope of HPV16 minor capsid protein L2 (RG1; aa17-36). Vaccinations have previously demonstrated efficacy against genital high-risk (hr), low-risk (1r) and cutaneous HPV.
   To compare RG1-VLP to licensed vaccines, rabbits (n = 3) were immunized thrice with 1 mu g, 5 mu g, 25 mu g, or 125 mu g of RG1-VLP or a 1/4 dose of Cervarix (R). 5 mu g of RG1-VLP or 16L1-VLP (Cervarix) induced comparable HPV16 capsid-reactive and neutralizing antibodies titers (62,500/12,500-62,500 or 1000/10,000). 25 mu g RG1-VLP induced robust cross-neutralization titers (50-1000) against hrHPV18/31/33/45/52/58/26/70. To mimic reduced immunization schedules in adolescents, mice (n = 10) were immunized twice with RG1-VLP (5 mu g) plus 18L1-VLP (5 mu g). HPV16 neutralization (titers of 10,000) similar to Cervarix and Gardasil and cross-protection against hrHPV58 vaginal challenge was observed.
   RG1-VLP vaccination induces hrHPV16 neutralization comparable to similar doses of licensed vaccines, plus cross-neutralization to heterologous hrHPV even when combined with HPV18L1-VLP. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine shows variable efficacy in protection against adult tuberculosis (TB). Earlier, we have described a BCG mutant vaccine with a transposon insertion in the gene coding for the secreted acid phosphatase SapM, which led to enhanced long-term survival of vaccinated mice challenged with TB infection, To facilitate development of this mutation as part of a future improved live attenuated TB vaccine, we have now characterized the genome and transcriptome of this sapM::Tn mutant versus parental BCG Pasteur. Furthermore, we show that the sapM::Tn mutant had an equal low pathogenicity as WT BCG upon intravenous administration to immunocompromised SCID mice, passing this important safety test. Subsequently, we investigated the clearance of this improved vaccine strain following vaccination and found a more effective innate immune control over the sapM::Tn vaccine bacteria as compared to WT BCG. This leads to a fast contraction of IFN gamma producing Th1 and Tc1 cells after sapM::Tn BCG vaccination. These findings corroborate that a live attenuated vaccine that affords improved long-term survival upon TB infection can be obtained by a mutation that further attenuates BCG. These findings suggest that an analysis of the effectiveness of innate immune control of the vaccine bacteria could be instructive also for other live attenuated TB vaccines that are currently under development, and encourage further studies of SapM mutation as a strategy in developing a more protective live attenuated TB vaccine.

AB Breast cancer vaccines composed of antigens identified by serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) induce antigen specific immune responses in patients but have had disappointing clinical benefits. While many attempts to modify the adjuvants and vaccine method have been tried, one issue not addressed was whether the SEREX tumor-associated antigens identified from late stages of disease were ideal targets. We questioned in the transgenic TgMMTV-neu mouse model whether the antigen repertoire is distinct between early and late stage breast cancer and whether the antigens identified via SEREX from transgenic mice with early or late stage tumors would elicit differential anti-tumor effects to address this question.
   Three early stage antigens, Pdhx, Stk39, and Otud6B, were identified from a SEREX screen of mice prior to development of palpable lesions. Formulated into a vaccine, each early antigen inhibited tumor growth (p < 0.0001). The antigens identified from mice with late stage tumors (Swap70, Gsn, and Arhgef2) were unable to inhibit tumor growth when used as vaccines (for example Gsn p = 0.26). Each of the three early stage antigens were essential for tumor survival in syngeneic mouse tumor cells and in human breast cancer cell lines across breast cancer subtypes. Silencing protein expression of the early antigens increased apoptosis (p < 0.0001 for all antigens in mouse and p < 0.05 for all antigens in human triple negative breast cancer) and decreased survival (p < 0.0001 for all antigens in mouse and human triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancer). Overexpression of the early stage antigens in women with breast cancer predicted worse prognosis (p = 0.03) while overexpression of late stage antigens did not impact prognosis (p = 0.09). These data suggest that antigens expressed earlier in breast tumor development and functionally relevant to breast tumor growth may be more effective targets for therapeutic breast cancer vaccines than antigens identified in later disease.

AB Immune responses to the capsular polysaccharide administered in the polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines can be either improved or suppressed by the pre-existence of immunity to the carrier protein. Receiving multiple vaccinations is essential for travellers such as Hajj pilgrims, and the use of conjugated vaccines is recommended.
   We studied the immune response to meningococcal serogroup W upon prior, concurrent and sequential administration of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) conjugated to CRM197 (coadministered with 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine conjugate CRM197 [PCV13]), and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine in Australian adults before attending the Hajj pilgrimage in 2014.
   Participants were randomly assigned, by computer-generated numbers, to three study arms by 1:1:1 ratio. Group A received Tdap followed by MCV4-CRM197 (+PCV13) 3-4 weeks later. Group B received all three vaccines in a single visit. Group C received MCV4-CRM197 (+PCVI3) followed by Tdap 3-4 weeks later. Blood samples obtained prior to and 3-4 weeks after immunisation with MCV4-CRM197 were tested for meningococcal serogroup W-specific serum bactericidal antibody responses using baby rabbit complement (rSBA).
   One hundred and seven participants aged between 18 and 64 (median 40) years completed the study. No significant difference in meningococcal serogroup W rSBA geometric mean titre (GMT) was observed between the study arms post vaccination with MCV-CRM197 but Group A tended to have a slightly lower GMT (A = 404, B = 984 and C = 1235, p = 0.15). No statistical difference was noticed between the groups in proportions of subjects achieving a >= 4-fold rise in rSBA titres or achieving rSBA titre >= 8 post vaccination.
   In conclusion, receipt of MCV4-CRM197 vaccine prior, concurrent or subsequent to Tdap has similar immunologic response, and hence concurrent administration is both immunogenic and practical. However, further investigation into whether carrier induced suppression is a public health issue is suggested. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Scope and magnitude of private sector financing and provision of
   immunization in Benin, Malawi and Georgia
SO VACCINE

AB Background: Little is known about the role of private sector providers in providing and financing immunization. To fill this gap, the authors conducted a study in Benin, Malawi, and Georgia to estimate (1) the proportion of vaccinations taking place through the private sector; (2) private expenditures for vaccination; and (3) the extent of regulation.
   Methods: In each country, the authors surveyed a stratified random sample of 50 private providers (private for-profit and not-for-profit) using a standardized, pre-tested questionnaire administered by trained enumerators. In addition, the authors conducted 300 or more client exit interviews in each country.
   Results: The three countries had different models of private service provision of vaccination. In Malawi, 44% of private facilities, predominantly faith-based organizations, administered an estimated 27% of all vaccinations. In Benin, 18% of private for-profit and not-for-profit facilities provided vaccinations, accounting for 8% of total vaccinations. In Georgia, all sample facilities were privately managed, and conducted 100% of private vaccinations. In all three countries, the Ministries of Health (MoHs) supplied vaccines and other support to private facilities. The study found that 6-76% of clients paid nominal fees for vaccination cards and services, and a small percentage (2-26%) chose to pay higher fees for vaccines not within their countries' national schedules. The percentage of private expenditure on vaccination was less than 1% of national health expenditures. The case studies revealed that service quality at private facilities was mixed, a finding that is similar to those of other studies on private sector vaccination. The three countries varied in how well the MoHs managed and supervised private sector services.
   Discussion/Conclusion: The private sector plays a growing role in lower-income countries and is expanding access to services. Governments' ability to regulate and monitor immunization services and promote quality and affordable services in the private sector should be a priority. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB A 49-year-old kidney transplant recipient, presented with a skin rash, and interstitial infiltrates three weeks after receiving a live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine. Varicella-zoster Oka-vaccine strain was detected in plasma by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis targeting open reading frame 62 (ORF 62). She was treated successfully with intravenous acyclovir. Our case report supports the current contraindication of live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine in the solid-organ transplant recipients. Recombinant subunit varicella-zoster vaccine may be the vaccine of choice in these patients; nevertheless, further information is required to establish its safety, efficacy, and optimal timing.

ID ABSOLUTE QUANTIFICATION; MATURATION; PROTEOMICS; BURDEN
AB Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a global health threat with the potential to affect at least 3.6 billion people living in areas of risk. No specific curative treatments against dengue disease are available and vaccines are currently the only way to prevent the disease. The tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur has demonstrated significant efficacy in phase III studies and is now licensed in several countries for the prevention of disease in dengue-seropositives over 9 years of age. The vaccine is composed of four recombinant, live, attenuated vaccines (CYD 1-4) based on a yellow fever vaccine 17D (YFV 17D) backbone, each expressing the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes of one of the four DENV serotypes. Virus maturity could impact the biological activity of the vaccine viruses. To address this question, the maturity of the four vaccine viruses used in phase III clinical studies was assessed by two complementary techniques: mass spectrometry (MS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). MS assessed viral maturity at the molecular level by quantifying specifically the prM, and M proteins. CryoEM provided information at the particle level, allowing visualizing the different phenotypes of viral particles: spiky (immature), smooth/bumpy (mature), and mixed (partially mature). Results of the two assays used in this study show that all four CYD dengue vaccine viruses present in lots used in phase III efficacy trials, display in the majority a mature phenotype.

AB Background: The approval of the extended use of 1-dose varicella vaccine (VVL) in adults aged 50 and older against herpes zoster (HZ) in 2016 and the 2-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in 2018 raised the need to evaluate the value for money between these two vaccines.
   Methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of the immunisation programmes from payer's perspective. Eight strategies with different ages to receive VVL or RZV were set, namely: 65-84 year old (y.o.), 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., and 80-84 y.o. VVL- or RZV-strategy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with curative care scenario were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort were as follows: acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, recurrence of HZ, and general death.
   Results: At the vaccination cost (sic)8000 (US$73) for 1-dose ZVL and (sic)30,000 (US$273) for 2-dose RZV, ICERs ranged from (sic)2,633,587/US$23,942 (age 80-84 y.o.) to (sic)3,434,267 or US$31,221 (age 65-84 y.o.)/QALY gained for WL-strategies: from (sic)5,262,227 or US$47,838 (age 80-84 y.o.) to (sic)6,278,557 or US$57,078/QALY gained (age 65-84 y.o.) for RZV-strategies. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that if the cost-effective threshold was at (sic)3,000,000 or US$27,273/QALY, the acceptability was 90.7% and 8.8% for 65-84 VVL-strategy and 65-84 RZV-strategy, respectively; if at (sic)5,000,000 or US$45,455/QALY, 56.2% and 43.8%, and if at (sic)10,000,000 or US$90,909/QALY 11.9% and 88.1%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Vaccinating individuals aged 65-84 y.o., 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., 80-84 y.o. with VVL or RZV to prevent HZ-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from payer's perspective, with vaccination costs at (sic)8,000 per shot for VVL, (sic)30,000 for 2-dose RZV. While the results suggesting that only 65-84 VVL-strategy and 65-84 RZV strategy should be considered when introducing HZ immunisation programme. The optimal strategy varies depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Here, we constructed an attenuated live marker classical swine fever (CSF) vaccine (Flc-LOM-BErns) to eradicate CSF. This was done by taking infectious clone Flc-LOM, which is based on an attenuated live CSF vaccine virus (LOM strain), and removing the full-length classical swine fever virus (CSFV) E-rns sequences and the 3' end (52 base pairs) of the CSFV capsid. These regions were substituted with the full-length bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) E-rns gene sequence and the 3' end (52 base pairs) of the BVDV capsid gene. Sows were vaccinated with the Flc-LOM-BErns vaccine 3 weeks before insemination and then challenged with virulent CSFV at the early, mid- or late stages of pregnancy. We then examined transplacental transmission to the foetuses. Piglets born to sows vaccinated with Flc-LOM-BErns did not show vertical infection, regardless of challenge time. In addition, CSFV challenge did not affect the delivery date, weight or length of the foetus. Pregnant sows inoculated with the Flc-LOM-BErns vaccine were anti-CSF E-rns antibody-negative and anti-BVDV E-rns antibody-positive. Challenge of pregnant sows with virulent CSFV resulted in anti-CSF E-rns antibody positivity. These results strongly indicate that differential diagnosis can be conducted between the Flc-LOM-BErns vaccinated animal and virulent CSFV affected animal by detecting antibody against BVDV E-rns or CSF E-rns gene. Therefore, the Flc-LOM-BErns vaccine may fulfil the function of differential diagnosis which required for DIVA vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was carried out to assess the immunogenicity and safety of NBP608-a newly developed live-attenuated zoster vaccine in Korea-relative to Zostavax (R) in healthy adults aged 50 years or older. Immune responses to the vaccine were evaluated by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays using the interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 FluoroSpot kit 6 weeks after vaccination. Safety was monitored for 26 weeks based on subjects' diaries, spontaneous reports from subjects, and history taking by the investigators. A total of 845 subjects participated in the screening, and 823 received the vaccination (413 in the NBP608 group and 411 in the comparator group). The gpELISA-determined geometric mean fold rise from baseline to post NBP608 vaccination was 2.75 [95% confidence interval, CI (2.57, 2.94)]. The gpELISA-determined adjusted geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NBP608 and the comparator were 1346.37 [95% CI (1273.99, 1422.87)] and 1674.94 [95% CI (1585.35, 1769.58)], respectively. The adjusted GMT ratio of NBP608 to the comparator was 0.80 [95% CI (0.75, 0.87)]. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of the geometric mean spot numbers determined by IFN-gamma and IL-2 ELISPOT assays at 6 weeks post vaccination (P = 0.7232, 0.3844). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) within 6 weeks post vaccination was 49.82% overall (410/823, 941 cases), 50.73% (209/412, 474 cases) in the NBP608 group, and 48.91% (201/411, 467 cases) in the comparator group. The difference in AE rate between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.6010). Most AEs were mild, with a rate of 83.12% in the NBP608 group and 75.37% in the comparator group. Thus, NBP608 is non-inferior to Zostavax (R) in terms of inducing the immune response and can be safely administered to adults aged 50 years or older. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Lanzhou Lamb rotavirus (LLR) vaccine was licensed in China in 2000. It was the only vaccine available in private market before 2018. However, the data about the post-marketing effectiveness is very limited. To assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE), we conducted a case-control study based on the hospital surveillance system in Beijing from 2015 to 2017.
   Methods: Seven hospitals located in seven districts in Beijing, from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, were included. The VE of LLR vaccine was assessed in laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection among children younger than five years old through a case-control design, using rotavirus-negative cases as controls. LLR vaccination was documented from a vaccination registry. VE was estimated adjusting for age group, gender, study site, the month of illness onset and interval days between illness onset to sampling through a logistic regression model.
   Results: A total of 598 cases and 1766 controls were included in this study. The vaccine average coverage rate during 2015-2017 among children younger than five years old was 10.8% in Beijing. The adjusted VE for LLR vaccine of 1 dose versus 0 dose was 34.9% (95%CI, 5.3-55.3). We also obtained the adjusted VE of 87.7% (95%CI, 32.7-97.8) for patients with the severity score >= 11, 36.2% (95%CI, 4.7-57.3) for children of 2-35 months age group and 40.8% (95%CI, 7.8-61.9) against G9 rotavirus infection. Vaccinated cases were less likely to have watery stool (OR = 0.42) and have diarrhea longer than 5 days (OR = 0.47) than unvaccinated cases.
   Discussion: LLR vaccine conferred protection against rotavirus disease. Children who were vaccinated presented with less severe clinical manifestations. An immunization schedule of receiving all three doses in the first year should be preferred. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (qHPV; HPV6/11/16/18) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness worldwide. We report qHPV vaccine efficacy for up to 6.5 years after first administration among Chinese women 20-45 years of age.
   Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 study (NCT00834106), women were randomized 1:1 to receive 3 doses of qHPV vaccine or placebo (Day 1, Month 2, Month 6). Endo-ecto-cervical and external genital swabs were collected for HPV testing and gynecologic examinations, and cervical cytology testing were performed at Day 1 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24, 30, 42, 54, 66, and 78. Any abnormality in cytology testing would trigger colposcopy examination and cervical biopsy, if necessary. Efficacy against genital disease, persistent infection, and the composite endpoint was assessed. Primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population.
   Results: Of 3006 participants randomized, 2759 (91.8%) and 2374 (79%) completed the Month 30 and Month 78 visits, respectively. At Month 78, efficacy among women aged 20-45 years was 100% (95% CI: 32.3, 100; 0 vs 7 cases) and 100% (95% CI: 70.9, 100; 0 vs 14 cases) against HPV16/18-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and cervical cancer (CIN 2+) and HPV6/11/16/18-related CIN 1+, respectively, in the PPE population. The efficacy against cervical 6-month and 12-month persistent infection was 91.6% (95% CI: 66.0, 99.0) and 97.5% (95% CI: 85.1, 99.9) at Month 30 and Month 78, respectively, in the PPE population. The vaccine also reduced the rate of cervical cytology abnormalities associated with HPV6/11/16/18, with an efficacy of 94.0% (95% CI: 81.5, 98.8). The vaccine was generally well tolerated (reported separately).
   Conclusion: The qHPV vaccine is efficacious against endpoints of persistent infection and genital precancerous lesions in Chinese women aged 20-45 years. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of end group of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) on the drug loading and release behavior of electrospray-generated PLGA microspheres. To this end, doxycycline hyclate (DOX) was selected as a model drug, and PLGA (molecular weight 17 and 44 kDa) with either an acid or ester end group were electrosprayed with DOX. The processing parameters were optimized to obtain microspheres comparable in size. Drug loading efficiency and release profile were determined by the high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method. PLGA polymers or drug-loaded microspheres were characterized before and after exposure to phosphate buffer saline at 37 degrees C regarding the wettability of polymers, pH changes of the buffer, molecular weight of PLGA and morphology of the microspheres. The acid end group of PLGA microspheres brought about lower encapsulation efficiency and faster DOX release rate in our study, indicating that different hydrophilicity of polymer and degradation speed were the main reasons causing a difference in encapsulation efficiency and release profile. In addition, DOX released from the PLGA microspheres was active by showing antibacterial effects against Potphyromonas gingivalis as measured using a zone of inhibition test, and varying the end groups showed no impact on the antibacterial efficacy. This study demonstrated that the end group of PLGA can be used as a new tool to regulate drug encapsulation efficiency and release rate to meet different clinical drug delivery requirements.

AB Direct compaction (DC) attracts more and more attention for tablet manufacturing; however, its application in natural plant product (NPP) tablets is still extremely limited. In this study, 8 kinds of composite particles (CPs) based on the Zingiberis Rhizoma extracted powder (ZR) (a natural plant product powder with poor DC properties) were prepared with different shell materials, including hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), dextran, inulin, mannitol, silica, and their combinations. Their physical properties and compacting parameters were characterized comprehensively. The results demonstrated that (i) fluid bed coating was not a simple process of superposition and transmission of the physical properties of raw materials; and (ii) all the shell materials studied could improve the DC properties of problematic ZR to some degree and the combination of 7% HPMC and 1% silica showed to be the best to markedly improve both the compactibility and flowability of ZR. As a whole, by virtue of the design of core-shell particles, qualified tablets with high ZR loadings were successfully produced via continuous DC in this study. These findings are beneficial to boosting the development of natural plant tablets through DC.

AB Aim: The current study reports the development and evaluation of chitosan-sericin-silver nanocomposite (CSSN) films without and with moxifloxacin (Mox).
   Methodology: The film preparation method involved the in-situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles within the chitosan-sericin colloidal composite followed by preparation into a film by solvent casting technique. In-situ formation and the particle size analysis of the silver nanoparticles was performed via UV-Visible and zeta-size spectrometer. The prepared films were tested for swelling ratio, contents uniformity, in-vitro Mox release, and permeation analysis. The morphological (SEM), elemental (EDX), spectral (FT-IR), structural (XRD), and thermal (TGA and DSC) properties of the composites were also inspected. The antibacterial activity of the CSSN films was performed against seven pathogenic bacterial strains including five ATCC and two clinical strains. The potential wound healing activity of the composite films was evaluated on burn wound model induced in Sprague Dawley male rats.
   Results: The prepared films displayed good swelling profile with a sustained in-vitro Mox release and permeation profile; attaining maximum of 78.57% (CSSM3) release and 55.05% (CSSM1) permeation (CSSM1) in 24 h. The prepared films, particularly the Mox-loaded CSSN films displayed a promising antibacterial activity against all the tested strains with the activity being highest against MRSA (clinical isolates). The prepared films indicated a remarkable wound healing applications with successful fibrosis, collagen reorganization, neovascularization, and mild epidermal regeneration after 7 days of treatment with no silver ions detection in animal's blood.
   Conclusion: The obtained findings strongly suggest the use of the prepared novel composite dressing for wound care applications.

AB We investigated the effect of variation in the molecular weight of hypromellose (HPMC) on the oral absorption of fenofibrate (FFB) nanocrystal. Four types of HPMC with different molecular weights and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as dispersion stabilizers for FFB nanocrystal suspension. Wet-milling of FFB crystal with HPMC and SDS formed diamond-shaped FFB nanocrystals with approximately 150 nm diameter. HPMC was strongly adsorbed onto the FFB nanocrystal interface, and the amount of HPMC adsorbed was not dependent on the molecular weight of HPMC. However, the decrease in the molecular weight of adsorbed HPMC led to an improvement in the permeability of FFB nanocrystal through the mucin layer. The decrease in molecular weight of HPMC enhanced the flexibility of FFB nanocrystal interface and effectively inhibited its interaction with mucin. This led to faster diffusion of FFB nanocrystal through mucin. In vivo oral absorption studies showed rapid FFB absorption from FFB nanocrystal formulations using HPMC of low molecular weights. The present study revealed that the molecular weight of the dispersion stabilizer for drug nanocrystal formulation should be taken into consideration to achieve improved absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs after oral administration.

AB Fractional CO2 laser treatment has been used in some clinical trials to promote topical drug delivery. Currently, there is no standard for laser settings to achieve a feasible therapy. The cutaneous recovery following laser treatment and its influence on drug absorption have not been well explored. This study evaluated the kinetics of laser-treated skin-barrier restoration and drug permeation in nude mice. The skin recovery and observation of the process were characterized by transdermal water loss (TEWL), erythema measurement, gross appearance, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The skin absorption of a lipophilic small permeant (tretinoin), a hydrophilic small permeant (acyclovir), and a large molecule (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 4 kDa, FD4) was examined in vitro using Franz cell. TEWL suggested that the laser-treated skin restored its barrier function at 16 h after irradiation. The fractional laser produced microchannels of about 150 mu m in diameter and 25 mu m in depth that were surrounded with thermal coagulation. The bright-field imaging indicated that the micropores were progressively closed during the recovery period but had not completely closed even after a 16-h recovery. The laser treatment led to a rapid tretinoin penetration across the skin immediately after irradiation, with a 5-fold enhancement compared to intact skin. This enhancement was gradually reduced following the increase of recovery time. Conversely, the acyclovir and FD4 permeation peaked at 1-2 h postirradiation. The FD4 flux was even elevated as the recovery time increased. The reasons for this could have been the subsequent inflammation after laser exposure and the deficient fight junction (TJ) barrier. The confocal imaging demonstrated the perpendicular diffusion of rhodamine B and FD4 through microchannels immediately after laser exposure. The lateral diffusion from the microchannels was observed at 2 h post-irradiation. Our results revealed a time-dependent recovery of skin permeation. The time frame for applying the drugs after laser irradiation was dependent upon the permeants and their various physicochemical properties.

AB Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides able to improve drug water solubility and stability by forming CD/drug inclusion complexes. To further increase drug entrapment and delay its release, the CD/drug inclusion complex can be embedded in the aqueous phase of a liposome, a lipid vesicle composed of phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous compartment. The resulting carrier is known as drug-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposome (DCL) system. CDs and DCLs are recognized as effective drug delivery systems; therefore, understanding the interaction of CDs with liposomal and biological membranes is of great importance. CDs are able to extract phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins from membranes; the effect depends on the membrane structure and composition as well as on the CD type and concentration. Under definite conditions, CDs can affect the membrane fluidity, permeability, and stability of liposomes and cells, leading to the leakage of some of their internal constituents. On the other side, CDs demonstrated their beneficial effects on the membrane structure, including preservation of the membrane integrity during freeze-drying. In this paper, we review the literature concerning the interaction of CDs with biomimetic and biological membranes. Moreover, the impact of CDs on the membrane properties, mainly fluidity, stability, and permeability, is highlighted.

AB The usage of 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38) as the most biologically active member of camptothecin family is restricted because of its poor solubility in pharmaceutical solvents. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, can be used as suitable drug delivery carrier for poorly water soluble molecules. In this study, we prepared two cell penetrating peptides (BR2 and CyLoP1) conjugated formulations of PEGylated PAMAM containing SN38. In vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake were investigated on murine colon carcinoma (C26) cell line. Then in vivo antitumor efficacy and survival analysis were studied in C26 mice bearing tumor. Blood serum level in different time points and biodistribution in major organs were determined using fluorometry. In vitro evaluations revealed the IC50 range of 154.4-635 nM in two exposure times for all preparations that was much lower compared to SN38 solution. Cellular uptake studies showed a time-dependent manner and higher values for CPP conjugated dendrimers. In vivo results indicated survival improvements of all prepared formulations and significantly better tumor growth inhibition of most CPP-conjugated formulations compared to Irinotecan. Biodistribution studies confirmed higher tumor accumulations for most of formulations comparing to positive control. In conclusion; prepared CPP-targeted dendrimeric formulations of SN38 exhibited efficient characteristics in tumor inhibitory.

AB The application of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers in reservoir-type intra-vaginal rings (IVRs) offers advantages over silicones including i) versatile properties, ii) absence of curing chemistry, and iii) continuous and flexible processing via co-extrusion. Thus, we investigated the capability of EVA based IVRs to deliver broad ranges of estradiol (E2) thereby, fulfilling the requirements of local and systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and contraception. To circumvent the high material needs associated with co-extrusion, we implemented a small-scale screening procedure that accurately predicts the E2 release from IVRs comprising E2 below its solubility concentration in the core. Rational formulation design yielded the target release for local HRT (< 10 mu g/day), systemic HRT (50-100 mu g/day) and contraception (> 150 mu g/day, combined with a progestin). Low E2 release was achieved by the combination of low E2 loadings, low VA content of the membrane polymer (also known as coat polymer or outer shell), and increased membrane thickness. Medium E2 release was provided by medium E2 loading, low VA content of the membrane polymer, and low membrane thickness. Combining high E2 loadings, high VA content of the membrane polymer, and low membrane thickness yielded high E2 release. This makes EVA based IVRs a versatile platform that can be used to deliver a broad range of E2 doses.

AB Despite the abundant use of polyethylene oxides (PEOs) and their integration as an excipient in numerous pharmaceutical products, there have been no previous reports of applying this important thermoplastic polymer species alone to fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing. In this work, we have investigated the manufacture of oral doses via FDM 3D printing by employing PEOs as a backbone polymer in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Blends of PEO (molecular weight 100 K, 200 K, 300 K, 600 K or 900 K) with PEG 6 K (plasticiser) and a model drug (theophylline) were hot-melt extruded. The resultant filaments were used as a feed for FDM 3D printer to fabricate oral dosage forms (ODFs) with innovative designs. ODFs were designed in a radiator-like geometry with connected paralleled plates and inter-plate spacing of either 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 mm. X-ray diffraction patterns of the filaments revealed the presence of two distinctive peaks at 2 theta = 7 degrees and 12 degrees, which can be correlated to the diffraction pattern of theophylline crystals. Blends of PEO and PEG yielded filaments of variable mechanically resistance (maximum load at break of 357, 608, 649, 882, 781 N for filament produced with PEO 100 K, 200 K, 300 K, 600 K or 900 K, respectively). Filaments of PEO at a molecular weight of 200-600 K were compatible with FDM 3D printing process. Further increase in PEO molecular weight resulted in elevated shear viscosity (> 10(4) Pa.S) at the printing temperature and hindered material flow during FDM 3D printing process. A minimal spacing (1 mm) between parallel plates of the radiator-like design deemed essential to boost drug release from the structure. This is the first report of utilising this widely used biodegradable polymer species (PEOs and PEG) in FDM 3D printing.

AB Crystalline bulking agent in lyophilized biopharmaceutical formulations provides an elegant lyophilized cake structure and allows aggressive primary drying conditions. The interplay between amorphous and crystalline state of excipients heavily influence the stability of lyophilized biological products and should be carefully evaluated in the formulation and process development phase. This study focuses on: (1) elucidating the influence of formulation and lyophilization process variables on the formation of different states of mannitol and (2) its impact on model monoclonal antibody stability when compared to sucrose. The main aim of the present research work was to study the influence of different mannitol to sucrose ratios and monoclonal antibody concentrations on mannitol physical form established during lyophilization. In addition, also the effect of process variables on mannitol hemihydrate (MHH) formation was under investigation.
   Thermal analysis and powder X-ray diffraction results revealed that the ratio between sucrose and mannitol and mAb concentration have a decisive impact on mannitol crystallization. Namely, increasing amount of mannitol and monoclonal antibody resulted in decreasing formation of MHH. From the process parameters investigated, a higher secondary drying temperature has the biggest impact on the complete dehydration of MHH. Specifically, higher secondary drying temperature reflected in complete dehydration of MHH. Annealing temperature was shown to affect the MHH content in the final product, wherein the higher annealing temperature was preferential for formation of anhydrous mannitol. Temperature stress stability study revealed that the most important parameter influencing monoclonal antibody stability is the ratio of protein to sucrose. Contrary to widespread assumption, we did not detect any impact of MHH on the stability of the investigated monoclonal antibody.

AB Warfarin is a narrow therapeutic index drug that requires personalized dosing which is currently not achieved by the marketed products. Further, pediatric and geriatric patients may face swallowing problems with solid oral dosage forms. To face these issues, the aim of the present study was to investigate semisolid extrusion 3D printing for production of warfarin containing orodispersible films. Extrusion 3D printing was successfully utilized to produce transparent, smooth and thin, yet flexible and strong orodispersible films containing therapeutic doses of warfarin (3.9-7.4 mg). Excellent linearly (R-2 = 0.9996) between the designed sizes of the films and the drug contents was achieved indicating semisolid extrusion 3D printing as a promising way to produce orodispersible warfarin films with personalized doses. This one-step-process utilizes disposable syringes hindering the printing material to be in contact with the printing equipment making it a potential method for on-demand in-hospital compounding.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different chain length fatty acids on physicochemical properties and cancer targeting of fattigation-platform nanoparticles (NPs). Two different types of fatty acids (short chain, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, C4; long chain, oleic acid, C18:1) were successfully conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) via simple 1-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling reaction. These conjugates readily formed HSA-C4 and HSA-C18:1 NPs which showed good stability in serum and desirable biocompatibility with normal cell line (HEK293T). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was efficiently loaded into NPs by incubation process via electrostatic interaction. The structure, morphology, and texture of DOX-loaded NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The initial burst release of DOX-loaded NPs was controlled by the presence and chain length of fatty acids. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with three cancer cell lines (A549, HT-29, and PANG-1) suggested that fattigation-platform NPs have distinctive cytotoxic effects compared to Doxil (R). Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry exhibited that the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was varied by the different chain lengths of fatty acids. It was evident that the chain length of fatty acids in the fattigation-platform NPs could play a vital role in varying physicochemical properties and cancer cell targeting of NPs.

The binding to mucin plays a crucial role in drug pharmacokinetics especially in diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), where mucin is overexpressed. In this study, we have investigated the interaction between mucin and several drugs used in CF therapy. Protein-drug interaction was carried out by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy; quenching mechanism, binding constants, number of binding sites, thermodynamic parameters and binding distance of the interaction were obtained.

AB Recently DNA aptamers have attracted remarkable attention as possible targeting ligands since selective targeting of cancer cells is a critical step in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Here, the development of AS1411 aptamer-functionalized albumin nanoparticles loaded on iron oxide and gold nanoparticles is reported for target delivery of the well-known anticancer drug of doxorubicin (Dox). Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were prepared by ultrasound-assisted and controlled seeded growth synthetic methods, respectively. The nanocarrier was synthesized by a desolvation cross-linking method and characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurement, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, as well as vibrating sample magnetometer. The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be spherical with an average diameter of 120 nm and zeta potential of about - 50.3 mV. The in-vitro anti-tumor effect of the designed delivery vehicle on MCF7 and SKBR3 human cancer cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The experimental results revealed that it could significantly inhibit the proliferation of cancerous cells. Moreover, GNPs and IONPs with the coating of albumin did not show any toxicity. AS1411 aptamer-functionalized nanoparticles improved cellular uptake and efficiency to MCF7 breast cancer cells as compared to non-targeting nanoparticles because of the high affinity of mentioned aptamer toward the overexpressed nucleolin on MCF7 cell surface.

AB It is essential to optimize a carrier of dry powder inhalation (DPI) for the aerodynamic deposition in vitro to achieve pulmonary delivery of drug molecules in vivo. In this study, neutralized nanoporous gamma-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) crystals with cubic morphology and uniform inhalation size were developed and modified as a DPI carrier for budesonide (BUD). Cholesterol (CHO) and leucine (LEU)-poloxamer were used to modify the CD-MOF powder for the improvement of flowability and particle aerodynamic behaviour, for which the particle size distribution, Carr's index and in vitro pulmonary deposition were assessed. Compared to CD-MOF or LEU-CD-MOF-BUD, CHO-CD-MOF had a superior mass median aerodynamic diameter (4.35 +/- 0.04 mu m) and inhalable performance (fine particle fraction of 30.60 +/- 0.76%), which were maintained after budesonide loading (4.47 +/- 0.30 mu m, 24.95 +/- 4.33%). The crystallinity, cytotoxicity and in vivo deposition of drug loaded samples (CHO-CD-MOF-BUD) were then investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), cell viability study, in vivo fluorescence imaging and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The characteristic PXRD crystallinity peaks of budesonide disappeared after being loaded into CHO-CD-MOF, potentially indicating the molecular incorporation of budesonide into the pores of CD-MOF. The cell viability of A549 cell was more than 90% for CHO-CD-MOF-BUD as a result of the good biocompatibility of CD-MOF. When Rhodamine B was carried by the DPI particles, the fluorescence signal at the lung tissue was markedly improved after cholesterol modification compared with CD-MOF, whilst the bioavailability of CHO-CD-MOF-BUD in rat was equivalent with that of the commercial product of Pulmicort Turbuhaler. Therefore, the CD-MOF powders modified by cholesterol can be used as a promising inhalable carrier for pulmonary delivery of drugs with small dose.

AB Several drugs are pH-dependent soluble weak bases with a poor solubility in the intestinal pH range. Additionally a variable gastric pH, which is a common issue in the population, potentially reduces the in-vivo performance due to reduced solubility at elevated pH. Aiming to avoid the influence of variable gastric pH on the dissolution performance, enteric polymers - hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HP-55, HP-50) and methacrylic acid ethylacrylate copolymer (Eudragit L100-55) together with nevirapine as model drug were used for the preparation of solid dispersions by hot-melt extrusion. We were able to generate solid dispersions without crystalline residuals. The resulting solid dispersions were further tested for stability and dissolution performance applying two different pH-shift experiments (non-sink conditions), to simulate standard and altered gastric conditions. Solid dispersions made of enteric polymers were independent to gastric pH variability and exhibited superior dissolution performances compared to their respective physical mixtures and neat nevirapine.

AB Hair follicles are a promising target for the administration of drugs to treat diseases associated with the pilosebaceous unit, such as acne. For solid lipid microparticle dispersions a successful and selective delivery of adapalene via targeted erosion of the particles in sebum has been shown. By embedding nanoparticulate benzoyl peroxide in lipid microparticles, the therapeutic potency of adapalene can be further increased by improving follicular deposition of benzoyl peroxide and minimizing direct contact between benzoyl peroxide and stratum corneum, which is responsible for the irritating potential of this active agent. The aim of this study was to develop a novel nanoparticulate formulation for benzoyl peroxide suitable for the incorporation in solid lipid microparticles. In this contribution, a wet grinding process using liposomal dispersions of fully hydrated phosphatidylcholine was developed, upscaled and optimized for solid content and stabilizer concentration. The resulting novel nanosuspension was characterized by particle size and morphology and examined for chemical and physical stability as well as solubility and polymorphism. During the process development a dependency between the colloidal microstructure of the stabilizer dispersion and milling efficiency was found: while physical mixtures fail to deliver nanosuspensions, liposomal dispersions succeed with the same amount of stabilizer.

AB Intravesical mucoadhesive self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) have been developed via synthesis and incorporation of S-protected chitosan CS-MNA into SEDDS. N-acetyl cysteine-6-mercaptonicotinamide (NAC-6-MNA) was synthesized via disulphide exchange reaction between N-acetyl cysteine and 6-mercaptonicotinamide dimer. NAC-6-MNA was attached to chitosan (CS) via carbodiimide mediated amide bond formation. The S-protected chitosan (CS-MNA) and chitosan (CS) were complexed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (CS-SDS and CSMNA-SDS) and incorporated in SEDDS at a concentration of 1% (m/m). SEDDS, SEDDS-CS-SDS and SEDDS-CSMNA-SDS were characterized regarding size and zeta potential. 6-MNA release from SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS in presence of glutathione was evaluated. Mucoadhesive properties of these novel formulations were assessed via rheology measurements and residence time evaluation on porcine bladder. Cytotoxicity of formulations was determined on porcine bladder. S-protected chitosan displayed 465.42 +/- 75.64 mu mol of NAC-6-MNA per gram of polymer. SEDDS and SEDDS-CS-SDS and SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS displayed a size of 22.5 +/- 0.9, 37.4 +/- 0.1 and 98.5 +/- 5.7 nm at a concentration of 20% (m/v) in simulated urine pH 6.2, and a zeta potential of - 5.1 +/- 0.2, -1.6 +/- 0.1 and -1.4 +/- 0.2 mV at a concentration of 1% (m/v) in water at pH 6, respectively. 80% of MNA was released from SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS in presence of glutathione. Viscosity of SEDDS-CS-SDS/mucus and SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS/mucus was 6- and 18-fold higher than SEDDS/mucus after 90 min incubation. 2.6%, 5.8% and 14% of SEDDS, SEDDS-CS-SDS and SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS remained on bladder mucosa within 120 min, respectively. No pronounced bladder cytotoxicity was observed in presence of 0.5% (m/v) formulations. According to these results, SEDDS-CS-MNA-SDS might be a promising carrier for intravesical drug administration.

Their appearance and particle size were observed by transmission electron microscope and particle size analyzer. The drug release behavior of nanoparticles was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The toxicity, morphology and interaction of nanoparticles to cells were studied by means of MTT, live/dead staining and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results show that the nanoparticles have good particle size dispersion, regular morphology, good drug release performance, good biocompatibility and in vitro effective inhibition of CT26 colorectal cancer cells. These results demonstrated that the good biocompatibility of egg white coated sodium alginate nanoparticles and PTX loaded these nanoparticles would show potential application for cancer therapy.

AB Naproxen (NAP) is a widely used drug for the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions. However, there is not the physicochemical information about this drug such as solubility, volumetric and compressibility properties in the presence of deep eutectic solvents (DES) as a new class of green solvents to overcome the low solubility of drugs. In this work, the solubility of NAP is studied in the solutions containing some choline chloride (ChCl) based DES at temperature ranges (298.15-313.15) K. The results indicate that the solubility increases with increasing the concentration of DES and temperature and DES containing malonic acid is the proper co-solvent. The experimental solubility values were correlated by the e-NRTL, Wilson and UNIQUAC models. In addition, the complex interactions between the components in the systems should be elucidated, therefore, the thermodynamic properties including volumetric and compressibility properties have been investigated using density and speed of sound measurements at T = 298.15 K. According to calculated thermodynamic parameters, strong interactions between NAP and DESs are observed which is in agreement with obtained solubility data.

AB The past fifteen years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in vaginal ring technologies for drug delivery applications, mostly driven by the impetus for development of vaginally-administered antiretroviral microbicides to help reduce the high acquisition rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among Sub-Saharan African women. Currently, the lead candidate microbicide is a 28-day silicone elastomer vaginal ring releasing dapivirine (Ring-004), an experimental non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The ring was tested in two pivotal Phase III clinical studies in 2016 and is currently undergoing review by the European Medicines Agency. Recently, we described a new type of silicone elastomer vaginal ring offering sustained release of the protein molecule 5P12-RANTES, a potent experimental chemokine analogue that potently blocks the HIV CCR5 coreceptor. Building on our previous work, here we report the preclinical development of a new combination vaginal ring that offers sustained release of both 5P12-RANTES and dapivirine, in which the 5P12-RANTES is incorporated into an exposed core within the ring body and the dapivirine in the sheath. In this way, in vitro release of dapivirine matches closely that for Ring-004. Also, we report the pharmacokinetic testing of this combination ring formulation in sheep, where vaginal concentrations of both drugs are maintained over 28 days at levels potentially useful for preventing HIV infection in women.

AB Gene therapy strategies for liver cancer have broad application prospects but still lack a stable and efficient delivery vehicle. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a multifunctional gene delivery vector, sTPssOLP, which was based on oleylamine (OA)-modified disulfide-containing polyethylenimine (PEI) and incorporated into lipids to prepare a lipid nanoparticle. sTPssOLP consisted of the core of PEI derivative and cationic lipids bound to siRNA. The modified polyethylene glycol (PEG) and transferrin (Tf) were partially embedded in the phospholipid bilayer through the lipid and the other as the outer shell. The aim was to use the redox responsiveness of disulfide to trigger siRNA release in cytoplasm to enhance transfection efficiency. Pegylated lipids and Tf focus on increasing cycle life in the body and increasing accumulation at the tumor site of the carrier. In addition, two vectors were prepared as controls, one based on a PEI derivative containing no disulfide bond (POLP) and the other on the surface of the carrier not linked to Tf (PssOLP). PEI derivatives effectively avoid the toxicity problems caused by the use of PEI alone (25 kDa). Meanwhile, it was confirmed by gel retardation experiments that in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), the disulfide bond can indeed be reduced and the siRNA entrapped in the vector can be released. Both HepG2 and SMMC had significant uptake of sTPssOLP. The results of intracellular and lysosomal co-localization indicated that sTPssOLP achieved lysosomal escape. RT-PCR and Western blot results also confirmed that sTPssOLP had the best gene silencing activity. In vivo, the tumor inhibition rate of sTPssOLP in nude mice carrying HepG2 xenografts was 56%, which was significantly greater than that of the saline control group. In vivo imaging results showed that fluorescently labeled siRNA loaded in sTPssOLP was able to deliver more to the tumor site. At the same time, it was observed that sTPssOLP did not show significant damage to normal tissues. Therefore, this multifunctional gene delivery vector warrants further investigation.

AB At present, there is an increasing demand to improve the sustainability of surface-active compounds in dermal formulations. Biosurfactants, which are derived from living cells, are considered to be more environmentally friendly than synthetic surfactants. Thus, the use of biosurfactants is a promising strategy for the formulation of more environmentally friendly and sustainable dermal products. In this work, a biosurfactant extract (BS) obtained from corn wet-milling industry was studied for its potential use in dermal formulations. The corn derived BS possesses good surface-active properties and was found to be a suitable co-stabilizer for nanoemulsions and nanocrystals for dermal application. It also possesses antioxidative and skin protective properties and was also able to increase the dermal penetration efficacy for lipophilic actives. In dermal formulations the BS can therefore be used as co-stabilizer with antioxidative and penetration enhancing properties at the same time.

AB Liposomal anticancer drugs have been developed with improved clinical effects and reduced side effects. We have developed a PEGylated liposomal formulation of oxaliplatin that has anticancer effects in animal models of colorectal cancer with a favorable toxicity profile. To move this formulation into clinical development, a formulation that is stable during long term storage is needed, which has similar pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity against solid tumors to the original formulation. In this study, we found that PEGylated liposomal oxaliplatin showed no changes in particle size after long term storage (12 months at 2-8 degrees C), but phospholipid degradation had occurred. Hence, the stored formulation had compromised membrane integrity, resulting in decreased in vivo circulation times of the liposomes. To improve the stability during long-term storage, a screening study to obtain an appropriate stabilizer was carried out. The buffer 2-morpholinoethansulfonic acid (MES) attenuated not only phospholipid degradation but also oxaliplatin degradation, unlike most other excipients. After 12 months storage at 2-8 degrees C in the presence of MES only slight degradation of phospholipids in PEGylated liposomal oxaliplatin occurred, resulting in similar in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles of the encapsulated oxaliplatin to the original formulation. Long term stability of PEGylated liposomal oxaliplatin was achieved by addition of MES, resulting in long circulation half-lives in vivo, a property which would be expected to lead to increased suppression of tumor growth and reduced side effects. Our formulation may now be suitable for clinical development.

AB In this report, a novel redox-responsive liposomes based on disulfide derivative paclitaxel-ss-lysophosphatidylcholine prodrug (PTX-ss-PC) with high PTX loading was developed for triggering drug release. First of all, PTX-ss-PC was synthesized by a facile esterification and verified by MS, H-1 NMR and HPLC. After that, PTXss-PC derived liposomes (PTX-ss-PC liposomes) containing EPC:Chol:mPEG(2000)-DSPE components were prepared by the conventional film method. Moreover, physicochemical characterizations of the PTX-ss-PC liposomes were carried out by using transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and release test. It was demonstrated that the PTX-ss-PC liposomes possessed average diameter of 234.9 nm and zeta potential of -29.1 mV with highest PTX loading 7.97%. The PTX-ss-PC liposomes dissociated rapidly in a reduction medium, as confirmed by their triggered aggregation/disruption and rapid release of PTX in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Finally, in vitro cytotoxicity of the liposomes was checked against MCF-7 and A549 cells. It was found that the PTX-ss-PC liposomes exhibited favorable GSH-mediated anti-proliferative activity in comparison with the nonresponsive counterpart. Taken together, the novel PTX-ss-PC based liposomes possess improved loading capacity, reduction triggered release of PTX and efficient anti-proliferative activity, which should be valuable for further preclinical evaluation.

AB RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most promising strategies for cancer therapeutics. The successful translation of RNAi therapeutics to a clinic setting requires a delivery system that is efficient and simple to upscale. In this study, we devised a simple industrial method to manufacture lipoplex, which includes short hairpin RNA against the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS shRNA) - a key molecule for DNA biosynthesis. An aqueous solution of TS shRNA was gently mixed with either a precursor of cationic liposome (Presome DF-1) or a cationic lipid mixture in an o/w emulsion. This solution was subsequently lyophilized under optimal conditions to obtain either FD-lipoplex-1 or FD-lipoplex-2, respectively. With this method, a lipoplex in activated form was obtained via a simple "one-step" hydration with saline. Both forms of FD-lipoplex showed physicochemical properties comparable to those of conventional lipoplex. FD-lipoplexes stably retained TS shRNA within their formulations in the presence of tumor ascites fluid. Intraperitoneal treatment with either FD-lipoplex-1 or FD-lipoplex-2 provided a therapeutic level of efficacy comparable to that of conventional lipoplex in the treatment of a peritoneal disseminated gastric cancer mouse model. Collectively, established freeze-drying-based methods for RNAi-therapeutic preparation could realistically be used in a clinical setting for the treatment of patients with peritoneal disseminated cancer.

AB The purpose of this study was to improve solubility and oral bioavailability of fenofibrate via solid dispersion (SD) using a supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process with amphipathic polymers P407 and TPGS. Solid dispersion techniques have been widely used to enhance the solubility and dissolution profiles of poorly soluble drugs. Fenofibrate is classified as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System class II compound because of its low solubility and high gastrointestinal permeability. Two copolymers were selected based on solubility and dissolution tests. Their physicochemical properties were compared with those prepared by conventional solvent evaporation (CSE). The SD formulations containing fenofibrate were successfully prepared using the SAS and CSE methods. The dissolution rate (%) of fenofibrate at 60 min was significantly improved compared with the solution of raw fenofibrate (19.5% +/- 3.7%) by 95.1% +/- 2.5% and 93.7% +/- 4.1% using the SAS and the CSE process, respectively. This approximately four-fold increase in dissolution rate indicates that oral bioavailability can be enhanced. In addition, pharmacokinetic study was analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC) and C-max values of SAS-SD and CSE-SD in rats. The AUC was 2.1 times higher and C-max was 1.9 times higher in SAS-SD, indicating higher concentrations of fenofibrate in the blood. In a pharmacodynamic study to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in hyperlipidemic rat models, SAS-SD showed strong lipid-lowering effects including cholesterol (1.9-fold) and triglycerides (3.3-fold), than CSE-SD. Taken together, these results suggested that SAS-SD has excellent potential as a formulation for the poorly soluble drug fenofibrate.

AB Nanoparticular system of a model small molecular drug curcumin (CUR) was prepared using a novel method, namely, flash nanocomplexation by hydrogen bonding interactions. The CUR-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by mixing CUR, tannic acid and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in aqueous solutions under turbulent condition through a three-inlet confined impinging jet (CIJ) device. Compared to bulk mixing, FNC has the advantage of scalability, reproducibility and without causing the variations by different mixing sequences. Three NPs with different drug loading levels were prepared by tuning the CUR feeding amount. In human prostate cancer PC3 cells, both cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of these NPs were negatively correlated with the drug loading level. These findings indicate that FNC is an easy and feasible method for small molecular drug delivery by hydrogen bonding interactions.

AB HSP90 inhibitors have the potential to treat many types of cancer due to the dependence of tumor cells on HSP90 for cell growth and proliferation. The Cullin-5 (Cul5) E3 ubiquitin ligase is required for HSP90 inhibitors to induce client protein degradation and subsequent cell death. Cul5 is expressed at low levels in breast cancer cells compared to patient matched controls. This observed low Cul5 expression may play a role in the reported decreased efficacy of 17-AAG and related HSP90 inhibitors as a monotherapy. We have developed a method for delivery of 17-AAG plus Cul5 DNA to cells via gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Delivery of AuNPs containing Cul5 DNA increases the sensitivity of Cul5 deficient AU565 cells to 17-AAG. Characterization of AuNPs by UV-vis spectrum, TEM, gel electrophoresis assay and H-1 NMR indicate attachment of both 17-AAG and DNA payload as well as AuNP stability. Studies in Cul5 deficient AU565 cells reveal that delivery of Cul5 and 17-AAG together increase cytotoxicity. Our results provide evidence that delivery of DNA with drug may serve as a method to sensitize drug resistant tumor cells.

AB Spray freeze drying (SFD) was used to prepare re-dispersible powders of crystalline, pure-drug nanodispersions of naproxen in lactose and stabilized with hydroxypropyl cellulose. The particle size of the rehydrated powders was determined using static light scattering/Mie analysis. The nanoparticles present in the SFD powders were aggregated but could be dispersed on re-dispersion with water and stirring either with or without additional ultrasonic treatment. The disaggregation of the SFD nanoparticles was superior to that reported in the literature for spray dried nanoparticles of the same composition. It appears that the moderately-rapid freezing of the large spray droplets in LN2 during SFD produces less aggregation than does evaporative drying of the much smaller droplets during spray drying. Re-dispersion was also found to depend strongly on the pH of the original nanodispersion. The solubility of this weak acid is greater at higher pH which resulted in formation of a dissolved fraction of drug in the nanodispersions during media milling. After SFD, the dissolved naproxen fraction formed an amorphous solid which re-dissolves on re-hydration whereas the crystalline nanoparticles disaggregate.

AB In this paper mangiferin nanoemulsions were developed using hyaluronic acid of different molecular weight, in absence or presence of Transcutol-P. An extensive study was carried out on the physico-chemical properties of nanoemulsions. Nanosizer and transmission electron microscopy showed oil droplets average size 296 nm with monodisperses distribution (PI <= 0.30). The zeta potential was highly negative (- 30 mV). FTIR analysis confirms the existence of physical interactions among compounds. Rheological measurements allowed to conclude that all formulations present a pseudoplastic behavior (s similar to 0.4) in presence of the biopolymer. Moreover, mangiferin release depends on the molecular weight of the polymer. Permeability assays on pig epidermis showed that nanoemulsions with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid improve the permeation, being this effect more pronounced in nanoemulsions with Transcutol-P. Administration of mangiferin nanoemulsions on TPA-inflamed skin mice model provided an attenuation of oedema and leucocyte infiltration. Macroscopic appearance of mice skin lesions has a good correlation with the histological study. The topical application of these formulations shows an appropriate anti-inflammatory effect.

AB Carbon dots are a carbonaceous nanomaterial that were discovered accidentally and are now drawing significant attention as a new quantum-sized fluorescent nanoparticle. Carbon dots are biocompatible, non-toxic, photostable, and easily functionalized with good photoluminescence and water solubility. Due to these unique properties, they are used broadly in live cell imaging, catalysis, electronics, biosensing, power, targeted drug delivery, and other biomedical applications. Here, we review the recent development of carbon dots in nanomedicine from their use in drug carriers to imaging agents to multifunctional theranostic systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges and views on next-generation carbon dot-based theranostics for clinical applications.

AB Quantitative analysis using proton NMR (H-1 qNMR) has been employed in various areas such as pharmaceutical analysis (e.g., dissolution study), vaccines, natural products analysis, metabolites, and macrolide antibiotics in agriculture industry. However, it is not routinely used in the quantification of saccharides in dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations. The aim of this study was to develop a H-1 NMR method for the quantification of saccharides employed in DPI formulations. Dry powders as DPI carriers were prepared by spray drying (SD) and spray freeze drying (SFD) using three saccharides: namely D-mannitol, D-sorbitol and D-( + )-sucrose. The calibration curves constructed for all three saccharides demonstrated linearity with R-2 value of 1. The H-1 qNMR method produced accurate (relative error %: 0.184-3.697) and precise data with high repeatability (RSD %: 0.517-3.126) within the calibration curve concentration range. The H-1 qNMR method also demonstrated significant sensitivity with low values of limit of detection (0.058 mM for D-mannitol, 0.045 mM for D-( + )-sucrose, and 0.056 mM for D-sorbitol) and limit of quantitation (0.175 mM for D-mannitol, 0.135 mM for D-( + )-sucrose, and 0.168 mM for D-sorbitol). Pulmonary deposition via impaction experiments of the three saccharides was quantified using the developed method. It was found that SFD D-mannitol (68.99%) and SFD D-( + )-sucrose (66.62%) exhibited better delivered dose (total saccharide deposition in throat and all impactor stages) than SD D-mannitol (49.03%) and SD D-( + )-sucrose (57.70%) (p < 0.05). The developed H-1 qNMR methodology can be routinely used as an analytical method to assess pulmonary deposition in impaction experiments of saccharides employed as carriers in DPI formulations.

AB Despite being one of the most commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam is marketed in oral and intravenous dosage forms, which are associated to drug-drug interactions and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential of the intranasal route to deliver levetiracetam into the brain, due to the particular anatomical features of the nasal cavity. After development and characterization of the drug formulation, a thermoreversible gel loaded with levetiracetam was administered to CD-1 male mice by intranasal route and its pharmacokinetics compared to those observed after intravenous administration. Similar plasma pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained and the intranasal absolute bioavailability was 107.44%, underscoring that a high drug fraction was systemically absorbed. In brain tissue, maximum drug concentrations were 4.48 and 4.02 mu g/g (intranasal vs intravenous) and the mean cerebral concentrations were significantly higher after intranasal administration. The percentage of drug targeting efficiency was 182.35% while direct transport percentage was 46.38%, suggesting that almost 50% of levetiracetam undergoes direct nose-to-brain delivery. Complementarily, an in vivo intranasal repeated dose toxicity study was performed and no relevant histopathological alterations were observed. The herein proposed non-invasive and safe intranasal administration route allowed a direct nose-to-brain delivery of levetiracetam and is a promising strategy for the treatment of DRE.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with aptamers have been extensively in recent years, which can efficiently target cancer cells that improve the therapeutic effect. Aptamers (Apt) are small oligonucleotide molecule ligands have specific high-affinity. In this work, we developed a PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with doxorubicin. The NPs were modified with C2NP, a ssDNA aptamer specifically binding to CD30 protein which was over expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells. PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were formed by nanoprecipitation and loaded with doxorubicin, further conjugated C2NP aptamer via an EDC/NHS technique. Obtained results demonstrated that the targeted agent was successfully conjugated confirming by Urea PAGE and XPS. The physicochemical properties of Apt-DOX-NPs like particle size at 168.07 +/- 2.72 nm and zeta potential at - 30.76 +/- 0.153 mV. The time of the release drugs was efficiently increased in targeted formulations and showed higher accumulation in ALCL cells than non-targeted system. Findings from this work demonstrated the potential efficacy of C2NP-functionalized nanoparticles for a therapy in ALCL.

AB In the current study, two series of antimicrobial dressings conjugated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were developed and evaluated for chronic wound healing. Highly porous polycaprolactone (PCL)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers were loaded with different concentrations of SSD or AgNPs and compared comprehensively in vitro and in vivo. SSD and AgNPs indicated a strong and equal antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. However, SSD had more toxicity against fibroblast cells over one week in vitro culture. An in vivo model of wound healing on male Wistar rats was developed with a full thickness wound. All the wound dressings indicated enough flexibility and hydrophilicity, which resulted an adequate adhesion into the wound closure. After 30 days, the control group without any treatment indicated 31% wound closure while the group treated with PCL/PVA (without antimicrobial components) indicated 44% wound closure. Presence of antimicrobial components in the PCL/PVA nanofibers resulted into a lower inflammation response leading to a faster proliferation and maturation phases. In agreement with the higher biocompatibility of AgNPs than SSD, a faster angiogenesis, epithelialization and subsequently, remodeling were observed for the wound dressings loaded with AgNPs. The group treated with the highest concentration of AgNPs showed the fastest healing process leading to a final epithelialization with 96% wound closure after 30 days. This study indicated that AgNPs have higher biocompatibility and regulate wound healing process more efficiently compared to SSD. PCL/PVA nanofibers conjugated with AgNPs are promising wound dressings for full-thickness wounds.

ID THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; COMBINING INKJET
AB Inkjet printing is a form of additive manufacturing where liquid droplets are selectively deposited onto a substrate followed by solidification. The process provides significant potential advantages for producing solid oral dosage forms or tablets, including a reduction in the number of manufacturing steps as well as the ability to tailor a unique dosage regime to an individual patient. This study utilises solvent inkjet printing to print tablets through the use of a Fujifilm Dimatix printer. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone and thiamine hydrochloride (a model excipient and drug, respectively), a water-based ink formulation was developed to exhibit reliable and effective jetting properties. Tablets were printed on polyethylene terephthalate films where solvent evaporation in the ambient environment was the solidification mechanism. The tablets were shown to contain a drug loading commensurate with the composition of the ink, in its preferred polymorphic phase of a non-stoichiometric hydrate distributed homogenously. The printed tablets displayed rapid drug release. This paper illustrates solvent inkjet printing's ability to print entire free-standing tablets without an edible substrate being part of the tablet and the use of additional printing methods. Common problems with solvent-based inkjet printing, such as the use toxic solvents, are avoided. The strategy developed here for tablet manufacturing from a suitable ink is general and provides a framework for the formulation for any drug that is soluble in water.

AB Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are natural occurring vehicles attractive for drug delivery and targeting tumor cells. Here we have investigated the encapsulation and interaction of a wellknown anticancer agent curcumin with LDL and HDL. LDL particles have been found to accumulate more curcumin molecules inside their structure than HDL. The chemical stability of curcumin is enhanced and its photo-physical properties are altered due to encapsulation inside both lipoproteins. Combining photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy can improve anticancer treatment by overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Therefore, we have also investigated a co-loading of curcumin with a natural potent photosensitizer hypericin into molecules of LDL using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The loading patterns of curcumin and hypericin into LDL particles were found to be different as revealed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Present study illustrates the potential of LDL nanoparticles in combination therapy because of simultaneous loading of more than one type of drugs into these nanoparticles with high level of efficiency.

AB Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) displays interesting properties for biomedical applications such as high chemical stability, large surface area and tunable pores diameters and volumes, allowing the incorporation of large amounts of drugs, protecting them from deactivation and degradation processes acting as an excellent nanoplatform for drug delivery. However, the functional MSNs do not present the ability to transport the therapeutics without any leakage until reach the targeted cells causing side effects. On the other hand, the hydroxyls groups available on MSNs surface allows the conjugation of specific molecules which can binds to the overexpressed Enhanced Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in many tumors, representing a potential strategy for the cancer treatment. Beyond that, the targeting molecules conjugate onto mesoporous surface increase its cell internalization and act as gatekeepers blocking the mesopores controlling the drug release. In this context, multifunctional MSNs emerge as stimuli-responsive controlled drug delivery systems (CDDS) to overcome drawbacks as low internalization, premature release before to reach the region of interest, several side effects and low effectiveness of the current treatments. This review presents an overview of MSNs fabrication methods and its properties that affects drug delivery as well as stimuli-responsive CDDS for cancer treatment.

AB Albeit its well known potency as a postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment, Risedronate suffers from poor oral bioavailability and high oral toxicity. This is the first work to assess the potential of bilosomes to address challenges of RS oral delivery. Furthermore, impact of integrating cationic moiety into bilosomes on intestinal digestability and toxicity of RS nanovesicles was first investigated in this article. Prepared formulations were optimized based on physicochemical properties, digestibility, intestinal permeation and local toxicity studies. Optimized preparations were prepared by reversed phase evaporation technique with three extrusion cycles and loaded by 10 mg/ml RS. Molar lipid to bile salt to cholesterol ratio was adjusted to 4:1:1 at pH 5. Addition of cholesterol had significantly improved bilosomes stability to digestive media. Results also revealed that permeation of anionic vesicles increased permeation by 1.5 times more than RS solution and reduced drug toxicity by 2 folds. On the other hand, Cationic bilosomes showed good stability in GIT fluids but their induced oral toxicity could limit their use. In conclusion, bilosomes are superior over liposomes regarding protection of delivery system from the damaging effect of external in digestive bile salts. In addition, it decreases toxicity issues of orally administered drugs.

AB The novelty of the present research is application of a comprehensive quality by design (QbD) approach to minimize errors in product optimization and validation for the development of a stable nanocrystalline zileuton (BCS class II drug) formulation. A QbD approach was used to identify, optimize and validate the critical processes parameters (wet media milling and spray drying) and critical formulation parameters (drug and excipient concentrations). The milling time, milling speed, inlet temperature, aspirator rate, feed flow rate and drug concentration had a significant influence on the particle size and total product yield of the nanocrystalline zileuton. Trehalose compared to mannitol was determined to be a better stabilizer during spray drying processing. Stability studies revealed the following trend after 12 months: 4 degrees C (most stable) > 25 degrees C/60% RH > 40 degrees C/75% RH (least stable) for the optimized spray-dried nanocrystalline zileuton in terms of physicochemical attributes, crystallinity and in vitro dissolution testing. Based on the comprehensive QbD approach, stable spray-dried nanocrystalline zileuton was obtained with exceptionally high total product yield (similar to 80% w/w) and small particle size (276.4 +/- 27.54 nm) with low PDI (0.109 +/- 0.056 units). Drug release from the formulations followed a particle size dependent dissolution trend. Additionally, pH switch dissolution testing indicated that complete drug release from the nanoformulations was observed at intestinal pH (pH 6.8) within 1-2 h of the shift from the stomach pH (pH 1.2).

AB We previously found that a slow ramp rate during the shelf ramp process induced product collapse. However, the cause of the collapse could not be explained by the hypothesized mechanism of collapse. To identify the cause, drying parameters such as sublimation rate and dry layer resistance (R-p) were calculated from cycle data by mathematical model. As a result, the behavior of these parameters in the slow ramp cycles showed a different profile from that of the fast ramp cycles. From the cross-sectional appearance of the lyophilized cakes, the point at which the onset of collapse occurred in vial lyophilization during the slowest ramp cycle was estimated, and collapse occurred as expected, at a dry layer thickness (L-dry) = 1.5 mm in the R-p - L-dry profile. The time-point of L-dry = 1.5 mm corresponded to the shelf ramp process; the subliming ice front temperature (T-i) at this point was lower than the collapse temperature (T-c) measured by LT-FDM. Although T-i in the fastest ramp cycle exceeded the above temperature, no macroscopic collapse was observed. Thus, the real T-c during the shelf ramp process in vial lyophilization was decreased by the slow ramp rate, and this was considered the reason for collapse in the slow ramp cycle.

AB Formulations for the controlled release of substances in the human terminal ileum and colon are essential to target the gut microbiome and its interactions with the intestinal mucosa. In contrast to pharmaceutical enteric coatings, reliable food-grade alternatives are still scarce. Shellac coatings have been used for various active ingredients, but their stability is affected by the physicochemical properties of the encapsulated substances. It is well known, that shellac release can be modulated by an acidic subcoating. Here, we hypothesized that a triple shellac coating with an adjusted intermediate coating (acidic or alkaline) can be effectively used to counteract the differences in pH value of various encapsulated substances, allowing a precise targeting of the desired release pH value. First, the system was tested with riboflavin 5'-monophosphate sodium salt dihydrate (RMSD) as a characteristic model substance. Secondly, it was transferred to nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NAM) as bioactive compounds with different physio-chemical properties: NAM, an alkaline crystalline and highly water-soluble substance, led to a premature release from conventional shellac microcapsules, whereas RMSD and NA with their medium solubility and neutral to acidic pH properties delayed the shellac dissolution. A precise modulation of the release profile of each substance was possible by the addition of different intermediate subcoatings: an acidic layer with citric acid counteracted the premature release of the alkaline and highly soluble NAM. In contrast, an alkaline sodium bicarbonate intermediate subcoating enhanced shellac swelling and delayed the release of NA and RMSD. In conclusion, the novel triple-layer shellac coating provides a much higher adaptability and reliability for nutritional formulations aiming at a targeted release in the ileocolonic region.

AB The use of opioids for treating acute and chronic pain condition is a common clinical practice. When delivered systemically, the analgesic activity is mediated through the central pathway, which although effective, leads to various adverse effects such as dependence, abuse and respiratory depression. Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic that is available as injection and transdermal patch products for the management of acute and chronic pain. These products require stringent regulatory controls and label warnings on disposal due to the abuse potential associated. This research project evaluated the regional antinociceptive efficacy of fentanyl delivered from soluble microneedles. The microneedle patches were formulated with relatively less drug loading as compared to patches intended for systemic delivery and were tested for their antinociceptive activity in rats by measuring the paw withdrawal latency when exposed to a thermal stimulus. The results indicate that regional delivery of fentanyl mediated through soluble microneedles provides an effective antinociceptive activity. The onset of analgesic activity was faster with microneedle patch (0.5 h) when compared to the adhesive dermal patch (6 h). This study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of microneedle mediated pain management for immediate pain relief.

AB The present study aimed to develop a photochemically stabilized formulation of dacarbazine [5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide; DTIC] for reducing the production of algogenic photodegradant (5-diazoimidazole-4-carboxamide; Diazo-IC). Photochemical properties of DTIC were characterized by UV-visible light spectral analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, and photostability testing. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted after intravenous administration of DTIC formulations (1 mg-DTIC/kg) to rats. DTIC exhibited strong absorption in the UVA range, and photoirradiated DTIC exhibited marked ROS generation. Thus, DTIC had high photoreactive potential. After exposure of DTIC (1 mM) to simulated sunlight (250 W/m(2)) for 3 min, remaining DTIC and yielded Diazo-IC were estimated to be ca. 230 mu M and 600 mu M, respectively. The addition of radical scavenger (1 mM), including L-ascorbic acid, L-cysteine (Cys), L-histidine, D-mannitol, L-tryptophan, or L-tyrosine, to DTIC (1 mM) could attenuate DTIC photoreactions, and in particular, the addition of Cys to DTIC brought ca. 34% and 86% inhibition of DTIC photodegradation and Diazo-IC photogeneration, respectively. There were no significant differences in the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of DTIC between DTIC and DTIC with Cys (0.67 mg/kg). From these findings, the supplementary use of Cys would be an effective approach to improve the photostability of DTIC with less production of Diazo-IC.

AB Adenosine, which is produced mainly by microbial fermentation, plays an important role in the therapy of cardiovascular disease and has been widely used as an antiarrhythmic agent. In this study, guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) synthetase gene (guaA) was inactivated by gene-target manipulation to increase the metabolic flux from inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) to adenosine in B. subtilis A509. The resulted mutant M3-3 showed an increased adenosine production from 7.40 to 10.45 g/L, which was further enhanced to a maximum of 14.39 g/L by central composite design. As the synthesis of succinyladenosine monophosphate (sAMP) from IMP catalysed by adenylosuccinate synthetase (encoded by purA gene) is the rate-limiting step in adenosine synthesis, the up-regulated transcription level of purA was the potential underlying mechanism for the increased adenosine production. This work demonstrated a practical strategy for breeding B. subtilis strains for industrial nucleoside production.

AB Salicylate (SA) is an important platform chemical widely used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, an efficient SA producing strain was constructed by step-by-step chromosome integration. First, the SA biosynthetic module controlled by promoters P-T7 or P-tac was integrated into the chromosome of E. coli, generating the basal strain SA producing strains. P-T7 performed better than P-tac and led to higher SA titers, the best of which was 233.6 +/- 6.6 mg/L. Disrupting pheA/tyrA eliminated accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine, improving SA titer to 492.4 +/- 9.3 mg/L. Strengthening the upstream pathway by enhancing expression of aroG further improved SA titer to 679.9 +/- 27.1 mg/L. Furthermore, pykA/pykF were disrupted to conserve phosphoenolpyruvate, resulting in a final strain that can produce 769.8 +/- 12.6 mg/L of SA using glucose and glycerol as the mixed carbon source. When using sole glycerol instead, the titer was significantly improved to 1560.6 +/- 50.2 mg/L. The platform strain was further used to produce muconic acid and salicyl alcohol by introducing the downstream SA-conversion modules. In this study, we constructed an effcient SA producing E. coli strain by chromosome integration, which can be used as a platform for the production of SA derivatives.

AB Blastemal Wilms' tumors are associated with poor chemo-responsiveness and an adverse prognosis. Our aim was to contribute to the miRNA profiling of the disease, while demonstrating the value of archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples as miRNA sources. MiRNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissues of 8 patients diagnosed with blastemal Wilms' tumor in Hungary. A quantitative real-time PCR-based protocol was used to identify miRNAs of interest and study the expression of selected miRNAs in all samples. Profiling of miRNA expression from FFPE samples turned out to be cost-effective in Wilms' tumor, as most miRNAs (including miRNA-194-5p, which was studied in all patients) showed expression alterations similar to the ones reported in the literature. MiR-184 expression was found to be lower than in previous studies, while the downregulation of miR-203a is a novel finding. MiR-184 may be downregulated in a subset of blastemal and other Wilms' tumors. A loss of miR-203a may or may not be specific to blastemal cells, but available evidence hints at its importance in the pathogenesis of Wilms' tumor. It should be considered for inclusion in future studies of miRNA expression.

AB CD24 is a small molecular weight cell-surface protein and an independent marker for poor prognosis in the different type of cancers. We aimed to determine the expression of CD24 in plasma, exosomes and ovarian tissue samples of serous ovarian cancer patients.
   We collected tissue and blood samples from 21 cases of serous ovarian cancer and eight healthy controls. We used silica adsorption method for isolation of RNA. The cDNA was synthesized using quantitative real-time PCR. We used beta-globin as a housekeeping gene for the normalization of the data. Protein-protein and miRNA networking were analyzed.
   There was a significant difference in the expression of CD24 in ovarian tissue between controls and patients (0.16 +/- 0.32 vs. 44.97 +/- 68.06; p < 0.01), while CD24 did not show expression in each plasma and exosome samples. There was a correlation in the expression of CD24 and FIGO grading between controls and patients.
   CD24 expression was detected in exosomes in 38.1% of patients, mainly with FIGO III, and in their plasma in 9.5% of cases. Our network analysis shows LYN, SELP, FGR, and NPM1 proteins are interacting with CD24.
   Our study demonstrates higher expression of CD24 in ovarian cancer patients' tissue samples, and there is an association with FIGO classification. However, CD24 showed expression only in some cell-free plasma and exosome samples.

AB The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the development of high-yielding varieties enabled substantial increase in crop productivity during the 20th century. However, the increase in yield over the last two decades has been slower. It is thought that further improvement in productivity of the major crop species using traditional cultivation methods is limited. Therefore, the use of genetic engineering seems to be a promising approach. There is ongoing research concerning genes that have an impact on plant growth, development and yield. The proteins and miRNAs encoded by these genes participate in a variety of processes, such as growth regulation, assimilate transport and partitioning as well as macronutrient uptake and metabolism. This paper presents the major directions in research concerning genes that may be targets of genetic engineering aimed to improve plant productivity.

AB Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are biocompatible-engineered polypeptides, with promising interest in tissue engineering due to their intrinsic biological and physical properties, and their ease of production. The IKVAV (Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) laminin-1 sequence has been shown to sustain neuron attachment and growth. In this study, the IKVAV adhesion sequence, or a scrambled VKAIV sequence, were incorporated by genetic engineering in the structure of an ELP, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The transition temperatures of the ELP-IKVAV and ELP-VKAIV were determined to be 23 degrees C. Although the phase transition was fully reversible for ELP-VKAIV, we observed an irreversible aggregation for ELP-IKVAV. The corresponding aggregates shared some characteristics with amyloid-like polypeptides. The two ELPs were then reacted with functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form hydrogels. These hydrogels were characterized for rheological properties, tested with cultures of rat primary sensory neurons, and implanted subcutaneously in mice for 4 weeks. Sensory neurons cultured on high IKVAV concentration hydrogels (20%) formed longer neurite than those of neurons grown on hydrogels containing the scrambled IKVAV sequence. Finally, in vivo evaluation showed the absence of detectable inflammation. In conclusion, this functionalized ELP-IKVAV biomaterial shows interesting properties for tissue engineering requiring neurotization.

AB In order to maximize cell growth and productivity for an inducible CHO cell line expressing rituximab, various fed-batch culture strategies were investigated. In each case, the performance was evaluated for cultures induced at moderate and high cell density conditions (4 x 10(6) and 10 x 10(6) cells/mL) to assess the impact of the timing of induction. We first demonstrate the importance of starting the feeding process during the growth phase, as this translated into significantly improved integral of viable cells and antibody concentration, when compared to post-induction feeding only. Secondly, we investigated the impact of the feed rate by maintaining different levels of glucose (25, 35 and 50 mM) via a dynamic feeding strategy. The highest antibody concentrations were achieved under a moderate feeding regime for both cell densities at induction, highlighting the risks of under-or over-feeding the cultures. We then evaluated the impact of performing a temperature shift at induction by testing different mild hypothermia conditions. At small-scale, the highest production yields (1.2 g/L) were achieved when the temperature was reduced from 37 to 30 degrees C during the production phase of a culture induced at high cell density. When the strategy was applied in bioreactor, the better controlled conditions led to even greater product concentrations (1.8 g/L). Furthermore, this production protocol was shown to promote a more galactosylated glycan profile than a bioreactor culture initiated at 34 degrees C during growth and downshifted to 30 degrees C during the production phase.

AB Streptococcus mutans plays a key role in the development of dental caries and promotes the formation of oral biofilm produced by glucosyltransferases (GTFs). Bacillus velezensis K68 was isolated from traditional fermented foods and inhibits biofilm formation mediated by S. mutans. Gene amplification results demonstrated that B. velezensis K68 contained genes for the biosynthesis of 1-deoxynojirimycin (1-DNJ), a known GTF expression inhibitor. The presence of the GabT1, Yktc1, and GutB1 genes required for 1-DNJ synthesis in B. velezensis K68 was confirmed. Supernatant from B. velezensis K68 culture medium inhibited biofilm formation by 84% when S. mutans was cultured for 48 h, and inhibited it maximally when 1% glucose was added to the S. mutans culture medium as a GTF substrate. In addition, supernatant from B. velezensis K68 medium containing 3 ppb 1-DNJ decreased S. mutans cell surface hydrophobicity by 79.0 +/- 0.8% compared with that of untreated control. The supernatant containing 1-DNJ decreased S. mutans adherence by 99.97% and 98.83% under sugar-dependent and sugar-independent conditions, respectively. S. mutans treated with the supernatant exhibited significantly reduced expression of the essential GTF genes gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD compared to that in the untreated group. Thus, B. velezensis inhibits biofilm formation, adhesion, and GTF gene expression of S. mutans through 1-DNJ production.

AB Although massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is becoming common practice in both research and routine clinical care, confirmation requirements of identified DNA variants using alternative methods are still topics of debate. When evaluating variants directly from MPS data, different read depth statistics, together with specialized genotype quality scores are, therefore, of high relevance. Here we report results of our validation study performed in two different ways: 1) confirmation of MPS identified variants using Sanger sequencing; and 2) simultaneous Sanger and MPS analysis of exons of selected genes. Detailed examination of false-positive and false-negative findings revealed typical error sources connected to low read depth/coverage, incomplete reference genome, indel realignment problems, as well as microsatellite associated amplification errors leading to base miss-calling. However, all these error types were identifiable with thorough manual revision of aligned reads according to specific patterns of distributions of variants and their corresponding reads. Moreover, our results point to dependence of both basic quantitative metrics (such as total read counts, alternative allele read counts and allelic balance) together with specific genotype quality scores on the used bioinformatics pipeline, stressing thus the need for establishing of specific thresholds for these metrics in each laboratory and for each involved pipeline independently.

AB Ovarian tumor is one of the leading causes of cancer among women. Patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, usually. There is a need for new specific and sensitive biomarkers.
   Mitochondrial DNA copy number change was observed in various cancers. Our aim was to detect mitochondrial DNA copy number in whole blood (wb-mtDNA) and in plasma (cell-free and exosome encapsulated mtDNA) in patients with serous epithelial ovarian tumor.
   DNA was isolated from EDTA blood and plasma obtained from 24 patients and 24 healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated from cell-free plasma, and exosome encapsulated DNA (exoDNA) was extracted. Quantitative-real-time PCR was performed with Human Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Monitoring Primer Set. Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis.
   Wb-mtDNA copy number was significantly different among healthy controls and patients in multiple comparison (p = 0.0090 considering FIGO stage independently, and p = 0.0048 considering early- and late-stage cancers). There was a significant decrease among early-stage, all advanced stage and all cancer patients (FIGO I: 32.5 +/- 8.3, p = 0.0061; FIGO III + IV: 37.2 +/- 13.7 p = 0.0139; FIGO I + III + IV: 35.6 +/- 12.2, p = 0.0017) or FIGO III patients alone (32.8 +/- 5.6, p = 0.00089) compared to healthy controls.
   We found significant increase in copy number in exosomal mtDNA in cancer patients (236.0 +/- 499.0, p = 0.0155), advanced-stage cancer patients (333.0 +/- 575.0, p = 0.0095), of FIGO III (362.0 +/- 609.2, p = 0.0494), and FIGO IV (304.0 +/- 585.0, p = 0.0393) patients alone but not in samples of FIGO I patients (10.0 +/- 3.5, p = 0.3907). In multiple comparison the increase was significant considering early- and late-stage cancers (p = 0.0253). Cell-free mtDNA copy numbers were not increased significantly.
   We found the highest copy number of mtDNA in exosomes, followed by plasma and peripheral blood in late-stage cancer patients. We observed significant difference in wb-mtDNA copy number between healthy controls and both early- and late-stage cancer patients.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor with a 16-24 -months overall survival time (OS). Effective management is hindered by intratumoral heterogeneity, a characteristic trait of GBM which results in subpopulations of cells with altered therapeutic responsiveness, different invasiveness and growth potential. Correct initial molecular profiling of the tumor, as well as following its molecular biological changes are further impeded by the intracranial location of the tumors, hence the risks of surgical interventions. Radiological examination, the sole non-invasive method of obtaining information about the tumors, also has limitations.
   This review article aims to summarize the currently available information about the promising applicability of liquid biopsy, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cf-NAs) in GBM patients. Liquid biopsy is a quick and inexpensive way of obtaining exceptionally relevant information about tumors, and can be performed multiple times during the clinical course of the disease. Furthermore, integrating analyses of EVs and related cf-NAs in clinical practice might also help to establish diagnosis in a non-invasive manner, and complex oncotherapy could be indicated in the future without high-risk neurosurgical interventions.

AB Polymer-coated nanocarriers play an important role in targeted drug delivery. The use of polymers such as polyethylene glycol increases stability, biocompatibility, and blood circulation time of the drug, and may consequently improve the success of drug delivery. In the present work, a simple approach has been reported for synthesizing polyethylene glycol bis amin (PEGA) functionalized graphene oxide/iron oxide nanocomposite as a remarkable unit for loading drugs. The biomedical applications of the synthesized nanocomposite were investigated by immobilizing methotrexate (MTX), as an anticancer drug. The structural and morphological characteristics and the successful synthesis of the nanocomposite were evaluated by different charachterization techniques. The cytotoxicity assay of the nanocarrier showed higher toxicity against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, compared to free MTX. The drug release experiments in acidic and physiological conditions suggested the first order kinetics model for the release of MTX from the nanocomposite. Furthermore, the agglutination, complement activation, and coagulation time experiments demonstrated the blood compatibility of the synthesized nanocarrier.

AB The macaque simian or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SIV/SHIV) challenge model has been widely used to inform and guide human vaccine trials. Substantial advances have been made recently in the application of repeated-low-dose challenge (RLD) approach to assess SIV/SHIV vaccine efficacies (VE). Some candidate HIV vaccines have shown protective effects in preclinical studies using the macaque SIV/SHIV model but the model's true predictive value for screening potential HIV vaccine candidates needs to be evaluated further. Here, we review key parameters used in the RLD approach and discuss their relevance for evaluating VE to improve preclinical studies of candidate HIV vaccines.

AB In the past when large investments have been made in tackling narrow scientific challenges, the enormous expansion in our knowledge in one small area has had a spill-over effect on research and treatment of other diseases. The large investment in HIV vaccine development in recent years has the potential for such an effect on vaccine development for other diseases. HIV vaccine developers have experienced repeated failure using the standard approaches to vaccine development. This has forced them to consider immune responses in greater depth and detail. It has led to a recognition of the importance of epitopic specificity in both antibody and T cell responses. Also, it has led to an understanding of the importance of affinity maturation in antibody responses and the quality of T cell responses in T cell-mediated immunity. It has advanced the development of many novel vaccine vectors and vehicles that are now available for use in other vaccines. Further, it has focused attention on the impact of research funding mechanisms and community engagement on vaccine development.

AB Objective: To test the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention in obstetrics/gynecology (ob-gyn) clinics to increase uptake of influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines in pregnant women and these vaccines plus human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in non-pregnant women.
   Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial among 9 private ob-gyn practices in Colorado from 9/2011 to 5/2014. The intervention consisted of: designation of immunization champions, staff/provider trainings, assistance with vaccine purchasing/management, identification of eligible patients, standing order implementation, chart review/feedback, and patient education materials. Control practices continued usual care. Primary outcomes were receipt of influenza and Tdap vaccines among pregnant women and these vaccines plus HPV vaccine among non-pregnant women, comparing a Baseline period (Year 0/Year 1) to Year 2, intervention versus control. With an estimated sample size of 32,590 per arm, there would be >80% power to detect a 10% difference between groups.
   Results: In the Baseline period, 27% of pregnant women in both intervention and control practices received influenza vaccine. In Year 2, 29% of pregnant women in intervention practices received influenza vaccine versus 41% in control practices. In the Baseline period, 18% of pregnant women in intervention practices received Tdap vaccine versus 22% in control practices. Both intervention and control practices increased to 51% in Year 2, representing an increase of 33% for intervention practices and 29% for control practices, consistent with a change in Tdap recommendations. Relatively few HPV, influenza or Tdap vaccines (<= 6% of eligible patients) were given to non-pregnant patients in either intervention or control practices at any time during the study.
   Conclusion: In this cluster randomized trial designed to increase vaccination uptake, both intervention and control practices showed improved vaccination of pregnant but not non-pregnant patients. Future work should focus on tailoring evidence-based immunization practices or developing new approaches to specifically fit busy ob-gyn offices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The public acceptance and implementation of vaccination programs is essential to prevent infectious diseases. However, vaccine adverse events may cause public panic and eventually lead to an increasing number of populations who were hesitant or refuse to participate in these vaccination programs. In 2018, the Changsheng vaccine crisis broke out in mainland China, and 252,600 unqualified DTP vaccines were reported to be used for child vaccination. In this study, we observed media and public reactions toward the vaccine crisis.
   Methods: This study conducted Internet surveillance by four mainstream indicators from July 15th to August 7th, including social media (WeChat, Sina Weibo), online news and Baidu search index. We also analyzed the emotional perceptions of people in crisis through an online questionnaire survey.
   Results: During the crisis, huge number of articles emerged on Internet, 125,882,894 articles (including forwarding) on WeChat friends circle, 1,877,660 Sina Weibo posts, 648,265 online news and 4,986,521 Baidu search indexes. Most of these articles were negative and expressed the public's weak confidence to the China-made vaccines. Public confidence in vaccines was undermined by the actions of the manufacturer and the government.
   Conclusions: The DTP vaccine crisis led to panic about immunization and eroded trust in the immunization program and in the government. Restoring public confidence in Chinese-made vaccines will take a long time, and meticulous management in vaccine production, and strict government regulation will help to alleviate public anxiety about vaccine safety and ultimately restore confidence.

AB Incorporation of membrane-anchored flagellin molecules into the surfaces of influenza virus-like particles (VLP) was previously reported to promote T helper (Th) 1-biased IgG antibody production and protective efficacy of co-presented vaccine antigens. Herein, we investigated the potential adjuvant effects and mechanisms of flagellin-expressing VLP (FliC-VLP) as an independent component on influenza vaccination in wild-type and mutant mouse models. FliC-VLP adjuvanted influenza vaccination was highly effective in promoting the induction of Th1-biased IgG isotype switched antibodies, enhanced protection, and long-lasting IgG antibody responses in both wild-type and CD4-knockout mice. In contrast, the adjuvant effects of soluble flagellin were Th2-biased and required CD4 T helper cells. The adjuvant effects of FliC-VLP were less dependent on CD4 T cells and flagellin-mediated innate immune signaling pathways. The results suggest that FliC-VLP might play an effective adjuvant role in an immune competent condition as well as in a defect of CD4 T cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Foot and Mouth Disease is a highly contagious and economically important disease of livestock. While vaccination is often effective at controlling viral spread, failures can occur due to strain mismatch or viral mutation. Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) possesses a hypervariable region within the G-H Loop of VP1, a capsid protein commonly associated with virus neutralization. Here, we investigate the effect of replacement of the G-H loop hypervariable epitope with a xenoepitope from PRRS virus on the immunogenicity and efficacy of an adenovirus vectored FMDV vaccine (Ad5-FMD). Pigs were vaccinated with Ad5-FMD, the modified Ad5-FMDxeno, or PBS, followed by intradermal challenge with FDMV strain O-1 Manisa at 21 days post-vaccination. While overall serum antibody titers were significantly higher in Ad5-FMDxeno vaccinated animals, neutralizing antibody titers were decreased in pigs that received Ad5-FMDxeno, when compared to those vaccinated with Ad5-FMD, prior to viral challenge, indicative of immune redirection away from VP1 towards non-neutralizing epitopes. As expected, animals vaccinated with unmodified Ad5-FMD were protected from lesions, fever, and viremia. In contrast, animals vaccinated with Ad5-FMDxeno developed clinical signs and viremia, but at lower levels than that observed in PBS-treated controls. No significant difference was found in nasal shedding of virions between the two Ad5-FMD vaccinated groups. This data suggests that the hypervariable epitope of the VP1 G-H loop contributes to protective immunity conferred by Ad5 vector-delivered FMD vaccines in swine, and cannot be substituted without a loss of immunogenicity.

TI Therapeutic HSV-2 vaccine decreases recurrent virus shedding and
   recurrent genital herpes disease
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIVIRAL THERAPY; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SAFETY
AB Background: Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 is a common persistent infection that frequently reactivates to cause recurrent lesions and recurrent viral shedding which is incompletely controlled by antiviral therapy. GEN-003 is a candidate therapeutic vaccine containing 2 HSV-2 proteins, gD2 and ICP4, and Matrix-M2 adjuvant (M2).
   Methods: HSV-2 seropositive persons with genital herpes were randomized into three dose cohorts of Gen-003 (60 mu g antigen/50 mu g M2, 60 mu g/75 mu g M2 or Placebo). Three intramuscular doses 21 days apart of GEN-003 or placebo were administered. Participants obtained genital area swabs twice-daily for HSV-2 detection and monitored genital lesions for 12 months. The rates of virus shedding and lesion rates before vaccination were compared to 3 defined periods after vaccination; Days 43-71, Month 6 and Month 12.
   Results: GEN-003 at a dose of 60 mu g each antigen/50 mu g M2 reduced HSV shedding immediately after dosing with a rate ratio of 0.58, compared to 0.75 for the GEN-003 6014/75 mu g M2 and 1.06 for placebo. Lesion rates, recurrence rates, and duration of recurrences were also reduced. Reactogenicity was higher with the 75 mu g M2 dose than the 50 mu g M2 dose, specifically for pain, tenderness, malaise and fatigue. Antibody and cellular immune responses were stimulated by both doses and persisted to 12 months.
   Conclusions: GEN-003 vaccine manufactured with a scalable process gave results similar to those observed in prior clinical trials. GEN-003 had an acceptable safety profile and stimulated both humoral and cellular immune responses. The 60 mu g antigen/50 mu g M2 provided the maximal effect on virologic and clinical measures and warrants further development. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   RODENTS
AB Lassa fever is an acute viral illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), a rodent-borne pathogen. LASV is endemic to much of Sub-Saharan West Africa, where seasonal outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality. Increased global awareness of LASV has led to development of improved diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. As vaccine candidates are trialled, it is essential to assess the potential outcomes of introducing a LASV vaccination program in endemic regions. This study investigates the potential outcomes of routine and pulse vaccination strategies using a deterministic mathematical model that captures seasonal LASV transmission between rodents and humans. For plausible parameter values, we find that immunization of 40% of infants at 70% vaccine effectiveness achieves a population-level reduction in infectious case numbers of 30%, while coverage of 60% at 90% vaccine effectiveness achieves a 56% reduction. Similar reductions can be achieved more rapidly via population-wide pulse vaccination at 11% coverage (30% reduction at 70% effectiveness) or 23% coverage (56% reduction at 90% effectiveness) repeated every 10 years. Similar pulse vaccine doses delivered at reduced frequency, but increased coverage achieves a greater reduction in infectious cases. Findings around infant vaccination are sensitive to our assumption that immunity is life-long, while pulse-vaccination has only slightly reduced effect if immunity lasts 10-30 years. An effective LASV vaccination program would incorporate pulse vaccination in addition to routine childhood immunization to limit disease. Estimates of feasible vaccine coverage and effectiveness are needed to fully quantify the likely benefits of a vaccination program in LASV endemic regions.

AB In kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) long-term immunosuppression leads to BK virus (BKV) reactivation, with an increased incidence of BKV-associated pathologies and allograft rejection. The current approaches to limit BKV infection include a reduction in immunosuppression and use of anti-BKV drugs, which are clinically sub-optimal and lead to undesirable therapeutic outcomes. Here, we adopted an immune-based approach to augment the endogenous BKV specific T-cells. Using reverse vaccinology based in silico analyses, we designed a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine for BKV (MVBKV). A major advantage of our approach is that the selected epitopes show an affinity towards all the 12 superfamilies of HLA class I alleles and 27 reference alleles of HLA class II. This suggests MVBKV's universal nature and its potential effectiveness in a wide-population base. To improve MVBKV's immunogenic properties, a synthetic Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 4 peptide ligand (RS09) was added to the final vaccine construct. The sequences of the individual epitopes were molecularly linked to form a 3D-stable synthetic protein. Overall, our immunoinformatic-based approach led to the design of a new MVBKV vaccine, which remains to be validated experimentally. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.
   Methods: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of <= 7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay.
   Results: During the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or reenrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season.
   Conclusion: RSV had an attack rate of 10-13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adjuvants are substances that enhance adaptive immune response to antigen. Development of a safe and effective immunostimulant adjuvant is essential for the efficacy of a vaccine to protect against infectious pathogens. Purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria exhibited nontoxic natural lipid A variants that are distinct in their chemical structures from that of the Escherichia coli-type lipid A. In this study, the adjuvant efficacy of attenuated lipid A variants and their corresponding lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), derived from purple photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodocyclus tenuis and Rhodobacter sphaeroides) were evaluated. LPS was extracted using modified phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method and lipid A was separated by mild acid hydrolysis. Trinitrophenol (TNP) was conjugated to hen egg albumin (TNP-HEA) and used as haptenic antigen. The LPS and lipid A adjuvant candidates were formulated in oil-in-water emulsion (OIWE) and evaluated to elicit anti-TNP IgG against TNP-HEA conjugate in BALB/c female mice. The anti-TNP IgG titers were measured using ELISA. The intact LPS-based adjuvants present in OIWE formulation showed significantly higher efficacy to elicit anti-TNP IgG titers against TNP-HEA conjugate compared to their corresponding lipid A-based adjuvants. As expected, the OIWE formulations of all LPS- and lipid A-based adjuvant candidates showed higher activities compared to the aqueous formulations. Slow reduction in the levels of anti-TNP IgG antibodies in the serum was observed over 4 months after immunization using the LPS- and lipid A-based adjuvant candidates which may provide a long protection against pathogens. The attenuated LPSs and lipid A's from the photosynthetic bacteria showed promising results to develop novel safe and effective adjuvants that can evoke the immune response. The most promising adjuvant candidate was the LPS-based adjuvant from R. tenuis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Pain following herpes zoster (HZ) can persist for months and negatively impact quality of life. To evaluate the effect of zoster vaccine live (ZVL) on progression of pain following HZ, we conducted a prospective cohort study of HZ cases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.
   Methods: ZVL vaccinated and unvaccinated members aged >= 60 years with laboratory-confirmed HZ from January 18, 2012 to February 26, 2015 were followed up within 5 days of HZ diagnosis, and at 30, 60, and 90 days after diagnosis. Pain was assessed with the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) on a 0-10 scale, using cut-points of >= 3, >= 5, and >= 7, with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) defined as pain >= 3 at 90 days. Log binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) associated with pain, comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated HZ patients.
   Results: We interviewed 509 vaccinated and 509 unvaccinated HZ patients. ZVL was associated with significantly lower risks of HZ-related pain at all time-points. The risk of PHN in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively, was 9.2% and 15.4% (aRR = 0.594, 95% CI: 0.413, 0.854); 2.0% and 4.8% of these patients reported pain >= 7 (aRR = 0.332, 95% CI: 0.153, 0.721). Irrespective of vaccination, the risk of PHN was lower in adults aged <70 years versus those >= 70 years and was similar or lower in females versus males.
   Conclusion: We used laboratory confirmation of HZ cases and patient survey to show that aside from preventing HZ, ZVL reduced HZ-related pain and prevented PHN among vaccine recipients who experienced HZ. Observational studies will be needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness of the new recombinant zoster vaccine and its benefits in protecting patients against PHN. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a highly-adapted and human-restricted pathogen responsible for a high global burden of disease across a diverse clinical spectrum. Vaccine development has been impeded by scientific, regulatory, and commercial obstacles. Human infection studies (HIS) are increasingly contributing to drug, diagnostics, and vaccine development, reducing uncertainty at early stages, especially for pathogens with animal models that incompletely reproduce key elements of human disease. We review the small number of historical GAS HIS and present the study protocol for a dose-ranging inpatient study in healthy adults. The primary objective of the study is to establish a new GAS pharyngitis HIS with an attack rate of at least 60% as a safe and reliable platform for vaccine evaluation and pathogenesis research. According to an adaptive dose-ranging study design, emm75 GAS doses manufactured in keeping with principles of Good Manufacturing Practice will be directly applied by swab to the pharynx of carefully screened healthy adult volunteers at low risk of severe complicated GAS disease. Participants will remain as closely monitored inpatients for up to six days, observed for development of the primary outcome of acute symptomatic pharyngitis, as defined by clinical and microbiological criteria. All participants will be treated with antibiotics and followed as outpatients for six months. An intensive sampling schedule will facilitate extensive studies of host and organism dynamics during experimental pharyngitis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pneumococcus remains a common cause of otitis media (OM) despite the widespread introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In mice, a pneumococcal whole cell vaccine (WCV) induces serotype-independent protection against pneumococcal colonisation and invasive disease via T(H)17- and antibody-mediated immunity, respectively. We investigated the effect of WCV on influenza A-induced pneumococcal OM in an infant mouse model.
   C57BL/6 mice were immunised subcutaneously with a single dose of WCV or adjuvant at 6 days of age, infected with pneumococci (EF3030 [serotype 19F] or PMP1106 [16F]) at 12 days of age, and given influenza A virus (A/Udorn/72/307 [H3N2], IAV) at 18 days of age to induce pneumococcal OM. Pneumococcal density in middle ear and nasopharyngeal tissues was determined 6 and 12 days post-virus. Experiments were repeated in antibody (B6.mu MT-/-)- and CD4(+) T-cell-deficient mice to investigate the immune responses involved.
   A single dose of WCV did not prevent the development of pneumococcal OM, nor accelerate pneumococcal clearance compared with mice receiving adjuvant alone. However, WCV reduced the density of EF3030 in the middle ear at 6 days post-viral infection (p = 0.022), and the density of both isolates in the nasopharynx at 12 days post-viral infection (EF3030, p = 0.035; PMP1106, p = 0.011), compared with adjuvant alone. The reduction in density in the middle ear required antibodies and CD4(+) T cells: WCV did not reduce EF3030 middle ear density in B6.mu MT-/- mice (p = 0.35) nor in wild-type mice given anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody before and after IAV inoculation (p = 0.91); and WCV-immunised CD4(+) T cell-deficient GK1.5 mice had higher levels of EF3030 in the middle ear than their adjuvant-immunised counterparts (p = 0.044).
   A single subcutaneous dose of WCV reduced pneumococcal density in the middle ears of co-infected mice in one of two strains tested, but did not prevent OM from occurring in this animal model. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background and purposes: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are multifactorial diseases characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and are susceptible to genetic and environmental risk factors. The macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA) was discovered as a protein to mediate the attachment of erythroid cells to macrophages and is essential for bone marrow hematopoiesis. MAEA is expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues including osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Recent studies have shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6815464 (C/G) in the MAEA gene increases the susceptibility of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the contribution of MAEA to bone metabolism remains unknown. Therefore, we performed this study to evaluate the association between MAEA polymorphism and low BMD.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study with postmenopausal Japanese women living in the Yokogoshi area, Niigata City, we evaluated whether rs6815464 was associated with low BMD. Blood samples were collected from 353 subjects (age 63.8 5.4 years). The MAEA genotype was determined by TaqMan assay. BMD was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L2-L4), hip and femoral neck. Low BMD was defined as a T-score < -1.
   Results: The percentage of subjects with low BMD in the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck were 71%, 75% and 84% respectively. After adjusting age, BMI, HbAlc, smoking and alcohol consumption, the G-allele carriage was found to be associated with low BMD of total hip (odds ratio = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.14-3.91, P = 0.018), but not of the lumbar spine or femoral neck.
   Conclusion: The MAEA gene polymorphism rs6815464 was associated with low hip BMD in postmenopausal Japanese women.

   DIAGNOSIS; TRANSPORT; STABILITY; TOPOLOGY
AB Background-Glycogen storage disease type-la is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in G6PC1 gene leading to deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase-a specifically in the liver/kidney/intestine.
   Patients and methods: DNA of six unrelated Indian GSD-la patients were screened for mutations in the entire coding region of G6PC1 gene followed by direct DNA sequencing and functional was tested using glucose-6phosphatase assay.
   Results: Mutational screening of GSD-la patients identified five novel mutations, viz., 1) p.V99Cfs*3, 2) p.G125R, 3) IVS1-2A > T, 4) IVS3 + 39G > A and 5) IVS3 + 42G > A along with three previously reported mutations p.G118D, p.R149Q and p.A331V. Interestingly, each of the p.V99Cfs*3, IVS1-2A > T and p.G118D mutations are identified in two unrelated GSD-la cases. Further allelic distribution of p.V99Cfs*3 and p.A331V mutations were confirmed by RFLP analysis, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Functional characterization revealed that glucose-6-phosphatase activity was completely abrogated with the mutant proteins p.G125R, p.R149Q, p.G118D, p.A331V and p.V99Cfs*3 than wild-type. However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of mutant constructs at transcription and translation level.
   Conclusion: Five novel mutations, p.V99Cfs*3, p.G125R, IVS1-2A > T, IVS3 + 39G > A and IVS3 + 42G > A are reported first time to cause GSD-1a among Indian ethnicity and are not yet reported elsewhere, suggesting separate ethnic founder effects for some mutations among Indian ethnicity.

AB The weaker expression of the two main proteins adhering melanocytes to the epidermis basal layer, Epithelial Cadherin (E-cadherin) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1), has been implicated as one of the aggravating factors in the loss of melanocytes in vitiligo. The present study was designed to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the genes encoding these proteins, CDH1 and DDR1, and the risk of developing vitiligo. The independent case-control study was conducted on the sample including152 patients with vitiligo and 152 matched controls. A questionnaire was completed for recording demographic and clinical characteristics of vitiligo patients. Venous blood samples were taken from all the subjects. Genotype frequencies were determined for CDHI C/T (rs 10431924) and DDRI A/C (rs 2267641) genes polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The CDH1 CC genotype was found to be significantly associated with the risk of developing vitiligo. The results of stratified analysis revealed a correlation between CDH1 CC genotype and late age of onset, clinical type of vitiligo, the absence of autoimmune comorbidities and family history of auto immune disorders. However, the expression level of CDH1 TT genotype increased significantly in patients with autoimmune comorbidities. There was also a significant relationship between the DDR1 CC genotype and the risk of developing vitiligo. The results of stratified analysis revealed a correlation between DDR1 CC genotype and early age of onset, clinical type of vitiligo and absence of family history of autoimmune disorders. The findings of the study confirm the conjecture previously made in the literature regarding the melanocytes' adhesion deficit as an initial step for pigment loss in vitiligo and emphasize the substantial role of friction and koebner phenomenon in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Moreover, a probable association can be proposed between the adhesion deficit involved in vitiligo and autoimmune disorders.

AB Sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam] is an important crop used for food, animal feed, and production of industrial materials. Although it is adapted to a wide range of unfavorable conditions, including drought and high salt, sweetpotato is vulnerable to low temperature, making it difficult to cultivate in low temperature regions. To understand the molecular responses occurring in sweetpotato leaves under low temperature stress, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed in leaves under low temperature stress (LT) and during recovery (RC). In comparison with non-treated controls (NT), 2461 and 1017 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in LT and RC leaves, respectively. When expression in RC and LT samples was directly compared, 2053 DEGs were detected. To increase understanding of the DEGs, the three datasets were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) database. The CBF transcriptional cascade, a well-known cold response pathway, was investigated using transcriptomic analysis. In contrast with reports from the cold-tolerant Arabidopsis thaliana, none of the COR genes identified in sweetpotato showed increased expression in response to low temperature. Genes involved in antioxidant enzyme pathways mediating responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated during low temperature response. This work provides insight into the molecular basis of the responses of sweetpotato to cold stress. This increased understanding of gene regulation in response to cold stress in sweetpotato will be beneficial for future research into molecular-assisted breeding.

AB We investigated changes in expression of the CIP/KIP family-related genes and the cycle-dependent factors Pena, Cdk4 and Cdk2 during the growth and development of mice, Drosophila and silkworms. When the organism was in a period of rapid development, the related genes of the CIP/KIP family had low expression level and the cell cycle-dependent genes were highly expressed. In mammals, the CIP/KIP family includes three genes, p21, p27/Dacapo and p57. However, only one gene, P27/Dacapo, exists in the CIP/KIP family in silkworm' and the orthologous gene in the silkworm is named Bmdacapo. Down-regulation of Bmdacapo in silkworm embryos caused overdevelopment of the embryos and indicated that Bmdacapo can inhibit silkworm growth and development. Up-regulation of Bmdacapo in silkworm cells inhibited cell proliferation, whereas down-regulation of Bmdacapo promoted cell proliferation. In order to explore the mechanism of Bmdacapo regulated silkworm development and cell proliferation, the effect of Bmdacapo on cell cycle changes was examined. The results demonstrate that Bmdacapo was able to induce G1/S phase arrest in the cell cycle. In silkworm cells, Bmdacapo inhibits the expression of Pcna, CDK4 and CDK2, which affects the cell cycle and ultimately inhibits cell proliferation. This regulatory mechanism is particularly different from mammals.

AB Anti-inflammation is a key process to restore tissue integrity and function. CXCL12 is a homeostasis chemokine, which plays a coordinating role in organogenesis, tumorigenesis and regeneration. In the present study we found that the uterus of abortion mice showed different histo-morphological changes with the development of abortion. The expression of chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in abortion uterus showed a time-dependent pattern. Compared with normal pregnancy, the expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 did not change in the uterus of GD7 abortion mice, but increased significantly in the uterus of GD8 and GD10 abortion mice. However, the expression of IFN-gamma increased significantly in the uterus of GD7 abortion mice, while there was no significant change detected in GD8 aborted mice uterus. Our further data show that the expression of CXCL12 is not regulated by IFN-gamma in endometrial stromal cell culture system in vitro. The treatment of CXCL12 significantly inhibits the expression of IFN-gamma in in vitro cultured stromal cells and splenic monocytes. This suggests that CXCL12 may play an anti-inflammatory role in the uterus of abortion mice to promote the process of endometrial restoration after abortion, rather than participate in the process of abortion as a response molecule of IFN-gamma.

AB Intramuscular fat content (IMF) is one of the most significant factors for meat quality affecting tenderness, flavor, and juiciness of meat. For this reason, we aimed to investigate the association of SIRT1 gene polymorphisms with intramuscular fat content in Chinese Qinchuan cattle (Bos taurus). Using DNA sequencing, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter regions of SIRT1 gene were identified in 535 Qinchuan cattle, and the five haplotypes representing five potential different compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Results indicated that both c.-107 G > A and c.-274 A > G were significantly associated with intramuscular fat content in Qinchuan cattle, and Hap5/5 diplotype showed higher (P < 0.05) intramuscular fat content than other combinations (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In addition, the Hap5 haplotype had much lower (P < 0.05) transcriptional activity, consistent with the association analysis. Based on our results, the polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites of SIRT1 gene promoter may affect the transcriptional activity of SIRT1 gene, and thus alter intramuscular fat content in beef cattle.

AB Objective: In this study, we aim to evaluate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in human glioma tumors and the correlation between its expression with degrees of malignancy and autophagy, development of tumors.
   Method: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were carried out to determine the expression of LC3, Beclin1 and TLR2 in 74 glioma specimens. We analyzed the prognosis of 551 glioma patients through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To determine the effect of TLR2 in glioma, we manipulated TLR2 expression using TLR2 plasmid transfer technique in U87 human glioma cell.
   Results: TLR2 expression in high-grade was significantly higher than that in low-grade glioma group (P < 0.05). TLR2 was positively correlated with tumor grade (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation showed that the expression of TLR2 was positively correlated with the numbers of LC3 and Beclinl (P < 0.05). The patients with high TLR2 expression had a poorer outcome compared with the patients with low TLR2 in low-grade glioma (P < 0.05). TLR2 overexpression enhances glioma cell activity and accelerates cell cycle progression. In addition, treatment with TLR2 overexpression increases the conversion rate of LC3-I to LC3-II and enhances the level of phosphorylated p38.
   Conclusion: TLR2 promotes development and progression of human glioma via enhancing autophagy.

AB Aquaporins (AQPs) are hydrophobic integral trans-membrane channel proteins implicated in cellular proliferation and water transport in various cancers. They compose a family of 13 different isoforms (25-34 kDa) in mammals that have been identified to date. These AQPs exhibit a unique pattern of tissue expression. Though they can be found in most tissues, they are mostly active in endothelial and epithelial tissues. In this review, the AQPs associated with female-specific cancers are comprehensively explored and their significant features are analysed. Recent findings revealing their role in female-specific carcinogenesis, especially cervical, ovarian, uterine/endometrial, and breast, will be also discussed.

AB Introduction: Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare developmental disorder characterized by the combination of aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp vertex and terminal transverse limb defects. DOCK6 (Dedicator of cytokinesis 6) is one of the six identified AOS genes.
   Methods: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a child with an AOS phenotype. Sanger DNA sequencing further validated her lineal consanguinity. To explore the pathological features of the mutation, a minigene assay was used to investigate the effects of the mutation on splicing.
   Results: Two compound heterozygous DOCK6 mutations (c.4106 + 2T > C and c.3063 C > G (p.Y1021*)) were identified in this family, and both mutations have not been reported previously. Sanger DNA sequencing indicated that the mutations were inherited maternally and paternally, respectively. The results of the minigene assay showed that the c.4106 + 2T > C mutation resulted in aberrant splicing and caused a four-nucleotide insertion in the transcript and a premature stop codon.
   Conclusions: Our findings expanded the number of reported cases of this rare disease and the mutation spectrum of DOCK6 mutations, which can serve as the basis for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling.

AB Oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide is faced by bacteria when encountering hostile environments. In order to define the physiological and regulatory networks controlling the oxidative stress response in the freeliving bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, a whole transcriptome analysis of wild type and AoxyR strains in the presence of hydrogen peroxide for two different exposure times was carried out. The C. crescentus response to H2O2 includes a decrease of the assimilative sulfate reduction and a shift in the amino acid synthesis pathways into favoring the synthesis of histidine. Moreover, the expression of genes encoding enzymes for the depolymerization of polyhydroxybutyrate was increased, and the RpoH-dependent genes were severely repressed. Based on the expression pattern and sequence analysis, we postulate that OxyR is probably directly required for the induction of three genes (katG, ahpCF). The putative binding of OxyR to the ahpC regulatory region could be responsible for the use of one of two alternative promoters in response to oxidative stress. Nevertheless, OxyR is required for the expression of 103 genes in response to H2O2. Fur and part of its regulon were differentially expressed in response to hydrogen peroxide independently of OxyR. The non-coding RNA OsrA was upregulated in both strains, and an in silica analysis indicated that it may have a regulatory role. This work characterizes the physiological response to H2O2 in C. crescentus, the regulatory networks and differentially regulated genes in oxidative stress and the participation of OxyR in this process. It is proposed that besides OxyR, a second layer of regulation may be achieved by a small regulatory RNA and other transcriptional regulators.

AB MiR-155-3p, which is derived from the same pre-miRNA as miR-155-5p, the latter has been reported to be dysregulated in multiple tumor tissues and associated with clinicopathologic markers, tumor subtypes, and poor survival rates. However, the biological effects of miR-155-3p are rarely explored. In this study, we find that miR155-3p was down-regulated in breast cancer and MYD88 was validated as the target for miR-155-3p. Moreover, miR-155-3p showed a negative effect on apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, reverses paclitaxel resistance by suppression of the corresponding target gene MYD88 in vitro and in vivo experiments. Taking together, our studies suggest that miR-155-3p, which serve as a negative regulatory mechanism for breast cancer development. The mechanism further complicates the regulatory network in human breast cancer.

AB Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor is implicated in many types of cancers. However, the role of GRHL2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been fully understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the expression and functional roles of GRHL2 in CRC. The expression of GRHL2 in normal human intestinal epithelial cells and colorectal cancer cells was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. For knockdown of GRHL2, two small interfere RNAs (siRNAs) targeting GRHL2 or control siRNA was transfected into CRC cell lines (HCT116 and HT29). For GRHL2 overexpression, the GRHL2-overexpressing vector or empty lentiviral vector was infected into HCT116 and HT29 cells. Cell proliferation was measured by MIT assay. Cell apoptosis rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax, and Bcl-2 was detected by western blot. We found that GRHL2 was upregulated in CRC cells compared to normal human intestinal epithelial cells. Knockdown of GRHL2 inactivated the PI3K/Akt pathway in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Knockdown of GRHL2 inhibited cell viability, elevated the apoptosis rates, suppressed the expression of PCNA and Bcl-2, and induced the expression of Bax in HCT116 and HT29 cells, and these effects were reversed by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway blocked the effects of GRHL2 over expression on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, GRHL2 acted as an oncoprotein through regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in CRC cells. The PI3K/Akt pathway was closely involved in the effects of GRHL2. Therefore, GRHL2 might be a therapeutic target for the CRC treatment.

AB Our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to immune traits in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene, suggesting the association of this gene with immune function in pigs. To better understand the immune functions of the TNFRSF1A gene, SNPs within the TNFRSF1A gene were detected by sequencing. One SNP (c.1394C > T) in exon 6 of TNFRSF1A was identified, and association analysis in two pig populations was subsequently performed. The results showed that this SNP was significantly associated with CD4(-)CD8(-)CD3(-), CD4(+)CD8(-)CD34(-), and CD4(-)1(-)/CD84(-)(P = 0.0038, P = 0.0007, and P = 0.0076, respectively). Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the TNFRSF1A mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in six different tissues. Finally, functional verification of the TNFRSF1A gene was performed in vitro to better understand its role. RNAi was used to generate a porcine PK15 cell line with a silenced TNFRSF1A gene, and a vector was also constructed to assess overexpression of TNFRSF1A. RT-qPCR was then used to detect changes in the expression levels of five critical genes. Our results indicated that TNFRSF1A activated the TNF signaling pathway and inhibited the NFKB signaling pathway in vitro. These findings provide evidence for an immune -related regulatory function for porcine TNFRSF1A.

AB MicroRNA-574-3p (miR-574-3p) has different roles in different cancer types. However, the exact regulation mechanism of miR-574-3p in gastric cancer (GC) progression remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the role of miR-574-3p in GC metastasis. We investigated the mechanism via which miR-574-3p regulated cancer cell migration and invasion to determine the relationship between epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. Our results indicated that human GC cell line SGC7901 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin (DDP), but SGC7901 cisplatin-resistant cells (SGC7901/DDP) were more resistant to DDP and had mesenchymal characteristics. In addition, miR-574-3p overexpression up-regulated E-cadherin expression, and concomitantly down-regulated the expression of vimentin. We also identified zinc finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factor 1 (ZEB1), a crucial EMT inducer gene, as a new target of miR-574-3p. In fact, miR-574-3p bound the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ZEB1, regulating expression of this transcription factor at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, miR-574-3p overexpression reduced the migratory and invasive properties of the SGC7901/DDP cells and inhibited cisplatin (DDP) resistance in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the results indicated that miR-574-3p inhibited the EMT and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in GC cells by suppressing ZEB1. These results provide further evidence for the critical roles of miR-574-3p and ZEB1 in invasion and migration regulation characteristics of GC cells.

AB Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) binds a stem-loop structure of the mRNA, which is important for the stability of histone mRNAs and translation process. In the present study, two slbp cDNAs (Ecslbpl and Ecslbp2) were cloned from a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Ecslbpl cDNA contained a 678 base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted polypeptide of 225 amino acids. Ecslbp2 cDNA contained a 1041 bp, encoding a predicted protein of 346 amino acids. The result of real-time PCR revealed that Ecslbpl mRNA was exclusively detected in the ovary. Moreover, it was found to be restricted to oocytes according to in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Ecslbpl was found to be hardly detected in gonia and significantly increase in the cytoplasm of primary-growth stage oocytes, but decreased during the process of vitellogenesis. Interestingly, Ecslbp2 expression centralized as a perinuclear speckle in early-primary-growth stage oocytes, which appeared to form into the Balbiani body (Bb) in late-primary-growth stage oocytes. These data indicated that Ecslbp2 might play an important role in the process of oocyte development, and could serve as an oocyte-specific molecular marker for the study of ovary development and sex reversal in groupers.

AB The circadian clock synchronizes internal and external stimuli to ensure numerous biological processes occur at the optimal time. EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4) is a key evening-phased component of the circadian clock and essential for photoperiod-dependent flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. There are four homologous ELF4-like (EFLI-EFL4) genes in the Arabidopsis genome but their functions are unknown. Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that these four EFL proteins contained an evolutionarily conserved domain, DUF1313, of unknown function. To investigate the physical roles of these genes in Arabidopsis, we overexpressed the four homologous EFL genes in the elf4 mutant background. Under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions, overexpression of EFL1 not only completely rescued the early flowering phenotype of the elf4 mutant, but also delayed flowering. Overexpression of EFL2, however, failed to rescue this phenotype and overexpression of EFL3 partially rescued the early flowering phenotype. The transcription levels of the key flowering time regulation genes CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) were significantly decreased in the EFLI- and EFL3-overexpressing transgenic lines in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the elf4 mutant. These results suggest that EFL1 and EFL3 are involved in flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis.

AB Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is always characterized by hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Dysregulated long noncoding RNAs regulate pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, the role of Mirt2 (long noncoding RNA myocardial infraction associated transcript 2) in NAFLD remains unclear. This original study aims to investigate the role of Mirt2 in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Mirt2 was decreased in the livers of high-fat diet (HFD) mice, Ob/Ob, Db/Db, and fasting mice. Hepatic Mirt2 restoration attenuated hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and steatosis in the livers of obese mice, and Mirt2 inhibition promoted fasting hyperglycemia and lipid droplets accumulation in normal mouse livers. Furthermore, overexpression of Mirt2 resulted in suppression of miR-34a-5p, whereas knockdown of Mirt2 exerted opposite effects in the livers. Then, miR-34a-5p was a positive regulator of NAFLD by targeting USP I 0, which serves as a negative regulator of NAFLD. Overexpression of Mirt2 made miR-34a-5p mimic fail to reduce luciferase activity of USPIO 3'-UTR, and this regulation was also demonstrated by Western blot. Similarly, overexpression of miR-34a-5p significantly let Mirt2 lost the ability to elevate USP10 protein level. Thus, Mirt2 can function as the sponge of miR-34a-5p. Moreover, Mirt2-mediated upregulation of USP10 protein expression can be reversed by silencing USPIO. USP10 inhibition could abolish Mirt2 overexpression-induced suppression of glucose production and lipogenesis in hepatocytes. In conclusion, the decrease of Mirt2 expression contributed to hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis in obese mice, and Mirt2/miR- 34a-5p /USP10 was involved in NAFLD development. Overexpression of Mirt2 might be a promising strategy for treatment of NAFLD.

AB Class III peroxidases are classical secretory plant peroxidases belonging to a large multi-gene family. Class III peroxidases are involved in various physical processes and the response to biotic and abiotic stress to protect plants from environmental adversities. In this study, 151 BdPrx genes were identified using HMM and Blastp program. According to their physical location, the 151 BdPrx genes were mapped on five chromosomes. The results of Gene Structure Display Serve and MEME revealed that BdPrxs in the same subgroup shared similar gene structure, and their protein sequences were highly conserved. Based on the analysis of evolutionary relationships and Ka/Ks, 151 BdPrx genes were divided into 15 subgroups, they have undergone purifying selection. In addition, the result of GO annotation showed that 100% of the BdPrxs participated in antioxidant. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the orthology-based method, found that 66 BdPrxs were involved in the regulatory network and 183 network branches were identified. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptome data indicated that the BdPrx genes responded to low concentration of exogenous phytohormones and exhibited different levels of expression in the different tissues. Subsequently, 19 genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR and found to be mainly expressed in the roots, might preferentially respond to hydrogen peroxide and gibberellin. Our results provide a foundation for further evolutionary and functional study of Prx genes in B. distachyon.

AB Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a major antioxidant enzyme in plasma, catalyzes the reduction of H202, lipid peroxides and organic hydroperoxides by reducing glutathione (GSH). Hypermethylation of the GPx3 promoter and suppression of GPx3 expression are associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, and response to chemotherapy in various types of cancer. We previously reported the possibility of GPx3 as a serological marker for lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the role of the microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-921 (miR-921) in the regulation of GPx3 expression in A549 lung cancer cells. The expression patterns of the miRNAs of A549, H1650, and H1975 cells were compared and analyzed. Of 25 miRNAs from the A549 cell line, the expression of 10 decreased and the expression of 15 increased in comparison to the miRNAs from the other cell lines. Of the miRNAs with reduced expression, the most reduced miRNA was miR-921 and the expected binding site of which is in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GPx3. We found that miR-921 inhibited the expression of GPx3 and bound directly to the 3'-UTR of GPx3.

AB To evaluate the additional diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing (WES) reanalysis in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability/mental retardation, we reanalyzed raw WES data and clinical information for 76 patient trios whose initial reports returned negative results. Eight patients (10.5%, 8/76) had positive genetic diagnoses finally, including six novel mutations in five genes. The reasons for the previous false-negative reports were divided into four categories: specific gene disease associations had not been established at the time of the initial report; the disease database of the genetic test center had not been updated in a timely manner; the patient's clinical phenotype had not been carefully or correctly collected, submitted and reviewed when applicating genetic test and analyzing the variants; and the first round of data analysis missed a synonymous variant that affected splicing. Therefore, physicians should not give up the discovery of disease-causing mutations before re-examining the WES data and clinical phenotype by themselves or by collaborating with bioinformatic experts in the genetic test centers, especially for patients with strongly suspected genetic disease whose initial WES result was "negative".

AB The recent disclosure of a human embryo subjected to a genetic transformation using the CRISPR/cas9 system give rise to several concerns on ethical questions about its uncontrolled use in humans. Although CRISPR/cas9 has demonstrated its efficiency, this system still lacks the capability to avoid the introduction of undesirable mutations through the target genome. In this Letter, we present several undesirable impacts that CRISPR/cas9 system have in the genetic transformation of the human genome. We briefly discuss, using the very recent literature from distinct high impact journals, the main concerns related to CRISPR/cas9 to deal with off-target effects and how the research community has treated it.

AB Cytauxzoonosis, caused by infection with Cytauxzoon fells, is the most severe tick-borne disease of cats. The purpose of our study was to determine the efficacy of selamectin (6.0 mg/kg) plus sarolaner (1.0 mg/kg) formulated in combination (Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) applied topically once a month on cats for three months against induced infestations of Amblyomma americanum adults and to evaluate the effectiveness of the product in preventing the transmission of C. fells. This study was conducted in two phases. Sixteen cats were dosed with selamectin/sarolaner or a placebo (vehicle control) on Days 0, 28, and 56. In phase 1, each cat was infested with 50 (+/- 5) unfed adult A. americanum on Day 4 and tick counts were conducted on Day 6 (48 h post infestation) and Day 7 (72 h post infestation) to evaluate acaricidal efficacy. In phase 2, to confirm acaricidal efficacy and evaluate prevention of C. fells transmission, each cat was infested on Day 60 with 50 (+/- 5) adult A. americanum acquisition fed as nymphs on two C. fells-infected donor cats. Tick counts were conducted on Day 62 (48 h post infestation) and Day 63 (72 h post infestation). Blood samples were collected on Days -9, 60, 70, 76, and 90 and tested for infection with C. fells. Placebo cats were adequately infested on all count days, with least squares (geometric) mean live tick counts ranging from 34.0 (28.8) to 46.1 (46.0). Treatment reduced the least squares (geometric) mean counts compared to placebo by 27.1 (32.1)% and 90.4 (96.8)% on Days 6 and 7, respectively. The corresponding percent reductions were 56.4 (60.6)% and 94.7 (97.3)% on Days 62 and 63, respectively Least squares mean counts were significantly lower in the treated group compared with the placebo group on all count days (P <= 0.0286). All cats were negative for C. fells by PCR prior to study start. In phase 2, seven cats in the control group and no cats in the selamectin/sarolaner group became infected with C. fells (P = 0.0017). Topical treatment with selamectin/sarolaner was > 90% effective in reducing A. americanum tick counts 72 h after infestation and prevented the transmission of C. fells from infected ticks following the third of three monthly treatments. Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus offers an option for the control of A. americanum infestations on cats and for preventing the transmission of C. fells to cats.

AB The efficacy of three consecutive monthly treatments with a novel topical product (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) containing selamectin in combination with the isoxazoline, sarolaner, was compared with that of another topical isoxazoline, fluralaner [Bravecto (R) (fluralaner topical solution) for Cats, Merck] against Ixodes scapularis ticks on cats. Twenty-four cats were ranked by pre-treatment tick counts to form groups of three and were randomly allocated to be treated with placebo, the minimum label dosage of Revolution (R) Plus (6 mg/kg selamectin plus 1 mg/kg sarolaner) or the minimum label dosage of Bravecto (R) for Cats (40 mg/kg fluralaner) within the groups. On Days 0, 30, and 60, each cat in the placebo and Revolution (R) Plus-treated groups was treated topically, whereas cats in the Bravecto (R) for Cats-treated group were treated topically once on Day 0 with fluralaner and, subsequently, these animals were treated with the placebo on Days 30 and 60 to maintain masking. Doses were calculated based on weight to provide the minimum label dosage for each product; the calculated volume of product to be administered was rounded off to the nearest 0.1 mL. The selamectin plus sarolaner-treated cats received effective dosages of 5.29-7.12 mg/kg selamectin and 0.88-1.19 mg/kg sarolaner, while the fluralaner cats received dosages of 35.21-43.16 mg/kg fluralaner. Cats were infested with approximately 50 unfed viable adult I. scapularis ticks on Days 5, 12, 26, 40, 54, 68, 82, and 88. Efficacy was assessed at 48 h after each infestation.
   There were no adverse reactions to any treatment during the study. The placebo-treated cats maintained adequate tick infestations throughout the study. Three monthly treatments with selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus) resulted in high and consistent efficacy against I. scapularis for up to 30 days after each treatment. Based on geometric means, efficacy was >= 99.1% at all time points assessed. Treatment with fluralaner (Bravecto (R) for Cats) provided high and consistent efficacy of >= 99.3% up to Day 70. On Day 84, efficacy was 90.1%; however, cats from which ticks were recovered on Day 84 had received approximately 4%-12% less than the minimum dosage of 40 mg/kg fluralaner. Three consecutive monthly treatments with Revolution (R) Plus or a single treatment with Bravecto (R) for Cats provided > 90% control of I. scapularis ticks over a 12-week time period.

AB In a controlled laboratory study, the efficacy against fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, of a single treatment of fluralaner topical solution (Bravecto (R) for Cats, Merck) was compared with that of three consecutive monthly topical treatments with selamectin and sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus, Zoetis). Twenty-four domestic short hair cats were ranked based on host suitability flea counts to form groups of three and were randomly assigned within group to one of three treatments. The first group received a topical treatment with (a) placebo (vehicle control for Revolution (R) Plus) on Days 0, 30, and 60, (b) 6 mg/kg selamectin and 1 mg/kg sarolaner on Days 0, 30, and 60, or (c) 40 mg/kg fluralaner on Day 0 and placebo (vehicle control for Revolution (R) Plus) on Days 30 and 60. Because doses were rounded off, the selamectin plus sarolaner-treated cats received effective dosages of 5.25-6.60 mg/kg selamectin and 0.88-1.10 mg/kg sarolaner, while the fluralaner-treated cats received dosages of 34.71-43.08 mg/kg fluralaner. All cats were infested with 100 (+/- 5) fleas on Day -1 and at biweekly intervals after that, from Day 13 to Day 89. Flea comb counts were conducted 24 hours after treatment or after re-infestation.
   There were no adverse events related to treatment during the study. Except for a single cat from which 20 fleas were recovered on Day 90, all other placebo-treated cats had at least 48 fleas at each count, indicating adequacy of infestation of the controls. Based on geometric mean live flea counts, three consecutive monthly treatments with Revolution (R) Plus resulted in consistent and high efficacy of >= 98.6% compared with placebo throughout the study. A single treatment with Bravecto (R) for Cats provided consistent and high efficacy of >= 94.6% on all count days during a period of 12 weeks, the approved duration of efficacy for the product. Based on the efficacy results of the study, both products were equivalent in their ability to control fleas on cats. Use of Bravecto (R) for Cats every 12 weeks or the consecutive monthly use of Revolution (R) Plus is expected to provide extended high residual kill over the respective labeled durations of efficacy of the two products.

AB Two randomised, single-masked, multi-center field studies were conducted in the United States in cats presented as veterinary patients. The first study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a topically applied formulation of selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) against natural flea infestations; the second study evaluated its efficacy against natural ear mite infestations. The product was administered topically by the cats' owners at the dose range provided in the market product of 6.0-12.0 mg selamectin and 1.0-2.0 mg sarolaner per kg bodyweight. Imidacloprid plus moxidectin (Advantage (R) Multi for Cats, Bayer) was used as a positive control in both studies at the label dosage. In the flea study, treatments were administered on Days 0, 30, and 60. Efficacy was calculated based on the mean percent reduction of live flea counts on Days 30, 60, and 90 relative to the pre-treatment count. In the ear mite study, a single treatment was applied on Day 0 and efficacy was determined on Days 14 and 30 based on the presence or absence of ear mites. In both studies, patients were randomly allocated to treatments in the ratio of 2:1, selamectin plus sarolaner: imidacloprid plus moxidectin.
   In the two studies, 405 cats received treatment with selamectin plus sarolaner; of these, 256 cats received three monthly treatments in the flea study. There were no serious adverse reactions to treatment with selamectin plus sarolaner; health issues noted were typical of the normal ailments or minor traumatic injuries expected in the general cat population and were similar in both treatment groups. Efficacy against fleas based on geometric (arithmetic) means was 97.2% (95.9%), 99.5% (99.4%), and 99.8% (99.8%) in the selamectin plus sarolaner group and was 79.7% (70.5%), 91.4% (77.3%), and 95.5% (87.4%) in the imidacloprid plus moxidectin group on Days 30, 60, and 90, respectively. Flea counts for the selamectin plus sarolaner group were significantly lower than the counts for the imidacloprid plus moxidectin group at all time-points after treatment administration on Day 0 (P < 0.001). Treatment reduced the clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (alopecia, dermatitis/pyodermatitis, erythema, pruritus, scaling, and papules) in affected cats by 86.7%-100% in the selamectin plus sarolaner group and by 66.7%-100% in the imidacloprid plus moxidectin group.
   In the ear mite study, a single application of selamectin plus sarolaner resulted in the clearance of mites from 87.5% of cats within 14 days and 94.4% of cats within 30 days of treatment. The respective percentages of mite free cats in the imidacloprid plus moxidectin group were 64.0% and 72.0%. There were significantly more cats with no mites noted in the selamectin plus sarolaner group than in the imidacloprid plus moxidectin group on Day 14 and Day 30 (P <= 0.018).
   Selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus) administered topically at monthly intervals for three months was well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment and prevention of natural infestations of fleas on cats presented as veterinary patients. Clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis improved in affected cats following treatment administration. A single topical treatment was also safe and highly effective for the treatment of ear mite infestations in naturally infested cats.

AB The speed of kill of a novel, topical product containing selamectin in combination with sarolaner (selamectin/sarolaner; Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus) was evaluated against Ixodes scapularis ticks on cats. Sixteen cats were randomly allocated to a treatment group and treated topically on Day 0 with either placebo (vehicle control) or 6 mg/kg selamectin plus 1 mg/kg sarolaner. Cats were infested with approximately 50 unfed viable adult I. scapularis ticks on Days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Efficacy was assessed at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment on Day 0 and at 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after post-treatment re-infestations.
   There were no adverse reactions to the topical treatment with selamectin/sarolaner. Placebo-treated cats maintained tick infestations throughout the study. Treatment with selamectin/sarolaner significantly reduced tick counts within 12 h (P < 0.0001) and resulted in 100% efficacy by 24 h. For subsequent re-infestations, live tick counts were significantly reduced by 12 h after infestation on Day 7 (P = 0.0120) and by 24 h for Days 14-35 (P < 0.0001). At 24 h after the post-treatment re-infestations, efficacy based on geometric (arithmetic) means was >= 96.1% (94.5%) through Day 21, 75.3% (67.7%) on Day 28 and 66.4% (56.4%) on Day 35.
   Thus, a single topical dose of Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus at the recommended minimum dose started killing ticks within 12-24 hours after treatment and re-infestations for up to 5 weeks. High acaricidal efficacy (>= 90% reduction in tick burden) was achieved within 24 h after treatment and subsequent re-infestations for at least three weeks.

AB A new topical formulation of selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) was evaluated in the treatment and control of naturally occurring infections of Ancylostoma tubaeforme and Toxocara cad in cats presented as veterinary patients in the United States. Three thousand three hundred three (3303) cats were screened in 25 veterinary practices in 15 states and 153 hookworm-positive cats (A. tubaeforme and/or A. braziliense), mainly from Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Hawaii, were identified; 135 cats met all the criteria for enrollment and were included on study. The cats were randomly assigned to treatment with Revolution (R) (at the label dosage, to provide a minimum dosage of 6 mg/kg selamectin) or selamectin plus sarolaner (at a dosage of 6-12 mg/kg plus 1-2 mg/kg, respectively). Treatments were administered at the time of enrollment and repeated 30 days later. Fecal samples were collected for differential fecal egg count prior to the first treatment (Day 0), prior to the second treatment (Day 30), and approximately 30 days later (Day 60). Efficacy was based on the percentage reductions in geometric mean fecal egg count for A. tubaeforme on Day 30 and Day 60 compared with Day 0. Where cats were co-infected with T. cati, efficacy against this species was also evaluated. Efficacy data were evaluated for A. tubaeforme for 40 cats on both Day 30 and Day 60 for the group treated with the selamectin/sarolaner combination and reductions in geometric mean fecal egg counts of 99.4% and 99.7% were demonstrated for Day 30 and Day 60, respectively. For the group treated with selamectin alone, 44 and 40 cats were evaluated and percent reductions for Day 30 and Day 60 were 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively. For T. cati, 14 cats were evaluated in the selamectin/sarolaner-treated group for Day 30 and for Day 60, and the reduction in geometric mean fecal egg count was 100% for both days. There were 11 and 9 cats evaluated for Day 30 and Day 60, respectively, for the selamectin-treated group and the reduction was again 100% for both days. The geometric mean fecal egg counts post-treatment were significantly lower than pre-treatment for both A. tubaeforme and T. cati, for both treatments, and for both periods of interest (P < 0.0001). No serious adverse events related to treatment with either product occurred during the study. Thus, both selamectin alone and the combination product of selamectin/sarolaner were safe and effective when administered on a monthly basis for the treatment and control of natural infections of A. tubaeforme and T. cati. The addition of sarolaner to the formulation did not interfere with the efficacy of selamectin against these nematodes.

AB The efficacy of a single topical application of a combination product containing selamectin and sarolaner (selamectin/sarolaner; Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus) was evaluated in seven laboratory studies against Ixodes scapularis (three studies), Dermacentor variabilis (two studies), or Amblyomma maculatum (two studies). In each study, cats were randomly allocated to treatment groups based on pre-treatment host-suitability tick counts. On Days-2, 5, 12, 19, 26 and 33, the cats were infested with unfed adult ticks. On Day 0, cats were treated with either a placebo (vehicle control) or with the spot-on solution at the minimum dose of 6.0 mg selamectin and 1.0 mg sarolaner/kg bodyweight. In one study with I. scapularis and one with D. variabilis an additional group of cats was treated with selamectin alone (Revolution (R), Zoetis) at 6.0 mg/kg bodyweight. Tick counts were conducted after treatment and after each weekly re-infestation and efficacy determined relative to placebo-treated animals. There were no treatment-related adverse reactions in any of the studies. Geometric mean live tick counts were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the selamectin/sarolaner-treated groups compared to the geometric mean tick counts in the placebo-treated groups at all time-points in all studies. For all species, a single topical administration of the selamectin/sarolaner combination resulted in > 90% efficacy against existing infestations based on geometric means. Efficacy against weekly re-infestations was > 90% based on geometric means for at least 5 weeks for I. scapularis and D. variabilis, and for at least 4 weeks against A. maculatum. Selamectin alone had no efficacy against I. scapularis, where counts on selamectin-treated cats were not significantly different from placebo at all time points (P > 0.05), and for D. variabilis, counts were not significantly different from placebo at 2, 3 and 5 weeks after treatment (P > 0.05) and efficacy was never greater than 85%. Thus, the activity of the sarolaner against three common tick species found on cats in the US is complementary to the existing broad-spectrum parasite control of selamectin. The inclusion of sarolaner with selamectin in a combination product (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus) provides for the treatment of existing tick infestations and gives at least one month of control against re-infestation following a single topical application.

AB The efficacy and safety of a new topical formulation containing selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) was evaluated for the prevention of heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease and the treatment of roundworm infection in cats enrolled as veterinary patients in two field studies conducted in Japan.
   In the heartworm field study, 91 cats negative for D. immitis antigen and anti-D. immitis antibody were enrolled and received 9 monthly topical treatments with selamectin plus sarolaner during the period of April to December 2015. Efficacy was assessed by testing post-treatment blood samples collected 8, 12, and 15 months after initiation of treatment for the presence of D. immitis antigen and anti-D. immitis antibody. Eighty-seven cats completed the entire study and were included in the determination of efficacy. No D. immitis antigen or anti-D. immitis antibody were detected in any of the post-treatment samples.
   In the roundworm field study, completed in the period from April to November 2015, 64 cats with >= 100 roundworm eggs per gram (EPG) of feces were enrolled and allocated randomly in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either selamectin plus sarolaner or emodepside plus praziquantel (Profender (R), Bayer). Treatments were administered topically on Days 0 and 30, and efficacy was assessed by fecal EPG counts conducted on Days 14, 30, and 60. All cats completed the entire study. At enrollment, all cats were infected with Toxocara cati. Compared to pre-treatment, geometric mean T. cad EPG counts on Days 14, 30, and 60 were reduced by >99.9% in both treatment groups.
   There were no treatment-related adverse events in either study. Monthly topical administration of Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus providing a minimum of 6 mg/kg selamectin and 1 mg/kg sarolaner was safe and effective in the prevention of heartworm disease and the treatment of roundworm infection in cats enrolled as veterinary patients in Japan.

AB The efficacy of a single application of a new topical formulation containing selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus, Zoetis) was evaluated against fleas and ticks infesting cats enrolled as veterinary patients in two field studies conducted in Japan and against Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks on cats in a laboratory study.
   In the laboratory study, sixteen cats were ranked based on pre-treatment tick counts and allocated randomly to treatment on Day 0 with either selamectin plus sarolaner or placebo. Cats were infested with adult H. longicornis on Days -2, 5, 12, 19, 26 and 33. Efficacy relative to placebo was based on live attached tick counts conducted 48 h after treatment and subsequent re-infestations. Selamectin plus sarolaner reduced live, attached H. longicornis counts by 96.4% within 48 h of treatment, and by >= 91.7% within 48 h of weekly re-infestation for 35 days, based on arithmetic means.
   In the field studies, 67 client-owned cats harboring six or more live fleas and 63 cats harboring four or more live attached ticks were enrolled to evaluate selamectin plus sarolaner for efficacy and safety compared with a registered product. Cats were allocated randomly to treatment with selamectin plus sarolaner or fipronil plus (S)-methoprene based on order of presentation. Treatment was administered once on Day 0 and efficacy was assessed by parasite counts conducted on Days 14 and 30 compared to the pre-treatment count. In the flea field study, live flea counts on Days 14 and 30 were reduced by 99.5% and 99.9% in the selamectin plus sarolaner group, and by 97.6% and 98.6% in the fipronil plus (S)-methoprene group, based on least squares mean percentage reductions. Clinical signs typically associated with flea allergy dermatitis improved following treatment. In the tick field study, live tick counts on Days 14 and 30 were reduced by 97.5% and 97.7% in the selamectin plus sarolaner group, and by 91.5% and 93.4% in the fipronil plus (S)-methoprene group, based on least squares mean percentage reductions. Selamectin plus sarolaner was determined to be non-inferior to fipronil plus (S)-methoprene in both field studies.
   There were no treatment-related adverse events in any study. A single topical dose of Revolution (R) Plus / Stronghold (R) Plus providing a minimum dosage of 6.0 mg/kg selamectin and 1.0 mg/kg sarolaner was confirmed to be effective against H. longicornis ticks on cats for one month and safe and effective in the treatment of fleas and ticks on cats enrolled as veterinary patients in Japan.

AB Among several components of the hydrology cycle, streamflow is one of the essential process necessarily needed to be studied. The establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management. The influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective. It has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications. This research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline integrated with Differential Evolution (MARS-DE) to forecast streamflow pattern in semi-arid region. To achieve this, monthly time series streamflow data at Baghdad station, coordinated at Tigris River, Iraq, is inspected. For the model validation, Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and standalone MARS models are conducted. To demonstrate the analysis of the undertaken models, several statistical indicators are computed to verify the modeling accuracies. Based on the achieved results, the MARS-DE model exhibited an excellent hybrid predictive modeling capability for monthly time scale streamflow in semi-arid region. Quantitatively; MARS-DE, LSSVR and MARS models achieved the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 46.64-35.25 m(3)/s, 57.50-49.20 m(3)/s and 78.01-62.65 m(3)/s, respectively. In conclusion, several perspectives are suggested for further studies to enhance the forecasting capability of the model.

AB A riverine and overland flow model based on the dynamically adapting Galerkin Least-Squares finite element method is developed and presented. The method utilizes the diffusive wave equations within a dynamically adaptive mesh and second-order accurate implicit time stepping scheme to efficiently and accurately simulate problems involving flows such as those that occur during overland flooding and urban inundation. The developed method and the utility of dynamic mesh adaption is presented through the simulation of common problems that occur in urban and overland flow conditions, these are shallow flooding, rapid flooding and flow propagation in an urban area. The application of the method to the flooding of the Morganza floodway illustrates the capabilities of the model in simulating large scale flooding and the application to a large dam break illustrates the limitations of the diffusive wave equations and the flow regimes where the numerical assumptions for the method break down. To the author's knowledge, the unique combination of FEM, wet-dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of diffusive wave equation (DWE) has not been presented in literature prior to this study.

   DEPOSITION
AB Intertidal flats are shallow-water environments that undergo cyclical variations in water depth, leading to a frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water stages (ESWS; water depths < 0.2 m). However, relatively little is known about the hydrodynamic conditions and erosion-accretion processes during ESWS, because the water depth is too shallow to measure in situ sediment dynamic processes using traditional methods. To address this gap, based on in situ measurements with four advanced instruments, we quantified the hydrodynamic conditions, erosion and accretion during ESWS in calm weather conditions on a highly turbid intertidal flat in Jiangsu coast, China. Our results revealed that marked erosion and accretion occurred during ESWS at the flood and ebb tidal stages, respectively. The resulting bed-level changes were three times greater during ESWS than relatively deep water stages (RDWS; water depths > 0.2 m), and the rate of change was an order of magnitude faster than during RDWS. This larger and faster bed-level change occurred even though the ESWS duration only accounted for 10% of the entire tidal cycle. This result occurred because the bed shear stress due to combined current-wave action during ESWS, was, on average, two times higher than during RDWS at the flood stage causing more extensive erosion. Whereas during the ebb stage, this shear stress during ESWS was only half of that during RDWS resulting in greater accretion. The main implications of these results are that, because ESWS occur frequently (twice every tide) and are associated with large bed shear stress and bed-level changes, these conditions are likely to play an important role in morphological changes of intertidal flats. Our study shows that ESWS have a key influence on intertidal flat hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. Thus our results are the basis for an improved understanding of the coastal morphodynamic processes on intertidal flats.

AB The conventional geo-accumulation index (GI) cannot deal with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of pollutants or conduct a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments. To solve these problems, a geo-accumulation vector (GV) model is designed based on uncertainty analysis theory. GV uses the probability vector to quantify the possibility for the pollution condition of a heavy metal to belong to a certain grade and then uses the first-order moment principle to determine its category. The GV model is applied in this study to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of Western Dongting Lake. The results show that (i) compared with the conventional GI model, the GV model has better capacity in evaluating synthetic pollution and in dealing with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of sediments; (ii) the sediments of Li River estuary, Yuan River estuary, Songzi River estuary, and the central part of Western Dongting Lake are "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately contaminated," and "uncontaminated to moderately contaminated" by heavy metals, respectively. These sediments also have 0.19, 0.36, 0.48, and 0.15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category, respectively; and (iii) all deterioration risks are introduced by cadmium.

AB Hydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern Australia (i.e. the Manning River catchment) and analyzed climate-hydrology relationships. For this evaluation, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall-runoff relationships of the catchment. Statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models (GCMs) under RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Manning River catchment. Our results showed that the XAJ model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall-runoff relationships with an R-2 >= 0.94 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency >= 0.92. The median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021-2060 and an increase for the period 2061-2100. Annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly, while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future. Our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall, with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature. An increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 GCMs suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future. A trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern Australia. These results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern Australia.

AB Analyzing the impacts of climate change on hydrology and future projections of water supplies is fundamental for the efficient management and planning of water resources in large river systems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is known as the "water tower of Asia." However, large uncertainties remain in the projections of streamflow and glaciers in these cryospheric catchments due to great uncertainties in climate change projection and modeling processes. In this work, we developed an extended Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (named VIC-CAS), which was coupled with glacier melting and glacier evolution schemes. A two-stage calibration procedure that used glacier inventory data and the observed streamflow was adopted to derive the model parameters. The calibrated VIC-CAS model was then used to assess the future change in glaciers and runoff using downscaled climate model data in the upstream regimes of the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra rivers on the TP. The results indicated that both temperature and precipitation were projected to increase, resulting in a greater than 50% decline of the glacier area by the end of the 21st century in the five catchments. Glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century with a greater than 20% loss of the glacier area except in the upstream of the Yangtze River, where glacier runoff was projected to decrease after the 2030 s. Annual streamflow was projected to increase significantly as a result of increased rainfall-induced runoff, compensating for the reduced glacier/snow melt water in the five major upstream river basins. The increasing rate of warm season streamflow was clearly less than that of annual runoff. A negative trend in warm season streamflow was expected if precipitation did not sufficiently increase. The annual hydrograph remained largely unchanged, except in the upstream of the Yellow River, where peak streamflow was predicted to occur 1 month earlier because of the earlier snowmelt and greater rainfall/precipitation ratio from May to June.

AB Although hydrological processes are generally nonlinear, linear time series models are commonly adopted in the field of water sciences. Nonlinear approaches such as threshold time series and conditional heteroscedasticity models are still seldom used. In this study, first, two- and three-regime Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models are used to model the mean behavior of daily streamfiows. The residual time series computed from the difference between observations and lag-one time-ahead best-estimates of the fitted models are also obtained. Second, the conditional variance behavior of the residual series obtained from the two- and three regime SETAR models is modeled using the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. The GARCH model is hence used to capture the time-varying variance behavior of residuals as a nonlinear phenomenon and thus it removes the existence of autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity so-called ARCH effect. Finally, the performance of SETAR models and their combination with the GARCH model are evaluated. Six deseasonalized daily streamflow series from upstream watershed rivers of Zarrineh Rood dam, in the southern part of Lake Urmia in Iran, are used to illustrate and test the procedure. The McLeod-Li test, a formal test for demonstrating the ARCH effect, indicates that the ARCH effect exists in all residual series, which means that the residuals of streamflow time series are nonstationary in terms of the variance. Results indicate that the hybrid SETAR-GARCH models performed better than the models without GARCH component. Results demonstrate also that the use of nonlinear SETAR and GARCH improves streamflow modeling efficiency by capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of nonlinear threshold time series.

AB Nowadays there is a need to overcome the effects caused by rapid urbanization with more innovative methods. Recently, source control approaches, known as Low Impact Development (LID), are being used by urban planners to cope with water-related problems due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. To do this, allocation of LID techniques in most suitable locations is done by introducing a new modeling tool called LID locator to the WetSpa-Urban software package and tested in the Watermaelbeek catchment situated in the Brussels capital region. In the first step, almost half of the catchment is eliminated from the implementation of LIDs by considering only pixels with high runoff. Also, by considering the sewer network behavior, the total area of high potential pixels for implementing LID is reduced to the range of 37% and 10% of the entire area of the catchment for different scenarios. In the next step, the selected area is further eliminated by use of suitable location algorithm based on size and other installation limitation of each type of LID. Then, the results are used as an input for the newly developed cost-optimization tool. In the end, the best scenario (10-year design storm with the current state of sewer network) is selected based on their performance in surface runoff volume reduction and the total cost. As a result, maximum flow and total volume at the outlet is reduced by 21 and 8% for the most cost-optimized scenario in January and February 2015. In addition to considering sewer network performance, land characteristics and LID installation limits for LID implementation, producing maps indicating the most cost-efficient locations and combinations for LIDS and visualizing them through the GUI make this tool a user-friendly product. This tool was applied to this case study in Brussels however it is applicable for other urban catchments.

AB In order to rationalize a surface water quality monitoring network (WQMN), it is critical to appropriately design surface water quality sampling locations. This is due to high installation, operational, and maintenance costs for each sampling representative of the whole water system conditions. The main objective of this study was to propose an integrated method to determine the most appropriate sampling points in the Khoy watershed northwest of Iran, where financial resources and water quality data are limited. Multi criteria evaluation method including analytic network process (ANP) and Fuzzy logic were incorporated in River Mixing Length (RML) procedure in order to identify exact locations of sampling points. Based on RML procedure, 15 candidate sampling points were identified to suitably select sampling points based on budget deficiency. Relative weights for 12 criteria and 10 sub-criteria related to non-point sources and surficial rocks as well as criteria of topography were then calculated by the ANP method. According to the obtained results, a new total potential pollution score (TPPS) was presented to prioritize 15 candidate sampling points. Then, the values of TPPS were classified and fuzzified to distinguish real differences between scores. Based on current monitoring stations and budget deficiency, the hierarchy value, and Fuzzy rank, six points are proposed as the most appropriate locations for surface water quality monitoring. Furthermore, four points are identified as the second most appropriate for enhancing a robust WQMN in the study area in order for an expansion plan in the future. The results of this study should be valuable for water quality monitoring agencies looking for an efficient approach for selecting exact sampling locations.

AB Climate change, in terms of changes in temperature and patterns of precipitation, has significant impacts on water resources and watershed ecosystems. Adapting to climate change is becoming an important strategy for watershed management. The goal of this study was to quantify the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrological processes and water quality, to evaluate the efficiency of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and the possible effects of a changing climate, and to configure cost-effective BMPs at sub-basin scale using a multi objective optimization method to mitigate climate effects on water resource. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate the possible effects of changing climate on watershed hydrological and water-quality processes and adaptation options in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). Climate change had significant impacts on water balance components such as precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) and on water-quality components such as sediment and nutrient loads. A substantial decreasing trend of runoff indicated that the Miyun Reservoir faced a more acute challenge of insufficient water-supply capacity. Compared with baseline climate, climate change represented by precipitation and temperature regimes resulted in substantial increases in sediment load (12.95%) and nutrient losses (7.26% for TN and 9.56% for TP) on average all sub-basins. Climate variability had significant effects on BMP efficiency through effects on watershed hydrology, soil erosion, and nutrient losses. Results highlight the importance of optimal configuration of site-specific BMPs at sub-basin scale for adaptation to climate change. The methods and findings presented here hold promise to enhance the resilience of the watershed system to current and future climate change.

AB Glacierised river catchments have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate change, while large populations depend on the water resources originating from them. Hydrological models are used to aid water resource management, yet their treatment of glacier processes is either rudimentary in large-scale applications or linked to fully distributed glacier models that prevent larger model domains. Also, data scarcity in mountainous catchments has hampered the implementation of physically based approaches over entire river catchments. A fully integrated glacier dynamics module was developed for the hydrological model SWIM (SWIM-G) that takes full account of the spatial heterogeneity of mountainous catchments but keeps in line with the semi-distributed disaggregation of the hydrological model. The glacierised part of the catchment is disaggregated into glaciological response units that are based on subbasin, elevation zone and aspect classes. They seamlessly integrate into the hydrological response units of the hydrological model. Robust and simple approaches to ice flow, avalanching, snow accumulation and metamorphism as well as glacier ablation under consideration of aspect, debris cover and sublimation are implemented in the model, balancing process complexity and data availability. The fully integrated model is also capable of simulating a range of other hydrological processes that are common for larger mountainous catchments such as reservoirs, irrigation agriculture and runoff from a diverse soil and vegetation cover. SWIM-G is initialised and calibrated to initial glacier hypsometry, glacier mass balance and river discharge. While the model is intended to be used in medium to large river basins with data-scarce and glacierised headwaters, it is here validated in the data-scarce catchment of the Upper Aksu River, Kyrgyzstan/NW China and in the relatively data-abundant catchment of the Upper Rhone River, Switzerland.

AB Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172% and 137% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91% in the western-most field to approximately 70% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

AB Spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment-water interface (SWI), due in part to sediment heterogeneities, which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence. However, several factors, including the flow-rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach-scale models of groundwater/surface water exchange. Using a series of controlled-head tracer-injection experiments coupled with cm-scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream, we quantified the flow dependence of local less-mobile porosity volume, mass-transfer rate coefficient, and the resulting local residence time in the less-mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes (0.8, 2, and 3 m/d). Experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations, representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability. Less-mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations; though a more competent, thin, organic layer at similar to 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading, flushing dynamics, and local residence times. Increased downward flux led to (1) a decrease in less-mobile porosity residence time in all experiments, and (2) an increase in less-mobile porosity fraction for most experiments. Additionally, at the larger stream reach-scale, surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel. These surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event, which revealed widespread, short-term, flushing (e.g. < 3 h) of the hyporheic zone with stream water, followed by longer-term (e.g. > 60 h) flushing of the SWI with riparian zone groundwater. Flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths, like in the controlled tracer experiments, was also observed in these reach-scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements. Our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic SWI conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the SWI in urbanized, sand-impacted streams.

AB An innovative approach was recently proposed to increase water depth and improve navigation in rivers by increasing overall roughness through an adaptive placement of artificial vegetation. In this approach, a section of the river width is covered with artificial vegetation constructed from an array of dampers that can be added or removed while maintaining sufficient width for navigational purposes. The goal of the work here is to explore the mean flow and turbulent momentum transport properties of such flow in a controlled flume setting, where the flow rate is steady, the vegetation placement is uniform, and the Froude number is maintained at sub-critical conditions. The focus is on vegetation-induced roughness alterations to the bulk flow statistics as well as the structure of turbulence impacted by the presence of such artificially engineered vegetation. The canopy flow experimentally explored here differs from the well-studied planar uniform emergent canopy flow because the interface between the vegetation and non-vegetation areas occurs along a lateral direction instead of the vertical direction. The flume experiments were conducted by partially covering the channel width with emergent artificial vegetation that is flexible and can interact with the flow. The quantities studied are the equilibration distance of the flow statistics from the leading vegetation edge as such distance is essential to any engineering design. Moreover, the mean flow and turbulence regimes at several longitudinal sections were analyzed using spectral analysis and conditional sampling to identify the main vortical structures and their contribution to momentum transport. Spectral analysis demonstrated that the sizes of the dominant vortices can be classified into stem-scale (small-scale) and shear-scale (larger scale) vortices as conventional in canonical canopy flows. The shear layer formed in the planar direction and its associated coherent vortices are spawned near the edge of the vegetated area in a manner analogous to a plane mixing layer. Quadrant analysis showed two contributions to the overall shear stress and lateral momentum exchange between the vegetated and non-vegetated zone, namely, ejections and sweeps. The measured ejection-sweep contributions are short-lived but significant to the overall turbulent momentum transport consistent with other canopy flow studies. Approximately 80% of the turbulent stress contributions at the interface occur within 30% of the time. Because the flume experiments were conducted at sufficiently high Reynolds number and sufficiently low Froude number, the scalability of the experimental findings here to much larger settings encountered in engineering practice are briefly discussed.

AB Human activities have exerted influential effects on the evolution of channels in river deltas throughout the world in recent decades. In this study, the adjustment processes of deltaic channels in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in response to diverse human interventions were examined during the 1960s-2010s. Changes in the channel geometries (i.e., cross- and longitudinal sections and at-a-station hydraulic geometry) indicate that channel evolution in the PRD can be divided into three periods since the 1960s, corresponding to stepwise changes in the hydrological processes in the PRD. During the 1960s-1980s period, channel topography showed slight change, mainly resulting from the variations in the water and sediment inputs, and hence at-a-station hydraulic geometry also displayed insignificant change. Such a kind evolution indicates a negligible impact from human interventions and an insignificant change in the hydrological processes in the PRD. From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the deltaic channels were substantially deepened, mainly due to large-scale sand excavation occurred in the PRD. And changes in at-a-station hydraulic geometry reveal an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge but a decrease for water depth and channel area. In response to channel deepening, the water level decreased but the tidal range increased at the Makou and Sanshui stations during this period. Furthermore, uneven down-cutting of the riverbed also significantly altered the divided water and sediment ratios in the PRD. After the prohibition of sand excavation (i.e., mid-2000s), although sediment reduction caused by dam construction was favorable for the further incision of deltaic channels, the incision magnitude was considerably decreased. In addition, we observe a relatively slight change in at-a-station hydraulic geometry. These results indicate an adjustment stage for the deltaic channels during this period. Correspondingly, the divided water and sediment ratios showed insignificantly change in the PRD, as did the water level and the tidal range. The results obtained from this study may help to set scientific guidelines for sustainable water management strategies for flood control, embankment protection, water and sediment regulation and prevention of salt-water intrusion in the PRD and other river deltas worldwide that are subject to strong human interventions.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a flood warning system based on Atmospheric Ensemble Forecasts. Although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed for flood forecasting, developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not been adequately addressed yet. In this study, first a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to forecast the heavy precipitation in Kan Basin, Iran. Ensemble storms were forecasted using five cumulus schemes including Kain-Fritsch, Betts-Miller-Janjic, Grell 3D ensemble, Multi-scale Kain-Fritsch and Grell-Devenyi ensemble cumulus scheme. Then, a Bayesian Networks (BN) was developed to estimate the flood peak using the atmospheric ensemble forecasts. Finally, a Fuzzy-TOPSIS (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was prepared for making decisions for flood warning scenarios considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them. Assessment of the proposed flood warning system was examined for various scenarios. It showed that when a significantly high probability was assigned to a warning level, that level had the maximum closeness coefficient and consequently chosen as a warning level. Yet, if the probability was distributed equally between some warning levels, the flood warning system acts cautiously since the decision-making model allocated the highest rank to the stronger warning level. Regarding the reasonable results of this study, applying the Fuzzy-TOPSIS model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts is recommended to apply in similar catchments for addressing the uncertainties.

AB Lakes impact atmosphere boundary layer processes and are thus important for catchment scale climate modeling and regional water and heat budgets. To explore the differences in lake-atmosphere interaction parameters, meteorological variables and turbulent heat fluxes in small and large water bodies, we collected eddy covariance observations and meteorological data during ice-free periods of the Lake small Nam-Co ("small lake") in 2012-2013 and Lake Nam-Co ("large lake") in 2015-2016 on the Tibetan Plateau. Significant differences exist in their lake-atmosphere interaction processes due to differences in their inherent attributes and environmental backgrounds. Relative to the "small lake", the maximum surface temperature of the "large lake" in summer is approximately 3 degrees C lower; "large lake" also has a larger wind speed, a higher monthly average air temperature and delayed peaks of the seasonal variation of water and air temperature. The typical values of the roughness length and standard bulk transfer coefficient for momentum are approximately 80% and 21% higher, respectively, for the "large lake". The typical values of the roughness lengths for heat and water are one order of magnitude lower in the "large lake" while the corresponding standard bulk transfer coefficients are only 7% lower. The latent and sensible heat fluxes of the two lakes have quite different seasonal variations, with evaporation peaking in November for the "large lake" and in June for the "small lake". The estimated evaporation during the ice-free season of the "large lake" (approximately 981 +/- 18 mm) is also higher than that (812 mm) of the "small lake" and this is mainly related to the observed lower Bowen ratio in the "large lake".

AB Water security has become a priority for adaptive policy and measures taken in response to climate change around the world. This is an opportunity and a challenge for the Taiwan government to establish a climate-resilient water supply portfolio to ensure water security. This study incorporated the costs of water production, intermittency, and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the currently available water sources and how they will be affected by climate change, and applied optimal control theory to establish a cost-effective model to plan a long-term (2031) climate-resilient water supply portfolio for Taiwan. The study then uses the Penghu area as an empirical case study for this water supply portfolio. The results showed that desalination will become the major source of water, accounting for 71.81% of the water supply by 2031. However, this high proportion of desalination water will result in a significant increase in the unit cost of water production and the carbon footprint. Therefore, water demand management is also needed, and is recommended to ensure sustainable water resources in the Penghu area.

AB Transportation of carbon and nitrogen during rainfall events is highly important within karst ecosystems and has particular relevance to understand decoupling relation between carbon and nitrogen cycles. The ability of the karst ecosystem to sequester carbon is currently unknown but has potential to be an important residual terrestrial carbon sink. We hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area, and carbon and nitrogen have imbalanced outputs response to runoff. Hence, a series of in-situ simulated rainfall experiments at three sites (two karst slopes with different carbonate matrixes and one non-karst slope without a carbonate matrix) were conducted in a typical karst zone in southwest China. We measured runoff discharge, and dissolved carbon and nitrogen during the experiments. The results show that the total runoff discharge increased positively with rainfall intensity, with the carbonate matrix making an important contribution to rainfall reallocation. The dissolved carbon loss from runoff plots is much higher than the dissolved nitrogen, with the dissolved C/N revealing the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen cycles in this critical karst zone. This initial carbon migrated by runoff at catchment scale is critical to carbon budgets in rivers. Furthermore, nitrogen leaching from the system is crucial as a nitrogen shortage at karst area in southwest China.

AB Mountain watersheds serve as important water sources for socioeconomic activities in semiarid and arid regions. This study examined the streamflow response to snow regime shifts associated with climate variability in the US Great Basin. To this end, the coupled hydro-ecological simulation system (CHESS), a process-based and distributed model, was applied to four mountain watersheds in the US Great Basin. Historical weather records for the period of 1961-1990 were used to spin-up model simulations so that the soil water and vegetation reached the equilibrium state under long-term climate conditions; the period of 1991-2015 was selected as the study period. The model evaluation suggested that CHESS was able to simulate major hydrological processes in the four mountain watersheds. In addition, it was found that annual streamflow was more strongly correlated with snowfall than with rainfall during 1991-2015 and increased by 0.62-0.76 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in the study regions. Recent regional warming advanced the timing of the peak flow and shifts in the snow regime also affected the intra-annual pattern of the soil moisture content. Seasonally, spring rainfall and snowmelt were dominant factors in generating spring streamflow and summer baseflow. The mechanisms for flow generation were more complex and more variable in the four watersheds in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. On an annual basis, shifts in snowmelt resulting from climate variability accounted for more than 60% of the variability in the annual streamflow, surpassing the contribution of rainfall in the four watersheds. Overall, our results suggest that shifts in the snow regime due to climate variability have important implications for the intra-annual distribution and availability of water resources in semiarid and arid regions of the US Great Basin.

AB This study aims to clarify groundwater and stream water flow systems in the Geum River basin, Korea, which is an area with a crystalline basement using delta O-18, delta H-2, and H-3. Stable isotopes of precipitation showed clear differences between dry and rainy seasons due to the Asian monsoon. Groundwater and stream water samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons in three hydrographic zones of the upper, middle, and lower zones. The contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge based on deuterium excess was 71-89%, far exceeding the amount fraction of the season in total precipitation. Stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water showed little seasonal variation, and indicated the dominance of high-altitude recharge in the upper zone. Groundwater with lower H-3 was mainly observed in that area, indicating a contribution of intermediate flow with a longer residence time. In contrast, stream water and some groundwater samples in the lower zone showed seasonal variability and signatures of 10-20% evaporation in their stable isotopic composition. The H-3 content of groundwater in the lower zone was high, indicating that the local flow system is dominant. These regional features also influenced the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation, dry season precipitation, and local recharge with evaporation signature, as estimated from delta O-18 and deuterium excess values, and H-3 in groundwater. Stream water from lower-order streams of the river had stable isotopic compositions similar to those in the upper zone, indicating a considerable contribution of groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas to the lower reach of the river. These results have implications for sustainable management of water resources in the basin during predicted changes in water usage and precipitation patterns due to climate change, as well as in regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions.

AB General Circulation Models (GCMs) provide vital information on the likely future climate, much needed for the effective planning and management of water resources. The performance assessment of GCMs has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate. Even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of GCMs for the selection of an appropriate ensemble, there is still a need to explore the potential of the state-of-the-art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of GCMs suitable for a given task, over a region of interest. The present study assessed the potential of a state-of-the-art feature selection method known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) in ranking 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual, monsoon and winter seasons. The performance of GCMs was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing dataset (Prin) over the period 1961-2005 considering Pakistan as the study area. The ranks obtained with SU were compared with those obtained using two well-established ranking approaches; (1) Compromise Programming (CP) and (2) Wavelet-based Skill Score (WSS). According to the results of this study, for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons; CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESIVM1-M and HadGEM2-ES were identified as the best GCMs by SU, whereas CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESM1-M and GFDL-CM3 were identified as the best GCMs by CP, and CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, GFDL-ESM2G and HadGEM2-ES by WSS. The comparison of ranks of GCMs obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given GCM. However, the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches. The approach presented in this study can be extended to any number of GCMs and can be applied over any region, for the identification of the best performing ensemble of GCMs for a set of climate variables.

AB The lack of knowledge on precipitation frequency over ungauged areas introduces a significant source of uncertainty in relevant engineering designs and risk estimation procedures. Radar-based observations offer precipitation information over ungauged areas and thus have gained increasing attention as a potential solution to this problem. However, due to their relative short data records and inherent uncertainty sources, their ability to provide accurate estimates on the frequency of precipitation extremes requires evaluation. This study involves the evaluation of at-site precipitation frequency estimates from NEXRAD Stage IV radar precipitation dataset. We derive precipitation annual maxima series from the 16yrs record (2002-2017) of NEXRAD and we compare against 539 long-term (50yrs) hourly gauge records. In addition, Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are estimated from both radar and gauge dataset and compared. IDF estimation is based on fitting the Generalize Extreme Value distribution to annual precipitation maxima. Evaluation is carried out over the contiguous United States and results are grouped and presented for five dominant climate classes and for a range of return period and precipitation durations. NEXRAD was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations (1- and 3-h) and low quantiles, while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations (24 h). In addition, evaluation of the IDF curves estimated from NEXRAD revealed a distinct geographic dependence with certain regions exhibiting a tendency to overestimation (e.g. east of the Rocky Mountains) or underestimation (Midwest). Overall, this analysis suggests that, while significant discrepancies may exist, there are several cases where NEXRAD provide estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset. The climate/geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider. Findings provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using NEXRAD estimates for further research or applications on precipitation extremes.

AB Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

AB Pump-and-treat (P&T) is a widely adopted technology for groundwater containment/remediation. Over the past decades, we have recognized that mapping aquifer heterogeneity, especially the low hydraulic conductivity (K) zones, has become an urgent need in remediation efforts. Meanwhile, many studies have proved that hydraulic tomography (FIT) utilizing groundwater responses from a series of cross-hole pumping tests is a viable technology for detailing hydraulic heterogeneity (high and low K zones) of aquifers. At a P&T field site, operation of pumping and injection wells often vary, creating changes in flow fields analogous to those in FIT surveys. Therefore, collecting groundwater monitoring data and analyzing them is tantamount to a cost-effective largescale FIT survey during P&T operations. To demonstrate this idea, water level data was collected at 41 wells for one year at the U.S. Air Force Plant 44 (AFP44) P&T site in Tucson, Arizona, where the pumping and injection rates of the P&T system were changed many times during the year. This dataset was analyzed with a geostatistical inverse model to estimate the hydraulic property distribution, which can reasonably predict the pressure responses of the site under different conditions. Moreover, we showed that large-scale geological information, built based on 245 borehole logs at the site, could improve the model calibration performance through a two-step calibration procedure. Additionally, we used synthetic experiments to verify that the use of a larger variety of P&T configurations can yield non-redundant FIT information, and enhance site characterization. Overall, we demonstrated that the proper scheduling of pumping and injection operations at a P&T site and collecting corresponding groundwater responses are equivalent to conducting a large-scale HT survey, with minimal additional costs.

AB This work investigates the potential of using the Bayesian-based Model Conditional Processor (MCP) for complementing satellite precipitation products with a rainfall dataset derived from satellite soil moisture observations. MCP - which is a Bayesian Inversion approach - was originally developed for predictive uncertainty estimates of water level and discharge to support real-time flood forecasting. It is applied here for the first time to precipitation to provide its probability distribution conditional on multiple satellite precipitation estimates derived from TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis real-time product v.7.0 (3B42RT) and the soil moisture-based rainfall product SM2RAIN-CCI. In MCP, 3B42RT and SM2RAIN-CCI represent a priori information (predictors) about the "true" precipitation (predictand) and are used to provide its real-time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the Bayes theorem. MCP is tested across Italy during a 6-year period (2010-2015) at daily/0.25 deg temporal/spatial scale. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides rainfall estimates that are superior to both 3B42RT (as well as its successor IMERG-early run) and SM2RAIN-CCI in terms of both median bias, random errors and categorical scores. The study confirms that satellite soil moisture-derived rainfall can provide valuable information for improving state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products, thus making them more attractive for water resource management and large scale flood forecasting applications.

AB Single-well injection tests in a petroleum-contaminated region stimulate microbial growth and cause bioclogging because of the intrusion of elevated dissolved oxygen (DO), which may affect the hydraulic conductivity (K) estimation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model considering multispecies and multiphase reactive transport and bioclogging for a single-well injection test in a confined aquifer to investigate the microbial effects on parameter estimation. The finite-difference method was used to solve the model. The temporal heads in the injection well in both cases of clean and petroleum-contaminated aquifers were compared. The results indicated that the bioclogging led to an abnormal bulge of the drawdown-time curve at an intermediately late time of injection. Based on sensitivity analysis and Cooper-Jacob straight-line fitting associated with the least square method, the underestimation degree of K was 17.7% with default parameters, 11.9% with double injection rate Q, 31.1% with double maximum biomass growth rate mu(maxJ) and 39.5% with double initial contaminant concentration C-2(ini). Moreover, introducing an approximate Damkohler number indicated that increasing Q reduced the underestimation by flushing and diluting the essential materials for microbial growth to the downstream and that larger C-2(ini) and mu(maxJ) resulted in an increase in underestimation due to the increase in favorable conditions and strong growth ability of microbes. Finally, we suggest that when petroleum contamination is inevitable in a single-well injection test, moderate increases in Q and the test duration can reduce the underestimation degree of K to a considerable extent.

AB yy Groundwater serves as a significant freshwater supply for coastal regions. In many coastal areas, extensive islands have been created by filling the sea. These reclaimed islands not only provide valuable space for urban development, but also can serve as valuable aquifers. Recharge of fresh water from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a freshwater lens beneath the reclaimed island. However, how a fresh groundwater lens grows in reclaimed islands and the factors that control its growth are unclear. Here we use a series of three-dimensional density-dependent flow-and transport models to investigate the process of fresh-salt water mixing and quantify the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands. Our results show that the recharge rate controls the growth rate and the initialization of the fresh groundwater lens, whereas the permeability of the underlying fill materials and bedrock determines the shape of freshwater lens beneath the island but has a minor influence on freshwater volume. Increasing porosity enlarges the total water volume but diminishes the proportion of fresh water as the larger volume of original salt water in the aquifer requires more recharge to flush and dilute; longitudinal dispersivity promotes the fresh-salt water circulation in a certain range but limits the maximum fresh volume storage, and vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas to enlarge the freshwater lens. Heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow, restricts the average speed of fresh-salt water circulation, and results in a decrease in the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens. Our study has large implications for planning and management of reclaimed lands for water sustainability In the future in coastal areas.

AB Desert oases exist around the alluvial fans of inland river basins in arid areas, where the vegetation growth is wholly dependent on groundwater due to scanty rainfall and arid environment. Climate change and water resources exploitation may threaten the groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in the arid areas; a case study was proposed to evaluate the vegetative growth state with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), hydrometeorological data, and the exploitation of water resources of the Nalenggele alluvial fan in northwest China. Climate change, and increasing temperature and precipitation may be indispensable factors for vegetation growth; however, based on the results of a correlation analysis, it was found that climatic factors shared little direct correlation with the NDVIs of the Nalenggele alluvial fan. Also, the depth to groundwater table (DWT) and distribution of shallow groundwater (DSG) are the direct influencing factors of vegetation growth. DWT and DSG are mainly controlled by the groundwater recharge mechanism and the original water sources from snowmelt, which are directly correlated with climate change. Predictions for DWT and DSG were made considering water resource exploitation and different river discharges amid climate change. The results reveal that the distribution area of shallow groundwater with the ecological water level (DWT < 4 m) in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78-86% of that in the status quo year, which suggests vegetation may be at risk of degradation from the combined influence of climate change and human activities. Therefore, management strategy and legislation for protecting GDEs should be proactively initiated in other similar areas in China.

AB Sources of water used by plants in rock-dominated environments are far less clear than those in relatively homogeneous soils, largely because plants in rocky environments normally expose to more complex substrate conditions and their potential water sources are hard to locate and sample. In the current study, potential water sources for plants growing on cliff-face (a typical kind of rock-dominated environment) were roughly separated into two water pools based on their hydrological differences. A variable pool that is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by precipitation and depletion by transpiration, and a constant pool that is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and depleted by transpiration of deep-rooted species. This study was conducted in a typical karst catchment of Northwest Guangxi, Southwest China. Stem water samples for the most common dominant tree species of cliff-faces and rainwater for each rain event were consecutively collected throughout the growing season. A co-occurring shrub species, which was identified to have a shallow root system, was further selected as a reference species. The reliance on different water pools was qualitatively identified based on the deviation of stem water isotope values between current and last sampling times, as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall between these two sampling times. Our results showed that the shrub species continuously relied on water from the variable water pool, which was consistent with its shallow root system. While the dominant tree species shifted from the constant pool during the early wet season to the variable pool during the mid-wet season, then back to the constant pool during the early dry season. Moreover, the divergent reliance on different water pools by the two species was further supported by the species-specific dynamics in the efficiency in water use by various plants (reflected by leaf carbon isotope ratio). Our results provide new insights into the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools, which would be helpful in understanding the hydrological importance of different plant species.

AB A set of closed-form series solutions that account for the transient and steady-state responses of excess pore water pressure and total settlement to one-dimensional consolidation in saturated soils exposed to various typical types of time-dependent external loading with any desired excitation amplitude and period is symmetrically formulated based on the theory of poroelasticity. The mathematical approach developed in the current study is quite general so that it can be straightforward extended to arbitrary waveform shapes of harmonic loading after they are simply represented in terms of Fourier trigonometric series. These solutions are numerically calculated to evaluate variations in excess pore water pressure and total settlement due to vertical consolidation in saturated soils with two very different magnitudes of intrinsic permeability, Soil A (higher) and Soil B (lower), as representative examples using two illustrative periods per cycle. Our results show that within excitation frequencies we examined, the excess pore water pressure exhibits greater cyclic swings in Soil B than that in Soil A as harmonic stress compression and relaxation are added, but an inverse trend is observed for total settlement. As compared to static external loading, the excess pore water pressure persists longer with periodic fluctuation in the presence of cyclic loading, but less total settlement is induced in Soil B. The discrepancy in the latter (total settlement) between the static and cyclic loading is most significant in Soil B, reflecting a physical implication that low permeability leads to a slower dissipation of excess pore water pressure, thus causing less settlement with time.

AB Realistic representation of surface states using the land surface model (LSM) is extremely challenging owing to human-induced changes and uncertainty in forcing data. In this study, we focus on two crucial objectives pertaining to hydrology namely (a) to understand the ability of different soil moisture (SM) products to improve simulation of unmodeled irrigation processes through data assimilation process, and (b) to learn the feasibility of these SM products to correct the spatial surface soil moisture artifacts caused due to error in precipitation forcing. The utility of SM products evaluated in the present study are retrieved from different satellite sensors and algorithms such as the active satellite-based the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), merged SM from European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI V4.2) and the latest passive microwave-based SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) SM product. The results presented for three years (2010, 2011 and 2012) suggest that assimilation of ASCAT and CCI based products effectively captures the SM changes due to irrigation. Similarly, it corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation errors. However, the single sensor based products have a limitation in spatial samples per day which is critical to capture dynamic SM products over a larger area. Hence, blended products are more effective on a larger area to capture the dynamics in a more effective manner at daily temporal resolutions.

AB Stormwater detentions basins are designed to capture stormwater to reduce and delay peak flows and to improve water quality. A novel technology proposed to improve basin performance is real-time, active control of the basin outflow, in so-called "smart" stormwater systems. Existing studies demonstrate the performance of active controls that respond in real-time to basin water level, detention time, and rainfall forecast for one or a small number of rainfall events. We hypothesize that the performance of these active controls can be improved by incorporating real-time water quality data into the control algorithm. In addition, we hypothesize that active control performance depends on hydrologic variability, specifically the frequency and intensity of runoff inputs. In this paper, we test these hypotheses using a numerical modeling framework for systems-level reliability analysis of active and passive stormwater basin outflow control using a Monte Carlo method. The analysis is performed using the urban hydrology model EPA-SWMM driven by stochastic rainfall time-series generated from the Modified Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model. Water quality-informed real-time active control algorithms are developed, tested, and shown to display an improvement over traditional, passive (no control) systems and other storage-based active controls for water and pollutant capture. Seasonal and duration curve analysis showed that water level- and water quality- informed control performance varied for different storm return periods and this variability could partly be attributed to the fraction of time the valve is closed. In addition, control performance was sensitive to rainfall variability, generally decreasing as storms become less frequent and more intense. Therefore, control system performance may depend on seasonal and longer time scale variability in climate and rainfall-runoff processes. We anticipate this study to be a starting point to incorporate theories of reliability to assess detention basin and conveyance network performance under more complex real-time control algorithms and failure modes.

AB Protecting karst aquifers from nitrate contamination is an issue of global concern due to the inherent vulnerability of karst aquifers to contamination and the negative health effects of elevated nitrate levels. Hydrological and transport models were developed to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi-arid and sub-humid climate conditions. Groundwater flow through the aquifer matrix and conduits was simulated with CFPv2, an experimental version of the Conduit Flow Process (CFP) version of the MODular FLOW (MODFLOW) groundwater model. Nitrate transport was simulated with the experimental Conduit Mass Transport Three-Dimensional Model (CMT3D). The hydrologic calibration of the steady-state model was successful based on a scaled Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.9% for hydraulic heads and percent errors of 3.0% and 6.6% for the two major springs in the area. Performance of the transient hydrologic model exceeded the performance of the existing Equivalent Porous Media (EPM) model with a scaled RMSE of 2.2% and springflow errors of 1.5% and 2.8% for the major springs. Similarly, nitrate calibration was successful with all Percent Bias (PBIAS) values between +/- 25%. Additional calibration statistics including a two-tailed t-test indicated successful calibration. The CMT3D model corroborates prior research findings that anthropogenic sources as well as biogenic wastes are important sources of nitrate to the aquifer. The methodology used in this study represents an additional tool for watershed managers to address nitrate contamination within karst aquifers.

AB Presented in this paper is a theoretical and numerical analysis for active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow dominated by the free-surface effect. An ecological risk assessment model for the concentration distribution of active particles is devised as an extension of the general form of concentration transport equation for passive particles in wetland flows. The vorticity in the free-surface wetland flow is found to depend on the dimensionless parameter alpha, which reflects the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion, microscopic curvature of flow passages, friction of vegetation and water depth. The large alpha results in the decrease of vorticity at the free surface and the increase at the bed bottom. The analytical solution of stable concentration distribution is rigorously derived for the active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows, under the combined action of the effective mass dispersion by the ambient flow, as well as the translational diffusion and vertical swimming by the active particles. It is found that the strong vorticity weakens the concentration of active particles in the free surface wetland flow, while the strong diffusion, by the wetland flow and active particles, enhances the concentration. The large alpha results in the increase of concentration near the free surface and the decrease of concentration near the bed bottom. The time scale for active particles to reach the stable concentration distribution is mainly dependent on the dimensionless parameter, Pe, which reflects the relative strength of the vertical swimming and the total diffusion due to the wetland flow and the active particles.

AB A single fracture is the basic unit of fracture medium, and the roughness of the fracture surface is an important factor influencing hydraulic characteristics of the flow in bedrock fracture. However, effects of the shape and density of roughness elements (various bulges/pits on rough fracture wall surfaces) on water flow in a single fracture have not been thoroughly understood. Thus the water flow in a single fracture with different shapes and densities of roughness elements was simulated by using Fluent software in this study. The results showed that the existence of roughness elements could enhance the flow resistance and cause nonlinear flow. The shape difference of roughness elements, i.e. the value variation of the included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness element and the streamline direction, could change their influence degree on the flow regime. Increasing the density of roughness elements could bring more violent turbulent, reduce the relative aperture of fracture, and decrease the discharge per unit width correspondingly. With the increase of flow velocity, Forchheimer equation could fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient better than Izbash equation. In addition, the variation of flow regime in rough fracture from laminar flow to turbulent flow was a process of the gradual dominance of inertial force.

AB Forest ecosystem plays a major role in controlling moisture dynamics over the continents, particularly in the humid tropics. The montane forest ecosystem in South India supports a characteristic warm tropical climate which affects the weather pattern and the monsoon system. This study focuses on better understanding of the influence of dual monsoonal rainfall on the surface water and groundwater in south-west India, and the role of the Western Ghats mountain belt in governing the water isotope characteristics (i.e., isotopic elevation, rainfall amount and continental effects) in the humid tropics of South India. This is achieved through a spatial study of stable isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water (oxygen, delta H-2 and hydrogen, delta H-2), collected from different tropical river basins located between Kozhikode (Kerala, 10 degrees 30' N) and Udupi (Karnataka, 13 degrees 30' N), in the wettest places and highest peaks of the Western Ghats between 2011 and 2014. The results on stable isotope ratios of ground water, river water and springs show that the water from the tropical mountain belt of the Western Ghats exhibit a low elevation effect with an isotopic lapse rate of 0.09 parts per thousand/100m for delta O-18 up to 2050 m asl. Beyond 2050 m asl, a considerable effect of elevation with an isotopic lapse rate of 2.5 parts per thousand/100 m for delta O-18 is observed. The water samples from the Nilgiri ranges (1950-2300 m asl) exhibited higher isotopic lapse rate of 1.5 parts per thousand/100 m for delta O-18 unlike that of the mountains (Ezhimala, Agumbe and Chembra) close to the eastern Arabian Sea. The difference in isotopic lapse rate is mainly dependent on (i) the dominating seasonality of oceanic source moisture over the subcontinent leading to higher depletion of heavy isotopes for more inland groundwater during the winter monsoon on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats (ii) the degree of terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms along windward slopes of the Ghats belt (i.e., Arabian Sea coast of India) leading to relative enrichment of heavy isotopes in groundwater fed by the highly recycled vapour sources rather than depletion due to amount, elevation or continental effect, and iii) deep cooling of orographically uplifted air moisture at high elevations of inland tropical mountains. The observed isotopic elevation effect on the groundwater and surface water is unique and constrained by specific time scale and mountain ranges within the Western Ghats belt. This study provides new understanding on factors controlling hydrological budget along higher parts of the Western Ghats mountain belt in South India experiencing humid tropical climate.

AB Hydrological modeling has provided key insights into the mechanisms of land-use change impacts on runoff. However, the uncertainty of this impact is poorly understood. This paper examines the uncertainty originated from hydrological models' parameters and structure in simulating hydrological responses to land use change on daily, monthly and annual time scales. Two hydrological models, SWAT and HSPF, were applied to simulate the runoff response in the Xitiaoxi basin of eastern China. The effects of three land use scenarios (in 1985, 2002 and 2014) were analyzed with respect to the expansion of urban areas and reduction of cropland and forests. The changes in streamflow with multi-timescales between two models were compared at the whole basin and the sub-basin scales. The parameter uncertainty was estimated based on a sequential uncertainty analysis method (SUFI-2). The results indicate that the two models (SWAT and HSPF) could reproduce the observed daily and seasonal flows well, but they cannot accurately reconstruct the extreme flows (such as annual 7-day minimum discharge, R_7dMIN). The effect of parameter uncertainty on streamflow varies over time scales. The simulated annual and monthly runoff change values show large discrepancies but with same trends. The simulated changes for annual maximum discharge (R_1dMAX) and R_7dMIN often show different signs. The average width of the predictive interval in the relative change of different flow characteristics exceeded 100% of the average relative changes for both models. HSPF tends to present larger relative changes for the annual and monthly runoffs compared to SWAT. Moreover, the model choice could affect the direction change in R_1dMAX and R_7dMIN. However, when land use change was significant to a certain degree, both models simulated increased R_ldMAX and decreased R_7dMIN, but with different significance levels. The study suggests that the model structure represents an additional uncertainty, which should be accounted for in the land-use change impact assessment.

AB The choice of data periods for calibrating and evaluating conceptual hydrological models often seems ad-hoc, with no objective guidance on choosing calibration periods that produce the most reliable predictions. We therefore propose to systematically investigate the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance. We demonstrate our analysis on the Deggendorf/kollbach catchment in Bavaria, Germany, for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records. After classifying these data into three hydrological conditions (wet, dry and mixed) and combining them into periods of varied data length (2, 4, 8, 15, 20 and 25 years), we repeatedly calibrate a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model - Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) to these distinct data sets via Bayesian updating in a Monte Carlo setting. Then, we analyze predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods of distinct hydrological condition and time-series length. We call this the Comprehensive Differential Split-Sample Test (CDSST). Our results suggest that hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact than time-series length, and that calibrating on dry conditions might be a robust choice when aiming at predicting arbitrary future conditions (wet, dry or mixed). Furthermore, we found that posterior parameter estimates converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios, indicating that compensation of model structural errors by parameter fitting is independent of the chosen calibration condition. However, calibrating on time-series 8 years or longer led to overconfident predictions that failed to reliably envelope future data. While these findings are specific to our case study, we recommend using the CDSST to stress-test conceptual hydrological models to identify robust model parameters and/or deficiencies in the model structure. In general, we expect our proposed approach to be a valuable basis for model error diagnosis in any type of dynamic environmental system model, because it answers the following three questions: (1) what is the importance of physical processes not explicitly covered by the model? (2) How much overconfidence is present in the model? And (3), what are case-specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups?

ID PESTICIDE ATTENUATION; AQUIFER; SYSTEMS; AGE; AID
AB Groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed to give the best possible overview of the quality status and trend of aquifers from a limited number of measurement stations. Ideally, the stations of the network should (i) allow the detection of significant changes in water quality, either improvements due to successful mitigation measures, or deteriorations caused for instance by land use change or other increasing pressure and (ii) approximate closely the true unknown mean concentration of the considered aquifer. If these two features are met, the monitoring network is representative of the entire aquifer. In this article, we present a method with which to assess and improve the representativeness of a regional groundwater monitoring network. The method is designed specifically to optimize the selection of monitoring stations from a larger choice of fixed locations such as springs or existing observation wells using one contaminant for the optimisation procedure. Firstly, the empirical distribution of selected solutes (contaminants and age tracers) is calculated from a large dataset consisting of as many sampling points as possible and compared to the distributions obtained solely from the stations of the existing or planned monitoring network. If differences are large, the network is modified by adding new stations or replacing some of them, using one contaminant for the optimisation. Lastly, the distribution of the optimised network is compared to the total distribution for other contaminants and one groundwater age tracer.
   The use of the method is illustrated for the main aquifer of the country of Luxembourg, where it is shown that the representativeness of the current monitoring network can be improved by replacing two stations. In the case study, the optimisation was based on desethyl atrazine, a ubiquitous pesticide transformation compound which was assumed to be an indicator of diffuse agricultural pollution. Although the largest improvement was obviously obtained for the optimised compound, improvement was also observed for other contaminants, including nitrate, probably showing that at the regional scale, the pattern of diffuse pollution of widely used agrochemicals is similar between compounds. The temporal evolution of the major contaminants could also be reproduced by the optimised network, even though the range of tritium values used as age tracer was narrower for the modified network than for the original network, thus indicating some bias towards faster reaction times.

AB Rainfall-runoff processes in the karst dominated regions are of great importance. However, not all areas in a karst-dominated river basin are covered by typical limestone and both limestone and soil cover may exist. This study proposes a coupled conceptual hydrological model for simulating the rainfall-runoff processes in karst-dominated areas. The model, named as K-XAJ, couples the traditional Xinanjiang (XAJ) model and a two reservoir-based karst model for simulating runoff in both the karst area and the non-karst area in the Lijiang River basin. Simulated results demonstrated that the proposed K-XAJ model satisfactorily simulated the rainfall-runoff processes. Compared with the traditional XAJ model, the K-XAJ model produced better forecasts. The peak flow predicted by the K-XAJ model was larger than that by the XAJ model, but the interflow routed by the K-XAJ model was significantly smaller than that by the XAJ model. The magnitude of groundwater predicted by the K-XAJ model was greater. This study thus provides a new way to simulate rainfall-runoff processes in karst areas.

AB In deep excavation engineering, the head of the confined aquifer below the excavation bottom must be lowered when the anti-uprush safety factor is not satisfied. However, the drawdown of the confined aquifer may cause ground settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings, tunnels or municipal pipes. Artificial recharge (AR) is a measure that has been applied in such situations to recover the water level and control the settlement. However, practical engineering cases have shown that AR could control only the development of settlement and could hardly recover the settlement caused by long-term dewatering. Therefore, three recharge schemes, namely, "recharge first", "simultaneous pressure relief and recharge" and "pressure relief first", are studied using numerical modeling. The results show that the opening timing of the recharge wells and pressure relief wells has a significant impact on the final settlement. In different recharge schemes, different stress paths of the soil in the confined aquifer and overlying aquitards cause different plastic compressive deformations. To reduce plastic deformation, recharge should begin at the same time as pressure relief when the surrounding environment of the deep excavation must be strictly protected. Additionally, the case study and numerical simulation both show that the most significant settlement or uplift occurs in the deep soil layer rather than at the ground surface, a phenomenon that occurs because the vertical displacement of the soil adjacent to the relief and recharge wells is larger than that in the soil far away, leading to a vertical soil arching in the strata above the confined aquifer.

   FRAMEWORK
AB River flows exert dominant controls on in-stream biota. Quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions. Hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow-ecology relationships and guide management actions. Traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition. We present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response. First, we developed regional flow-ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern California to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait-based biotic indices. Next, we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics. For our study sites, flow flashiness and low flow frequency (indicative of drying) were found to best explain biotic condition. Hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime. This ecological-calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow-ecology relationships, but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation.

AB A novel form of coupled curvilinear lattice Boltzmann model (CCLBM) for solving the solute transport in shallow water flows, imposed by the complex geometry, is developed and applied. Shallow water equations, transformed into curvilinear coordinate system, are solved using the lattice Boltzmann equation with multiple-relaxation-time (MRT-LBM), while the curvilinear form of the 2D advection-diffusion equation is solved applying the Bhatnagar-Gmss-Krook (BGK-LBM) approach. Corresponding forms of equilibrium distribution function for both the shallow water and the advection-diffusion equation is derived using the D2Q9 lattice. The physical flow domain of arbitrary geometry in the horizontal plane is covered with adequate curvilinear mesh, while the calculation procedure for flow and transport is carried out in the D2Q9 square lattice, applying the basic form of the boundary condition method on water-solid and open boundaries as well. The coupled flow and pollution transport is tested using a straight inclined channel, irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 degrees bend, and a segment of the Danube River. In the cases of the straight inclined channels analytic solution is used as a comparative base, while for the bent channel previously obtained velocity measurements are utilized for flow calibration, where a mathematical model based on traditional CFD procedures is used for pollution transport validation. Unsteady flow and salinity transport in the Danube River is calibrated and modelled using velocity and salinity measurements, along with the results obtained by the traditionally based CFD model. The high level of agreement between the results obtained by the proposed model and the corresponding analytical values and measurements indicates that the presented curvilinear form of the LBM is capable of solving very complex environmental problems.

AB River confluences are key features of a river network, and their effects on contaminant transport and transformation need to be understood to control the contamination of a river network. This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus (P) contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the Huai River, China, where water and sediment contamination is severe. The results highlight that P contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main stream of the river network to which the river confluence belongs. Floods have critical impact on the transport of sediment and its surface texture. In the annual water cycle the initial small flood can convey much more contaminated sediment and pollute the downstream river, whereas the subsequent large flood leads to the coarsening of the surface sediment and decrease of the total P (TP) content on the surface sediment (TPS). Water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of the TPS at the river confluence. Higher P amounts are adsorbed on the surface sediment during lower water temperatures in winter and spring. Calcium bound P (Ca-P) is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary P during the dynamic processes of contamination of the surface sediment, and the nonapatite P gets released from the surface sediment during the summer. Effects of P concentration of the surface water and that of pH on TPS variability are not discernable in the current study. These results will be useful for controlling phosphorus contamination at river confluences and in river networks.

AB As a typical wet island in arid Central Asia, the Ili Valley located in northwestern China provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches. However, it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region. Based on three sites spread over the Ili Valley, 297 precipitation samples were collected from May 2015 to April 2016. The delta O-18 and delta D values range from -37.8 parts per thousand to 3.2 parts per thousand and -261.5 parts per thousand to 34.5 parts per thousand, with a weighted mean -9.4 parts per thousand and -65.2 parts per thousand, respectively. A clear correlation exists between mean monthly delta O-18 values and mean monthly temperature, with R-2 = 0.68 for the mean monthly values increase of 0.91 parts per thousand per degree Celsius. A positive gradient of 0.32 parts per thousand/100 m was obtained from the Ili Valley when an annual weighted average of delta O-18 values was used. Considering the temporal and spatial variation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and d-excess value of precipitation, combined with the results from the HYSPLIT4.0 air mass trajectory model, we found that moisture source in the study area is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies, and the moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around Yining cannot be ignored. Although the data covers a year, it can still provide a good database for studying hydrological cycle in Centeral Asian.

AB This paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model (NFVMSFEM) for groundwater flow and velocity simulation in porous media. The main goal of this method is to simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x, y direction Darcian velocities, thereby simplifying the simulation process and improving the efficiency. This goal is accomplished by introducing a novel velocity matrix in the control volume boundary flux estimation of the finite volume multiscale finite element method (FVMSFEM) framework. The velocity matrix allows for the NFVMSFEM to directly represent continuous fine-scale velocities by coarse-scale heads, thus merging the two kinds of unknowns into one. Through a modified Yeh's Galerkin model, the velocity matrix is constructed in each local coarse element before the head computation; thus, the computational cost is very little. Furthermore, the NFVMSFEM inherits the advantageous features of the FVMSFEM, which ensures the local conservation of heads and further improves the efficiency. The results of the comparison between the NFVMSFEM and certain classical methods for head and velocity computation demonstrate its effectiveness and high efficiency.

AB Climate change in mean-state or variability could lead to more/less frequency of extreme drought. In this study, we developed a new framework for decomposing the contributing factors of changes in future extreme drought frequency in China in accordance to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). We performed a series of numerical experiments to ensure that the sensitivity of trend and variability in individual climatic variables can be distinguished. In addition, an extreme drought rate with warming (EDRW, unit: %.K-1) is defined to quantify the relative change in extreme drought frequency per Kelvin. Overall, the EDRW will increase dramatically by an average of 27.71%.K-1. The ascended EDRW are attributed to increases in temperature (+56.90%.K-1), net radiation (14.80%.K-1) and precipitation variability (+8.23%.K-1); a decrease in relative humidity (+4.61%K-1), but is partly offset by an increase in precipitation (i.e., "wetting", -60.12%.K-1). A smaller increase in the frequency of extreme droughts is found in high-latitude regions due to their enhanced sensitivity to "wetting".

TI Hydrogeophysical monitoring reveals primarily vertical movement of an

AB Intensive potato production is an important contributor to groundwater and surface water nitrate contamination in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. In PEI, the presence of a permeability contrast between soil and the underlying compact basal till at approximately 1 m depth is known to cause temporary perched water table conditions, but the implications for agricultural nitrate transport are not well understood. This study is the first detailed field investigation to examine the impact of the soil - compact basal till interface on vertical and lateral subsurface flow of water and solutes on a moderate hillslope in PEI. A surface-applied tracer test was conducted and a shallow drain-tile pipe system, with a tipping bucket gauge, was installed down-gradient of the tracer application to monitor lateral subsurface flow. In addition, three-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was employed to monitor the evolution of the applied tracer plume over a period of 1 year. A small scale, transient flow and transport model was used to simulate the tracer test and to investigate the sensitivity of tracer transport to selected parameters (primarily, the hydraulic conductivities of the soils and underlying compact basal till). Monitoring, conducted from October 2013 to June 2015, and numerical modeling showed a strong tendency for vertical flow of water and tracer through the soil - compact basal till interface as opposed to lateral down-slope subsurface flow. Water balance calculations estimated a total vertical flow of 94.5% of the infiltration for the October 2014 to January 2015 period. The preference for vertical over lateral flow and transport was consistent with electrical resistivity images for the same time period. These findings indicate that the fate of infiltrating water and dissolved nitrate is the deeper bedrock aquifer water table, and that intermittent perched water table conditions do not result in significant lateral flow toward nearby surface waters.

AB In this study, synchronized gridded precipitation and temperature generators were developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to reconstruct the spatial structure and other statistical properties of high-resolution CaPA (Canadian Precipitation Analysis) precipitation and GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale Model) temperature products. The precipitation generator is an extension to the gridded multi-site occurrence-amount model. While the multi-site framework is not efficiently applicable to regions with limited precipitation information and sparse observation network, this paper provides the full mathematical description of estimating the model based on high-resolution gridded products. The temperature model, on the other hand, introduces the first gridded hourly generator in the literature in which cyclic temperature components are conditioned using wet and dry day status information. This was achieved using harmonic functions establishing the connection between the simulated daily precipitation occurrence time-series and the moments of the generated temperature data. One of the key features of the proposed gridded generators is the capacity to produce temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature; an essential prerequisite for hydrologic modeling applications. The generators were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce the standard, interannual, and extreme-value characteristics of observed gridded products. The gridded precipitation model can preserve key statistical and spatial properties of the gridded CaPA observations to an acceptable level, while similar to the original multi-site framework, it falls short to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation. The temperature model, on the other hand, preserves the majority of key features of the gridded GEM temperature observations, including the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds. The only notable defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed.

   approach; Momentum transfer
ID OPEN-CHANNEL; RESISTANCE; MODELS
AB Determining the characteristics of pipe flow and the effect of friction resistance is relevant to a variety of applications in hydraulic and hydrological engineering such as flood control, river restoration and ground runoff prediction. In the Nikuradse's experiments, the relative roughness and the bulk Reynolds number are used to scale the Darcy friction factor thereby determining the mean velocity. Recent observations using permeable-walled pipes however indicate that the friction factor can significantly deviate from the results obtained in Nikuradse's approach. Here, we propose a concise model to estimate the mean velocity of the pipe flow over permeable walls. The model is formulated using a data-driven approach based on the analytical solution of the mean velocity and the similarity analysis (dimension conservation) of the two extreme cases: impermeable and porous pipe flow. We show that the proposed approach can derive a physically meaningful formula for the mean velocity. Furthermore, we propose a simple momentum transfer model which confirms the findings from the data-driven approach. The momentum transfer model indicates that the friction factor can be scaled with two different relative hydraulics radius scales, which are intrinsically determined by two different eddy sizes. Lastly, the present approach is examined by comparing it with another approximate formula and the limited experimental data in the literature.

AB Accurate forecasting of hourly suspended sediment concentration is a critical issue for reservoir management, especially during typhoon periods. This research proposes a two-stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine-learning-based models to provide accurate real-time forecasts of half-hourly suspended sediment concentration. In the first stage, the density current model, SRH2D, was verified and applied by the historical typhoon events due to the lack of measured suspended sediment concentration. Next, in the second stage, the calculated results from SRH2D based on the spatial-temporal relation were employed as the input of the MGSVM-based model. Finally, an application in the Shi-Men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach. The results indicated that the calculated data from the SRH2D model corresponded to the trend of measured data in spatial-temporal variation. Moreover, the proposed forecasting approach enables reasonably acceptable 0.5- to 3-h ahead forecasts of suspended sediment concentration by using the simulated data of half-hourly suspended sediment concentration. The accurate forecast conducted by the proposed approach is expected to be properly applied to reservoir management.

AB The discharge of fecal indicator bacteria into surface water sources poses treatment challenges to drinking water utilities. Changes in the discharge regimes of streams resulting from extreme precipitation associated with climate change can exacerbate these challenges. The catchments of many surface water sources depended upon by water treatment plants are ungauged, thus making it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on the microbial quality of such water sources. In this study, a hydrological model is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and E. coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of Alesund in Norway. We performed separate sensitivity analysis for flow and E. colt, and assessed the variations in patterns of flow and E. coli concentrations in the streams in future using adjusted meteorological data. The calibrated flow showed good agreement with the observed data, but the E. coli model yielded lower performance indices. The results indicate that interception of precipitation by forest cover and soil organic carbon content mostly control flow generation in the catchments, and the variations in the concentrations of E. coli were more sensitive to instream sediment processes. Flow levels in the streams would remain the same in 2045 and 2075. Peak flows that currently occur in spring and autumn months may respectively shift back to winter and summer months. High concentrations of E. coli currently observed in summer in the streams may be lower in future, but the concentrations may be high at the start of autumn seasons. The results have management implications for watersheds and water utilities mostly in temperate climate regions.

AB Numerous studies have been conducted on Cs-137 transport in the environment in Fukushima, Japan, since the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. Many studies have monitored river and stream water, and a declining trend in dissolved Cs-137 concentrations has been reported. In addition, temporary increases in dissolved Cs-137 concentrations have been observed during rainstorm events. However, the source and process of such temporary increases remain poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, intense multi-point sampling and analysis of dissolved Cs-137 in stream water, soil water, and groundwater were conducted in a forested headwater catchment in Yamakiya district, located 35 km northwest of the FDNPP, from July 2015 to November 2016. The average dissolved Cs-137 concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mBq/L, whereas the concentration during rainstorm events was 31 mBq/L (maximum: 170 mBq/L on July 15, 2015). The dissolved Cs-137 concentration in groundwater (average: 0.93 mBq/L) was lower than that in stream water. Conversely, high concentrations of dissolved Cs-137 in soil water were observed (average: 81 mBq/L), particularly at lower parts of the slope near the spring point and in wet conditions throughout summer. Consequently, the dissolved Cs-137 concentrations in stream water were considered to be derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater. The high dissolved Cs-137 concentration in soil water may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored on the slope. During rainstorm events, the saturated area expands upward; therefore, the temporary increase in the dissolved Cs-137 concentration in stream water observed at the beginning of a rainstorm may be caused by the release of high levels of dissolved Cs-137 in soil water stored in the shallow soil layer.

AB Many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the United States because of the importance of flooding to bridges and other structures, and the concern that human influence may increase flooding. To help attribute causes of historical peak-flow changes, it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows. We analyzed historical trends by basin type: minimally altered basins, regulated basins (substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization), and urbanized basins (with low reservoir storage). Although many peak-flow magnitude changes were found in the last century across the conterminous United States, the trend magnitude and direction vary strongly by basin type and region. In general, there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while many regulated basins had significant decreases and the limited number of urbanized basins with long-term record showed a high percentage of increases. For urbanized basins, which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, trend magnitude was significantly correlated with the amount of basin urbanization. For all basins regardless of type, parts of the Northeast quadrant of the U.S. had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the Southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases. Basin regulation appears to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the Southwest quadrant; there were many large decreases for this basin type despite overall increases in heavy precipitation in this area. Changes over time in the number of 2-per-year and 1-per-5-year peaks over threshold are consistent with changes in the magnitude of annual peak flows.

ID WASTE-WATER SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; QUALITY; CALIBRATION; RIVER
AB This paper proposes a new conceptual modelling approach and calibration method for sewer systems, driven by the interest in using the sewer as a bioreactor and long-term biochemical modelling of the integrated system consisting of the sewage collection system and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The new approach consists of a method for simplifying a complex sewer network into a simpler, yet accurate, computationally efficient (conceptual) model able to capture the relevant sewer dynamics, both in terms of water quantity and water quality entering the wastewater treatment plant. Water quality predicted by the conceptual model was assessed using a detailed biochemical process model and compared against a whole-network biochemical model that covers all hydraulic segments and pipes of the sewer system. The conceptual biochemical model achieves very similar results as the whole-network model in terms of water quality, while providing much faster simulation speed (minutes rather than hours) and easy calibration. Given these advantages, the conceptual biochemical model of a collection system can be used in an integrated model with which sewer and WWTP can be simulated simultaneously for long-term evaluation of optimization scenarios. The model was applied to the prediction of the biochemical components, e.g. sulfide, organics and nutrients, which are essential for the control and management of sewer corrosion and pollutant removal.

   MODEL; INDIA
AB To overcome water scarcity issues, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) structures are currently developed in many parts of the world, including poorly permeable terrain like weathered crystalline rocks. In such geological context, characterized by relatively limited groundwater storage mainly associated with fractures located at the interface between the upper weathered layer (saprolite) and the fractured bedrock, the efficiency of MAR is poorly known. To address this question and better understand the factors that control recharge dynamics, an artificial recharge basin was implemented at the Experimental Hydrogeological Park in Telangana (South India), a well-equipped and continuously monitored site situated in Archean granitic terrain. The thickness of the saprolite and hydraulic properties are relatively well known all over the site from previous geophysical surveys and hydraulic tests.
   To characterize recharge dynamics, recharge has been monitored in different boreholes surrounding the infiltration basin. Infiltration rates and water level data are interpreted by both a volume balance approach and different analytical solutions. In addition, a simple numerical model was used to show how the depth of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite controls recharge dynamics and observed water levels variations. Results show that the permeability of the saprolite/bedrock interface is sufficiently large to allow an efficient recharge that propagates laterally throughout the aquifer through this well connected interface. However, the variable depth of this permeable pathway controls the water level response, acting as a semi-impervious boundary, leading to remarkable water level variations. Thus, our findings show how the characteristics of the most permeable pathways control recharge dynamics in weathered crystalline rocks. In addition, we show how the depth variations of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite may be inferred from the monitoring of water level during recharge events.

AB Streamflow forecasting has great significance in water resource management, particularly for reservoir operation. However, accurately predicting streamflow is challenging due to the non-stationary characteristics of hydrologic processes and the effects of noise. To improve monthly streamflow forecasting, this study proposes a data-driven model based on a double-processing strategy, which combines singular spectrum analysis (SSA), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) approaches. In the proposed double-processing model, called SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM, the original streamflow series are first processed via SSA for denoising; then, the processed series are reprocessed via ICEEMDAN to decompose them into relatively stationary sub-series; finally, these sub-series are modelled using ELM. The performance of the proposed model is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using streamflow data from the Caojiahu and Shibalipu reservoirs in the Gulang River Basin. In addition, the proposed double-processing model is compared with four single-processing models, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-ELM, ensemble EMD (EEMD)-ELM, ICEEMDAN-ELM and SSA-ELM, and two single models without any processing, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ELM. The results show that: (a) the four single-processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models, and the performance of the SSA-ELM model is the best of these single-processing models, implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored; (b) the proposed SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM model is superior to the single-processing models and single models, demonstrating that the double-processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed model, which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management, can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series.

AB Near-surface soil water content (NSWC) is an important parameter for characterizing hydrological processes, water and vapor exchange at the soil-atmosphere boundary, and potential biological productivity. Here we develop a dielectric based frequency-domain (FD) impedance sensor operating at 100 MHz, with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board. This perforated cylinder coaxial (PCC) sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and of temperature. The temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water. We characterize the performance of the PCC sensor and compare it with alternative 3-pin- and 2-pin-electrode FD impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board. A series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted, including (i) sensors calibration, (ii) temperature effects and their correction, (iii) soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal (SSR) test and (iv) accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the NSWC measurements. The calibration results verified that the PCC, 3-pin and 2-pin probes were suitable to measure VSWC (RMSE <= 0.0142 cm(3) cm(-3)). The simulation analysis using High Frequency Structure Simulator software (HFSS) indicated that the novel PCC probe had a symmetrical distribution of the E-field, wholly contained within the cylinder, avoiding leakage of the E-Field into air at the soil-atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on VSWC. The results of the SSR test showed that the E-field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the PCC probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin-type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on VSWC (i.e. up to 8 mm for 3-pin and up to 11 mm for 2-pin designs when VSWC > 0.17 cm(3) cm(-3)), which corresponds to the simulation analysis. Moreover, the new PCC probe provided more accurate NSWC measurement than 3-pin or 2-pin probes because the E-field was contained within the perforated cylinder, avoiding E-field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of VSWC. The pin-structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface.

AB Transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers arc important aspects of the carbon cycle and the critical linkage between terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems. Recent studies have quantified fluvial export to the marine environment in many systems, but in-stream losses of DOC are poorly constrained. This study compares DOC yields (kg C/ha) between the area-weighted averages of several tributaries within larger watersheds with the DOC yields of the larger watersheds to gain insight on in-stream losses in larger river systems. Four large watersheds, 22 tributaries to those watersheds, and 5 additional main stem locations in Maine were studied during 1 April to 15 November in 2011 through 2013. There were no significant differences in the area weighted average DOC yield of the tributaries and the larger watersheds indicating little net in-stream loss in the main stems of the larger rivers. It is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries based on similarity in DOC yield longitudinally along the main stems of two of the rivers. In addition, wetland abundance, which is associated with higher DOC yield in this environment, did not consistently increase from tributaries to the larger watershed or longitudinally along the main stems. This geographic distribution of wetlands therefore also indicates that it is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries. These findings suggest that in-stream losses of DOC in these larger river systems are minimal and that the vast majority of DOC in major rivers in Maine is transported conservatively to the coastal ocean.

AB Monitoring continental precipitation over Europe with high resolution (2 km, 15 min) has been possible since the operational production of the OPERA composites from the European weather radar networks. The OPERA data are the essential input to a hazard assessment tool for identifying localized rainfall-induced flash floods at European scale, and their quality determines the performance of the tool. This paper analyses the OPERA data quality during the warm seasons of 2015-2017 by comparing the estimated rainfall accumulations with the SYNOP rain gauge records over Europe. To compensate the OPERA underestimation, a simple spatially-variable bias adjustment method has been applied. The long-term comparison between the OPERA and gauge point daily rainfall accumulations at the gauge locations shows the benefit of the bias adjustment. Additionally, the daily monitoring shows gradual improvement of the OPERA data year by year. The impact of the quality of the OPERA data for effective flash flood identification is demonstrated for the case of the flash floods that occurred from 29 May to 3 June 2016 in central Europe.

AB In urban stormwater pipe networks, pipe leakage may lead to reduction of groundwater recharge, to significant reduction of groundwater levels, and to subsurface contamination. In the present study, stormwater pipe leakage is simulated in a case study representing an urban catchment using the coupled groundwater-pipe network flow model OGS-HE. This model includes pipe flow, variably saturated subsurface flow and exchange fluxes to and from leaky pipes. The study area is a typical northern German urban catchment with a stormwater pipe network which is located partly below and above groundwater. The successful calibration of a groundwater model is shown. Based on the calibrated groundwater model, stormwater pipe leakage for pipe networks of different ages and different pipe defect sizes is investigated for dry-weather flow conditions and rainfall conditions. It is shown that standard defects with a size of 10(-4) m(2) per m pipe can result in a groundwater infiltration into the leaky pipe network, which is in the order of annual groundwater recharge. The same standard defect size leads to a reduction of local groundwater levels by several meters. Rain events of increasing return period reduce groundwater infiltration into leaky pipes and increase stormwater exfiltration from leaky pipes, while the temporal distribution of a rain event has no effect on stormwater leakage.

AB To reflect a key aspect of global socio-hydrology, this paper explores global virtual water use from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption via interregional trades within the world economy as reflected by world input-output database for 2014. An embodiment accounting model is developed, which takes full account of virtual water feedbacks related to primary inputs. Global total trade volume of virtual water is estimated to be in magnitude around 30% of the global direct freshwater withdrawal. Moreover, it is revealed that global virtual water transfer in intermediate trade is in magnitude around 1.4 times that in final trade. In intermediate trade of virtual water, China, Japan and the United Kingdom turn out to be the three leading net importers, while India, Russia and the United States are revealed as the leading net exporters. In final trade of virtual water, the United States, Japan and Russia are the major net importers, in contrast to China, India and Mexico as the leading net exporters. Trade connections and imbalances of major economies in terms of virtual water are quantified and analyzed. Two new indicators in terms of water self-sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised. It is found that around 40% of the use of China's freshwater withdrawal finally sinks into foreign economies while only 20% of China's virtual water use originates from other regions. With regard to Germany, Canada and France, they behave like active pumps driving vast virtual water inflows and outflows, demonstrating their high involvement in the global supply chain in terms of virtual water. With the increasingly frequent virtual water transfer within the world economy, nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate and final trades of virtual water for sustainable use of freshwater resources.

AB Runoff generation from rainfall events is a complex, spatial and temporally dependent process strongly governed, among other factors, by catchment surface topography. Although it is widely known that many catchments experience morphological evolution, it is often ignored in analysis for different reasons ranging from simplification to lack of data. However, young catchments and early landscapes (such as those which are affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances) do exhibit topography changes which in turn affect catchment hydrodynamics, hydrology and in particular runoff. In this work, we study the runoff generation and hydrodynamics of the Huhnerwasser artificial catchment (Brandenburg, Germany) during a period of erosion-based topographical changes (2006-2010). Nine Digital Elevation Models from such period were used as topography over which physically-based simulations were performed. The results suggest that topographic evolution in this catchment mostly affects the onset of runoff, whereas peak discharges and receding hydrograph limbs are less affected. These differences in hydrological signatures can be explained through the changes in the spatial distribution of runoff hydrodynamics and their impact on surface runoff connectivity. Relatively small topographical differences produce changing ponding conditions and modify flowpaths which becomes evident only through inspection of the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic variables. Moreover, the study shows that in order for simulations to be able to capture such responses, appropriate computational mesh and topographical data resolution are critical, since connectivity itself can be greatly affected by low resolution data or representation.

AB Tree-ring reconstructions of streamflow can provide long-term perspectives of flow variability that may be useful in management strategies for water resources. Relative to other portions of the United States, there is a dearth of tree-ring based streamflow reconstructions in the Midwest. The Wabash River is an important water resource in Indiana and Illinois where many sectors rely on it. Here, to better understand the historic hydroclimate within the Wabash River Basin, we reconstructed June-September streamflow for a tributary of the Wabash River using three statistical approaches: the traditional basin approach, and the recently-developed climate-footprint, and drought-reconstruction approaches. Our reconstructions explained 53-71% of the variance for the common period (1941-1984). We find that in our three reconstructions, there are extreme droughts and pluvials that exceed those during the instrumental period, including a sustained five-decade low-flow event in the early 19th century. Overall, we find that the traditional basin approach produced the most robust model but had the shortest reconstruction length of the three approaches, as it requires the predictor chronologies to be derived from within the basin. Our results indicate that there are merits and drawbacks to each approach with the general pattern of sacrificing variance explained for reconstruction length.

AB The quantitative estimation of the quick-flow runoff component of streamflow is required for many hydrologic applications. Estimation at the monthly timescale and national spatial scale would be particularly useful for national water availability modeling. This paper reviews a sample of commonly used equations for quick-flow runoff, including several currently in use in continental-scale models. The review shows the wide range of equation forms or heuristics currently in use to predict quick-flow runoff, the limited spatial scale over which these equations are often developed or calibrated, and the scarcity of well-tested equations available for quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale. Data were gathered from a set of 1301 gaged watersheds across the United States to test a range of equations from the literature, along with several alternative equations, to assess and compare their performance in predicting quick-flow runoff at the monthly timescale. The highest-performing equation was selected for application to monthly maps of explanatory variables to produce monthly quick-flow runoff water budget contribution maps. This equation is a regression against precipitation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, surficial geology type, and slope data. Its application indicates that average quick-flow runoff across the conterminous United States in the winter exceeds that in the summer by up to a factor of three. The monthly maps were explored and evaluated for the timespan of 2000-2015. The comparison of equation forms and produced monthly maps will be useful for a variety of hydrologic modeling and monitoring applications.

AB Streamflow data is important for studies of water resources and flood management, but an inherent problem is that many catchments of interest are ungauged. The lack of data is particularly the case for small catchments, where flow data with high temporal resolution is needed. This paper presents an analysis of regionalizing parameters of the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) rainfall-runoff model for predicting hourly flows at small-ungauged rural catchments. The performance of the model with hourly time resolution has been evaluated (calibrated and validated) for 41 small gauged catchments in Norway (areas from 1 km(2)-50 km(2)). The model parameters needing regionalization have been regionalized using three different methods: multiple regression, physical similarity (single-donor and pooling-group based methods), and a combination of the two methods. Seven independent catchments, which are not used in the evaluation, are used for validation of the regionalization methods. All the three methods (the multiple regression, pooling-group, and combined methods) perform satisfactorily (0.5 <= KGE < 0.75). The combined method (which combines multiple regression and pooling-group) performed slightly better than the other methods. Some model parameters, namely those describing recession characteristics, estimated by the regionalization methods, appear to be a better choice than those estimated locally from short period of hydro-meteorological data for some test catchments. The single donor method did not perform satisfactorily. The satisfactory performance of the combined method shows that regionalization of DDD model parameters is possible by combining multiple regression and physical similarity methods.

AB Understanding how the moisture content in a green roof substrate varies during a storm event is essential for accurately modelling runoff detention. In this paper, a green roof test bed installed with moisture probes at three depths was used to understand how moisture content varies during storms. Detailed studies were conducted on five selected storm events. Physical characterisation tests and field-data based calibrations were performed to acquire the model parameters. Two alternative detention models, based on Reservoir Routing and Richard's Equation, were validated against the measured green roof runoff and temporary moisture storage data. Once the moisture content exceeds local field capacity, its response at different depths occurs simultaneously during storms, although the recorded data indicate a vertical gradient in the absolute values of local field capacity. Both Reservoir Routing and Richard's Equation can provide reasonable estimations of the runoff and the vertical moisture content profiles, although Richard's Equation exhibited stronger vertical water content gradients than were observed in practise. The vertical water content profile is not sensitive to the soil water release curve, although the hydraulic conductivity function influences both the vertical water content profile and runoff rate. The modelled results are highly sensitive to the bottom boundary condition, with a constant suction head boundary condition providing a more suitable option than a free drainage boundary condition or a seepage boundary condition.

Pressure-based sensing is cost effective, suitable for real-time monitoring, and scalable to large monitoring networks. However, questions remain on how to best harness intelligent information from the high-frequency pressure monitoring sensors to support real-time decisions. This work presents a deep-learning-based framework for analyzing and detecting anomalies in pressure data streams by using a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network model, which allows for the fusion of both static and dynamic reservoir data. In ConvLSTM, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for spatial pattern mining and the LSTM is used for temporal pattern recognition. The performance of the ConvLSTM model for real-time anomaly detection is demonstrated using a set of pressure monitoring data collected from Cranfield, Mississippi, an active enhanced-oil-recovery field. The anomaly detection model is trained using bottom-hole pressure data acquired from the base experiment (without leak event) and then tested on pressure data collected during a series of controlled CO2 release experiments (with artificially created leak events). Results show that the ConvLSTM neural network model successfully detected anomalies in the pressure time series obtained from the controlled release experiments. Inclusion of static information into the model further improves the robustness of ConvLSTM.

AB The forecasting accuracy of downstream water levels greatly impacts the economic operation of reregulating hydropower stations. If present, large errors in water level forecasting may require the hydropower station to discard water, which decreases the revenue from hydropower generation. Especially when the reregulating hydropower station undertakes the task of peak load regulation of the power grid, its power output may change drastically over a short period of time. Such large changes in the discharged flow of the hydropower station may inevitably cause an unsteady flow, which can lead to large fluctuations in the water levels of downstream rivers. In this case, the current forecasting methods, such as standard rating curves and empirical formulae, may inevitably result in large deviations when forecasting the change in the downstream water level. In order to reduce the volume of water discarded as a result of forecasting errors, a back propagation neural network-based forecasting model for downstream water levels of a reregulating hydropower station was constructed. The model enabled the direct, accurate, real-time forecasting of changes in downstream water levels by using measurable operation data from a hydropower station and process data on downstream water level changes. This method was applied to the actual hydropower generation dispatch of the Gezhouba Hydropower Plant in China. The results showed that as the peak load regulation volume increased, the forecasting errors of two conventional methods (standard rating curves and empirical formulae) became continuously superimposed. However, the water level forecasting error of the neural network-based method was small and could fully meet the real-time dispatching requirements of the hydropower station. In particular, under large peak load regulations, the maximum absolute values of the forecasting errors of the two conventional methods were close to 1 m, while that of the neural network-based method could be controlled within 0.3 m.

ID GREYWATER REUSE
AB Population growth and climate change place a strain on water resources; hence, there are growing initiatives to reduce household water use. UKWIR (2016) have a stated aim to halve water abstraction by 2050. This will significantly reduce inflow to sewer systems and increase wastewater concentration. This work presents a new stochastic sewer model that can be used to predict both hydraulic and pollutant loading for various water saving scenarios. The stochastic sewer model is based on integration of the stochastic water demand model SIMDEUM (R) with the InfoWorks ICM (R) (Sewer Edition) hydraulic model and software. This model has been developed using foul sewer networks, i.e. where household discharges are the dominant inflow; however, it could also be used in combined sewage systems where rainwater flows would add to the stochastic dry weather flow (DWF). The stochastic sewer model was tested and validated on several real catchments in the Wessex Water area of the UK. Calibration was carried out using metered consumption data. The stochastic sewer model gives an accurate prediction of the diurnal patterns of sewage discharge at a household level and was validated using real flow measurements within the catchment. The results obtained indicate that this model can be used to accurately predict changes in flow due to water conservation. A preliminary study for the impact of low water use on this validated network model has been conducted and it was found that overnight and daytime flow was reduced by up to 80% whereas evening flows remained largely similar. Extended stagnation times were observed in the street scale pipes (150 mm) in the low water use scenario.

AB Parameters are usually assumed to be stationary, and regarded as constants in hydrological modelling. However, studies have shown that model parameters may vary temporally due to human activities, and climate variability and changes. This study proposes a framework for quantifying hydrological model parameters as functions of time-variant catchment properties, aiming to improve the capability of capturing hydrograph and the extra-polative ability of hydrological models under a changing environment. The framework includes four steps: (1) estimating model parameters by using an ensemble Kalman filter based on the observations; (2) analyzing correlations between estimated parameter values and catchment properties; (3) constructing a set of parameter functions based on the identified catchment properties and the proposed functional forms; and (4) selecting and testing the best-performed model. As a demonstration of the framework, the monthly water balance for Tongtianhe and Ganjiang basins in China with different climate are simulated using a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Results from the Tongtianhe Basin show that considering the time-variant evapotranspiration parameter (C) brings improvement in low flows when water storage capacity (SC) is treated as constant since there is no significant improvement in runoff simulation when SC is treated as a time-variant parameter. The application to Ganjiang Basin shows that reasonable improvements are achieved when both C and SC are treated as time-variant, especially in low and high flows. The presented framework provides a useful tool for estimating time-variant parameters of hydrological models, thereby leading to more reliable model predictions under a changing environment.

AB The objective of this paper was to evaluate a recently proposed comprehensive model for three-dimensional single-ring infiltration and its suitability for estimating soil hydraulic properties. Infiltration data from four different soils with contrasting characteristics were inverted to estimate field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-fs, values using a total of fourteen different scenarios. Those scenarios differed by: i) the way they constrained the macroscopic capillary length, lambda, and the initial and saturated soil water contents, theta(i) and theta(s), ii) the use of transient or steady-state data, and iii) the fitting methods applied to transient data. For comparative purposes, the SSBI method (Steady version of the Simplified method based on a Beerkan Infiltration run) was also applied. For validation purposes K-fs data estimated from the different scenarios were compared with those values obtained by numerical inverse modeling with HYDRUS-2D/3D. This comparison identified Approaches 1 and 3, which respectively estimate K-fs via optimization and using analytical expressions, as the most accurate methods. The steady-state scenario of Approach 4 and the SSBI method, both of which use a lambda value of first approximation, appeared preferable for field campaigns aimed to sample remote or large areas, given that they do not need additional data and still provide acceptable estimates. The reliability of K-fs data was also checked through a comparison with unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K-h, values measured in laboratory on extracted soil cores, in order to discriminate between theoretically possible (K-fs > K-h) and impossible (K-fs <= K-h) situations. Physically possible K-fs values were always obtained with the exception of the crusted soil, where K-fs < K-h situations suggested that the crust layer reduced water flow during ponding experiments in the field. The new comprehensive model tested in this study represents a valuable tool for analyzing both transient and steady-state infiltration data, as well as experiments carried out with different depths of ponded water, ring sizes and ring insertion depths.

AB Accurate spatiotemporal analysis of surface water is important for managing water resources. The main objectives of this study were: 1) to assess different remote sensing algorithms' ability to accurately determine flood extent using MODIS imagery, and 2) to study the temporal dynamics of inundated areas and corresponding return periods in a large catchment in New South Wales, Australia.
   The different water detection alternatives used included the Open Water Likelihood (OWL) algorithm, the Brakenridge algorithm for single images (BRAK) and composite images (BRAKC), the Islam methodology (ISL), a combination of Normalized Difference Indices (NDIS), and an ensemble of these. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used as a reference to benchmark the performance of the algorithms. Occurrence probability maps derived from inundation images and estimated flood extent frequency curves were compared against the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset of the Joint Research Centre.
   The ISL methodology indicated the best performance compared with "ground truth" inundated images derived from Landsat, while the temporal performance of the BRAK algorithm indicated significant noise based on daily imagery. The remaining approaches generally matched stream discharge peaks. Maximum cross-correlation coefficients between daily discharge and inundated areas were calculated for different time lags, indicating high spatial variability across the catchment. Accumulated rainfall accounted for up to 40 and 60% of the variation in inundation extent in daily and composite images, respectively. The ensemble technique outperformed the other algorithms to describe the dynamics of flooding, followed by the NDIS and ISL algorithms. The occurrence probability images and flood frequency curves indicated a higher inundation extent than the GSW product for return periods greater than two years, which can be explained by the different temporal resolutions. The results of this study can be applied in water resources planning and flood mitigation efforts.

ID REGIONAL LAND SUBSIDENCE; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL
AB Ground surface subsidence due to groundwater production is a significant problem. Many attempts have been made to develop analytical models to forecast subsidence rates as a consequence of groundwater production. Previous analytical solutions either make limiting assumptions about the stress regime (e.g., radially symmetric with uniaxial strain or radially symmetric with zero incremental vertical total stress) or assume that the pressure distribution within the aquifer is uniform. Imposing assumptions about the stress regime lead to an overestimate of subsidence. Imposing a uniform pressure assumption often leads to an underestimate of subsidence. In this article, the principle of superposition is applied to extend a previous analytical solution, for a cylindrical uniform pressure change, to allow for a non-uniform pressure distribution resulting from constant rate production of a viscous fluid from a cylindrical confined aquifer of finite permeability. Results from the analytical solution are verified by comparison with a set of fully coupled hydro-mechanical finite element simulations. The analytical solution for subsidence directly above the production well (or uplift above an injection well) can be written in closed-form and is straightforward to evaluate. The equation also shows that, for many practical purposes, ground surface subsidence is insensitive to production fluid viscosity and aquifer permeability when the aquifer radius is less than the aquifer depth below the ground surface.

TI Urban flood resilience - A multi-criteria index to integrate flood

AB Climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future. Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. This concern points to the resilience concept. By including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision-making, urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems. This study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextWe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience: the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time; the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses; and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state. Consequently, this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi-criteria index called Spatialized Urban Flood Resilience Index (S-FRESI). The S-FRESI composition (according to the resilience definition adopted) combines: the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility, to represent flood resistance mapped over time; the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation, considering the income variable; and the functional capacity of the drainage system, represented by the flood duration. S-FRESI can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. The index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the Dona Eugenia river catchment in Rio de Janeiro. Four different scenarios were formulated: (1) the current situation; (2) the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures; (3) a future situation with the same infrastructure as today; and (4) a future situation with the considered flood control measures.

TI Integrated modelling of a megacity water system - The application of a
   transdisciplinary approach to the Lima metropolitan area
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cross-impact-balance; Lima; Macro-modelling; Scenario development;
   Simulation; Water supply
AB The rapidly growing urban centres throughout the world are facing serious problems due to the fast changing developments in all of their environmental spheres (nature, society, politics, culture and economics). Therefore, strategic planning becomes even more important in order to develop strategies that allow cities to adapt to new challenges and to prevent or to mitigate negative trends. This paper presents a transdisciplinary approach to water management, which combines adaptation and application of methods from hydrology, social sciences, water engineering and modelling; furthermore, this approach also involves stakeholders in this process. This methodology assists cities in addressing risks by elaborating solutions, which are characterised by ownership and acceptance of the stakeholders involved. The presented methodology proposed here has been applied to the water system of the desert megacity of Lima/Peru. As a city of almost 10 million inhabitants and with an annual rainfall of about 10 mm per year, Lima presents a unique case with particular challenges regarding water supply. In order to assess the changes in precipitation and temperature for the next decades, two global circulation models and three scenarios have been used. Changes in discharge was addressed using the conceptual rainfall-runoff model HBV applied in both the Atlantic and Pacific catchments relevant to the capital city Lima in terms of water supply. A scenario methodology, combining qualitative and quantitative elements, based on the Cross Impact Balance Analysis, has been developed and applied. From the millions of theoretically possible combinations of future developments of "descriptors" (driving forces) of the water system, four have been identified as the (only) consistent potential developments of the future. Local stakeholders, stemming from a wide range of institutions have been actively involved in the definition of these driving forces and the set of scenarios. The evaluation of these scenarios and potential options to adapt the water system to future developments was carried out by modelling and simulation, using a purpose-built, yet general, simulator which represents the entire water and wastewater system and includes the important inherent feedback loops (e.g. water demand by irrigation, reuse of treated and untreated wastewaters). The setup of the simulator and the implemented models was done in a way that the simulator formed an integral element in the design of strategies and measures, derived by this innovative combination of qualitative scenario building, quantitative modelling and stakeholder participation. As a core result of this process, the Action Plan "Lima 2040" has been developed and adopted, in which the signatories (the main institutions and organisations responsible for the water sector of Lima) commit themselves to specific actions to be implemented over the years to come.

AB Access to safe drinking water is now recognized as a human right and a government priority at an international level. In modern megacities, where urban agglomerations progressively encroach on the fringes between cities and rural areas, a growing trend in developing countries, water access is an urgent concern. Like most of the world's megacities, the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region is marked by a dependence on water sources outside its borders. This paper describes and discusses the unequal distribution of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in this metropolitan area from a historical path-dependence perspective. Drawing upon the theoretical concept of the socio-technical system, it explores diachronically past, present, and future scenarios of WSS in the area. The conclusions stress the existence of socio-technical path-dependency and raise questions for future researches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With an ever-growing population of around 10 million inhabitants (officially 7.9 in 2013), Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is set to become one of the largest cities in South East Asia and already occupies a major economic role in the area. To accommodate the increasing population, the megacity now stretches out in an urban continuum covering more than 800 square kilometers and is currently growing at a rate of 3.2% per year. If the neighboring provinces around HCMC are included, the total population reaches nearly 18 million people.
   This paper attempts to describe the interplay between HCMC and flood-related risks and offer some guidelines to deal with inundations. The potential risks of flooding by rain, tsunami and/or dam failure upstream of the city are evaluated and contextualized within the perspective of climate and human induced environmental changes. The region is highly vulnerable to the combined effects of subsidence and rising sea levels and has already led to serious flooding that may extend spatially before the end of the century. We propose possible preventative solutions to urban flooding using a multi-pronged approach to issues regarding urban development and suggest a redevelopment strategy for major infrastructure projects.

AB Megacities are facing a twofold challenge regarding resources: (i) ensure their availability for a growing urban population and (ii) limit the impact of resource losses to the environment. This paper focuses on two essential resources - nitrogen and phosphorus - and challenges their sustainable management in the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity. An in-depth analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of Paris Megacity was conducted, originally centered on human metabolism through consumption and excretion of these two elements. Upstream, the whole agricultural production that feeds Paris Megacity was scrutinized and nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the agro-system were fully documented. Downstream, the analysis of solid waste and wastewater management in Paris Megacity showed the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the city.
   Paris Megacity appears to rely on a very complex and international agro-food system, requiring high levels of chemical fertilizers and strongly impacting the environment through nutrient environmental losses. On the other hand, solid waste and wastewater management appears to be mostly disconnected from the agro-food system: even if the release of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment has largely decreased in recent years, their recycling rate remains very low. This overview of the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity suggests that an optimal management of nitrogen and phosphorus in the three subsystems (agriculture, waste management and sanitation) should be integrated within a comprehensive approach linking agriculture and urban residues. This analysis thus constitutes a groundwork on which paradigm shift scenarios of the global water-agro-food system could be constructed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Groundwater dependency; Water supply; Coupled surface-groundwater
   modelling; Jakarta
AB An overview of the urban shallow groundwater dynamics in Jakarta is provided. The modifications to the water budget at the micro and mesoscale due to anthropogenic influences are described and the diffusive nature of the interaction analysed. The scale of urbanisation (>10 million residents) in conjunction with the lack of infrastructure for water-related services is seen to have fostered a dependency on the shallow groundwater resources and, in turn, led to a tangible impact on the groundwater domain, which is difficult to quantify and study. Using short duration yet high temporal resolution groundwater level data collected at an urban site within Jakarta, two metrics are developed that can describe the daily variation in groundwater levels driven by the human interaction. Numerical models of varying complexity for the urban shallow groundwater dynamics are then used. Here, by employing a process of gradually improving the model's physical description while performing parameter estimation based on the new metrics, the study provides evidence of the role of the unsaturated zone in influencing the urban shallow groundwater dynamics. We further identify Jakarta's wastewater seepage as the crucial yet overlooked component of the urban cycle, having direct implications for the region's water security. The innovation of this study lies at the combination of high temporal resolution data with flexible modelling frameworks that can be developed to give insights into rapidly growing, unstructured stressors on water resources in data poor Mega Cities from the developing world.

DE Water in mega-cities; Modular-tray green roof systems; Hydrological
   performance of green roofs; CN (Curve Number); C (Coefficient of Runoff)
AB This paper investigates the performance of modular-tray green roof systems on rainwater retention and total runoff delay under heavy rain conditions, typical of countries with a tropical climate. It involved the building of a rain-spray system simulator and worktops to support the experimental units. Three green roof modular-tray systems were studied, M-4L, M-17L and F-17L, with a mix of succulent plant species. The volume and delay of total runoff were sampled for both dry and wet soil-moisture stages for a simulated rainstorm of 155 mm/h and duration of 7 min, which approaches the value of the design rainfall of 10-year return-period and an observed rainfall event that caused flooding in 2011 in the area where the experiments took place. These results were compared to three bare-soil similar experimental units and with a control unit consisting of a corrugated fibre-cement roof sheet. In addition, classic rainfall runoff parameterization, also important for catchment analysis, such as the rational coefficient method (C) and Curve Number (CN) were also applied. The results showed to be consistent. Overall, module F-17L presented the best performance with regard to both water retention and delay of total runoff. The average percentage of retention, considering all module types, was 58% of the total induced water volume, and the average delay for total runoff was approximately 12 min. In some tests, for the wet soil stage, the bare soil units performed better than the vegetated units. Soil moisture analysis revealed that considering the same period of time, the bare soil units lost more water through evaporation than the vegetated units through evapotranspiration. The average values of C for vegetated units for the wet and dry soil stages were equal to 0.66 and 0.27, respectively. The CN values were high, ranging from 88 to 97. Although fairly new on the market in Rio de Janeiro, modular-tray green roof systems are easy to build and hydrologically effective, mainly in the dry soil stages, performing as well as other extensive green roof systems. The values obtained for C and CN may be useful for the modelling of catchment rainfall and runoff especially for scenarios involving green roofs, as well as for establishing regulatory benchmarks towards more resilient and sustainable cities.

AB Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates.

TI Cities as hotspots of indirect water consumption: The case study of Hong

   RESOURCES; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; ENERGY
AB During the last years, the city of Hong Kong has made large investments to make its urban water supply system more water efficient and sustainable. As such, its municipal water abstraction - often defined as direct water use - has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day (l/cap/d) in 2005 to 326 l/cap/d in 2013. Due to its political history, Hong Kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption. It is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use. The objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of Hong Kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use. The current average diet in Hong Kong is very different to the average Chinese diet. It is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar, leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint (WFcons) of 4727 l/cap/d. According to recommendations from the Chinese Nutrition Society for a healthy diet, the intake of some product groups should be increased (vegetables and fruit) and of other product groups reduced (sugar, crop oils, meat and animal fats). This would result in a reduction of the WFcons of 40% to 2852 l/cap/d. Especially the reduced intake of meat (including offals) from currently 126 kg per capita per year (kg/cap/yr) to the recommended value 27 kg/cap/yr would results in a substantial WFcons reduction. Meat consumption in Hong Kong is extremely high. A pesco-vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49% (to 2398 l/cap/d) and a vegetarian diet in a 53% (to 2224 l/cap/d) reduction. Hong Kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet. Many of the products consumed, contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin Hong Kong imports from. This poses a water-related risk to food security in Hong Kong. As all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue WFcons, they decrease this risk. In order to become sustainable, (mega)cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems.

ID WASTE-WATER; RECYCLED WATER; URBAN; SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; CONTEXT;
   LESSONS; POLICY
AB Ageing water infrastructure and population growth, issues that are characteristic of megacities, are likely to exacerbate water supply deficits in London. To address this threat, wastewater reclamation and non potable reuse can potentially close the supply-demand gap without impacting on environmental water bodies. There is a need to understand the types of challenges that diverse stakeholders face in relation to the governance of NPR schemes, and how those challenges might be addressed in a megacity context. A case study is used to explore these challenges for an operational sewer mining scheme in London, where reclaimed non-potable water is used for irrigation and toilet flushing at the site of the London 2012 Olympic Park. Through qualitative analysis of interview and document data, the results highlight that collaboration and learning opportunities are perceived as necessary to improve scheme governance. The findings indicate that formal and informal engagement activities centred on risk management can support the development of common understandings, build important inter-stakeholder relationships and help maintain trust. Non-potable reuse can contribute to the resilience of megacities through infrastructure diversification, but its feasibility will depend on the willingness of stakeholders to participate and continually negotiate new risk management practices.

ID COPRODUCTION
AB With an estimated 10.6 million inhabitants in 2015 and an average 6.6% annual growth rate, Kinshasa ranks among the three largest cities in Africa and may well become the most populated. To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In 2016 suspected reduced ivermectin (IVM) efficacy in Oesophagostomum species in pigs was reported in England. Following this initial report, APHA raised awareness amongst private pig veterinary practitioners of the need to monitor the efficacy of the worm control on pig units. In 2017 another veterinary practitioner highlighted a potential in-field lack of IVM efficacy in treating Oesophagostomum species in sows on another breeder finisher unit. In this trial, the efficacy of IVM against Oesophagostomum species worms has been investigated to determine whether suspected reduced efficacy (52% reduction in mean faecal egg count 14 days post ivermectin administration) on a mixed indoor and outdoor breeder-finisher pig farm in England reflected true IVM resistance under controlled experimental conditions. On days 0 and 40 of the trial, twenty helminth-naive pigs were artificially infected per os with 5000 Oesophagostomum L3 obtained from the farm under investigation. The pigs were allocated to treatment or control groups (n = 10 per group). Treatment group pigs received IVM (0.3 mg kg body weight) by sub-cutaneous injection as per manufacturer's instructions on day 44. Control group animals were left untreated. Faecal worm egg counts were monitored throughout the trial from day 15 post infection to determine time to patency. On day 50 all pigs were euthanased to assess the worm burdens. Resistance to IVM was confirmed in Oesophagostomum dentatum based on the results of a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and a controlled efficacy test (CET). Efficacy based on mean reduction in faecal egg count of IVM-treated pigs compared to untreated control pigs was 86%. Mean reduction in IVM-treated pig worm burdens was 5% against an adult worm population and 94% against an L3/L4 population. The apparent discrepancy between FECRT and CET efficacy results appears to be due to egg development and/or oviposition suppression in IVM-treated female worms. The detection of IVM resistance in Oesophagostomum species worms for the first time in UK pigs is particularly important considering the global situation where resistance to pyrantel, levamisole and benzimidazole anthelmintics in Oesophagostomum species in pigs have already been reported. The results also provide an opportunity to discuss the wider issue of anthelmintic usage and efficacy on pig farms and highlight the need for wider surveillance for the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in pigs.

AB This study investigated the impact of variability in Parascaris spp. and strongyle faecal egg counts (FEC) from foals on treatment decision-making and detection of a patent infection. A single faecal sample was collected once daily for three days from 53 foals and a FEC was performed on three separate portions of each sample (total of nine egg counts per foal). Differences in the decision to administer an anthelmintic using the results of a single count (C-1), the mean of three ((X) over bar (1-3)) or nine counts ((X) over bar (1-9)) and the upper 5% confidence limit of the gamma confidence interval (CI) of the estimate of the distribution mean (mu) from three (UCL1-3) and nine counts (UCL1-9) were determined for a range of egg count thresholds. The UCL1-9 was used as the best estimate of p, hypothesis testing for treatment and the comparison of treatment decision-making using C-1,(X) over bar (1-3), (X) over bar (1-9) and UCL1-3. The results of this study demonstrated that a point estimate (C-1 or (X) over bar (1-3)) was of limited value for estimating the distribution mean of egg counts in faeces and there was overall poor agreement in treatment decision-making for individual foals using C-1 compared with UCL1-9. Of the foals with C-1 of zero eggs per gram, 54% and 47% had Parascaris and strongyle eggs in subsequent counts, respectively. The egg density in faeces is inhomogeneous, resulting in considerable variability in egg count results for an individual foal: between faecal piles, different portions of a faecal pile and days. The use of the negative binomial distribution CI for p takes this variability into account and is recommended for use when interpreting FEC data from horses.

AB Small ruminants browsing in tropical forests readily consume the foliage of Senegalia gaumeri. A S. gaumeri methanol:water extract was recently shown to have ovicidal activity against Haemonchus contortus eggs in vitro. In the present study, the fraction of a S. gaumeri methanol:water extract with ovicidal activity against H. contortus eggs and the metabolites potentially involved in this activity were identified. Bio-guided fractionation of the S. gaumeri methanol:water extract identified high ovicidal activity (80.29%, EC50 = 58.9 pg/mL) in the non-polar sub-fraction P1. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified several fatty acids: pentacosane (18.05%), heneicosane (18.05%), triacontane (30.94%), octacosane (18.05%), and hexanedioic acid bis-(2ethylhexyl) ester (32.72%). Purification of the polar components of sub-fraction P1 led to the identification of pcoumaric acid as a major constituent. In egg hatch tests, 400 mu g/mLp-coumaric acid resulted in an ovicidal effect of 8.7%, a larvae failing eclosion effect of 2.9%, and of the emerged larvae (88.4%), many were damaged. In conclusion, the low AH activity of p-coumaric acid against H. contortus eggs indicates that it is not solely responsible for the ovicidal activity of sub-fraction P1 but might act in synergy with other compounds in this fraction. However, p-coumaric acid showed potential anthelmintic effects against the larval stage of H. contortus.

AB Neosporosis is a common cause of abortion in cattle worldwide but is rare in horses. Here, the first case of histologically, ultrastructurally, immunohistochemically, and molecularly confirmed equine abortion caused by neosporosis is reported. Samples of lung, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, tongue, brain, and the placenta from a female fetus aborted at 280 days of gestation were fixed in formalin and submitted for diagnosis. Histologically, there was disseminated neosporosis with severe lesions in lungs, liver and the heart. Protozoal tachyzoites in all tissues reacted with polyclonal anti-Neospora caninum rabbit antibodies. Transmission electron microscopic observation on lung tissue revealed tachyzoites consistent with Neospora, including many rhoptries. Polymerasechain reaction (PCR) using primers designed to amplify the rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of the Sarcocystidae was performed on DNA extracted from fetal tissues. Comparison of the ITS1 amplified from the foal tissue to sequences available in GenBank revealed 100% sequence identity to the ITS1 from three isolates of Neospora hughesi.

AB This study evaluated the in vitro anthelmintic (AH) activity of cinnamic acid and six analogues against eggs and larvae of Haemonchus contortus. Stock solutions of each compound (trans-cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, trans-ferulic acid, trans-sinapic acid, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, and chlorogenic acid) were prepared in PBS:Tween-20 (1%) for use in the egg hatch test (EHT) and larval exsheathment inhibition test (LEIT) at different concentrations (25-400 mu g/mL). The respective effective concentration 50% (ECso) values with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Mixtures made of all cinnamic acid and its analogues as well as some selected individual compounds were also tested in the EHT. Only ferulic and chlorogenic acids showed AH activity in the EHT (EC50: 245.2 mu g/mL (1.26 mM) and 520.8 mu g/mL (1.47 mM), respectively) (P < 0.05). A higher EC50 (1628.10 mu g/mL) of the mixture of cinnamic acid and its analogues was required to observe activity against eggs mostly blocking the larvae hatching. The analogues' mixtures tested were less active than ferulic or chlorogenic acid alone. The activity of ferulic and chlorogenic acids against eggs was associated with larvae failing to hatch, and the two compounds exhibited antagonistic effects when evaluated together. All standards had an ECso lower than 0.42 mM in the LEIT. Caffeic acid had the best activity in the LEIT (EC50 0.04 mM), followed by ferulic acid (EC50 0.11 mM) (P < 0.05). There was no clear, definitive structure-activity relationship for these non-flavonoid polyphenols against eggs or larvae of H. contortus in vitro. This study is the first to directly evaluate cinnamic acid and its derivatives as active compounds against eggs and larvae of H. contortus.

AB Breeding for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in sheep relies largely on the use of worm egg counts (WEC) to identify animals that are able to resist infection. As an alternative to such measures of parasite load we aimed to develop a method to identify animals showing resistance to GIN infection based on the impact of the infection on blood parameters. We hypothesized that blood parameters may provide a measure of infection level with a blood-feeding parasite through perturbation of red blood cell parameters due to feeding behaviour of the parasite, and white blood cell parameters through the mounting of an immune response in the host animal. We measured a set of blood parameters in 390 sheep that had been exposed to an artificial regime of repeated challenges with Trichostrongylus colubriforrnis followed by Haemonchus contortus. A simple analysis revealed strong relationships between single blood parameters and WECs with correlation coefficients 0.54 to 0.60. We then used more complex multi-variate methods based on supervised classifier models (including Bayesian Network) as well as regression models (Lasso and Elastic Net) to study the relationships between WECs and blood parameters, and derived algorithms describing the relationships. The ability of these algorithms to classify sheep GIN resistance status was tested using the WEC and blood parameters collected from a different group of 418 sheep that had acquired natural infections of H. contortus from pasture. We identified the most resistant and most susceptible animals (10% percentiles) of this group based on WECs, and then compared the identities of these animals to the identities of animals that were predicted to be most resistant and most susceptible by our algorithms. The models showed varying abilities to predict susceptible and resistant sheep, with up to 65% of the most susceptible animals and 30% of the most resistant animals identified by the Elastic Net model algorithms. The prediction algorithms derived from female sheep data performed better than those for male sheep in some cases, with the predicted animals accounting for up to 50-60% of the actual resistant and susceptible female animals. Heritability values were calculated for blood parameters and the aggregate trait descriptions defined by the novel prediction algorithms. The aggregate trait descriptions were moderately heritable and may therefore be suitable for use in genetic selection strategies. The present study indicates that multivariate models based on blood parameter data showed some ability to predict the resistance status of sheep to infection with H. contortus.

AB Parasitic nematodes pose a major threat to livestock production worldwide. The blood-feeding parasite Haemonchus contortus is a key small-ruminant pathogen that causes anaemia, and thereby seriously impacts animal health and production. Control of this parasite relies largely upon broad-spectrum anthelmintics, but new drugs are urgently needed to combat the threat of widespread multidrug resistance. Repurposing drugs can accelerate the development pipeline by reducing costs and risks, and can be an effective way of quickly bringing new antiparasitic drugs to market. Diarylamidine compounds such as pentamidine and diminazene have been employed in the treatment of trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis in both human and veterinary settings, but their activity against parasitic worms has not yet been reported. We screened a small panel of diarylamidine compounds against H. contortus to assess their potential to be repurposed as anthelmintic drugs. Pentamidine and diminazene inhibited H. contortus larval development at low micromolar concentrations (IC50 4.9 mu M and 16.1 mu M, respectively, in a drug-susceptible isolate) with no existing cross-resistance in two multidrug resistant isolates and a monepantel-resistant isolate. Combinations of pentamidine with commercial anthelmintics showed additive activity, with no significant synergism detected. Pentamidine and diminazene showed different life-stage patterns of activity; both were active against early stage larvae in development assays, but only diminazene was active against the infective L3 stage in migration assays. This suggests some differences in uptake of the two drugs across the nematode cuticle, or differences in the nature and expression patterns of their molecular targets. As pentamidine and diminazene have been reported to be potent inhibitors of mammalian acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC), we tested the activity of known ASIC inhibitors against H. contortus to probe whether these channels may represent potential anthelmintic targets in nematodes. Remarkably, the spider venom peptide Hila, a potent inhibitor of ASICla, inhibited H. contortus larval development with an IC50 of 22.9 1.9 mu M. This study highlights the potential use of diarylamidines as anthelmintics, although their activity needs to be confirmed in vivo. In addition, our demonstration that ASIC inhibitors have anthelmintic activity raises the possibility that this family of ion channels may represent a novel anthelmintic target.

AB Variation in the timing of development of immunity to gastro-intestinal nematode parasites was assessed in resistant and resilient Romney selection lines exposed to mixed natural infection. From weaning, at mean 92 days-of-age, animals (n = 53) were sampled for faecal egg count (FEC) expressed as eggs per gram of faeces (epg), saliva for immunoglobulin (IgG and IgA) determination and fasted live weight (LW) every 10 days until 351 days-of-age. Overall, mean back-transformed FEC were consistently low for resistant animals (< 200 epg) whereas resilient counterparts' FEC increased with time to reach a peak of 1400 epg at day 230 for females and 1800 epg for males at day 280 before declining to less than 500 epg by day 300, respectively (P < 0.001). Resistant lambs reached a threshold for Trichoscrongylus colubriformis L3-specific IgG which was indicative of the presence of immunity earlier at 220.6 +/- 8.8 days-of-age compared with resilient-line animals which reach this threshold 40 days later at 263.4 +/- 6.9 days-of-age (P < 0.001). In addition, resistant females reached sexual maturity earlier compared with their resilient counterparts viz. 263.5 +/- 3.7 c.f. 274.4 +/- 3.4 days-of-age, respectively, (P = 0.048). Mean fasted live weight (LW) showed a selection line by time interaction (P < 0.001) which reflected greater LW in the early phase of the study in resilient males but increasing for all groups until day 280 before declining and being similar for all groups from day 330. In summary, differences appear to exist in the timing of immune development between these Romney lines, with resistant animals developing immunity earlier and these resistant-line animals also appear to be more physiologically mature at the same chronological age than resilient animals. These observations have implications on the timing of identification and selection of resistant animals.

AB Three controlled studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy of selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution (R) Plus/Stronghold (R) Plus) in preventing feline heartworm disease in cats. In all studies, cats were inoculated with 100 Dirofilaria immitis third stage larvae on Day -30. In the first study, cats were treated with selamectin plus sarolaner as a single dose on Day 0 or as three consecutive monthly doses on Days 0, 28 and 56. In the second and third studies, cats were treated with either sarolaner alone on Day 0, selamectin plus sarolaner on Day 0 or selamectin plus sarolaner as three consecutive monthly doses on Days 0, 28 and 56. In all three studies, dosages were 6 mg/kg selamectin plus 1 mg/kg sarolaner or 1 mg/kg sarolaner alone. Control cats were given a placebo containing inert formulation ingredients (vehicle). All treatments were administered at a single site topically to the skin cranial to the scapulae. Cats were humanely euthanized on Day 145/146 (i.e., 175/176 post-inoculation), and adult D. immitis worms were recovered and enumerated. Across the three studies, adult heartworms were recovered from 87 to 100% of control cats, with geometric mean worm counts ranging from 2.1 to 5.4. No adult D. immitis worms were recovered from cats treated with selamectin plus sarolaner. Cats treated with sarolaner alone were not protected against D. immitis infection, showing geometric mean worm counts of 1.9 to 2.4. In these studies, selamectin (6 mg/kg) plus sarolaner (1 mg/kg) was 100% effective in preventing heart worm development in cats when administered topically as one dose 30 days after inoculation or as three consecutive monthly doses starting 30 days post-inoculation. These studies demonstrated that a single topical administration of selamectin plus sarolaner at the recommended dosage was completely effective in preventing the development of D. immitis in cats.

AB Wurtzite ZnO nanoparticles have been coated by anatase phase TiO2 layers using a chemical co-precipitation technique to synthesize heterogeneous ZnO-TiO2 core-shell nanostructures. The structural characterizations of as-prepared core-shell nanoparticles have been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EDX). Linear optical studies have been performed using photo-luminescence (PL) emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. A blue shift towards shorter wavelengths has been observed in the NBE-related energies of core-shell samples as compared to blank ZnO core. Nonlinear optical parameters have been examined using the Z-scan technique under a 532 nm Gaussian laser beam with 10 ns short pulse width and 200 Hz repetition rate as an excitation source. All samples have exhibited a negative value of nonlinear refraction index and also reverse saturable absorption due to two-photon absorption phenomenon. The results of Z-scan analysis have revealed the stronger third-order nonlinearities for core-shell nanoheterojunctions compared to blank ZnO nanoparticles. The estimated values of the third-order susceptibility have exhibited measures up to the highest magnitude of 8.10 x 10(-4) esu belonging to ZnO-TiO2-1 sample, which shows an enhancement about four times higher than that of blank ZnO.

TI The enhancement of near-band-edge emission by hydrogen plasma treatment

DT Article

ID OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE
AB Hydrogen (H) plasma treatment has been used to improve the optical properties of ZnO-based materials. Giant 83-fold and 105-fold enhancement ratios of near-band-edge (NBE) emission are obtained in H-plasma treated ZnO and ZnMgO films, respectively, while a relatively small 8.6-fold enhancement ratio occurs to Ga-doped ZnO film. The NBE enhancement is partly attributed to the introduction of additional radiative recombination centers through H-plasma treatment. In addition, the passivation of nonradiative recombination centers by H accounts for partial NBE enhancement. The pronounced NBE enhancement differences among ZnO, ZnMgO and Ga-doped ZnO films can be illustrated as follows: on one hand, Ga ion with positive trivalence is more repulsive to H ion with positive univalency compared with Zn and Mg ions, resulting in the decrease of the concentration of H in Ga-doped ZnO film; on the other hand, the passivation of nonradiative recombination centers by H is more prominent in ZnMgO due to the poorer quality of ZnMgO.

AB This work analyzes the photoluminescence emission of Yb3+ and Tb3+ ions in co-doped silicon oxycarbide thin films, their activation by thermal treatment, and reveals their luminescent properties regarding the energy transfer between them. Three samples of silicon oxycarbide were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering from SiC, Yb and Tb targets in an oxygen/argon atmosphere. The first one is the undoped silicon oxycarbide sample, the second one is Tb single doped, and the last one is the Yb-Tb co-doped sample. All three samples are identified as silicon oxycarbides with a low carbon content using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The latter shows the presence of the vibrational modes of Si-C and Si-O bonds. Subsequent annealing treatments up to temperatures of 750 degrees C led to the rare earths optical activation in the samples. For each annealing step, we present the photoluminescence spectra using an above-bandgap excitation of 325 nm. The Tb3+ and Yb3+ -related luminescence lines were identified. The Yb3+ ions luminescence for the co-doped sample shows concentration quenching above annealing temperatures of 500 degrees C whereas the Tb3+ ions luminescence intensity remains almost constant. The analysis of the photoluminescence excitation spectra shows the direct excitation of the Tb3+ ions in the Tb-doped samples. A high suppression of the direct excitation of the Tb3+ ions in the Yb-Tb co-doped samples was observed. The energy transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+ ions in co-doped samples is evidenced, first, by the decrease of the Tb3+ photoluminescence intensity in the co-doped compared to the Tb doped sample. Second, a change from nearly single exponential to nonexponential decay in the Tb3+ photoluminescence decay curves and third, by the reduction of the Tb3+ decay time from 1.2 ms in the Tb-doped sample to 0.5 ms in the Yb-Tb co-doped sample.

AB In this work, an Ag nanoparticle colloidal suspension flowing in the form of a thin jet (250 mu m) is irradiated by 150 femtosecond, 800 nm laser pulses to form a plasma which emits bremsstrahlung X-rays of up to 100 keV energy. The flowing jet ensures long-term durability of the plasma source during continuous laser irradiation. The laser pulse is p-polarized and the angle of incidence is normal to the jet surface, to optimize resonance absorption of laser radiation by the plasma electron density gradient. A 30-fold enhancement is observed in the X-ray yield in the nanoparticle suspension, compared to the precursor salt solution. This is because of the local field enhancement (LFE) associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in Ag nanoparticles. Multiphoton ionization will be greatly enhanced in the presence of LFE, resulting in the generation of a relatively larger number of free electrons, which become "hot" electrons of high kinetic energy by resonance absorption. Bremsstrahlung in the X-ray regime occurs due to the deceleration of these hot electrons. Under identical excitation conditions the corresponding X-ray enhancement measured in Au nanoparticles is relatively lower at 18-fold. This decrease is due to the higher ionization potential of Au (9.22 eV) as compared to Ag (7.58 eV). On the other hand, absorption spectra and SEM images measured after continuous irradiation reveal that Au nanoparticles are more photostable compared to Ag nanoparticles. These studies show that Ag nanoparticles are better suited for X-ray generation compared to Au nanoparticles under the experimental conditions employed. Applications include dynamics studies, microscopy, and lithography.

AB A flagship application of miniaturized chemical optical (CO) sensors is the real-time monitoring of cell cultures in the biomedical field. Most of these devices are based on fluorescence variations when a fluorophore encapsulated in the sensor is brought into contact with an analyte. In this context, micro-structured architectures involving light coupling between a channel waveguide and diffraction gratings appear a promising way to propose integrated devices with enhanced detection sensitivity. In this paper, we report for the first time on such micro-structured architecture entirely elaborated through a sol-gel route. This work particularly highlights the potential of a high refractive index titanium oxide based sol-gel photoresist that can be imprinted through a single photolithography step (selective insolation/development) to form a given pattern, thus avoiding multi-step and rather costly traditional lithographic procedures. We firstly present a simplified two-step process taking advantage of this photoresist and leading to micro-structured architectures composed of diffraction gratings imprinted on channel waveguides. Both components of these architectures have been optimized on the basis of opto-geometrical characterizations and modeling. Then channel waveguide/diffraction grating coupling assessments are presented and discussed, showing that light coupling can effectively be achieved in the sol-gel architectures. This work constitutes a first step that opens the route to new CO sensors in channel waveguide configuration.

AB We report on the photoluminescence, long persistence luminescence, and thermally and optically stimulated luminescence properties of SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ and SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+ phosphors synthetized by the combustion method and annealed under a carbon atmosphere at 1150 degrees C for 6 h. XRD indicated the presence of a single monoclinic crystalline phase for both phosphors. After exposure to beta radiation, the phosphors exhibited an intense persistent luminescence lasting more than 220 h. After excitation with 375 nm light the emission spectra depict a broad band peaked at 515 nm, which is the characteristic for Eu2+ emission in SrAl2O4 phosphors, and two weak bands at about 405 and 425 nm. After beta irradiation, the Dy co-doped phosphor exhibits an intense thermoluminescence (TL) with a maximum around 60 degrees C and a weaker peak at 140 degrees C. The low temperature TL of the Nd co-doped phosphor consist of three peaks; two well-separated peaks with maxima at about 80 and 160 degrees C and the third one with the maximum near 50 degrees C, which becomes evident at doses higher than 10 Gy. Stimulation with IR light of 830 nm releases trapped charges caused by irradiation exposure, generating an intense IR stimulated luminescence (IRSL), which exhibits a typical time decay behavior for continuous wave optically stimulated luminescence. The persistence luminescence and IRSL were related to the release of electrons from the traps responsible for the 60 and 140 degrees C TL peaks in SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ and the 80 and 160 degrees C TL peaks in SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+ phosphors, respectively.

AB For highly sensitive and selective detection of ClO- over other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and anions, a fluorescent probe MN-BODIPY by introducing a morpholine group into the 8-position of BODIPY which could be used for targeting lysosome and improving water solubility was designed and synthesized. As a result of the C=N isomerization mechanism at 2-position of BODIPY, the probe alone generated extremely weak fluorescence. However, in the presence of ClO-, the probe exhibited a dramatic enhancement of fluorescence intensity by a 29-fold increase at 530 nm accompanying with quantum yield changing from 0.03 to 0.25. Accordingly, the probe displayed fast response for ClO- within 60s. The limit of detection (LOD) for ClO- was calculated as 16.5 nM from the titration experiments, which is lower than most previously reported ClO--selective probes. Moreover, MN-BODIPY had been successfully employed for monitoring exogenous and endogenous hypochlorous in MCF-7 cells with satisfying results, perhaps it was feasible for detecting abnormal contents of hypochlorous in a biological system and accomplished the goal of maintaining normal human activities. At last, the fluorescence imaging showed that MN-BODIPY was capable of localizing lysosomes in living cells.

AB Recent progress in halide perovskite solar cells exceeding 20% efficiency is remarkable. However, the understanding of device operation based on reasonable device model and physical parameters is not sufficient. In this study, experimental current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a 20%-efficient perovskite solar cell with mixed halide of I and Br in a literature were numerically reproduced by a device simulator called Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS), where device parameters extracted by fitting experimental J-V and EQE curves were used. It is demonstrated that the simulated EQE curve was not matched with the experimental one under the assumption of uniform band gap energy (E-g) resulting from a constant Br content throughout the perovskite absorber. On the other hand, the experimental J-V and EQE curves were reasonably reproduced by the simulation under the assumption of single-graded E-g of the absorber, resulting from the graded Br content. Moreover, the perovskite solar cell with E-g-grading absorber has theoretically showed higher open-circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency (PCE) than those with uniform E-g. The results are useful to not only improve the understanding of device operation but also indicate possibility of the further improvement of PCE using E-g-grading perovskite absorber.

AB Synthesis of the bulk Li1+xMn2O4 (0 <= x <= 1) was simulated by using molecular dynamics approach, from amorphous precursors where crystallisation was confirmed by the sharpness of the radial distribution functions. The resulting structures in the range Li1+xMn2O4 (0 <= x <= 0.5) and Li2.00Mn2O4 appear to be highly crystalline. On the contrary Li1.75Mn2O4 is predicted as an intermediate multi-grained phase. Furthermore, the simulated XRDs of the latter have extensive peak broadening, whereas at lower and highest Li concentration the XRD peaks are narrow. The results are explained in terms of a transition from cubic to tetragonal spinel phases with enhanced Li content. Lastly, the XRDs suggest the evolution of composite or heterostructured bulk Li1+xMn2O4 during simulated synthesis which is modified by the discharge process.

AB Tetragonal-structured colloidal spheres of Y/Eu binary and Y/Tb/Eu ternary phosphate hydrates have been successfully synthesized via microwave-assisted homogeneous precipitation, and the effects of hydrate water on crystal structure and luminescent behavior were investigated by detailed characterizations of XRD, Raman, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, STEM, PLE/PL spectroscopy, and fluorescence decay analysis. Decreasing the hydrate water induced more PO43- shifting from symmetric stretching vibration to anti-symmetric one, along with lattice expansion. Dehydration leads to a blue shift of the maximum band centre in the PLE spectra of Y/Eu binary phosphate. Both the hydrate and anhydrous spheres of Y/Tb/Eu ternary phosphates exhibited color-tunable emissions from green to red by increasing the Eu content. However, stronger quenching effect of hydrate water on Eu3+ transition than that on Tb3+ one takes place, and the emission at longer wavelength, especially for the near-infrared region, is significantly affected by the hydrate water. The hydrate water did not significantly affect the Tb3+-> Eu3+ energy transfer efficiency, but it could shorten the lifetimes.

AB The three reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based precursors subsuming pristine rGO, rGO-g-poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and rGO-g-poly(3-thiophene ethanol) (PTEt) were utilized to manipulate the optical, morphological, and electrical properties of perovskite solar cells. Via incorporation of rGO nanosheets, all device characteristics plummeted (13.65 rnA/cm(2), 63%, and 0.93 V) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) dropped to 8.00% (from 11.10%), indicating that the bared rGO precursors were not capable of modifying the active layer. The grafting of rGO surface with polymeric backbones effectively improved the cell parameters via enabling the rGO nanosheets to control the morphology, ordering, and absorbance. In particular, the self-designed grafts such as regioregular P3HT chains further improved the morphological and photovoltaic characteristics. The P3HT-grafted rGO precursors resulted in a PCE of 15.15% (22.15 mA/cm(2), 72%, 0.95 V), which was higher than efficiency ( = 13.91%) recorded in CH3NH3PbI3 + rGO-g-PTEt systems (20.63 mA/cm(2), 71%, 0.95 V), thanks to more intensified crystalline peaks, higher absorbance, larger grain sizes (averaged in 570 nm and peaked in 750 nm) and lower charge-transfer resistance (93.2 versus 109.4 Omega). As a fingerprint of high reproducibility, the distributions of photovoltaic features were also the narrowest in the rGO-g-P3HT based perovskite solar cells.

AB A light extraction structure and a flexible electrode have been developed to enhance the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of flexible organic light-emitting diodes (FOLEDs). However, these structures are still influenced by optical losses, poor electrical stability, and low throughput, and are not suitable to be adopted into FOLEDs due to the surface roughness problem, low flexibility/adhesion, complicated process, and high temperature/ pressure process. Here, to solve these problems, we demonstrate embedded Ag nanowires (AgNWs) in flexible substrate and highly flexible random nano pattern via easy/low-cost solution form process at atmospheric pressure and low temperature without any additional material. This study demonstrates an internal and external light extraction structure composed of double-sided nano-dimpled substrate PVB (DndP), which is directly fabricated on both sides of a flexible substrate (polyvinyl butyral, PVB) only in itself without additional material via the easy/low-cost transferring process using the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template by an anodization process-based solution form at atmospheric pressure and low temperature. Therefore, because the DndP and the substrate are composed of the same material, PVB, there is no light loss between their interfaces. In addition, a high-refractive-index TiO2 nanoparticle, for the scattering effect, and AgNWs, for electrode flexibility, are embedded into the DndP via the covering method using the solution form. Such structures exhibit extraordinary mechanical flexibility due to the AgNWs embedded in the PVB substrate. Therefore, FOLEDs using such structures can be well adapted to flexible/rollable/foldable displays and wearable application devices. Moreover, the corrugated surface of FOLEDs by such structures can improve the current flow through increased surface area of electrodes and extract the trapped light through the scattering effect (Rayleigh, Mie), reducing the total reflection and coupled photon in metal/dielectric. In addition, the FOLEDs with such structures show color/ spectrum-stable property and independence of viewing angles owing to their random nature. The final green FOLEDs with DndP, embedded scattering TiO2 nanoparticle, and embedded AgNWs&PEDOT:PSS demonstrate an outstanding EL efficiency enhancement ratio of 2.23 time via internal and external light extraction without electrical short.

Stable Q-switched pulses can be obtained. At the pump power of 12 W, a shortest pulse width of 550 ns and a pulse repetition rate of 97 kHz can be observed by a digital oscilloscope, corresponding to maximum pulse energy of 5.55 mu J and pulse peak power of 10.1 W. The results promote the promising applications of WS2-SA in all-solid-state laser at 1.3 mu m.

AB Four new D-pi-A-pi-D hybrid dyes containing coumarin as a major donor (4a-b and 5a-b) together with carbazole and triphenylamine as auxiliary donor having dicyanovinylene as a common acceptor are synthesized and studied in terms of photophysical, charge transfer, and non-linear optical properties. Optical properties of hybrid dyes considerably shifted towards red to NIR region upon increasing the solvent polarity. Highest emission solvatochromism is observed for dye 5b (similar to 137 nm) from nonpolar to polar solvent. Charge transfer is well established using solvatochromism, natural bond orbital analysis, and HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Two photon absorption is calculated using the theoretical model and dye 4b shows high sigma(2PA) in the range 186-464 GM. Nonlinear optical properties were investigated using solvatochromic two-level model, computationally using two global hybrid functionls (B3LYP and BHHLYP) and four range separated hybrid functionals (CAM-B3LYP, omega B97, omega B97 x and omega B97XD) and Z-scan technique. The computed values of the second order hyperpolarizability (gamma(0)) and first order hyperpolarizability (beta(0)) are high in the range of 993-5473 x 10(-36) esu and 240-806 x 10(-30) esu respectively for these dyes compared to urea. Z-scan results reveal saturable kind of behavior for 4a and 4b, whereas 5a and 5b show reverse saturable kind of behavior in acetone and ethanol and hence give optical limiting values. Thus, from the experimental and theoretical data, these dyes can be considered as promising candidates for NLO application in material science.

AB Single crystals of pure and crystal violet dye-doped L-Argininium bis dihydrogen phosphate were grown using slow evaporation technique. The crystalline nature and the structure parameters were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction technique. Blue and red shifting hydrogen bonds were predicted by DFT on the basis of vibrational spectral (FT-IR & FT-Raman), AIM and NBO analyses. Bifurcated N-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot O intermolecular hydrogen bonds in LADP molecule were visualized by Hirshfeld surface. C-13 and H-1 NMR spectroscopy confirmed the structure of LADP. Doped LADP crystal shows enhancements in the wavelength and longer lifetimes as identified from photoluminescence spectra and decay analysis respectively. The high values of electron mobility and low value of lambda(electron) reflect the applicability of LADP in OLED devices. Enhancement in nonlinear optical parameters in dye-doped LADP crystal was revealed from the Z-scan technique which shows its usefulness in the fabrication of NLO devices.

AB The Er3+-activated Ca2SiO4 nanopowders were fabricated via sonochemical method using Epigallocatechin gallate as a bio-surfactant. The X-ray diffraction results reveal that the prepared nanopowders consist of a single phase monoclinic structure. The energy band gap of the prepared samples was estimated and found in the range 4.95-5.18 eV. The photoluminescence emission spectra exhibit intense peaks centered at similar to 517, 551, 613 and 662 nm, which were attributed to H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2), S-4(3/2 )-> I-4(15/2), F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2) and F-4(9/2(1) )-> I-4(15/2) transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. The photoluminescence emission intensity increases up to 5 mol % of Er3+ concentration and later diminishes. The decrement of emission intensity with increasing Er3+ concentration was related to a self-quenching of the concentration. The cause behind the concentration quenching was proposed as a dipole-dipole interaction among Er3+ ions. Photometric characterizations of Er3+-doped Ca2SiO4 nanopowders exhibit green light emission with high color purity indicates the present nanopowders were quite useful in the fabrication of cool light emitting diodes. The sensor sensitivity of the Ca2SiO4:Er3+ (5 mol %) nanopowders was found to be - 0.0624 K-1 at lower temperature 303 K, suggesting suitability for the optical thermometry application. Further, thermoluminescence properties of the prepared samples were extensively investigated. The activation energy and frequency factor of the prepared nanopowders were estimated and obtained values were good agreement with standard thermoluminescence materials, which specify the suitability of the prepared nanopowders in dosimetry applications. The aforementioned results confirm the synthesized nanopowders exhibit excellent photometric, sensor sensitivity and thermoluminescence properties signifying suitability in solid state lighting, optical thermometry and dosimetry applications.

AB Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles present an interesting material for various applications in biotechnology and medicine. The mechanism of CeO2 nanoparticles activity is supposed to be related to the presence both Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions on the surface of the nanocrystal. Due to the Ce3+ ions, the charge deficiency of a crystal is compensated by oxygen vacancies in the lattice. The present work is devoted to study the cerium oxide defects by optical and luminescence spectroscopy methods. The CeO2 nanoparticles was produced by the method of pulsed electron evaporation of ceramic oxide targets with condensation of the vapors in a vacuum. The strong non-equilibrium conditions of this method could lead to higher oxygen non-stoichiometry of cerium oxide. The results of work show the cerium nanocrystal manifests an emission provided by intracenter transitions in the Ce3+ ions, F-0-centers and Ce4+-O2- complexes with charge transfer. The band gap E-g of the CeO2 nanoparticles for direct and indirect transitions was estimated. The cerium oxide was found to demonstrate catalase-mimic activity, as well as differential cytotoxicity in relation to tumor and healthy cell cultures.

AB White light emitting quantum dot (WQD) materials are being investigated due to their possible applications in the light emitting devices as single layer white light emitters and these have major advantage of lower reabsorption and self-absorption over multilayer emitters of different sized quantum dots (QDs). In this paper, white light emitting CdS core and Cd1-xZnxS graded shell based quantum dots have been synthesized using a single step non-injection technique. Detailed analysis of optical and structural properties has been carried out with QDs growth time. The photoluminescence (PL) consists a narrow band edge emission and a broad (in the range of 440-800 nm) trap state emission which results in white light emission and the quantum efficiency (QE) improves from similar to 12% to 34% as growth time increases from 5 min to 30 min. The average fluorescence lifetime of band edge emission and trap state emission varies in the range of similar to 2-5 ns and similar to 250-550 ns respectively with QDs growth time. We have obtained a series of white light whose color coordinates are very close to the standard white light (CIE-1931); hence these QDs can be a good candidate for white light applications.

AB MoO3-x, nanomaterials were synthesized on Si substrate deposited with gold film in hot filaments assisted chemical vapor deposition system using low cost precursors MoO3 and N-2. The characterization results indicate that the structures of MoO3-x nanomaterials transfer from nanoparticles to nanosheets with the reduction of N-2 flow rate and growth time, which results from the weakening diffusion of MoO3-like molecules in gas environment. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) of MoO3-x nanomaterials was studied at room temperature. The PL results indicate that the MoO3-x, nanomaterials emit ultraviolet, blue, green, red and near-infrared light, and the MoO3-x, nanosheets generate stronger PL emission than the MoO3-x nanoparticles. These multi-PL bands are related to the bandgap of MoO3, the transition between the sub-bands related to Mo5+ defects and oxygen vacancies, and the transition between the intermediate and valence bands, respectively. The strong PL emission of MoO3-x nanosheets is associated with the enhancement of oxygen vacancies due to more surfaces and edges of nanosheets. Our results provide an effective method of controlling the structures of molybdenum oxide nanomaterials and contribute to the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices based on molybdenum oxide nanomaterials.

We characterize the structure, size, morphology and absorption characteristics of samples. Results show that the size of alpha-MnS can be controlled and nanoparticles are attached on reduced graphene oxide (rG0). Nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of all samples are tested by the laser with wavelength of 532 nm and pulse width of 30 ps. Z-scan patterns display that a-MnS exhibits reverse saturation absorption, while composite shows enhanced saturated absorption. NLO properties of composites are better than that of alpha-MnS nanoparticles, implying that composites have potential applications in NLO devices.

AB We report on the operation of passively Q-switched waveguide lasers in Nd:YAG ridge waveguides based on WS2 as a saturable absorber (SA). The ridge waveguides are fabricated by swift Kr ion irradiation and femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. The 670 MeV Kr8+ ion irradiation creates a planar waveguide layer of similar to 50-mu m thickness in the crystal, and the following laser ablation patterns two parallel air grooves on the planar structure for ridge waveguide construction. Under the optical pump at 808 nm, the Q-switched waveguide laser operation at 1064 nm is realized with Ws(2)-based SA, reaching a maximum average output power of 119 mW and a slope efficiency up to 34.5%. The laser pulses are with duration of 209 ns, and with 870 kHz repetition rate corresponding to single-pulse energy of 25 nJ. This WS2-based waveguide laser system is a compact pulsed laser source, which may have potential applications in a number of areas.

AB Monodispersed Eu, Mn co-doped beta-NaYF4 nano-crystals with various morphologies, including nanoplates, hexagonal nanoprisms and microrod, have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal route. The trisodium citrate (Cit (3-)) and pH values, rather than Mn2+, play an important role in fine-tuning the morphologies. A broad band emission from the 5d-4f transition of Eu2+ as well as line emissions from the 4f-4f transitions of Eu3+ are observed in Eu, Mn co-doped beta-NaYF4. The quantum efficiency of Eu3+ was improved from 16% to 72% by inhibiting the luminescence of Eu2+. In addition, controllable emissions from Eu3+/Eu2+ can be achieved through the incorporation of Mn2+ in beta-NaYF4. The correlation between the tunable emission and enhanced quantum efficiency with Eu3+/Eu2+ and Mn2+ in beta-NaYF4 has been established and discussed in detail.

AB KGdF4:Tb3+, KGdF4:Sm3+ and KGdF4:Tb3+,Sm3+ polycrystalline were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The XRD and TEM patterns as well as excitation, luminescence spectra and luminescence decay curves of Sm3+, Tb3+ and Gd3+ have been measured at room temperature. For KGdF4:Tb3+(Sm3+), energy transfer processes from Gd3+ ions to Tb3+ (or Sm3+) ions are related to energy migration through Gd3+ ions and energy trapping by Tb3+ (or Sm3+) ions. The energy trapping rate strongly depends on the nature of RE3+ (Tb3+ or Sm3+) ions and it influences to the luminescence efficiency of RE3+ ion. For KGdF4 :Tb3+,Sm3+, the characteristic emission bands of Tb3+ ion (blue and green) and Sm3+ ion (orange-red) are obtained simultaneously upon excitation by 375 nm. The chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature (CCT) are used to estimate the emission feature of prepared material. The quenching of the luminescence and lifetime of D-5(4) (Tb3+) level are relate to the energy transfer process from Tb3+ to Sm3+ ions. It is shown that, by fitting the decay curves of D-5(4) (Tb3+) to the Inokuti and Hirayama model, the dominant interaction mechanism between Tb3+ and Sm3+ is dipole-quadrupole interaction. The probability (W ET ) and the efficiency (W-ET) of energy transfer from Tb3+ ions to Sm3+ ions increase with the increase of Sm3+ concentration.

AB The scintillation characteristics of Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce, Li (GAGG:Ce,Li) and Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce, Mg (GAGG:Ce,Mg) single crystals were compared. Radioluminescence spectra and photoluminescence decay curves were measured at various temperatures between 77 and 500 K to investigate the thermal luminescence quenching. At 662 keV gamma rays, the LY value of 35,400 photons/MeV and energy resolution of 6.9% obtained for GAGG:Ce, Li are superior to those of 24,200 photons/MeV and 9.5% for GAGG:Ce,Mg. Scintillation decays are approximated by a double exponentials with a fast principal decay component of 47 ns (83%) for GAGG:Ce, Mg and 90 ns (86%) for GAGG:Ce,Li. Coincidence time resolution of 282 ps obtained for GAGG:Ce, Mg is better than that of 389 ps for GAGG:Ce,Li. GAGG:Ce, Mg shows a much lower afterglow and thermally stimulated luminescence intensity with respect to GAGG:Ce,Li.

AB The calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been employed to study electronic and optical properties of the MWO4 (M = Ca, Sr or Ba) compounds with scheelite-type structure. Exchange and correlation effects have been treated by Tran- Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential. The calculated direct energy band gaps (5.08, 5.37 and 5.56 eV for CaWO4, SrWO4 and BaWO4 respectively) agree very well with experimental results obtained from optical absorption measurements upon the bulk samples. The calculated optical responses also agree well with experimental data. These facts demonstrate that the present approach describes the electronic and optical properties of the scheelite tungstates more successfully than the DFT studies reported up to now. Optical spectra are analyzed and interpreted in terms of calculated band structures. It is shown that the lowest-energy peak (centered at similar to 6 eV) is generated by electronic transitions within the WO42- molecular complex, while the middle-energy part of the spectra (from 7 to 15 eV) is due to electronic transitions within both WO42- and MO86- complexes. Optical spectra in the energy range from 0 to 15 eV are very similar for all three compounds. The differences emerge in the high-energy part (from 15 to 30 eV), which is dominantly generated by electronic transitions between the p- and d-states of the M ion.

AB A novel borate mineral of Ba3Sc1.9Al0.1B4O12 was synthesized successfully by traditional high temperature solid-state reaction. Its structure is determined by High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction Rietveld refinement. The crystal structure of Ba3Sc1.9Al0.1B4O12 was found to be trigonal crystal system and the space group is attributed to P-3m1 (164). Moreover, a series of Eu2+ doped Ba3Sc1.9Al0.1B4O12 phosphors are investigated. The electron structure, band structure and photoluminescence properties of Ba3Sc1.9Al0.1B4O12: Eu2+ are investigated in detail by density functional theory calculations, diffuse reflection spectra, emission-excitation spectra, decay curves and temperature dependence spectra. It can emit orange light peaking at similar to 592 nm upon 400 nm NUV excitation with quantum efficiency 40.1%. According to structure and photoluminescence (PL) properties analysis, Eu2+ can occupy two kinds of Ba2+ site. The concentration quenching mechanism of Eu2+ could be a d-d interaction luminescence center. It has not good temperature stability properties because of too much temperature-dependent electron-phonon interaction at high temperature. The fabricated white-LEDs using a 370 nm GaN NUV chip combined with orange/blue phosphors under different weight ratio driven by 30 mA current can get series warm-white light, which the correlated color temperature is smaller than 'YAG + Blue chips' It demonstrates that Ba3Sc1.9Al0.1B4O12: Eu2+ is a potential orange phosphor matching NUV LED chips to get warm white light.

AB Ge11.5As24Se64.5 chalcogenide waveguides were fabricated using lift-off method and thermal reflow process. The morphologies of the waveguide were characterized, and the geometry modification after thermal reflow was analyzed. The thermal reflow process can effectively improve the surface quality and reduce optical loss of the waveguides. Up to 36% sidewall roughness and 37% optical loss reduction were achieved after the waveguides reflowed at 310 degrees C, and the possible factors of high optical loss for reflow at higher temperature were discussed. All the results indicate that the thermal reflow process could be a feasible choice for low-loss integrated chalcogenide photonics application.

AB Ln-doped CaYAl3O7 (CYAM) has several applications due to its optical properties. This crystal matrix belongs to the melilite family, where Ca2+/Y3+ ions are randomly distributed at the same crystallographic site keeping a composition ratio of 1:1. This natural disorder represents a problem to traditional modelling strategies because it is not possible to determine experimentally which ion is actually substituted when a Ln(3+) ion is incorporated. To overcome this problem and to be able to use a static computer modelling approach based on energy minimisation, a supercell was built and Ca2+/Y3+ ions were distributed randomly in the crystallographic positions keeping the composition ratio at 1:1. The substitution of any Ln(3+) at cation sites could be successfully simulated. The energetic cost for the extrinsic defect creation were calculated using two different approaches. The first one was the well-established Mott-Littleton method, where the defect of interest is created in the centre of an explicit region and the position of all species were allowed to relax until a minimum potential energy is reached, with more distant regions being treated as a dielectric continuum. The second approach was based on a direct incorporation into a supercell by just redefining the supercell structure with the defect of interest as part of the supercell itself. The results from both approaches demonstrated that substitution at Ca site with charge compensation by Ca displaced to Y site, forming a kind of Ca-gamma' anti-site defect, was the most probable configuration. Analysis of the defect region showed that presence of mostly Ca ions in the next neighbour cation site to the dopant site reduced the solution energies. This latter result can explain the high Ln doping concentration limit observed for Ln(3+) - doped CYAM, as compared to Ln(3+) doping in other host materials, without any appreciable photoluminescence concentration quenching.

AB A series of LixNa1-xY(PO3)(4): 10% Eu3+ samples (x = 0; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75; 1) were synthesized by a solid state reaction method. They were characterized at room temperature using X-ray diffraction and luminescence spectroscopy. The obtained powders crystallize in monoclinic systems with space groups C2/c and P2(1)/n respectively for x = 1 and x = 0. However, according to XRD data, the LixNa1-x(PO3)(4): Eu3+ material seems to be a mixture of the Li and Na homologues when x = 0.5. This situation has been considered as an option to broaden the VUV absorption instead of mixing of both Li and Na based compositions which has been considered as representative of the discrimination between the two extremes. The VUV excitation and emission spectra of as-synthesized compounds were measured. The broad bands near 200 nm in VUV excitation spectra are attributed to both contribution of overlapped O2- -Y3+ and O2- -Eu3+ absorption charge transfer states while the host absorption band is estimated at 150 nm. The emission spectra are dominated by three bands characteristics of the radiative de-excitation connecting the first excited state D-5(0) of Eu3+ to the main (7)F1, F-7(2) and F-7(4) manifolds of the ground state. Based on Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory, the intensity parameters (Omega(2) and Omega(4)) have been evaluated from the emission spectra.

AB Dynamic in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (iSE) was employed to investigate the growth mechanism of the tantalum oxide (TaO) film on silicon wafer substrate deposited by reactive gas-timing RF magnetron sputtering compared with conventional reactive sputtering. The effect of reactive gas timing parameter on physical structure and optical property were analyzed by both the continuous and island film growth model with Tauc-Lorentz optical model. The variation of refractive index, film thickness and void volume fraction were obtained from dynamic fits of iSE data indicated that the growth process of the amorphous TaO thin films was divided into two regimes: the nucleation stage and continuous-layer stage. These stages were observed during deposition although the initial film growth stage corresponds to the island film growth model. The study demonstrates that sputtered TaO by the RGT technique at the O-2 on-off gas timing has played a crucial factor in improving the formation of nucleation stage and that the deposited TaO thin films were high deposition rate with high refractive index. The complementary field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed a good agreement with the film thickness and morphology obtained from dynamic iSE measurement. The real-time monitoring of iSE offers important evidences to understand the growth mechanism of reactive gas-timing technique.

AB We report novel Ag+-doped ormosil-phosphotungstate (PW12O403-) hybrid films that exhibit reversible yellow photochromism based on the phosphotungstate-assisted photo-induced formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their reversible oxidation back to Ag+ ions upon low temperature heating (60-80 degrees C). The sol-gel derived, dip-coated, hybrid films containing phosphotungstate anions and Ag+ ions exhibit yellow color upon UV exposure and become colorless upon simple heating. Using an array of complementary analytical techniques, we first present a detailed characterization of the prepared materials and then discuss the coloration/discoloration mechanism involved. The presence of both phosphotungstate and Ag+ ions inside the hybrid matrix is found to be imperative for achieving the photochromic behavior. Owing to the presence of AgNPs and their easily achievable coloration/discoloration, these hybrid films may find application in optical memory systems, band pass filters, non-linear optical devices, UV sensing and antibacterial coatings.

AB In this research, graphene oxide-zinc oxide nanocomposite film (GO-ZnO) was prepared by cost-effective solvothermal, spin-spray coating methods and studied for its UV sensing properties. I-V curve of prepared nanocomposite was recorded under illumination of an ultraviolet lamp. SEM and TEM images indicated the layer formation of GO and showed a uniform distribution of ZnO nanoparticles into GO nanosheets. XRD, Raman and EDX results indicated characteristic peaks of GO, ZnO and related elements in composite. For the first time based on ion beam induced luminescence (IBIL) study, GO-ZnO nanocomposite exhibited strong light emission in the UV-blue range at room temperature. The photoluminescence and IBIL investigations indicated that the optical quality of the GO-ZnO nanocomposite was improved compared with pure ZnO. The sensitivity in GO-ZnO composite and ZnO sample for V-Bias = 5 v was obtained about 24 and 3 respectively. The GO-ZnO nanocomposite with ZnO particle size of 20-30 nm showed higher sensitivity and faster response time as compared to bare ZnO. According to obtained results, it is anticipated that GO-ZnO nanocomposite would hold suitable potential for application in UV-Vis optoelectronic devices.

AB Optical rectification (OR) of organic 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4'-N'-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) single crystal was investigated. The relation between the two tensor elements d(33) and d(32) of DAST was theoretically derived to be d(32) = 2.29d(33). In measurements, the amplitude of the OR voltage signal of a strain-relaxed DAST single crystal reached 980 mV, much higher than those achieved in the well-known ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Taking advantage of the good elasticity of organic crystals, we also succeeded in tuning the OR signal of DAST by external stress, opening a new route to its applications in nonlinear optics and sensing.

AB A proposed Ag/WS2/SiO2/p-Si/Ag Schottky heterostructure photodetector is tested for its photoconduction behaviour under ultraviolet (UV) illumination using a light emitting diode (LED) at 380 nm. This is done at various illumination powers as well as different direct current (DC) bias voltages. A simple and feasible drop casting method and heating process allows good adhesion of tungsten disulphide (WS2) onto a silicon dioxide/p-silicon (SiO2/p-Si) substrate forming a Schottky contact. In order to enhance photoconduction, iron (Fe) powder is introduced to build contacts between WS2 and the substrate. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analysis, energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirm the formation of the WS2 thin film. Raman spectrum peaks at 357 cm(-1) (E-2g(1)) and 417 cm(-1) (A(1g)) confirm the presence of WS2 while peaks 214, 223, 274 and 292 cm(-1) and a small broad shoulder at 694 cm(-1) confirm the presence of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3). Furthermore, profound D and G bands at 1370 and 1585 cm(-1) respectively indicate defected carbon (C) structures in the WS2 thin film. Excellent photoconduction of UV LED 380 nm light source showed power and DC bias voltage dependent characteristics. Wide variations in rise and fall time justifies that the device can be operated at selected bias voltages and frequency modulations.

AB In this study, we demonstrated two processes for the fabrication of thin films comprising ZnO nanocrystals dispersed in a SiO2 matrix doped with Er3+ ions (Er3+-doped SiO2/ZnO nanocomposites). The thin films can be applied as SiO2 glasses for optical waveguide materials working at the 1.54 mu m band. In the first process, the conventional sol-gel method was utilized to generate homogeneous materials wherein ZnO nanoparticles formed after heat treatment. In the second process, SiO2 and ZnO sols were separately prepared before the fabrication of Er3+-doped nanocomposites. Different fabrication conditions, such as doping concentration and heat treatment temperature, and the optical properties of the corresponding prepared films were presented. The optical properties of the two material systems were compared to propose and discuss different excitation mechanisms via the interaction between intermediate ZnO nanocrystals and Er(3+ )dopants.

AB A selective UV shielding material based on photonic crystals structure is proposed in this paper, which composed of indium tin oxide, metallic silver and titanium dioxide. We investigate the optical properties of this structure in the UV to visible range by using finite-difference time-domain method. Furthermore, we have discussed the effect of structural parameters on the spectral selectivity of the structure. In addition, we find the (ITO/Ag/TiO2)(6) structure can be transparent in visible light while high-performance shielding in UV radiation. Numerical results demonstrate that this novel material enable potential applications in selective UV shielding material.

AB The objective of this work was to investigate the thermoluminescence (TL) properties of lanthanide-doped CaSO4 synthesized by co-precipitation for particle temperature sensing applications. Desirable properties for temperature sensing include high TL intensity, stability of the TL signal against light exposure, low room temperature fading, UV emission, and multiple TL peaks over a wide range of temperatures. CaSO4 was synthesized with one or more lanthanides and characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), radioluminescence (RL), and TL using both broad-band or wavelength resolved detection. We focused particularly in samples containing blue and UV emitting centers (e.g. Ce3+, Tm3+), because of the possibility of better discriminating the TL emission against the blackbody background emission in the high temperature region of the TL curves. TL emission was observed mostly for trivalent states of the lanthanides (Ce3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+ and Tm3+), except in Eu-doped samples, in which both Eu2+ and Eu3+ emissions were observed. A variety of TL peaks was observed with emission from < 100 degrees C to almost 600 degrees C with relative intensities that varied according to the dopants. Samples doped with Ce and co-doped with either Pr, Gd or Tb were particularly interesting for temperature sensing, because they showed TL emission in the UV region with higher intensity than the single-doped samples, and TL peaks in the high temperature range of the TL curve. The results demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing CaSO4 samples with high TL intensity and TL peaks distributed over a wide temperature range, which can be controlled by the appropriate choice of dopants. This can be useful for temperature sensing applications, because materials with TL peaks in specific temperature regions are required depending on the intended temperature range of measurement.

AB In this work, we first time reported the BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composite as photocatalyst for waste-water treatment. Firstly, the BiFeWO6 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple solvothermal route. Afterwards, a sequence of the BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composites was synthesized with various amounts of BiFeWO 6 through a costeffective co-precipitation route. The visible-light photocatalytic behaviors of these BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composites were further assessed through the removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye. It is indicates that BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composite displays a higher photocatalytic response than that of pure alpha-AgVO3 and BiFeWO6. This enhanced response of BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composite is mainly owing to the fast separation and migration of the photo-generated charge carriers via the creation of heterojunction between the BiFeWO6 and alpha-AgVO3. The recycling experiments demonstrate that BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 possesses a better photostability and reusability character. Furthermore, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composite for removal of RhB was also presented. Therefore, this fabricated BiFeWO6/alpha-AgVO3 composite can be a promising photocatalytic material for environmental remediation work.

AB Data on coupled experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure and optical properties of quaternary thallium mercury tin sulfide, Tl2HgSnS4, a perspective semiconductor for application in optoelectronics, are presented in the present work. In particular, for a Tl2HgSnS4 crystal grown by Bridgman-Stockbarger technique, we have measured X-ray photoelectron (XP) core-level and valence band (VB) spectra for as-synthesized and treated with 3 keV Ar+ ions surfaces. The XP measurements reveal a substantial sensitivity of the Tl2HgSnS4 crystal surface regarding treatment with Ar+ ions: such surface treatment leads to almost complete eliminating the mercury content in topmost surface layers being analyzed. Furthermore, based on computing techniques within density functional theory (DFT) framework, we have calculated the electronic band-structure of Tl2HgSnS4 through modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) approach for exchange correlation potential involving also in computation procedure spin-orbit (SO) coupling and Hubbard parameter U (mBJ-U-SO technique). The present mBJ-U-SO calculations reveal an excellent fit of the theoretical curve of total density of states and the experimental XP VB spectrum of the Tl2HgSnS4 compound. The DFT calculations indicate that the upper portion of the XP VB spectrum of Tl(2)HgSnS(4)is mainly due to contributions of S 3p states, the central part is formed by S 3p and Sn 5p states, the lower portion is determined from contributions of Sn 5s states, with slightly smaller input of 6s states associated with Tl and Hg atoms, while at the bottom the principal contributions come from Hg 5d(5/2) and Hg 5d(3/2) states. The optical absorption edge was measured for the Tl2HgSnS4 crystal and the main optical constants were calculated within mBJ-U-SO technique.

AB Ln(2)Ti(2)O(7) thin films with Ln = La to Lu were successfully grown on (110)-SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The microstructure and optical properties of the entire Ln(2)Ti(2)O(7) series were investigated by X-Ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. For large ionic radii (i.e. Ln(3+) = La3+ to Eu3+), the monoclinic/layered-perovskite structure is obtained with epitaxial growth. For smaller ionic radii (i.e. Ln(3+) = Tb3+ to Lu3+), the cubic/pyrochlore structure is privileged. We have also observed the growth of a Gd2Ti2O7 polymorphic phase between the stability limit of the two previously described structures. The optical band gap increases when the ionic radius of Ln(3+) decreases. Refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) have been calculated over a wavelength range of 260-1500 nm. The low value of the extinction coefficient indicates that these materials are transparent in the visible range and can therefore be used in electro-optics systems in the case of the layered-perovskite structure and more widely as emitting materials in solid-state lasers optically pumped.

AB In this study, we have reported easy and economical synthesis of highly fluorescent nitrogen-rich carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs). The as-prepared N-CQDs displayed strong blue color emission along with CIE co-ordinate index (0.15, 0.14). The N-CQDs possess comparatively high QY of 57% using quinine sulfate as a standard. Furthermore, the as-prepared N-CQDs defend against the high salt strength and longtime photostability over the six months of incubation. Apart from this, the as-prepared N-CQDs responded as a sensor for the 'turnoff' detection of Co2+ along with the detection limit of 0.12 mu M over a linear range from 0.5 to 3 mu M. The mechanistic study proved the detection of Co2+ was based on the IFE, static quenching, aggregation, and complex formation between the amino group of N-CQDs and Co2+. Moreover, the fluorescence of the quenched N-CQDs can reappear and get 'turn-on' by using GSH, AA, EDTA, and cyst; thus, the prepared N-CQDs could further execute as a probe for the Co2+ detection. Inspired by these outstanding properties, the as-prepared NCQDs were also successfully employed for the practical application toward monitoring the trace level of Co2+ in a vitamin B-12 sample.

CdTe thin films were obtained by vapor phase condensation method with different thicknesses on glass substrates. The optical properties of the deposited films were analyzed by Swanepoel method using transmission spectra. The upper thin layer of CdS was deposited by thermal evaporation method on CdTe thin films. The change of the optical properties of CdS/CdTe heterojunctions were investigated and compared with CdTe thin films. The main optical constants, such as refractive index and absorption coefficient were calculated. Advanced simulations were performed in SCAPS for optimization of CdS/CdTe thin film heterostructures.

AB Passive radiative cooler can dissipate heat from the earth (25 degrees C) to the outer space ( - 270 degrees C) through the atmospheric transparent window (8-13 mu m) by radiation, making the temperature of the cooler lower than that of ambient air. Here, we fabricated a passive radiative cooler that combined silica nanoparticles with anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template by a simple dip-pulling method, in which the pores of AAO template were filled with silica nanoparticles. The cooler selectively radiates in the atmospheric window while has low absorptivity outside the atmospheric window. Without convection shields, the temperature of the cooler is significantly lower than that of the ambient air throughout the day. Furthermore, the cooler has excellent thermal stability. Even after 4 h of annealing at 600 degrees C, the passive radiative cooling performance of the cooler does not deteriorate.

AB Enhanced terahertz (THz) radiation was generated from a gallium arsenide thin film integrated on top of porous silicon distributed Bragg reflector (GaAs/PSi DBR). The film's thickness was designed to be less than the penetration depth of the 800 nm excitation source, while the PSi DBR was centered at the laser wavelength to reflect the transmitted photons at the film-substrate interface. Reflection-geometry THz time-domain spectroscopy measurement revealed enhancement in THz peak to peak amplitude by 1.67 and 5.7 times as compared to the same thickness of GaAs on silicon (GaAs/Si) and bulk semi-insulating (SI) GaAs, respectively. In comparison with the bulk SI-GaAs, both thin film samples showed an order of magnitude improvement in the THz output power. The excitation-wavelength study also revealed a maximum increase near the design wavelength. The enhancement was attributed to the high reflectivity at the film-substrate interface and optical cavity effect in GaAs. These factors contributed to an effective optical confinement within the film's THz generation region.

AB Time-resolved luminescence of YAG-Ce (150 ppm) fiber crystal with Mg co-doping was studied under pulsed X-ray excitation and gamma-rays (Cs 662 keV). The initial part of decay kinetics under X-ray excitation is faster than for direct cerium excitation (63 ns). Decay kinetics is also characterized by the presence of slow components with at least two characteristic times longer than Ce3+ radiation time. The slowest one which dominates for t > 500 ns in YAG-Ce without Mg co-doping practically vanishes for samples with 50 ppm co-doping. Decay kinetics under gamma-rays are characterized by slower rise time than that under X-rays. These properties can be explained by competition of energy transfer and energy losses in track regions. The distribution of excitations in tracks produced by X-rays differs from that in tracks produced by gamma-rays, since the energy of primary electron after gamma-quantum conversion is much higher than after X-ray absorption. The stopping power for energetic electrons decreases with increase of electron energy, and therefore the density distribution after X-ray conversion is shifted to higher densities, Therefore, the acceleration of recombination and quenching of excitations is more prominent under X-ray excitation. Specific role of Ce4+ induced by Mg co-doping is also discussed in the paper.

AB The co-precipitation synthesis assisted YF3: Er3+/Yb3+ upconversion nanoparticles were examined as a function of pump power which showed a tuneable emission efficiency through 976 nm diode laser excitation. Different emission bands in the visible range corresponding to the F-4(7/2) -> I-4(15/2) (490 nm), H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) (522 nm), S-4(3/ 2) -> I-4(15/2) (548 nm) and F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2) (659 nm) transitions were observed. The sample crystal structure, particle morphology and optical properties were characterized. The applications of the present sample in latent fingermarks detection and security ink demonstration were successfully examined through the optimized annealing temperature and pump power of excitation. This demonstration claimed the highly utilization of the YF3:Er3+/Yb3+ upconversion nanoparticles for possible crime scene and anti-counterfeiting practitioners.

AB 0.5 mol% of europium (Eu3+) doped bismuth phosphate glasses (BiP) with different contents (0, 5, 10 and 15 mol%) of bismuth and different (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) mol% of Eu3+ doped 5 mol% bismuth contained BiP glasses were made by melt-quenching technique. The structural and photoluminescence properties were analysed via FT-Raman, excitation, luminescence and decay time computations. Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters were evaluated from the emission spectra and also various radiative properties such as radiative transition probabilities (A(R)), radiative lifetimes (tau(rad)), stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma(e)), branching ratios (beta), optical gain bandwidths (sigma(e)x Delta lambda(eff)) and optical gain (sigma(e)x tau(rad)) values for the observed emission transitions are studied. The electron-phonon coupling constants (g), phonon energies (h omega) and the multiphonon relaxation rates (W-MPR) were determined. The decay curves of D-5(0) level of Eu3+ in all the studied glasses exhibit single exponential nature. The lifetimes are obtained from the decay curves and reported. The CIE chromaticity coordinates were computed and they have fallen in red region. The characteristic red luminescence emission around 612 nm for D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition confirmed that the Eu3+ doped BiP glasses might be useful to fabricate red lasers and display devices.

AB Yttrium (Y2O3) nanopowders were synthesized via the precipitation method using ammonium hydrogen carbonate (AHC) as the precipitant. The influences of calcination temperature on the composition and morphology of the powders were investigated. Fine Y2O3 powders with low-agglomeration were obtained by calcining the precursor at 1100 degrees C for 4 h. The primary crystallites were calculated to be similar to 47 nm in size and weakly agglomerated to particles with size of similar to 79 nm. Using the synthesized powders as the starting materials, Y2O3 ceramics were fabricated by vacuum sintering at different temperatures combined with HIP post-treatment. The densification and micro-structure evolution of the Y2O3 ceramics were systematically investigated. The ceramic sample vacuum sintered at 1500 degrees C for 2 h and post-HIPed at 1550 degrees C for 3 h exhibited a uniform and fine microstructure with the average grain of about 1.0 mu m. The in-line transmittance of the ceramic sample reached 80.1% at 1100 nm.

The metal nanoparticles include Al, Ti, Co, Ni, Zn, Ag, Sn, In, W, Au and the quantum dots of Ag2S, and finally the perovskites such as CsPbBr3 and CsPbI2Br. We systematically characterized all materials mentioned above using absorption spectra and scanning electron microscope. We demonstrate that the light-induced nonlinear absorption leads to optical limiting. The suspensions of the reported samples demonstrated low threshold of optical limiting, which can be explained by strong two-photon absorption in these solutions. The gold nanoparticles (10-30 nm) show the lowest threshold of optical limiting (3.26 mJ cm(-2)).

AB FeNb11O29, pure or doped with metal transition ions, is a very promising material with advanced multifunctionalities and interesting applicative perspectives. It is isostructural with Nb12O29, one of the rare compounds in which Nb displays a local magnetic moment and shows both antiferromagnetic ordering and metallic conductivity at low temperatures. In this work we have synthesized and studied Fe0.8V0.2Nb11O29 monoclinic powders. In particular we monitored the effects on structural, electronic and magnetic properties in samples produced in different atmospheres to stabilize cations with different oxidation states.
   We have demonstrated that the reaction atmosphere influences the phase homogeneity, the crystallite size and the amount of paramagnetic centres, with a transformation of Fe3+ in Fe2+ when an inert atmosphere is used, as proved by the absence, in this case, of any electron paramagnetic resonance signal. Also the Raman spectra result to be affected due to the change of coordination polyhedra. Subsequent re-oxidation of reduced powders brings to the monophasic iron niobate again containing Fe3+ demonstrating the reversibility of redox process. This reversibility is accompanied by a complete restoring of monoclinic structure evidenced by X-ray diffraction data and by Raman measurements, which allowed also to follow in situ the spectral changes induced by laser heating.

AB GdVO4 single crystals doped with different concentration of Nd (0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 at.%) were grown by optical floating zone method. The absorption coefficient measured for two orthogonal polarization of light is different due to anisotropic structure in both the direction. The line strength and Judd-Ofelt parameters evaluated from the recorded absorption spectra are also dependent on the polarization of the incident light. Further, the spectroscopic quality factor was estimated by Judd Ofelt parameters and found to be maximum for 0.8 at.% Nd doped GdVO4 crystals. The emission study shows that photoluminescence (PL) intensity at 1062 (lasing wavelength), 1069 and 1081 nm increases with the doping concentration of Nd up to 0.8 at.% and beyond that the PL intensity at all emission wavelengths decreases. The emission cross-section with excitation at 808 nm was estimated by Judd Ofelt theory for the F-4(3/2) -> (4)l(11/2) transition and it was found to be independent of doping of Nd in GdVO4. The measured fluorescence life-time of Nd:GdVO4 samples is similar to 100, 101, 92 and 93 is corresponding to the doping concentration of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 at.% of Nd respectively. The measured fluorescence life-time exhibits the maximum value for 0.8 at.% of Nd doping. The decrease in the PL intensity as well as fluorescence life-time for higher doping concentration is because of quenching due to ion-to-ion interaction in the crystal. All the spectroscopic investigation presented here suggest that the optimum concentration of Nd ion in GdV4 single crystals is 0.8 at.%, at which the best lasing performance can be obtained.

AB Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) nanopowders are prepared by ultrasound assisted sonochemical route using Polyethylene glycol as a surfactant. The obtained product is irradiated with 8 MeV electrons with electrons dose strength of 2 kGy, 4 kGy, 6 kGy and 8 kGy. The powder X-ray diffraction studies reveals well indexed cubic structure in both pristine and electron beam irradiated samples. Morphological results evidence the spherical shaped nanopowders. The energy band gap was found to be decrease with increase of electron beam irradiation strength. The photoluminescence emission spectra of pristine and electron beam irradiated samples exhibit defects related peaks at similar to 424, 444, 460, 483 and 520 nm. Upon electron beam irradiation, the Commission International de I'Eclairage color coordinates are engineered from deep blue color to cyan color. A single thermoluminescence glow peak is recorded at similar to 213 degrees C in all the electron beam irradiated samples up to given dose range 2 kGy, 4 kGy, 6 kGy and 8 kGy. The trapping parameters (E, s) are calculated by employing various methods. Linear dose response, less fading and high reproducibility of electron beam irradiated SrTiO3 samples broadly indicated its suitability for thermoluminescence dosimetry applications.

AB Processing and characterization of polymer nanocomposites based on poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix with embedded core-shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QD's) were presented in this work. The aim is to preserve the optical activity of QD's in nanocomposite processing with improved mechanical properties. The modification of QD's CdSe/ZnS-PMMA interface was achieved with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS). Nanocomposites were processed by solution casting. The samples of pure PMMA, and composites with unmodified and silane modified QD's CdSe/ZnS were processed. FTIR analysis revealed modification of QD's with silane and characteristic bonding with PMMA matrix. Raman spectrum confirms a presence of alloyed layer at the core-shell interface. Time-resolved laser induced fluorescence measurements confirmed slight blue shift in QD's CdSe/ZnS-PMMA composite without interface modification, while there was a slight red shift with modified particles. Oxidation effects in quantum dots were removed with the use of PMMA as a host, and the core remained active, which was confirmed with FTIR analysis and time-resolved laser induced fluorescence measurements.

AB Efficient oxynitride phosphors CaSi2O2N2:Eu2+, Ce3+ for application as down-conversion luminescent materials in wLEDs were prepared from the precursor Ca-3(PO4)(2):Eu3+, Ce4+ at the relatively low temperature (1400*C), as well as a kind of novel phosphor of Ca2AlSi3O2N5: Eu2+/Mn (2+) was synthesized with CaCN2 as calcium resource. The structures and photoluminescent properties of oxynitride phosphors doped with rare earth and transition metal ions were systematically researched. The results indicate that the photoluminescence (PL) intensity can be highly improved when Eu2+/Ce3+ ions are doped with appropriate amounts in CaSi2O2N2 matrix. The rare earth or transition metal ions occupy two different lattice sites in the Ca2AlSi3O2NS host according to the PL spectra.

AB We demonstrate light coupling from femtosecond laser written diamond waveguide operating at the telecommunication wavelengths to a silicon microsphere resonator. Type II waveguides are written on a diamond platform and Fahry-Perot resonances are excited in the diamond waveguides by bare fiber coupling in and out of the waveguide. The Fabry-Perot resonances have a free spectral range of 87 pm, and a maximum Q-factor of 3.9 x 10(4). The diamond waveguide is used to excite TM-polarized whispering gallery modes of the 1 mm silicon microsphere, since the type II waveguides support TM modes better as compared to TE modes. The whispering gallery mode spacing is measured as 0.257 nm and the highest Q-factor is 6.2 x 10(4). This evanescent coupling method to high Q-factor silicon microsphere resonances by femtosecond laser written diamond waveguides can be further used for filtering and sensing applications in various photonic lightwave circuits.

AB The absolute band edge positions have significant impact on carrier transport in materials and solar cells. In the present work, an attempt has been made to examine the interfaces of different layers and to obtain band offsets, in one and two step deposited MAPbI(3) peroviskite solar cells (PSC), employing X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS). The values of conduction band offset (CBO) at TiO2/MAPbI(3) and the valance band offset (VBO) at MAPbI(3)/SpiroMeOTAD were 0.27eV and 0.26 eV, respectively. Relatively high VBO (0.29 eV) at MAPbI(3)/Spiro-MeOTAD interface in two-step PSC as compared to that of one step PSC (0.26 V) caused a barrier for hole transfer at the interface and hence results a 2% fall in its photo conversion efficiency (PCE). Surface roughness analysis using atomic force microscopy revealed a relatively smooth surface for one step method resulting in a reduction of interface resistance leading to a better charge transport and improved PCE.

AB Objective: Subjective sleep disturbances have been associated with greater risk for concurrent and incident metabolic syndrome (MetS). Previous studies have not examined prospective associations among polysomnography-assessed sleep and the MetS, despite knowledge that self-reported sleep is subject to reporting bias, and that subjectively and objectively assessed sleep are weakly correlated.
   Method: In the current study, objectively-assessed (polysomnography) and subjectively-assessed (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) sleep was measured in 145 adults at two timepoints, separated by 12-30 years. A continuous measure of the MetS was assessed at the second time point. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime history of major depressive disorder, follow-up time, and apnea-hypopnea index.
   Results: Polysomnography-assessed sleep duration, latency, efficiency, and slow wave sleep were not significantly prospectively associated with the MetS (ps >= 0.16). Self-reported longer sleep latency was prospectively associated with higher MetS scores in unadjusted (beta = 0.29, p = 0.002) and adjusted models (beta = 0.25, p = 0.009). Longer sleep latency was associated with higher fasting glucose levels (beta = 0.47, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that subjective and objective measures of sleep may differ in their ability to prospectively predict MetS. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Drug abstinence is accompanied by aversive experiences and lasting changes in mood status and worsening sleep quality. This study investigated the potential effects of chronic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in substance dependent inpatients during abstinence.
   Methods: This was a double-blinded study with 105 males inpatients dependent on heroin or methamphetamine (average abstinence time was six months). The inpatients were randomly divided into 10 Hz intervention (n = 40), sham stimulation (n = 40) and control (waiting list, no treatment) (n = 25) groups. Five sessions of rTMS stimulation were administrated for six consecutive weeks, reaching a total of 180,000 pulses. There was no intervention for control group. Patients were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed prior to and after six weeks of intervention.
   Results: The results showed that six weeks of rTMS treatment significantly improved the sleep quality (p < 0.001), alleviated depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety state (p < 0.001) of substance dependent inpatients in early abstinence. Furthermore, the active TMS group showed significant differences between sham and control groups.
   Conclusion: These findings suggested that chronic rTMS treatment have positive effects for substance dependent inpatients during abstinence. Future studies are required to understand the underlying mechanism for improving different clinical symptoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The doctorepatient relationship has an important role in the delivery of high-quality healthcare. The aim of the present study was to explore and evaluate the impact of sleep severity and fatigue manifestations on doctorepatient relationships.
   Methods: The present study was an analysis of a cross-sectional sample of a total of 123 physicians with different specialties and work in various shifts in Iraq. Sleep severity difficulty was measured by Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and the multidimensional nature of fatigue was assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF). Moreover, the doctor-patient relationship was measured by Difficult Doctor-Patient Relationship Questionnaire (DDPRQ-10).
   Results: In this study, nearly half of the physicians (45.5%) were insomniacs. The total fatigue score was 9.46; general fatigue (Mean (M): 5.84 of 24); physical fatigue (M: 5.15 of 24); emotional fatigue (M: 6.04 of 24); mental fatigue (M: 5.45 of 24); and vigor (M: 12.98 of 24). The doctors felt slight irritation in their communications with patients (M: 2.33); had moderate dysphoria (M: 3.37); had slight compliance in their communications (M: 1.71), and slightly considered patients to be self-destructive (M: 1.97). In addition, the study showed that general and physical fatigue, night shift-work, and increased working hours in the public sector were predictors for doctors finding their patient irritating. Similarly, increased working hours by clinicians in the public sector was a predictor for having less compliance in their relationships with patients.
   Conclusion: The present investigation suggests that insomnia has an indirect association with negative categories of the doctor-patient relationship. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Sleep problems are burdensome in adolescents. Understanding modifiable environmental risk factors is essential. There is evidence that physical activity is protective against sleep problems in adolescents. However, the association between sedentary behavior (SB) and anxiety-induced sleep disturbance has not been investigated.
   Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey, we explored the association between SB and anxiety-induced sleep disturbance in 181,093 adolescents [mean (standard deviation, SD) age 13.7 (1.0) years; 48.4% girls] from 67 countries, controlling for confounders (including physical activity). Adolescents reported anxiety-induced sleep disturbance during the past 12 months, and SB, which was a composite variable assessing time spent sitting and watching television, playing computer games, talking with friends during a typical day excluding the hours spent sitting at school and doing homework. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and a countrywide meta-analysis undertaken.
   Results: Overall, 7.8% of adolescents had anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The prevalence of SB was: <1 h/day 39.9%; 1-2 h/day 33.8%; 3-4 h/day 15.4%; 5-8 h/day 7.4%; and >8 h/day 3.6%. Compared to <1 h/day of SB, >8 h/day was associated with a 2.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.98-2.62] times higher odds for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The association was similar among both sexes. The pooled odds ratio for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance when being sedentary >= 3 h/day was 1.42 (95% CI = 1.36-1.48) with only a small degree of between-country heterogeneity (I-2 = 41.4%).
   Conclusions: Future longitudinal data are required to confirm/refute the findings to inform public interventions which aim to reduce anxiety and sleep disturbance in adolescents. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study investigated the association between poor sleep quality and hypertension, and evaluated how the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score correlates with blood pressure and prevalent hypertension.
   Methods: A total of 27, 912 participants aged 18-79 years from the Henan Rural Cohort Study were included into the current study. PSQI score was classified as <3, 3-, 6-, >= 9. Multivariate logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline with hypertension as a dependent variable were conducted. A meta-analysis was conducted to validate the result of the cross-sectional study.
   Results: Altogether, 6,085 (21.80%) were poor sleepers and 9,056 (32.44%) suffered from hypertension. The odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of participants with sleep quality of 3-, 6-, >= 9 were 1.16(1.07-1.26), 1.35(1.21-1.50) and 1.62 (1.39-1.88) compared to the participants with a score of less than 3 among participants excluding undiagnosed hypertension. ORs and 95% CIs per 3 increment score were higher for hypertension (1.16, 1.11-1.21) among total population, (1.18, 1.10-1.27) among men and (1.13, 1.08-1.19) among women. Compared to reference, poor sleep quality was associated with a higher odd of hypertension (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.17) for total population, (1.14, 1.00-1.30) for men and (1.04, 0.95-1.13) for women. Moreover, the odds of hypertension were increased with increment of PSQI score after fitting restricted cubic splines (P-trend <0.01). The meta-analysis showed that pooled OR of hypertension was significantly higher for poor sleepers (1.62, 1.03-2.56, I-2 = 97.3%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Higher PSQI score was associated with increased odds of prevalent hypertension in both genders. In addition, poorer sleepers might suffer from hypertension. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) occurs frequently in patients with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy body, or multiple system atrophy, but may also occur as a prodromal stage of those diseases; and is termed idiopathic RBD (iRBD) when not accompanied by other symptoms. Cholinergic degeneration of the mesopontine nuclei have been described in synucleinopathies with or without RBD, but this has not yet been explored in iRBD. We sought to assess cholinergic neuronal integrity in iRBD using PET neuroimaging with the F-18-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV).
   Methods: The sample included 10 participants evenly divided between healthy subjects and patients with iRBD. Polysomnography and PET imaging with FEOBV were performed in all participants. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were compared between the two groups using voxel wise t-tests. Non-parametric correlations were also computed in patients with iRBD between FEOBV uptake and muscle tonic and phasic activity during REM sleep.
   Results: Compared with healthy participants, significantly higher FEOBV uptakes were observed in patients with iRBD. The largest differences were observed in specific brainstem areas corresponding to the bulbar reticular formation, pontine coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex, tegmental periacqueductal grey, and mesopontine cholinergic nuclei. FEOBV uptake in iRBD was also higher than in controls in the ventromedial area of the thalamus, deep cerebellar nuclei, and some cortical territories (including the paracentral lobule, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex). Significant correlation was found between muscle activity during REM sleep, and SUVR increases in both the mesopontine area and paracentral cortex.
   Conclusion: We showed here for the first time the brain cholinergic alterations in patients with iRBD. As opposed to the cholinergic depletion described previously in RBD associated with clinical Parkinson's disease, increased cholinergic innervation was found in multiple areas in iRBD. The most significant changes were observed in brainstem areas containing structures involved in the promotion of REM sleep and muscle atonia. This suggests that iRBD might be a clinical condition in which compensatory cholinergic upregulation in those areas occurs in association with the initial phases of a neurodegenerative process leading to a clinically observable synucleinopathy.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a progressive sleep disordered breathing condition characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. Despite being the most common sleep apnea, it often remains undiagnosed and untreated, especially in rural communities. There is a paucity of literature estimating the prevalence of the disease and associated risk factors from the rural population of Odisha.
   Methods: It is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in a rural community of Odisha, India to find out the prevalence of people living with the risk of OSA. Multi-staged sampling was done. Participants were evaluated using the Berlin questionnaire (BQ) after obtaining informed consent. Data were analyzed using SPSS with the significance level set at 95%. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to evaluate the risk factors associated with the condition.
   Results: Out of 200 community dwellers surveyed using the BQ, 25% had a high likelihood of OSA. Among these high risk subjects, snoring was reported by 70%, excessive daytime sleepiness by 50%. Out of those who were at risk of OSA, 28% were smokers and 48% reported alcohol use. The associated risk factors were age >35 years (OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.4-13.8, p < 0.05), BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) (aOR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.2-10.5, p < 0.05), alcoholism (aOR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.8-11.1, p = 0.001), and hypertension (aOR = 11.5, 95% CI = 4.7-28, p < 0.001). The prevalence was not affected by the type of diet (vegetarian vs non-vegetarian), use of tobacco or tea consumption.
   Conclusion: OSA is highly prevalent in the rural community of Odisha. Independent risk factors associated with such subjects were obesity, regular alcohol consumption, and hypertension. Further prevalence studies are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Investigate the immediate and residual impacts of sleep extension in tactical athletes.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial (Sleep extension = EXT vs Control = CON) was conducted on 50 (EXT: 20.12 +/- 2.01 years vs CON: 19.76 +/- 1.09 years) tactical athletes enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). Participants wore actigraphs for 15 consecutive nights and completed a cognitive/motor battery after seven habitual sleep nights, after four sleep extension nights, and after the resumption of habitual sleep for four nights. The CON group remained on habitual sleep schedules for the entire study.
   Results: During the intervention, the EXT group significantly increased mean sleep time (1.36 +/- 0.71 h, p < 0.001). After sleep extension, there were significant between-group differences on the mean score change since baseline in Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) reaction time (p = 0.026), Trail Making Test (TMT) - B time (p = 0.027), standing broad jump (SBJ) distance (p < 0.001), and motivation levels [ to perform the cognitive tasks (p = 0.003) and the SBJ (p = 0.009)]; with the EXT group showing a greater enhancement in performance/motivation. After resuming habitual sleep schedules, significant between-group differences on the mean score change since baseline persisted on SBJ distance (p = 0.001) and motivation to perform the SBJ (p = 0.035), with the EXT showing greater enhancement in performance/motivation.
   Conclusion: Increasing sleep duration in military tactical athletes resulted in immediate performance benefits in psychomotor vigilance, executive functioning, standing broad jump distance, and motivation levels. Benefits on motor performance were evident four days after resumption of habitual sleep schedules. Military tactical athletes aiming to optimize their overall performance should consider the impact of longer sleep durations when feasible. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Sleep plays a role in some oligodendrocyte processes, including myelination. This study aimed to analyze the possible correlations between sleep quality and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) course.
   Methods: Forty patients with Relapsing-Remitting MS were admitted. Based on the score obtained by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), they were divided into good sleepers (<5) and bad sleepers (>= 5). A set of data was collected retrospectively for each patient to investigate whether PSQI scores correlated with EDSS score changes, the number and the duration of each relapse and the cumulative day-number of MS reactivations over a three-year period.
   Results: In a multivariate model, a PSQI score >= 5 independently and significantly correlated with an increase in number and duration of relapses (p = 0.000) and number of days of MS activity (p = 0.000) during the three-year retrospective observation period.
   Conclusions: The results of this study show that the course of MS may be influenced by sleep quality. Assessment of sleep quality could be used to obtain reliable prognostic information in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate whether the correction of sleep disorders may be effective in improving the prognosis of MS patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Our study aimed to assess the variation in serum C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), a biomarker of peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress, in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS).
   Methods: The study included a total of 380 individuals including 197 with RLS diagnosis. RLS diagnosis was determined according to the "International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group" questionnaire. Disease severity was assessed according to the "International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Severity Scale''.
   Results: The mean age of patients with restless legs syndrome was 52.5 +/- 12.7 years, while the mean age in the control group was 50.8 +/- 11.2, with no statistically significant difference found (p = 0.156). The hemoglobin, iron and ferritin levels in the patient group were lower than in the control group (p < 0.001; p < 0.01; p < 0.001), with total iron binding capacity levels higher than the control group (p < 0.001). The mean ferritin in the RLS group (49.8 +/- 51.2) was lower than the control group (76.9 +/- 44.7). In patients, the c-reactive protein, albumin and c-reactive protein/albumin ratio were found to be 0.21 +/- 0.18, 4.43 +/- 0.31 and 0.07 +/- 0.05, respectively. When compared with the control group, the patient group had high c-reactive protein (CRP), CAR and low albumin levels (p < 0.001). Among patients with "very severe" disease severity, ferritin levels were found to be lower than those with "moderate" disease severity. Additionally, patients with "very severe" disease had albumin levels which were significantly low compared to those with "mild" disease severity (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our study supports the hypothesis that serum albumin level, ferritin, CRP, and CAR may be associated with restless legs syndrome. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   DURATION
AB Objective/Background: Poor quality and inadequate sleep are associated with impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral components of sport performance and increased injury risk. While prior work identifies sports-related concussions as predisposing factors for poor sleep, the role of sleep as a sports-related concussion risk factor is unknown. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of poor sleep quality and insomnia symptoms on future sports-related concussion risk.
   Patients/Methods: In this study, 190 NCAA Division-1 athletes completed a survey battery, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Sleep module. Univariate risk ratios for future sports-related concussions were computed with ISI and NHANES sleepiness scores as independent predictors. An additional multiple logistic regression model including sport, sports-related concussion history, and significant univariate predictors jointly assessed the odds of sustaining a concussion.
   Results: Clinically moderate-to-severe insomnia severity (RR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.320-7.424, p = 0.015) and excessive daytime sleepiness two or more times per month (RR = 2.856, 95% CI: 0.681-11.977, p = 0.037) increased concussion risk. These variables remained significant and comparable in magnitude in a multivariate model adjusted for sport participation.
   Conclusion: Insomnia and daytime sleepiness are independently associated with increased sports-related concussion risk. More completely identifying bidirectional relationships between concussions and sleep requires further research. Clinicians and athletes should be cognizant of this relationship and take proactive measures - including assessing and treating sleep-disordered breathing, limiting insomnia risk factors, improving sleep hygiene, and developing daytime sleepiness management strategies e to reduce sports-related concussion risk and support overall athletic performance.

AB Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of acoustic pharyngometry and rhinometry in assessing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome in children.
   Patients/Methods: Patients who were hospitalized for polysomnography underwent acoustic pharyngometry and rhinometry in sitting and supine positions to measure anatomical (pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal) volumes and collapsibility characteristics (reduction of pharyngeal volume, estimated pharyngeal compliance, and reduction of nasopharyngeal volume).
   Results: In this study, we prospectively enrolled 103 children (median age, 10.4 years; 47 girls). Measures obtained from rhinometry correlated with height and were further height-normalized whereas measures obtained from pharyngometry did not correlate with height. Sleep apnea was ruled out in 51 subjects, while 52 children fulfilled OSA criteria (35 with obstructive apnea-hypopnea index >= 2 and < 5.h(-1) [mild] and 17 with an index >= 5). The three groups differed on the z-score of BMI, the reduction of pharyngeal volume when supine, the estimated pharyngeal compliance and the supine normalized nasopharyngeal volume. These four factors linearly correlated with the apnea index even though children without OSA and mild OSA were found to be similar overall. A multivariate analysis with apnea index as the dependent variable and BMI z-score, neck circumference, mean pharyngeal area in supine position, estimated pharyngeal compliance and normalized nasopharyngeal volume as independent variables, showed that only BMI z-score and estimated compliance remained independent predictors of obstructive apnea (r(2) value = 0.25, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: An increase in pharyngeal compliance is an independent risk factor of OSA syndrome in children; it can be measured using acoustic pharyngometry while awake. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Changes of sleep architecture have been reported in children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 2 (SMA2), mainly represented by a decrease of arousability. No studies have evaluated the effect of long-term ventilation on sleep parameters in these children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (LTNPPV) on sleep architecture and to assess the residual differences from normal controls.
   Methods: Nine consecutive children with SMA2 underwent two distinct polysomnographic (PSG) studies, one in spontaneous breathing, and subsequently after LTNPPV. The results were then compared to 15 age-matched controls.
   Results: SMA2 patients showed only slightly modified sleep architecture on LTNPPV: increased stage N2% and decreased number of awakenings, while several significant differences persisted between SMA2 patients on LTNPPV and controls (decreased total sleep time, number of awakenings, sleep efficiency, and percentage of REM sleep). Sleep microstructure, evaluated by means of the Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) showed only marginal changes on LTNPPV (small shortening of CAP A1 subtype duration and small increase in CAP A3 index). Conversely, CAP parameters on LTNPPV showed significant differences between SMA2 patients vs. controls, with increased A1 subtype percentage and decreased percentage of A2 and A3 subtypes.
   Conclusions: This is the first study in children affected by SMA2 reporting data on sleep microstructure and their changes after LTNPPV. We found persisting, small but important changes in sleep microstructure during LTNPPV in these children, suggesting that this treatment only partially improves their arousability.

AB Objective: To determine the associations between sleep duration and hypertension in Chinese adults. Methods: This longitudinal study analyzed 9851 adults who had participated in at least two rounds of the CHNS (China Health and Nutrition Survey) during 2004-2011. Sleep duration was classified into <= 7, 8, and >= 9 h. Age, sex, residence location, education level, smoking, drinking alcohol, drinking tea, drinking coffee, activity level, and body mass index were adjusted as confounders in a generalized linear mixed model.
   Results: The unadjusted analysis showed that compared with a normal sleep duration (8 h), the odds ratios (ORs) for those with short (<= 7 h) and long (>= 9 h) sleep durations were 1.24 and 1.17, respectively (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 1.14-1.36 and 1.06-1.29). After adjusting for confounding factors, the effect of a short sleep duration on hypertension was still statistically significant, with an OR of 1.13 (95% CI = 1.04-1.24), while a long sleep duration no longer had a statistically significant effect.
   Conclusions: A short sleep duration is an independent risk factor for adult hypertension, whereas a long sleep duration is not in Chinese adults. The prevalence of hypertension should be prevented and controlled by improving the sleep status of adults. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In healthy populations, irregular sleep patterns are associated with delayed sleep and poor functional/mood outcomes. Currently, it is unknown whether irregular sleep contributes to poor functional/mood outcomes in individuals with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD).
   Methods: In 170 patients with DSWPD, we collected sleep-wake patterns, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), and functional/mood outcomes. The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) and other sleep timing metrics were computed. Correlations of SRI were computed with phase angle (difference between DLMO and desired bedtime), sleep timing and quality variables, daytime function, sleep-related daytime impairment, mood, and insomnia symptom severity. Path analyses assessed whether SRI or total sleep time mediated the associations between sleep onset time and phase angle with daytime functioning, sleep-related impairment, and mood outcomes.
   Results: Higher SRI was associated with earlier sleep and longer total sleep time, but did not relate to sleep quality, daytime function, or mood outcomes. Path analysis showed that phase angle was directly associated with all outcome variables, whereas sleep onset time was not directly associated with any. SRI mediated the effects of sleep onset time and phase angle on daytime function. Total sleep time mediated the effects of sleep onset time and phase angle on sleep-related impairment.
   Conclusion: Individuals with DSWPD who have more delayed sleep and a greater phase angle also have more irregular sleep. This suggests that it is not delayed sleep timing per se that drives poor functional outcomes in DSWPD, but rather the timing of sleep relative to circadian phase and resultant irregular sleep patterns.

   Anomalous experiences; Parasomnia; Hallucinations
ID INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX; PREVALENCE; SAMPLE
AB Objective: Isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) is a relatively common parasomnia often accompanied by fear and distress. However, little is known about the range and relative severities of typical ISP symptoms and accompanying hallucinations. Furthermore, there have been inconsistent findings with regard to demographic differences in ISP.
   Patients/Method: In sum, 185 individuals with ISP (and 322 controls) were assessed for 27 symptoms and hallucinations using a clinical interview and trained diagnosticians. Insomnia symptoms were also assessed.
   Results: Rates of ISP did not differ according to gender or ethnic minority status, but higher levels of insomnia were associated with episodes. The participants with ISP reported a mean of 7.73 symptoms beyond atonia. Hallucinations of the presence of others were relatively common. Specifically, 57.84% of the sample sensed a presence in the room with them during ISP, and the majority believed it to be a non-human presence. In addition, 21.62% of the sample experienced visual hallucinations of others, with the majority perceiving strangers as opposed to known individuals. A panoply of supernatural/paranormal entities were reported by the 24.32% of participants who hallucinated non-human beings. A minority of individuals with ISP experienced clinically-significant distress (10.27%) and/or impairment (7.57%) as a result of episodes.
   Conclusion: ISP episodes were complex and often multisensorial experiences, and the majority of assessed symptoms were associated with clinically-significant levels of fear/distress. Vivid hallucinations of other people and entities were common as well, and it is recommended that ISP be assessed when patients report seemingly anomalous experiences. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The study aimed to examine the 12-month course of cancer-related insomnia (CRI) and to identify possible predictors for the prevalence and persistence of CRI.
   Methods: This longitudinal multicenter study included N = 405 patients with cancer (56% females, mean age: 58.6 years). CRI was measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Socio-demographic and clinical data, as well as psychological parameters (Distress Thermometer, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and EORTC-Fatigue), were assessed at baseline (T1) and 12 months later (T2).
   Results: In our sample, a high prevalence of relevant insomnia symptoms (49.4%, ISI > 7) was found, while a clinical insomnia diagnosis was verified in 12.8% (ISI > 14). When insomnia was present at T1, this problem was persistent after one year in 64%. At T2, however, significantly more women suffered from insomnia symptoms (53.3% women vs. 39.3% men; p = 0.003). Insomnia was associated with many clinical and psychological parameters, especially with fatigue (r = 0.5). Multiple regression analysis revealed that, in women, only insomnia at T1 was a significant predictor for insomnia at T2 (R-2 = 0.40; F(5) = 12.5; p < 0.001), whereas in men insomnia, depressive symptoms and the use of psychotropic drugs at T1 predicted the extent of insomnia at T2 (R-2 = 0.28; F(7) = 9.5; p < 0.001). In all participants, levels of distress, depression, and anxiety decreased from T1 to T2 (p's < 0.016).
   Conclusion: Insomnia is a common disorder in cancer patients. Although medical and psychological parameters improved during the 12-month course of cancer treatment, our results show that insomnia is highly persistent, especially in women. This indicates that adequate support for those affected is needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate in a sample of low-income families whether the quality of parent-child interactions mediated the association between coparenting and child sleep, and if this association was moderated by parents' anxiety.
   Method: In sum, 81 two-parent families with a preschool child (aged 3 to 5 years) and receiving social security benefits were recruited. Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires assessing coparenting, parental anxiety, and child sleep duration and sleep problems. Quality of mother-child and father-child interactions was evaluated by independent observers from videotaped free play sequences in the home environment.
   Results: Results showed that preschoolers' sleep duration was unrelated to paternal factors but associated with maternal factors. Specifically, coparenting predicted children's sleep duration through its effect on the quality of mother-child interactions, but only for dyads in which mothers were clinically anxious. Preschoolers' sleep problems were related to coparenting, quality of mother-child and father-child interactions, and mothers' but not fathers' anxiety.
   Conclusion: The current results suggest that both parents play a complementary role in children's sleep. Likewise, different pathways and interactions were found in relation to sleep duration and problems, emphasizing the complexity of the links between family factors and sleep processes. Overall, this study helps to clarify some of the associations between parental characteristics and preschoolers' sleep within a sample of low-income families. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, is often underestimated because it requires a burdensome test (ie, polysomnography) to ensure diagnosis. To improve polysomnography referral, it is of utmost importance to validate efficient alternative screening tools. This study aimed to provide a translation and a cross-cultural validation of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) into French to obtain an easy-to-use and reliable screening tool. The psychometric properties of the French version were also determined.
   Methods: The process of cross-cultural adaptation was carried out following these steps: forward-backward translation, evaluation by an expert committee, and pretesting of the pre-final version. Reliability of the French-PSQ version was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficients and Spearman's correlation on a convenient sample of 201 children (aged between 2 and 17 years). Construct validity was determined by factor analysis of principal components.
   Results: Internal consistency was within an adequate range for all subscales: 0.711 for snoring, 0.559 for sleepiness, 0.682 for behavioral problems, and 0.776 for the whole questionnaire. Spearman's correlation analysis comparing questionnaires administered two weeks apart showed good correlation coefficients for all subscales (snoring: 0.642, sleepiness: 0.846, behavioral problems: 0.780, and entire SRBD scale: 0.835). Factor analysis performed to assess the structure of the French-SRBD scale confirmed the same four factors described in the original questionnaire ("breathing," "behavior," "sleepiness," and "other").
   Conclusion: The French version of the PSQ has been successfully cross-culturally adapted and showed good psychometric properties, suggesting that it is useful as a tool to screen sleep-disordered breathing in French-speaking children. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Disturbances in the reward network of the brain underlie addiction, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The ventral capsule/ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) region is a clinically approved target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review to define clinically relevant anatomy and connectivity of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum and NAc region to guide target selection for deep brain stimulation.
   RESULTS: Architecturally and functionally, the NAc is divided into the core and the shell, with each area having different connections. The shell primarily receives limbic information, and the core typically receives information from the motor system. In general, afferents from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are excitatory. The dopaminergic projections to the NAc from the ventral tegmental area modulate the balance of these excitatory inputs. Several important inputs to the NAc converge at the junction of the internal capsule (IC) and the anterior commissure (AC): the ventral amygdalofugal pathways that run parallel to and underneath the AC, the precommissural fornical fibers that run anterior to the AC, axons from the ventral prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex that occupy the most ventral part of the IC and embedding within the NAc and AC, and the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle located parallel to the anterior thalamic radiation in the IC.
   CONCLUSIONS: The caudal part of the NAc passing through the IC-AC junction may be an effective target for deep brain stimulation to improve behavioral symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the time trade-off (TT0) method reflects health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 10 years after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods approach was used to follow up 208 patients treated for aSAH. Data were collected with intramethod mixing; the quantitative data consisted of the EQ-5D-3L instrument and a TT0 question, and the qualitative data comprised motivations to the TT0 answer. The quantitative data were analyzed statistically and comparisons were made between participants willing to trade off years and those not willing to trade off years. The qualitative data were merged in a matrix and analyzed with manifest content analysis.
   RESULTS: Participants willing to trade off years scored significantly lower HRQoL, and the correlation between EQ-5D(index) and EQ VAS to TT0 values were r(s) = 0.369 (P < 0.001) and r(s) = 0.345 (P < 0.001), respectively. In the content analysis, 4 categories emerged: perceived full health or satisfactory life; adaptability and managing strategies; the importance of hope and meaning in life; and unacceptable changes do not make life worth living. The results showed that several reasons other than health status were evident when expressing the willingness to trade off or not trade off life-years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Individuals willing to trade off years showed significantly poorer HRQoL; however the TT0 method did not seem to fully reflect HRQoL. Most participants did not want to trade off years, despite their living with severe disability, making it difficult to fully rely on the TT0 method in evaluation of medical outcome.

DE Penetrating injury; Pterional craniotomy; Tuberculum sellae
ID INJURY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Penetrating injuries are dangerous because they can damage intracranial structures. Removal of the object carries this same risk of injury, so neurosurgeons often visualize the injury via craniotomy during removal.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This report illustrates the case of a 41-year-old man who had a penetrating injury with a knife that started in the left nasal passage and extended to the parasellar region. Computed tomography angiography revealed an associated sphenoid fracture and showed the tip of the knife within the parasellar space with preservation of the internal carotid artery, ophthalmic artery, optic nerve, and pituitary gland. The patient was taken to the operating room for a right pterional craniotomy and the knife was removed in the operating room in a combined effort between neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient progressed well without complications post-operatively and was discharged 5 days later. We provide a report with video showing our surgical approach for removal of a penetrating object through the tuberculum sellae.

   ANASTOMOSIS; SEGMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysms are relatively rare, and neck clipping is often difficult due to their fusiform shape. We report a case of a thrombosed aneurysm of the distal PCA for which curative trapping and parent artery reconstruction by in situ bypass were performed through an occipital transtentorial approach (OTA).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old woman had been suffering from numbness in the right face and limbs for 4 months. Radiologic imaging demonstrated a thrombosed aneurysm on a distal portion of the left PCA. Curative trapping of the aneurysm and in-situ bypass between the distal PCA and superior cerebellar artery were performed through the OTA. Before surgery, we had evaluated access to the PCA and feasibility of the bypass in a cadaveric simulation. The PCA was well exposed in the posterior half of the ambient cistern, and the proximity of the distal PCA to the superior cerebellar artery through a tentorial incision was confirmed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This OTA could represent a useful option for definitive treatment of distal PCA aneurysms.

   CAVE; SURVIVAL; RADIOSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for similar to 8% of all brain metastatic disease; however, spread to the cranial nerves and their ganglia is uncommon. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of RCC metastatic to Meckel's cave, which was diagnosed secondary to new trigeminal sensory loss.
   METHODS: A 45-year-old man had presented with acute-onset right V3 numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated contrast enhancement of the ipsilateral V3, extending from its root at the Gasserian ganglion to the foramen ovale.
   RESULTS: He elected for observation, and his symptoms resolved over several weeks. At the scheduled, routine 3-month follow-up examination, he reported symptomatic relapse with new concomitant hyperesthetic/neuropathic pain. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated interval enlargement of the enhancing lesion in an atypical pattern, potentially consistent with trigeminal schwannoma versus meningioma, and operative resection was recommended.
   CONCLUSION: We have reported a case of RCC presenting with numbness via metastatic spread to Meckel's cave. Although uncommon, metastasis is an important diagnostic consideration for enhancing cranial nerve lesions. Our case has demonstrated that, although a history of malignancy, multiple lesions, or systemic/constitutional symptoms are typical, rare cases can demonstrate isolated central nervous system findings. Thus, short-term radiographic surveillance is indicated if the diagnosis of an intracranial or cranial nerve mass lesion is equivocal.

ID MANAGEMENT; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic transsphenoidal resection has become the primary approach for resection of pituitary macroadenomas. However, challenges such as narrow sinuses, dense tumor consistency, and invasion of surrounding structures exist.
   METHODS: We report a case in which the Artemis Neuro Evacuation device was used to endonasally remove a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar and parasellar extensions. The methodology and technical aspects of this device's novel use are illustrated.
   RESULTS: The long and narrow wand of the Artemis system allowed the operators to navigate through patient's narrow sinuses. Despite a dense tumor that did not come easily into a suction, the entire tumor debulking procedure lasted <10 minutes with the preservation of an intact arachnoid membrane using the Artemis. No perioperative complication was encountered, and the patient's neurologic deficits resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first reported case of the Artemis system's utility in the treatment of pituitary tumor beyond cranial hema-toma and hemorrhage.

ID PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; BLISTER-LIKE ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR
   TREATMENT; DIVERTOR TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP; COILING; TRIAL
AB OBJECTIVE: The use and timing of flow diversion for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is controversial. The objective of this study is to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to compare overall complication rate between early versus delayed flow diversion for ruptured aneurysms.
   METHODS: A literature search for all eligible articles was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. The primary outcome was the overall complication rate (any complication in the perioperative period), and secondary outcomes were 1) hemorrhage and 2) stroke/death (all hemorrhagic/ischemic strokes and/or death).
   RESULTS: Thirteen articles including 142 patients met inclusion criteria. Eighty-nine (62.7%) patients underwent early deployment of flow diverters (i.e., 2 days or less). The odds ratio for overall complication rate with early versus delayed flow diversion was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-2.49, P = 0.42). The odds ratio for the secondary outcome of hemorrhagic complication for early versus delayed flow diversion was 1.44 (95% CI 0.45-4.52, P = 0.87) and of stroke/death was 1.67 (95% CI 0.5-4.9, P = 0.69). The odds ratio of early versus delayed flow diversion for blister/dissecting/fusiform aneurysms was 0.82 (95% CI 0.29-2.30) and for saccular/giant aneurysms was 2.23 (95% CI 0.17-29.4). At last follow-up, 71.6% of patients had good performance status (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), and the rate of angiographic aneurysm occlusion was 90.2%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis did not show a difference in overall complication rate between early versus delayed flow diversion for ruptured aneurysms.

ID DURAL INVASION; CUSHINGS-DISEASE; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Removal of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus (MW) is challenging for neurosurgeons. We describe a practical method of endoscopic MW removal via endonasal transsphenoidal approach to minimalize intraoperative blood loss and postoperative morbidities. We also present the pathologic significance of this technique for functional pituitary adenomas (FPAs).
   METHODS: We performed MW removal in patients with FPA with no well-defined pseudocapsule and a tumor in direct contact with the MW. The MW was judged to have tumor invasion based on the intraoperative appearance, and it was removed regardless of the appearance of MW involvement. Intraoperative findings and postoperative clinical, endocrinologic, and pathologic outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent MW removal for FPA, including 12 patients with acromegaly and 2 with Cushing disease. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 170 mL (range, 32-400 mL), and none of the patients required blood transfusion. Among the 7 patients without intraoperative apparent MW involvement, 4 (57.1%) had pathologically confirmed tumor invasion into the MW (occult invasion). Biochemical remission by surgery alone was achieved in 13 patients (92.9%). Transient oculomotor palsy occurred in 1 patient (7.1%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Occult tumor invasion into the MW was often detected in patients with FPA without a well-defined pseudocapsule but in direct contact with the MW. Our technique can enhance the effectiveness of surgery with minimal postoperative morbidities.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB BACKGROUND: Medical publications reflect the development of training, research, and health services. No objective data are available regarding neurosurgical publications from Morocco. Bibliometrics were used to evaluate the contribution of Moroccan neurosurgeons (MONSs) in neurosurgical journals worldwide and to discuss the strategies that can be applied to increase the quantity and quality of publications on this subject.
   METHODS: A literature search of reports by MONSs was performed using the PubMed database. The number and quality of the reports were evaluated with the impact factor of the neurosurgical journals and the h-index of each first author.
   RESULTS: The data from 174 identified studies reported from 1989 to 2018 were analyzed. MONSs have continued to report more studies every year worldwide. However, their contribution to neurosurgical journals has been gradually declining since 2012. Scientific publishing was limited to a few great neurosurgical departments and a few academic neurosurgeons in Morocco. Most of the reports were case reports, reported in the French language, included in non-neurosurgical journals, from single centers, and without international collaboration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Academic neurosurgeons in Morocco should prepare their residents and young researchers on research methodology and medical writing. Moroccan neurosurgical research should be more focused on modern neurosurgical topics by highlighting our particularities. More high level of evidence studies should be reported in English-language neurosurgical journals with a high impact factor and good scientific reputation. MONSs should continue to collaborate more often with each other and with foreign centers to further improve the quality and number of international publications, regardless of the difficulties they face.

   TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Cryoprobe devices are used by ophthalmic and orbital surgeons for extraction of fluid-filled intraorbital lesions. No series has described cryodissection via an exclusively transnasal approach. We describe 2 cases of purely endoscopic transnasal removal of intraconal orbital hemangiomas with the aid of a dedicated cryoprobe.
   METHODS: All transnasal endoscopic intraorbital procedures were collected and analyzed. In cases in which intraorbital dissection was performed with the use of an Optikon Cryo-line probe, clinical features, histology, size and location of the lesion, early and late complications, surgical procedure time, and hospital length of stay were analyzed. Patient follow-up included endoscopic endo-nasal evaluations performed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery and ophthalmologic and orthoptic evaluations performed 2 days and 2 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: Two transnasal intraorbital endoscopic procedures with the aid of the dedicated Cryo-line probe were collected. Lesions were located in the intraconal space, medial to the optic nerve. In both patients, the histologic evaluation was compatible with cavernous hemangioma, and complete resection was obtained. Mean hospital stay was 5.5 days. Postoperative ophthalmologic and orthoptic evaluations performed 2 months postoperatively revealed complete resolution of preoperative symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cryoprobes represent an adjunctive tool in the orbital surgeon's armamentarium useful in the extraction of fluid-filled intraorbital lesions. This preliminary experience suggests that their use can ease the removal of intraconal hemangiomas with an exclusively transnasal approach. The analysis of further cases is necessary to confirm safety and efficacy.

TI Multiple Spinal Intramedullary Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors
   Mimicking Acute Myelitis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Magnetic resonance imaging; Myelitis; Spinal cord tumor; Spinal
   primitive neuroectodermal tumors
AB BACKGROUND: Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are rare malignant neoplasms in the spinal cord that comprise undifferentiated or poorly differentiated neural crest cells. PNETs imaging findings lack specificity, making diagnosis difficult.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old male patient presented with progressive weakness and numbness of the lower extremities for 1 month, which occurred after a cold. Significantly elevated protein levels were detected in his cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple patchy or spindle-shaped hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging, which is similar to acute myelitis imaging findings. However, the effect of hormone treatment was minimal. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid showed significant enhancement of intramedullary lesions and the meninges, which was diagnosed as tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. After therapy with quadruple antituberculosis treatment for 1 week, however, the T-spot was negative. Therefore, the antituberculosis regimen was ceased. Atypical cells were observed in cerebrospinal fluid from a third lumbar puncture. Next, most of the thoracic intramedullary lesions were resected. By histopathology, these lesions manifested as PNETs.
   CONCLUSIONS: This paper reports a very rare case of PNETs with multiple lesions in the spinal cord that mimicked acute myelitis and emphasizes that multiple PNETs lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging could have an initial acute myelitis-like presentation, which should be considered a differential diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: There have been a few previous reports of trigeminal neuralgia caused by bony structures. We report a rare case of trigeminal neuralgia caused by petrous bone deformity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A-43-year-old man with facial pain in the left maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve was referred to our hospital. Computed tomography showed bone hyperplasia protruding into the left cerebellopontine cistern, compressing the left trigeminal nerve. Administration of carbamazepine ameliorated facial pain, but the effect was unsatisfactory, and microvascular decompression was performed through the anterior transpetrosal approach. The protruding petrous bone was drilled out to release compression of the trigeminal nerve, thus straightening the deviated trajectory of the nerve. The superior cerebellar artery adjacent to the thickened petrosal bone seemed to have compressed the trigeminal nerve and was also transposed. The facial pain disappeared completely after microvascular decompression surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anterior transpetrosal approach is an appropriate and essential strategy for trigeminal neuralgia caused by petrous bone deformity of the petrous apex.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical diseases have a devastating impact on society. It is estimated that approximately 14 million essential neurosurgical cases develop worldwide annually, of which more than 80% arise in low- and middle-income countries. Neurosurgical cadaveric dissection remains largely unexploited as a learning tool for the training of surgeons in developing countries, often because of the assumed high costs.
   METHODS: The minimum requirements to establish a neurosurgical cadaver laboratory are the availability of minimally equipped environment to perform dissection, respecting safety requirements, fitting surgical instruments, anatomic samples, and materials to be used for preservation and preparation of anatomical specimens. Moving from these basic foundations, we established our Neurosurgical Dissection Laboratory at Fondazione Poli-clinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, Italy. The laboratory is located at the Institute of Public Health Section of Legal Medicine of University.
   RESULTS: After reviewing relevant literature and discussing our experience, we provide advice for setting up a neurosurgical dissection cadaver laboratory with specific focus on suitable location identification, surgical equipment procurement, fresh cadaver and frozen specimen acquisition, and preparation and description of a step-up strategy to progressively enrich the laboratory.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a neurosurgical cadaver dissection laboratory for training and research purposes even in presence of limited resources. The introduction of cost-effective guidelines and targeted funding could represent an added value to target the unmet neurosurgical disease need by promoting development of local neurosurgical expertise with the aim of providing health coverage for the treatment of common neurosurgical pathologies in developing countries.

ID CERVICAL-SPINE; BODY
AB BACKGROUND: Destruction of the spine is a huge complication of infectious spondylitis and surgical intervention is required. However, vertebral defect is a major problem after surgical intervention and numerous methods have been researched to solve this problem. There are known methods that use variously designed, patient-customized 3-dimensional (3D)-printed implants in various medical fields. The use of 3D-printed implants has also been attempted in treating defects in the spine. We present a case of failure of expandable titanium cage fusion after infection, treated using a 3D-printed implant.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient had undergone reconstruction surgery with expandable titanium cage due to infectious spondylitis and needed reoperation owing to recurrence of infections and failure of bone fusion. The problem we faced in this operation was a large vertebral defect, for which we used a 3D-printed implant. After 3 years of follow-up, the implant and bone fusion were intact and infection or mechanical complications were not seen.
   CONCLUSIONS: A 3D-printed implant could be an acceptable and alternative treatment option for replacing a large vertebral defect.

AB BACKGROUND: Experiencing a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt complication is a major obstacle in the management of hydrocephalus. Degradation of a shunt catheter associated with surrounding tissue calcification could be 1 reason for a difference in facture rates. Furthermore, tissue reactions around cerebrospinal fluid shunts may be a sign of bacterial shunt infection, which is not uncommon.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old man was living with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt since childhood. Consequently, his cerebrospinal fluid absorption was supposed to be modified by the shunt. Shunt malfunction later occurred concomitant with symptoms of headache and repeated vomiting. He had undergone shunt revision a year before presentation, but examination revealed that a new, extremely rare calcified lesion had formed in the aponeurosis of the abdomen, compressing the shunt tube. We removed it and replaced the shunt tube, thus relieving his symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: We treated a rare case of shunt dysfunction caused by calcification of the aponeurosis coinciding with significant weight gain over the course of a year. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a case of shunt malfunction caused by calcification of the aponeurosis.

TI Hydrocephalic Attack-An Uncommon Complication of Spine Surgery: A Case
   Series and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Hydrocephalic attack; Intracranial pressure; MRI CSF flow study;
   Pseudomeningocele
ID LUMBAR PSEUDOMENINGOCELE; SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal pseudomeningocele refers to an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a fibrous sac without arachnoid lining that occurs mostly as a result of an accidental dural opening. When accidental dural openings are found intraoperatively, they should be repaired to prevent further complications. Sometimes inadequately dealt dural openings, unnoticed, or postoperative dural openings may produce complications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Three patients had complications as a result of spine surgery and presented several days after the surgery with episodic symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, including headache, opisthotonos, altered breathing patterns, and altered sensorium. These symptoms increased whenever pressure was applied on the operated area suggesting hydrocephalic attacks. All 3 patients had a giant pseudomeningocele at the operated area, a complication that resulted from the spine surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging CSF flow study revealed hyperdynamic flow and increase in absolute stroke volume across the cerebral aqueduct when constant pressure was applied on the pseudomeningocele sac.
   CONCLUSIONS: Usually pseudomeningoceles are asymptomatic, and if symptomatic, the common presentations are local swelling, back pain, radiculopathy, and orthostatic headache. To our knowledge, this is the first article in the literature reporting the uncommon presentation of hydrocephalic attacks in 3 cases subsequent to CSF backflow from the sac, confirmed with MRI CSF flow study. This case series emphasizes rare presentations can result from transiently increased intracranial pressure related to postoperative pseudomeningocele in spine surgeries.

TI Craniocervical Osteoradionecrosis Treated with Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant
   Hyperbaric Oxygen in Combination with Posterior Spinal Fusion
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical spine; Craniocervical; Hyperbaric oxygen; Osteomyelitis;
   Osteoradionecrosis; Radiation therapy
ID CERVICAL-SPINE; RADIATION-THERAPY; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for malignant head and neck cancers includes a risk for off-target effects to bony structures, posing a risk for osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Patients in whom ORN develops can also harbor concomitant osteomyelitis and reduced healing capacity, making for a particularly challenging entity to treat. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mandibular ORN in the otolaryngology literature; yet, few reports exist detailing its utility when treating ORN of the craniocervical junction. Herein, we report 2 cases of ORN of the craniocervical junction who received both neoadjuvant and adjuvant HBO in combination with posterior spinal fusion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients with craniocervical junction ORN were treated with HBO delivered over 20 sessions before and after surgery in 90-minute treatments to 2.5 atmospheres of pressure. The patients underwent posterior occipital-cervical fusions with an average operative time of 301 (+/- 21.5) minutes with 250 (+/- 150) mL of blood loss. Both patients stayed in the hospital for 5 days, with no periprocedural complications. Outcomes included a 30% improvement of global assessment of function on follow-up EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire. Postoperative imaging demonstrated solid bony fusion, and both patients returned to full work duty.
   CONCLUSIONS: ORN is a difficult-to-treat radiation complication in head and neck cancers. Few reports exist detailing treatment options for ORN of the craniocervical junction in conjunction with surgical stabilization. We report 2 successful cases of HBO-assisted treatment of ORN and highlight the important role HBO can play in promoting bony fusion in these at-risk patients.

TI Intracranial Angiomatoid Fibrous Histiocytoma with EWSR1-CREB Family
   Fusions: A Report of 2 Pediatric Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Angiomatoid; Fibrous; Histiocytoma; Intracranial; Pediatric
ID VARIANT; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas (AFHs) are very rare tumors. Histologically, classical cases have been reported exclusively in adults, with myxoid variants identified only in children. Here, we report the clinical presentation, treatment, biopsy, and molecular test results for 2 children with classical intracranial AFH and combine this with a literature review of published intracranial AFH and AFH-like cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two young girls presenting with abnormal neurologic signs, received diagnoses of intracranial AFHs from histopathologic analysis. No myxoid features were identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing demonstrated EWS1-ATF1 and EWS1-CREM gene fusions, respectively, verified by Sanger sequencing. Both patients underwent surgery only. The first child experienced local recurrence 5 years from initial surgery. Following a further complete resection, this patient has remained recurrence free over a subsequent 6-year follow-up period. The second patient has recently experienced local multinodular recurrence 28 months after initial surgery and is awaiting surgical re-excision. No additional chemotherapy/radiotherapy has been administered to either patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the first 2 cases of nonmyxoid intracranial AFH in children; confirmed by molecular analysis. Our results suggest that a tumor spectrum incorporating classical and myxoid intracranial AFHs can occur in children and that gross total resection represents the treatment strategy of choice at diagnosis or following recurrence.

DE Angiosarcoma; Embolization; Middle meningeal artery; Skull; Subdural
   hematoma
ID METASTASIS; SCALP
AB BACKGROUND: Angiosarcoma often arises as a cutaneous disease in the scalp and the face; however, subdural hematoma (SDH) associated with angiosarcoma is extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old woman visited our hospital with gait disorder and progressive consciousness disturbance approximately 3 months after a minor head injury. Initially, on reviewing the results of imaging studies, she was diagnosed with traumatic chronic SDH. Despite repeated operations thereafter, including the embolization of the middle meningeal artery, her general condition progressively worsened, and computed tomography of head repeatedly showed the recurrence of SDH. Based on histopathologic and intraoperative findings, she was finally diagnosed with angiosarcoma originating from the skull. She died shortly thereafter because of aggressive recurrent intracranial SDH caused by leptomeningeal dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to cancers metastatic to the skull or dura mater, angiosarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients with repeated SDH and bone defect. An effective treatment for angiosarcoma with SDH that shows an unfavorable prognosis has not been established; however, an early diagnosis might be useful for a novel treatment.

ID VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS; CLOSURE DEVICES; FLUOROSCOPY; GUIDANCE;
   PUNCTURE; TRIAL
AB PURPOSE: The transfemoral approach is widely used by neurointerventionalists for accessing the femoral artery in patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic endovascular procedures. In patients with more difficult anatomy, duplex ultrasonography (US) may be a valuable adjunct for femoral vascular access. We aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of duplex US-guided femoral access within interventional neuroradiology.
   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE and included 5 randomized controlled trials. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences were pooled using the random-effects model.
   RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 5 RCTs that included 784 US-guided patients and 769 non-US-guided patients found that the US-guided approach was significantly favored in terms of time-to-access (weighted mean difference: 24.90 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.41-37.38), first-pass success rate (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.49-5.92), and total complication rate (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.77). There were no statistically significant differences in technical success rate, number of attempts, or individual complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: US-guided femoral artery access for endovascular procedures is a safe and effective adjunct for visualizing the femoral artery during vascular access for endovascular procedures. Neurointerventionalists should consider a low threshold for its use, especially for patients with challenging anatomy or at high-risk of bleeding complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) aneurysm is regarded as a rare lesion. What is more, patients can suffer from EICA aneurysms and hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD) simultaneously.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man was admitted to our hospital and underwent emergent tracheal intubation for hoarseness and breathing difficulty for 1 day. He had a pulsating mass of 2.5 cm in diameter in the left cervical area. Imaging examinations revealed the left EICA aneurysm and MMD. The patient underwent left superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and ligation of the left EICA simultaneously. Computed tomography revealed hemorrhagic stroke in the right basal ganglia region 20 days after the bypass. The hematoma disappeared 20 days after the stroke. Right bypass was performed 6 months after the left bypass. The patient was discharged with no neurologic abnormalities 10 days after the right bypass. He lived a normal life, and no neurologic abnormalities were found at the 6-month follow-up. Imaging examinations indicated the efficacy of the bilateral STA-MCA bypass and verified the disappearance of the left EICA aneurysm after the ligation.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of EICA aneurysm and hemorrhagic MMD. Ligation of the left ECA eliminates the EICA aneurysm with no neurologic abnormalities. STA-MCA bypass can be regarded as an effective choice for hemorrhagic MMD. Further studies should be performed to confirm the effectiveness of combined surgical revascularization.

   Central Herniation Masquerading as Seizures: Hydrocephalus Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brainstem herniation; Electroencephalogram; Shunt malfunction; Slit
   ventricle syndrome
AB BACKGROUND: Slit-ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a recognized complication of ventricular shunt malfunction, resulting in cyclical symptoms without ventricular dilatation. We present a case of SVS with transient, repetitive, and progressive signs of brainstem herniation evidenced by pupillary dilatation, posturing, and unresponsiveness, with diffuse voltage attenuation on electroencephalogram (EEG).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old female presented with a history of hydrocephalus and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement at 9 months of age. She began experiencing significant headaches in college, later accompanied by stereotypical 5- to 25-minute episodes of unresponsiveness, posturing and pupillary dilatation, and failing anticonvulsant therapy. No neurosurgical evaluation was sought because of small ventricles on brain imaging. Episodes became progressively more frequent over a 10-year period, eventually occurring daily. On presentation, 5 clinical events were captured on EEG over 12 hours of monitoring.
   With each episode, she became unresponsive and hypertensive, with fixed, dilated pupils and flexor posturing. Between events, she was awake and alert, without confusion or postictal state. She had papilledema and limited extraocular movements, with normal pupils and vital signs. Computed tomography scanning showed small ventricles. A shunt tap revealed no flow. With each episode onset, an EEG revealed an abrupt background rhythm slowing to 2-3 Hz delta range without epileptiform discharges. Between events, EEGs displayed normal waveform activity. Emergent ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision resulted in no further episodes in a 4-year follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: SVS can lead to severe intermittent brainstem herniation syndrome in the setting of shunt malfunction. Seizure diagnosis should be reserved for cases with proven functional shunt and EEG confirmation of epileptiform activity.

TI Role of Transnasal Endoscopic Surgery in the Treatment of Superficial
   Siderosis of Central Nervous System Secondary to Clivus Arachnoidocele:
   Report of Successful Case and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Central nervous system superficial siderosis; Clivus arachnoidocele;
   Endoscopic endonasal surgery; Treatment
AB BACKGROUND: Superficial siderosis (SS) of the central nervous system is a disease characterized by deposition of hemosiderin in the leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia mater) due to chronic intradural bleeding. One of the etiologic mechanisms proposed is a dural breach secondary to trauma with a consequent arachnoidocele in contact with an exuberant venous plexus. We describe a unique case of clival arachnoidocele treated by an endoscopic endonasal approach and closure of the defect with fat and nasoseptal flap.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old man with a history of severe head trauma 20 years ago presented with hearing deficit and a mild motor ataxia impairing gait. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed hemosiderin deposition throughout the brain cortical layer and in the cerebellum, affecting the dentate nucleus as well. A computed tomography revealed an osteolytic formation in the clivus, involving the inner bone table and bone marrow. The patient was then submitted to an endoscopic endonasal transclival approach to close the defect.
   CONCLUSIONS: SS may be a result of several etiologies generating repetitive meningeal bleeding. Our patient had the diagnosis of posttraumatic clival arachnoidocele and SS probably related to trauma with some dural injury. An endoscopic endonasal approach with tear reconstruction is feasible and successful to address clival arachnoidoceles and, in this case, to avoid progression of the SS.

TI Recurrent Acute Ischemic Stroke Associated with Dolichoectatic Aneurysm
   of the Internal Carotid Artery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute ischemic stroke; Best medical treatment; DOAC; Dolichoectatic
   aneurysm; ICA; Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia
AB BACKGROUND: Cranial artery dolichoectasia is characterized by dilated, elongated, and tortuous cranial arteries. Dolichoectasia and dolichoectatic aneurysm-particularly of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs)-are rare but can lead to stroke. We report a case of suspected recurrent acute cerebral infarction and dolichoectatic aneurysm of the left ICA combined with right dolichoectatic aneurysm, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia, and atrial fibrillation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old man experienced 3 days of recurrent aphasia episodes. He had a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Neurologic findings indicated Wernicke aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed acute cerebral infarction in the left temporal and parietal lobes. Magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography showed dolichoectatic aneurysms in the C1-2 portion of the bilateral ICAs and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Possible diagnoses included convulsion, cardioembolic infarction, atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, and acute ischemic stroke associated with the dolichoectatic aneurysm of the left ICA. Oral antiplatelet drugs, direct oral anticoagulants, and anticonvulsants were administered. Nine months after initial hospitalization, the patient had a recurrence of acute ischemic stroke and was rehospitalized. He was treated with a new direct oral anticoagulant, clopidogrel, statins, and ethyl icosapentate. At 2 years after initial hospitalization, he has had no recurrence of stroke, has a modified Rankin Scale score of 2, and is currently being followed as an outpatient.
   CONCLUSIONS: A direct oral anticoagulant (edoxaban) and clopidogrel were effective for suspected recurrent acute ischemic stroke associated with dolichoectatic aneurysm of the ICA combined with contralateral dolichoectatic aneurysm, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia, and atrial fibrillation.

TI Transvenous Embolization of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula of the Anterior
   Condylar Confluence via the Intercavernous Sinus Assisted by Bone
   Subtraction Computed Tomography Angiography
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior condylar confluence; Digital subtraction angiography; Dural
   arteriovenous fistula; Intercavernous sinus; Transvenous embolization
ID CT ANGIOGRAPHY; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVFs) of the anatomically complex anterior condylar confluence (ACC) are often examined by computed tomography (CT) angiography and conventional angiography before treatment. Contrasted vessels often overlap with skull bones in enhanced CT scan and make it difficult to detect the shunt point of the dAVF. Bone subtraction CT angiography (BSCTA) can overcome this limitation and allow for superior imaging of dAVFs that may help to find an alternative access for catheterization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old woman suffered from right ear tinnitus, headache, and an audible bruit. Preoperative imaging showed a dAVF of the ACC. It was fed by the bilateral ascending pharyngeal artery, drained to the internal jugular vein (IJV) via the inferior petrosal sinus, and had an intraosseous shunt pouch. We therefore performed transvenous embolization (TVE) via the intercavernous sinus because the angle between the anterior condylar vein and the IJV was too sharp to catheterize vessels through the ipsilateral IJV.
   CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the inherently complex and individually unique venous anatomy of the ACC is crucial for treatment of dAVFs. BSCTA is an effective visualization technique for dAVFs of the ACC and allows for precise preoperative vascular structure evaluation. We suggest that in the case of the angle between the ACV and the IJV being too sharp to catheterize vessels through the ipsilateral IJV, TVE via the intercavernous sinus can be efficiently used.

TI Cerebral Peduncle Volume and Motor Function Following Adult
   Hemispherectomy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anatomic; Corticospinal tract; Functional; Seizure
ID REFRACTORY EPILEPSY
AB BACKGROUND: Hemispherectomy is a successful and well-described treatment option for pediatric patients with hemispheric ictal onset, but adult outcomes have been far less studied. We describe the outcomes in adult patients with medically refractory epilepsy and hemispheric disease and the relationship to cerebral peduncle volume.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We retrospectively reviewed adult hemispherectomy patients at our institution from 2015 to 2018. Patient data including demographic information, pathologic changes, seizure-free outcomes, and ipsilateral (i.e., surgical side) and contralateral (i.e., functional side) cerebral peduncle volume data were collected. We identified 4 adult patients who underwent hemispherectomy. The mean age at surgery was roughly 25 years. All patients were categorized as Engel I or II, and motor scores at last follow-up were unchanged. The mean volume for contralateral and ipsilateral cerebral peduncle means were 1.42 and 0.78 cm(3), respectively (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that smaller ipsilateral cerebral peduncle size could potentially be associated with unchanged postoperative hemiparesis. We hypothesize that smaller ipsilateral peduncle size could have represented corticospinal tract reorganization in childhood, implying that the removed brain matter was mostly noncontributory to contralateral motor function.

DE Brain metastasis; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Stereotactic radiosurgery
AB BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant tumor of the head and neck, and is associated with high recurrence and low survival rates; however, distant brain metastasis from NPC is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors report 3 cases of brain metastasis from NPC treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A 49-year-old woman presented was diagnosed with brain metastasis from NPC, which occurred 53 months after the initial diagnosis of NPC. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-enhanced large tumor on the frontal lobe, which was treated with SRS. Six months later, brain MRI revealed progression of the tumor. A 44-year-old man had undergone craniotomy and removal of a cerebellar tumor pathologically confirmed as metastasis from NPC. The recurrent brain metastasis was diagnosed via routine MRI follow-up examination 23 months after surgery. Brain MRI revealed a heterogeneously enhanced cerebellar large tumor, which was treated using hypofractionated SRS. Three months later, brain MRI revealed a significant decrease in the tumor size. A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with distant brain metastasis from NPC via routine positron emission tomography follow-up examination 14 months after the initial diagnosis of NPC. Brain MRI confirmed a homogeneously enhanced tumor on the cavernous sinus, which was treated with SRS. Three months later, brain MRI revealed virtual disappearance of the tumor. All 3 patients had undergone concurrent chemoradiotherapy after the initial diagnosis of NPC and underwent salvage SRS for brain metastasis from NPC.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the poor prognosis, salvage SRS was performed for these rare brain metastases from NPC.

DE Lateral sacral artery; Sacral; Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula
ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; BRANCHES; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) occurs at any spinal level; however, a sacral location of fistula is extremely rare, and the clinical characteristics of sacral DAVF have not been well described. This study aimed to document the clinical features of sacral DAVF and review the existing literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient was a 55-year-old man who had progressive weakness and numbness in his lower extremities, along with mild urinary incontinence. The second case was a 32-year-old man who had a 1-year history of progressively worsening bilateral lower extremity weakness associated with diminished sensation. The third patient was a 43-year-old woman with 6-month history of progressive motor weakness of her lower limbs. On spinal angiography, a sacral DAVF with perimedullary vein drainage in all cases was observed. The sacral fistulas were completely obliterated with surgical intervention, and the symptoms of these patients have been gradually resolved. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed complete or partial resolution of the edema within the spinal cord and disappearance of the abnormal vascular flow voids.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sacral DAVFs are extremely rare and are easily missed by spinal angiography. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of the occurrence of sacral DAVFs, and spinal angiography for the complete assessment of spinal vasculature should be carried out.

ID INTRACARDIAC MIGRATION; CARDIAC MIGRATION; HEART; COMPLICATIONS;
   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Migration of distal ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt catheter into another body part has been described as a potentially serious surgical complication. We present the first case of sepsis caused by transcardial and pulmonary migration of a distal catheter into the heart and pulmonary artery, which was subsequently colonized by Klebsiella pneumoniae.
   CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old man underwent VP shunt insertion for hydrocephalus that developed after the surgery for intracranial meningioma. Three years later, he was admitted to department for infectious diseases because of persistent fever. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the blood cultures. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed migration of the distal catheter into the heart and pulmonary artery. The migrated shunt catheter was retrieved without any complication with the assistance of a cardiovascular surgeon; microbiologic analysis confirmed that the catheter was colonized with K. pneumoniae. We decided to delay new VP shunt placement because of the positive blood cultures, and 3 weeks after the surgery, the patient was without signs of increased intracranial pressure and without any heart problems.
   CONCLUSION: Migration of a distal VP shunt catheter into the heart should be considered in patients with a previously placed VP shunt presenting with cardiopulmonary problems, arrhythmia, and/or fever. Neurosurgeons should be involved as soon as possible, and a multidisciplinary approach is warranted.

AB BACKGROUND: Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars interarticularis that typically presents with axial back pain. Recently, minimally invasive spine techniques have increased in popularity and have been applied to the Buck technique of direct pars repair.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In our series, 2 patients underwent minimally invasive direct pars repair by the percutaneous insertion of a cannulated lag screw across the pars defect with compression against the lamina. The defect was then decorticated and packed with bone grafting material through a tubular retractor. The clinical records, including preoperative imaging characteristics and intraoperative variables, were collected. The first patient was a 22-year-old woman with bilateral pars defects, and the second was a 21-year-old woman with a left-sided pars defect. They underwent minimally invasive direct pars repair without complications and were discharged home within 24-48 hours. In the first patient, the fusion was successful; however, the second experienced screw back out and required subsequent revision. The follow-up period was 25 months for patient 1 and 21 months for patient 2. The fracture morphology differed. The successfully repaired fractures were linear with smooth cortical edges and oriented perpendicular to the screw trajectory. The failed repair involved a unilateral, curved defect with comminuted cortical edges.
   CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive direct pars repair can be performed safely and effectively with shortened hospital stays and reduced morbidity. Fracture morphology and orientation could be important predictors of the success of surgery.

TI Arachnoiditis Ossificans: A Rare Etiology of Oil-Based Spinal
   Myelography and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Arachnoiditis; Calcinosis; Contrast; Inflammation; Myelography;
   Ossification; Syringomyelia
AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoiditis ossificans (AO) is a rare entity characterized by the presence of calcified plaques formed by the metaplasia of arachnoid cells. Over 50 cases of AO have been reported, with predisposing factors including spinal trauma, hemorrhage, vascular abnormalities, and infection. The administration of oil-based contrast during myelography as an independent risk factor or in conjunction with other spinal pathology has been described in 9 cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old woman presented for neurosurgical consultation in 2013 with a 2-year history of progressive midthoracic pain, right-sided chest wall allodynia, lower extremity weakness, and gait ataxia. Approximately 30 years ago, she received an oil-based contrast myelogram for investigation of spontaneous spinal hemorrhage. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient experienced no allergic, hemorrhagic, traumatic, or infectious complications. No etiology was found for the spinal hemorrhage, and the patient recovered fully from that episode. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated multiple compressive intradural lesions in the upper thoracic spine and ventral tethering of the spinal cord at T7. MRI also demonstrated syringomyelia throughout the thoracic spine. Initially, the diagnosis of epidural mass or diastematomyelia was considered. To further characterize the epidural lesion, an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained, demonstrating a long segment of extensive calcification in the periphery of the thoracolumbar spine, with near-complete circumferential involvement from T5 to T11. The diagnosis of AO with extensive thoracic spine calcifications, syringomyelia, and spine cord tethering was made and confirmed at surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to acute inflammation, oil-based contrast myelography also leads to arachnoiditis, calcification, and retained mass lesions because of its chronic inflammatory properties and slow resorptive rate. Three decades after its replacement with water-based contrast material, the chronic sequelae of oil-based contrast myelography may continue to manifest clinically and on CT imaging. Because of calcifications often encasing the spinal cord or nerve roots, management of AO is challenging, and neurologic deficits may persist even after surgery.T

AB INTRODUCTION: Many controversies exist in the diagnosis and management of this aggressively malignant condition, mainly because of limited literature and lack of randomized control trials, resulting in nonstandardized treatment methods. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to identify management approach and treatment options for esthesioneuroblastoma.
   METHODS: An extensive review of the published literature was conducted in PubMed, OVID Medline, and EMBASE journals for studies of esthesioneuroblastoma. Terms for search included esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) and olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB). No date restrictions were used.
   RESULTS: The search yielded 3876 related articles. Cross-checking of articles led to exclusion of duplicate articles. The remaining 1170 articles were screened for their full text and English language availability. Of 609 full-text articles available, animal studies, irrelevant articles, and studies with mixed/confusing data were excluded. We finalized 149 articles pertaining to the topic, including 119 original research articles, 3 book chapters, 11 reviews, 9 case reports, and 7 case series.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy is the standard for treatment for higher-grade lesions. The endoscopic endonasal approach is gaining further recognition with more favorable outcomes and better survival than for open surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy is associated with the highest overall survival and shows benefit for patients with higher-stage disease and those who receive chemotherapy. Recurrence rates after treatment vary drastically in the literature and, therefore, prolonged follow-up with repeated imaging is recommended. Lifelong surveillance is recommended because of late recurrences associated with this tumor.

TI De Novo Aneurysm Formation After Wingspan Stenting of Intracranial
   Carotid Stenosis: Computational Hemodynamic Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Computational fluid dynamics; De novo aneurysm; Stenting
ID FLUID-DYNAMICS; EMBOLIZATION; PLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of de novo aneurysm after stenting is poorly understood. Hemodynamic effects may play an important role. We report and discuss the hemodynamic analysis of de novo aneurysm after intracranial stenting.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old female underwent angioplasty and coiling for stenosis associated with an aneurysm of the left intracranial carotid artery. Six years later, the follow-up digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a de novo aneurysm at the proximal tine of the Wingspan stent. Computational fluid dynamics simulations showed that stenting for intracranial stenosis resulted in higher oscillatory shear index and lower time-averaged wall shear stress in the neck region of de novo aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic change after stenting may lead to formation of a de novo aneurysm. After an initial injury that might result from the tine on the endothelial cells, stenting could produce high oscillatory shear index and low time-averaged wall shear stress near the tine, thus potentially inducing de novo aneurysm formation.

TI An Ectopic Recurrent Craniopharyngioma of the Temporal Lobe: Case Report
   and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Craniopharyngioma; Ectopic recurrence; Ki-67
ID RESECTION; IMPLANTATION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Ectopic recurrent craniopharyngioma is rare. We present a case of a temporal ectopic recurrent tumor after a trans-eyebrow supraorbital keyhole approach and provide a review of the reported data with basic statistics.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 57 cases of craniopharyngiomas surgically treated at our institution. A temporal ectopic recurrent tumor with 10% high Ki-67 proliferation index expression was identified. The lesion underwent gross total resection without any complications. We also reviewed the related data and performed a basic statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: Our review found 64 cases of ectopic recurrent craniopharyngioma that had been reported (including the present case). The median interval until ectopic recurrence was 4.0 years (interquartile range, 2.0-10.0). Of the 64 lesions, 48 (75%) were adamantinous, 6 (9%) were papillary, and 10 (16%) were unknown. Also, 34 tumors (53%) were located in the previous surgical tract, and 30 (47%) had disseminated along the cerebrospinal fluid pathway. Of the 64 ectopic tumors, 50 (78%) could be resected in total without complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic recurrent craniopharyngioma is a rare phenomenon. Meticulous protection of the entire surgical field and careful manipulation of the tumor during resection are required to prevent possible ectopic recurrence. Regular follow-up examinations are strongly recommended to detect any further recurrences. Gross total resection is the treatment of choice for ectopic recurrence.

ID MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY; RECURRENCE; THERAPY
AB INTRODUCTION: Embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) has emerged as a minimally invasive means of managing subdural hematoma. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on the safety and effectiveness of this treatment and to share our clinical experience.
   METHODS: This review was registered with PROSPERO. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms for MMA embolization and chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) from January 2000 to November 2018. All articles in the English language literature describing MMA embolization for CSDH were included, irrespective of study design. Consecutive patients who underwent MMA embolization at our hospital between January 2017 and June 2018 comprised our clinical experience.
   RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 193 procedures were included in the review. Ninety-five cases (49.2%) involved primary MMA embolization; 88 embolizations (45.6%) for recurrent CSDH and 10 (5.2%) for prophylaxis after surgical evacuation were performed. Recurrence after MMA embolization requiring further treatment occurred in 7 cases (3.6%). All other patients had symptomatic relief with no further recurrence. No procedure-related complications were reported. Polyvinyl alcohol was the most commonly used material. Our series included 8 patients treated with Onyx. All had symptom relief and significant reduction in hematoma size; no recurrences or procedure-related complications were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: MMA embolization of CSDH is safe and effective for CSDH treatment based on a documented recurrence rate of 3.6% and lack of reported complications.

TI Dissection of C2 Guiding to C1 Lateral Mass and Facilitation of Screw
   Placement: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial dislocation; Atlas; Craniovertebral junction; Lateral mass
   screw fixation
AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical intervention at the craniovertebral junction requires preoperative and intraoperative planning to get optimum postoperative results. Careful positioning minimizes the risk of iatrogenic injury and can also facilitate adequate surgical exposure. Tortuous venous channels that are usually encountered as the dissection proceeds may cause excessive bleeding before reaching the lateral mass (LM). However, both localization and placement may be made easier by altering the dissection technique and modifying the patient's position. Traditionally, the military tuck position is described for the dorsal approach to the craniovertebral junction. The objective of this study is to emphasize the role of arc or bow like position, a modification of prone position for adequate placement of C1 LM screw in these cases.
   METHODS: We operated on 68 patients with atlantoaxial dislocation in an arc or bow position from January 2013 to September 2018. In 58 patients, at least 1 C1 LM screw was placed.
   RESULTS: This position helped in easy and early recognition with easy trajectory for the C1 LM screw placement and less work force.
   CONCLUSIONS: Visual axis to the lateral mass of C1 in an arc/bow position with head elevation puts C1 LM more in the visual axis of the operator, which makes the trajectory straight without causing much angulation while inserting the screw. At the same time, the axis vertebra guides the surgeon to the C1 lateral mass with no handling of dura.

DT Review

   history; Seizure
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT; FEATURES; GENETICS; RISK; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) may be familial or nonfamilial. This systematic review compared the natural history of CCMs in familial compared with nonfamilial cases.
   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE for natural history studies on CCMs up to September 2018. We included studies that followed at least 20 untreated patients. Primary outcomes were hemorrhage, seizures, and neuroimaging changes in familial and nonfamilial cases. Incidence rate per person-year (PY) or lesion-year (LY) of follow-up were used to pool the data using fixed-effects or random-effects models. We used the incidence rate ratio for comparison.
   RESULTS: We could not compare hemorrhage rates between familial and nonfamilial cases mainly owing to mixtures of subgroups of patients. The seizure rate was similar in familial and nonfamilial cases with pooled incidence rate of 1.5%/PY (95% confidence interval 1.1%-2.2%). The reseizure rate was higher than the seizure rate (P < 0.001). New lesion development was higher in familial cases (32.1%/PY vs. 0.7%/PY, P < 0.001). Signal change on neuroimaging ranged from 0.2%/LY to 2.4%/LY in familial cases. In familial cases, incidence rate of size change was 8%/PY (95% confidence interval 5.2%-12.2%) and 1.1%/LY (95% confidence interval 0.6%-1.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Familial CCMs show higher dynamic changes than nonfamilial cases. However, the presence of actual dynamic changes needs further assessment in nonfamilial cases. CCMs demonstrate a low incidence of seizure. First-time seizure increases the chance of recurrent seizure. Seizure rate based on the location and type of the lesion should be investigated further.

   VESSELS; PSEUDOANEURYSM; DISAPPEARANCE
AB BACKGROUND: Peripheral aneurysms are known to be a source of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya disease. However, the natural history of ruptured peripheral aneurysms remains unclear. Some regress spontaneously, whereas others may rebleed. Direct treatments, such as surgical or intravascular treatment of the peripheral aneurysm, can have a risk of severe neurologic complications owing to the depth of the operative field and the fragility of the parent artery. A careful treatment policy is required.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 29-year-old man with moyamoya disease with intraventricular hemorrhage, rupture of a right anterior choroidal artery aneurysm was diagnosed by cerebral angiography. The aneurysm was approximately 4 mm in size and existed in the plexal segment of the right anterior choroidal artery. Endovascular embolization of the aneurysm was planned. However, repeat angiography 3 weeks after aneurysm diagnosis demonstrated complete resolution of the aneurysm. Such short-term disappearance of an aneurysm is remarkably rare. We believe that the aneurysm was thrombosed for a brief period considering the slow blood flow detected inside the aneurysm during the initial angiography. The patient was discharged with no neurologic deficit and has remained recurrence-free for >1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given that spontaneous resolution of an aneurysm may occur in a short period of time, we suggest that conservative treatment be considered as an option for ruptured peripheral aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease when direct treatment is risky.

TI De Novo Formation of Direct Arteriovenous Fistula Involving Anterior

   Arteriovenous Malformation in Pediatric Patient: Case Report and Review
   of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Arteriovenous fistulas; Arteriovenous malformations; Cerebrovascular;
   Intracranial hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: De novo formation of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is increasingly being reported in the neurosurgical literature, challenging the notion that AVMs are congenital in origin. Most of this literature centers around the pediatric population. After treatment of an AVM or AVF, recurrence, if any, appears to occur locally to the original insult. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a de novo direct AVF involving an anterior communicating artery aneurysm in a remote site from a prior ruptured AVM in a pediatric patient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 14-year-old female who presented 2 years prior with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage secondary to a left parietal arteriovenous malformation. That AVM was successfully micro-surgically resected and revealed complete angiographic obliteration on postoperative and surveillance angiograms. This patient now presents with a spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured anterior communicating artery complex aneurysm with a fistulous connection from this aneurysm to the inferior petrosal sinus. The aneurysm and direct AVF were not identified on prior surveillance imaging, indicating de novo formation in a remote site from her prior AVM.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of long-term imaging surveillance in patients with AVMs. Further prospective studies are indicated to evaluate the long-term imaging surveillance necessary to detect early recurrence, thereby allowing doctors to institute earlier definitive treatment. The exact pathophysiology behind these lesions is not fully understood; however, this case lends support to an acquired etiology to vascular malformations.

ID BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been commonly regarded as congenital. However, this suspected origin has been challenged by reports of de novo cerebral AVM.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have described a 25-year-old man without any known history of cerebrovascular disease, in whom cranial imaging demonstrated the de novo appearance of a pial AVM. Initial magnetic resonance imaging at 11 years of age had revealed the presence of a 2-cm parafalcine arachnoid cyst. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging performed 14 years later showed a new cerebral AVM in the left frontal lobe, which was then confirmed angiographically.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our case report and from 9 similar reports challenge the traditional theory that AVMs constitute congenital lesions.

DT Article
DE Delirium; Gabapentin; Serotonin syndrome; Tramadol
ID INDUCED DELIRIUM
AB BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a common disease entity and could result in death if missed. The incidence of SS is underestimated due to misdiagnosis of many cases, especially the ones with less severe presentation. Many medications have been depicted as the source of SS. We present a case of SS in a patient who received intravenous tramadol and oral gabapentin as pain management after spine surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man was admitted to our outpatient clinic with walking difficulties for 2 months. He was neurologically intact. However, he had neurologic claudication. He was on insulin, telmisartanhydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, and albuterol before the surgery, and these drugs were continued after the surgery. After he was diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis, he underwent total laminectomies of L3 and L4 and bilateral transpedicular screw placement from L1 to L5. He received tramadol 100 mg once daily intravenously and gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily orally after the spine surgery. He became confused, aggressive, and agitated during his stay in the hospital postoperatively. He became frustrated with even his children and wife. He started receiving haloperidol and quetiapine after psychiatry consultation. Because he worsened immediately after quetiapine and haloperidol, his medications were ceased in a step-by-step manner (first, tramadol and second, gabapentin). He became stable in a few hours, and his symptoms have improved since then.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians treating spine patients should be alert about SS in patients using both tramadol and gabapentin.

AB The objective of this paper is to discuss relevant data on the epidemiology of hydrocephalus in neurocysticercosis, the new knowledge coming from experimental studies, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, and the controversies regarding clinical and surgical management, through a comprehensive review of the literature. Hydrocephalus is present at the onset of the disease in 16% to 51% of patients with neurocysticercosis and in 64% to 72% of patients with the extraparenchymal form of the disease. Animal models have successfully reproduced the disease and open new therapeutic approaches perspectives. Current guidelines suggest that, when hydrocephalus is due to viable cysts that can be excised surgically, cyst removal is recommended. On the other hand, degenerating cysts with protein discharge become fixed and evoke inflammation throughout the cerebrospinal fluid compartments. In these cases, surgical removal is risky, and ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be placed with close monitoring of infection and malfunction. Cysticidal treatment after shunt surgery is recommended in cases of cysts located in cerebral areas that prevent surgical management. In conclusion, mechanical obstruction and inflammation are the key pathophysiologic mechanisms in the development of neurocysticercosisinduced hydrocephalus. Anthelmintic drugs and surgical options should be used, but they have limitations. A better understanding of the disease can come from experimental models.

AB INTRODUCTION: A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique is one of the most widely used techniques in mechanical thrombectomy. Aspiration catheter size plays a major role in the success of this technique. The AXS Vecta (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, California, USA) aspiration catheter is the first approved 0.071-inch catheter for mechanical thrombectomy. Here, we report our initial experience with direct aspiration thrombectomy using the AXS Vecta aspiration catheter.
   METHODS: We reviewed the prospectively collected database of all consecutive patients with stroke who underwent thrombectomy using A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique with the AXS Vecta aspiration catheter at our institution between September 26 and October 12, 2018.
   RESULTS: A total of 10 thrombectomy procedures were performed. Of those, 3 patients had M1 occlusion, 6 patients had M2 occlusion, and 1 patient had cervical carotid D M1 tandem occlusion. Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia grade 2b or greater revascularization was obtained in 9 of 10 patients. Median groin-to-reperfusion time was 29.5 (interquartile range 14.25-53.25) minutes. An intermediate catheter (3 Max) was used in all cases. No procedural complications or vascular injury were identified. The AXS Vecta catheter demonstrated excellent tractability and navigability in all cases except 1 case with severe narrowing of M1 segment secondary to atherosclerosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this early experience with the new AXS Vecta aspiration catheter, the catheter was safely navigated to the target vessel even at the level of M2 segment.

ID PERFUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a complex disease in young healthy adults. Most often AVMs are clinically silent but also can display a neurologic syndrome due to hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in perilesional brain tissue called steal phenomenon.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman was admitted to a secondary neurologic center complaining of a right hemiparesis and secondarily generalized seizures. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left prerolandic AVMwithout signs of acute or previous bleedings. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a left juxta-central AVM, with a diffuse pattern, fed by hypertrophic rolandic branches from the left middle cerebral artery. An F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed 3 days after the critical episode. A significant hypometabolism in parenchymal regions ipsilaterally to the AVM was detected. Two embolization sessions were performed by means of N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue. At the end of the second procedure, a decrease of the shunt-flow and AVM size was observed. Six months later, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging scan showed persistent hypometabolism located in the AVM area, with a significant improvement of the cortical hemispheric hypometabolism. The patient was asymptomatic and was sent to stereotactic radiosurgery to complete the treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, irritative symptoms in patients with unruptured AVMs could lead to erroneous evaluations. In case of fluctuating clinical syndromes, like our case, establishing that symptoms are related to a steal phenomenon is usually difficult.

DE Brain vascular malformation; Indocyanine green; Pial arteriovenous
   fistula; Videoangiography
AB Intracranial arteriovenous fistulas, rare causes of spontaneous intracerebral bleeding, are direct communications between an arterial feeder and an arterialized vein that drains a normal brain. Arteriovenous disconnection is the only effective treatment for this type of vascular malformation, which is often reached microsurgically due to the difficult endovascular access. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) is a valuable help in identifying the arterialized draining vein and its direct communication with the arterial feeder and in confirming real-time interruption of the fistula. We describe the case of a 46-year-old man presenting with sudden onset of headache and left arm motor and sensory deficits associated with a frontoparietal hematoma evacuated 1 week earlier in another institution. Digital subtraction angiography showed a direct communication between an anterior parietal branch of the right middle cerebral artery and a parietal vein. Given the difficulty to reach the point of the fistula endovascularly because of the small caliber and tortuosity of the arterial feeder, as well as the short and relatively rapid flow through the arteriovenous communication, we decided to proceed with microsurgical treatment. Under intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring the fistula was located with the aid of ICG-VA and interrupted (Video 1). Both control ICG-VA and postoperative angiogram confirmed resolution of the fistula. At a 3-month follow-up the patient had a complete neurologic recovery.

ID BREAST-CANCER; VASOSPASM
AB BACKGROUND: Several possible mechanisms exist for the spread of a primary tumor to the leptomeninges in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. This report describes a case caused by direct bleeding in the subarachnoid space from a neoplastic cerebral aneurysm rupture.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with breast carcinoma (pT3 pN2 M0) at the age of 45 years and underwent mastectomy and chemotherapy, was admitted in a coma following a suddenonset severe headache. Computed tomography revealed diffuse hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space, and angiography revealed an aneurysm at the distal middle cerebral artery. Superficial temporal artery - Lmiddle cerebral artery bypass, aneurysmal trapping, and aneurysm resection were performed within 24 hours of admission. Staining for AE1/AE3 revealed accumulation of atypical cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio in the aneurysmal wall. After showing initial improvement, she developed disturbed consciousness due to complicated ventricular enlargement on day 45. Although the cerebrospinal fluid in the acute phase had no atypical cells, subsequent testing revealed atypical cells, which supported a diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis due to breast cancer dissemination. The patient died on day 78 after receiving standard endocrine therapy and radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cells reach the leptomeninges via hematogenous spread or direct extension from preexisting lesions and can undergo neuraxis dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are both devastating conditions with extremely poor prognoses. This patient experienced delayed disturbed consciousness leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with decreased performance status, which made it difficult to justify aggressive treatment on the basis of her poor prognosis.

TI Microsurgical Clip Reconstruction of Ruptured Dissecting PICA Aneurysm:
   2-Dimensional Operative Video
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Aneurysm clipping; Cerebrovascular; Posterior inferior cerebellar artery
   aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB This case is a presentation of technical tenets for the microsurgical clipping of a ruptured posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm (Video 1). The patient described in this case was a 19-year-old male with a history of poly-substance abuse who presented from an outside hospital after being found unresponsive and admitted for a subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 days earlier. Noninvasive vascular imaging completed at the outside hospital showed no clear intracranial aneurysm except some irregularity of left PICA proximally. The cerebral angiogram subsequently completed after transfer demonstrated a left dissecting PICA aneurysm from the anterior medullary segment of the PICA. Endovascular options were considered to be high risk for this patient due to the wide neck of the aneurysm. Stent coiling was not considered the best option given the concern about recent subarachnoid hemorrhage and the need for antiplatelets. This case is valuable to the literature as it illustrates technical steps required for reconstructing an aneurysm with a dissected wall with pseudoaneurysmal formation, the need for early proximal control, and the use of intraoperative adenosine for temporary cardiac standstill.

TI Elongated Clivus with Deficient Anterior Atlantal Arch and Congenital
   Posterior Atlantooccipital Dislocation: Pathoembryology and Management
   Nuances of a Rare Form of Proatlas Segmentation Anomaly
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

   Pediatric; Proatlas anomaly; Transoral surgery
ID ATLANTOAXIAL DISLOCATION
AB BACKGROUND: Proatlas segmentation anomalies represent a rare subset of congenital craniovertebral junction anomalies. In this condition, the structures originating from the proatlas, such as the clivus, occipital condyles, foramen magnum rim, and odontoid tip, may demonstrate congenital anomalies, usually without any spinal instability. Elongated clivus, as a result of nonsegmentation of the odontoid tip from the rest of the proatlas, has been reported before to cause ventral spinal cord compression. We report such a case with certain unreported other associations and explore the pathoembryology and management options of such complex anomalies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year old girl presented with a 2-year history of progressive spastic quadriparesis. On neuroimaging, the anterior arch of the atlas was deficient, the odontoid process was foreshortened, and the clivus was elongated, encroaching into the spinal canal leading to ventral spinal cord compression. Additionally, there was rotatory posterior dislocation of the occipital condyles onto the posterior atlantal arch and vertebral artery anomaly. This patient underwent transoral decompression followed by occipitocervical fusion using rods and screws with satisfactory results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Proatlas anomalies are rare, varied, and often subtle enough to go unrecognized. Knowledge of the embryology and its aberrations is necessary to understand these anomalies. Our case describes a rare form of bony anomalies pertaining to the fate of the proatlas with accompanying atlantooccipital dislocation.

TI Side Slit Guide Pipe for Precise Placement of Depth Electrodes
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Accurate placement; Depth electrode; Neuronavigation; Side slit guide
   pipe; Stereoelectroencephalography
AB BACKGROUND: Using a stereotactic technique, surgeons can accurately place a depth electrode (DE), but sometimes the DE deviates from the intended target due to movement of the electrode or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid when placing the electrode. If DEs can be anchored before removing the catheter insertion guide pipe, more accurate placement may be possible.
   METHODS: We made a side slit guide pipe. When the DEs were anchored to the dura or the edge of the burr hole, the DE did not move when the guide pipe was removed. We measured the distance between the planned target and the tip of the electrode in 13 patients (3 female and 10 male patients; age range, 7-43 years; mean age 23.0 years; median age 27 years) withmedically intractable epilepsywho underwent DE placement with stereotactic neuronavigation guidance.
   RESULTS: There were 30 DEs implanted. The mean distance fromthe planned target to the tip of the DEwas 0.570 mm (range, 0.3-1.2 mm; median 0.5 mm; SD 0.212). The mean distance from the planned target to the tip of the DEwith dural anchoringwas 0.467 mm(range, 0.3-0.6 mm; median 0.45 mm; SD 0.121) and with burr hole edge anchoring was 0.596 mm (range, 0.3-1.2 mm; median 0.50 mm; SD 0.224; P = 0.205).
   CONCLUSIONS: DEs can be anchored using the side slit guide pipe for more precise placement.
