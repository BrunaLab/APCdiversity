AB The newly synthesized ternary system are consisting of metallic-Mg-ions diffused in hollow carbon nano-spheres (HCNS) that embedded with platinum nano-particles (NP). The ternary system exhibits characteristics features in hydrogen release. It is expected to be superior and efficient as hydrogen carrier to be used for energy release applications. The synthesized Mg/HCNS/Pt ternary system was well characterized by both of XRD and 3D-AFM. The measured H-2-desorption capacities were promising values recording 6.78, 6.92, 7.05 and 7.85 wt% at temperatures 270, 300, 330 and 370 degrees C respectively. These results confirmed that MgH2-storage capacity was enhanced and reinforced by extraordinary BET surface area of 1810 m(2)g(-1) attributable to (HCNS + Pt-NP + Mg - NP). The kinetics of desorption results indicated that Mg/HCNS/Pt composite can release hydrogen 7.85 wt% at 370 degrees C in 1.42 min (85.2 s) and minimum desorption capacity observed was 6.78 wt% at 270 degrees C in 2.8 min (168 s).

AB In this study, composite scaffolds consisting of mineral ion-loaded hydroxyapatite derived from fish scale (mHAFS) in a poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/chitosan (Chi) matrix (mHAFS@PLAChi) were fabricated by an in situ blending technique. Mineral ion loaded HAFS was successfully converted into mHAFS via the hydrothermal heating of HAFS in a SBF (simulated body fluid) solution. The composite mHAFS with PLAChi showed a compressive strength of 20 MPa and a compressive modulus of 539.88 MPa with a microporous structure. In vitro investigation showed that the UMR-106 cells adhered well and proliferated on the mHAFS@ PLAChi surface. Most importantly it improved the cell viability and alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity. These findings suggest that these synthesized materials have great potential for use in bone tissue engineering. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In the UK, the Waste Vitrification Plant (WVP) at Sellafield converts the highly active liquid (HAL) waste from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel into a glass wasteform suitable for long term storage and disposal. After the completion of reprocessing operations, the highly active liquor (HAL) storage tanks will be emptied and washed out to remove any accumulated solids. These solids are expected to contain high concentrations of molybdenum. Hence, a new glass formulation has been developed specifically for immobilisation of these waste streams. This 'Ca/Zn' glass allows for significantly higher waste loadings by the formation of CaMoO4 crystals when the Mo content exceeds its solubility limit in the glass. The product quality of the new Ca/Zn glass is currently undergoing validation, which includes measuring the chemical durability to demonstrate its suitability for long-term storage and disposal. Previous powder-based leach tests have indicated a very slow approach to the low residual dissolution rate regime in contrast to other HLW glasses. Hence, this study investigated the leaching of Ca/Zn glass powders in Si-saturated solutions at high surface area to volume ratios in order to probe the long-term dissolution rate.

AB This paper reported a gas phase reaction to synthesize epsilon-Fe3N nanoparticles with controlled annealing conditions. Vaporized iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)(5)) was used as the iron source, and ammonia (NH3) was used as the nitrogen source. In three parallel experiments, the annealing time of the nanoparticles was controlled. The particle morphologies and lattice parameters of the as-synthesized particles were characterized by TEM, and the crystal structure and crystallization level were determined by XRD. The magnetic properties were measured by VSM. The experimental results showed that enhanced crystallization and magnetization were obtained on the nanoparticles with longer annealing time.

AB Microporous materials with higher uptake - offtake difference per adsorption - desorption cycle have great potential to design adsorption assisted chillers, heat pumps and thermal batteries. In this context, we report a green reaction method for synthesizing aluminium fumarate (AlFum) metal-organic framework (MOF). The water uptake on AlFum shows S-shape isotherm curve with sharp increase in uptake offtake difference in a narrow pressure range. The proposed green synthesized AlFum exhibits higher deliverable energy capacity as compared to that of conventional (dimethylformamide based synthesis) AlFum for adsorptive cooling applications.

AB Dielectric properties in the microwave range of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics have been rarely studied. The work attempted to develop a new kind of high temperature microwave absorption material. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics were sintered at different temperatures by a traditional solid-state reaction method for dielectric and microwave absorption properties study. Results showed that the complex permittivity increased to the maximum at 1250 degrees C then decreased with the elevated sintering temperature. The effective absorption bandwidth (below -5 dB) was obtained in 8.98-12.4 GHz for the ceramic in 2.3 mm thickness and the lowest reflection loss is -12.9 dB at 10.74 GHz, which indicated that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics would be potential microwave absorption materials by further improvement.

ID SNO2
AB In this work, a facile one-pot chronoamperometry method was adopted to prepare the three-dimensional (3D) SnO2 incorporated polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide to achieve high stability and elevated electrochemical properties. A detailed study has been performed to correlate the structure, surface morphology, redox reaction at the electrode and its impact on the suitability of the material. The morphology analysis showed the presence of SnO2 nanoparticles on graphene sheets forming irregular flower-like coarse clusters, consisting of spinule-like structures on the surfaces that are embedded in polypyrrole matrix. The electrochemical performance reveals that SnO2-PG exhibits a high specific capacitance of 330 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) in 1 M KCl electrolyte and an excellent cycling stability of 82% even after 2000 cycles, a significant value for polymer nanocomposite. The existence of a high degree of porosity, considerably improved active surface area and the conductivity of SnO2-PG facilitated the better ionic penetration which demonstrates a new architecture for high performance supercapacitor.

AB Ceramization of several heavy metals (M = Cr, Fe, Co and Ni) in celsian lattice has been studied by sintering up to 1500 degrees C of its oxides with BaCO3, Al(OH)(3) and SiO2 in order to obtain (Ba1-XMx)Al2Si2O8 solid solutions. Cr3+ enters in solid solution forming cationic vacancies up to x = 0.5 (both celsian and hexacelsian coexist), Fe3+ and Co2+ only up to x = 0.1 (both celsian and hexacelsian coexist), melting at higher x values, while Ni only forms solid solution at low x (0.02), coexisting hexacelsian and celsian, and at higher x NiAl2O4 spinel crystallizes. However, the use of glass-forming mineralizers such as borates increases reactivity and monophasic celsian is obtained in the case of Co-celsian solid solution (adding 10 wt% of glass-forming agent) at only 1000 degrees C/3h of sintering temperature. These powders have been reused as ceramic pigments and leaching test is performed in order to classify the resulting solid solutions for its landfill disposal (Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the waste landfill).

AB Sodium (Na) doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods were successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. The effect of sodium doping in improving the performance of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) has been discussed. Field Emission scanning electron micrograph (FESEM) revealed the formation of nanorods and nanoflowers for doped samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of doped samples reveal slight shift towards lower angle confirming the effective substitution of Ti4+ by Na+. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6% sodium doped TiO2 based DSSC was 1.65% and is 79% higher than the undoped TiO2 based DSSC that exhibited an efficiency of 0.92%. This improvement in efficiency is ascribed due to less electron-hole recombination rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The PEO coatings samples obtained in electrolytes with/without ZrO2 underwent to subsequent immersion treatment in 8-hydroxyquinolate (8-HQ) solution for 72 h. It was observed that the formation of flower-like bis (8-hydroxyquinoline) magnesium inside the micro-pores of PEO coating was triggered when the coating was formed from electrolyte without ZrO2. As a result, a significant improvement in the corrosion resistance of Mg alloy was obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is highly researched photovoltaic (PV) material in recent years because of resource availability and non-toxicity of its constituents. Radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering is one of the potential methods of fabricating CZTS thin film due to its suitability for large scale industrial implementation. Of the three methods of depositing CZTS films by RF sputtering, one step single quaternary target sputtering is by far the simplest and straightforward one. However, deposition profile plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of pre-defined target composition transferred to glass substrates. In this study, several deposition parameters, such as RF power, working pressure, and target to sample distance were varied and their influences on corresponding compositional variation in deposited samples were studied. A quaternary CZTS target with pre-fixed composition (Cu = 22%, Zn = 15%, Sn = 13%, S = 50%) was used to deposit CZTS thin films at various depositing conditions. Among all deposition profiles, high RF power was found to be more detrimental with high Cu loss up to 53% from the original atomic composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY
AB In this study, we investigated the influence of annealing temperature on ultra-small SnO2 quantum dots (SQDs) prepared by a simple chemical reduction process. The structural and optical properties of annealed SQDs were systematically studied by different techniques. Our results show that the crystallinity and average crystallite size of annealed SQDs increased gradually with annealing temperature. The average crystallite size was maintained below 10 nm even for high annealing temperatures. XPS peak fitting analysis yielded information on the presence of mixed ionic states of Sn2+ and Sn4+ in SQDs and further revealed that the number of Sn2+ ions decreased at high temperature. Band-edge shifts were estimated from XPS data. It was possible to shift the bandgap of annealed SQDs from UV to the visible wavelength region, which is likely to have a beneficial impact on many applications of optoelectronic devices.

AB A novel and low cost vapor phase epitaxy (VPE) method using a single non-volatile source has been used to deposit ZnS thin films on soda lime glass substrates. Utilization of the non-volatile source eliminates the need for expensive and sophisticated reactors commonly used in conventional VPE. Instead, this experiment was carried out using inexpensive and easily attainable apparatus. The vapor phase reaction process described is also more compatible to the industry standard dry deposition processes of the other layers in the thin film solar cell stack for Cu(In, Ga)Se-2 (CIGS), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and CdTe photovoltaic (PV) devices. In this experiment, the substrate temperature was varied from 400 to 480 degrees C and the ZnS thin films produced were analyzed using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), optical spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Hall effect measurement system. The films were found to be hexagonal structured except for the film deposited at 480 degrees C, where the film was found to be cubic. The thickness, bandgap and resistivity of the deposited films ranged from 54 to 351 nm, 3.18 to 3.83 eV and 2 x 10(3) to 1.6 x 10(4) Omega.cm respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the fly ash produced from the combustion of agave bagasse, which comprises mainly calcium oxide (CaO), was used to synthesize calcite at room temperature without the use of additives. The interaction between the CaO contained by the ash and H2O generates a primary phase of Ca(OH)(2), then, the dissociation of Ca+ and the environmental CO2 dissolved in water produces a CaCO3 film at the interface of water and air. The process was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX), showing the composition and chemical transformation of the ash up to the CaCO3 film formation.

First, hexapods of Cu2O were obtained using copper chloride, and then in the second stage, sodium sulfite was used at different weight ratios in relation with Cu2O for the transformation into Cu7.2S4. The XRD, SEM, Raman, and XPS studies show that at 1:1 wt-ratio the conversion is not completely achieved and the presence of the two phases in the hexapod is detected. By increasing the weight-ratio to 1:2, Cu7.2S4 hexapods with smooth surface were totally transformed into Cu7.2S4 ones with modified surface completely covered by nanosheets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) thin films are widely used in stretchable electronics. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate PDMS thin films in an easy and convenient manner. To address this issue, here we novelly present an approach to ease the fabrication of PDMS membranes using lift-off method. For application as substrates in flexible biosensors, a gold thin film has been deposited on the PDMS thin film. The reliability of electric conductivity has been investigated. Moreover, biocompatibility of the PDMS thin film has been tested by culturing HeLa live cells it. The results demonstrate that the PDMS thin films fabricated by lift-off method has a high prospect towards application as substrate in flexible biosensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, we report a polymer-nanocomposite electrolyte (PNCE) system by dispersing CeO2 nano-powders as fillers in Poly(ethylene) oxide-LiClO4 matrix. The ceria powders known for their redox and catalytic activity have strongly influenced the structural properties of the PNCEs. XRD and thermal analysis results suggest structural modification in PNCEs that leads to improved ionic conductivity. The maximum conductivity of similar to 3.0 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) is observed for 1-2 wt% and 10 wt% nano-CeO2 dispersed PNCEs. The d.c. conductivity and hopping frequency are thermally activated. The activation energy of d.c. conductivity (E-a) and ion hopping (E-m) are well correlated, suggesting that PNCEs with smaller interaction energy between Li+ ions and PEO offer better ionic conductivity.

AB SiC foams sandwiched between two Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) skins are of interest for several high temperature applications ranging from aeronautics to energy production.
   In this paper, SiC foams were joined to C/SiC composites by the "Mo-wrap" method to obtain sandwich structures. The Mo-wrap method is a recently developed joining technique: it consists of wrapping Si foils inside a Mo wrap in order to prevent molten silicon leaking from the joined area and infiltrating SiC foam and C/SiC during the joining process.
   Compression and thermal shock resistance tests were performed on the C/SiC - SiC foam - C/SiC sandwich obtaining sound results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, we have successfully synthesized CdO nanostructures with various molar concentrations by a two-step chemical method. The crystal structure of our nanostructured CdO thin films is cubic phase while the microscopic images show the formation of nanoparticles, spindles, and coconut fiber bark shaped CdO nanostructured films. These different structures were achieved merely by controlling the molar concentration of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine. The size of the CdO nanostructure slightly increases monotonically with molar concentration. Our chemical synthesis approach is inexpensive, reproducible and scalable.

AB In this study, a surfactant-assisted method was employed to successfully prepare plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies encapsulated in hollow silica particles. In this method, silica was precipitated in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles with single nanometer sizes and an anionic surfactant, sodium oleate (NaOA). The absorption peak of the composite particles was red-shifted compared with that for the well-dispersed suspension of the plasmonic nanoparticles. The extent of red-shift was easily tuned by changing the concentration of nanoparticles incorporated in the hollow silica particles. A binary-nanoparticle assembly, comprising gold and silver nanoparticles, was also prepared. Hence, this method can be extended to the design of novel multifunctional particles based on different nanoparticle assemblies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The desert drift sands were used as raw materials to synthesize mullite ceramics in order to save mineral resources and protect the environment. The experimental results show the formation temperature of mullite was reduced significantly and the density and mechanical properties were remarkably improved compared to the reference sample prepared using analytical reagents. The impurity cations formed low thermal expansion of glass phase, contributing to the decrease of thermal expansion coefficient. Finally, the obtained mullite ceramics had excellent densification, mechanical properties and low thermal expansion coefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Moderate dehydrofluorinated PVDF (MD PVDF) composed of polyene and untreated PVDF was produced by elimination reaction in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and KOH aqueous solution. Dielectric films of MD PVDF were fabricated by solution casting method to study the energy density performance of the polymer. The energy density of MD PVDF was enhanced and the maximum energy density was 10.5 J/cm(3) at 450 kV/mm with an efficiency of 46%. The enhanced energy density was attributed to combined effects of high conductivity of polyene and charges blockage of untreated PVDF. This work may provide a new way to enhance the energy density performance of polymer dielectrics by moderate dehydrofluorination. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been established that IrO2 can improve the recording and stimulating efficiency of electrodes for neural activities. In this work, we have employed chemical bath deposition to fabricate an IrO2 nanotube array using an anodic alumina (AAO) template. We determined the optimal chemical bath condition including a suitable pH value to preserve the AAO template. After exploring various chemical bath deposition parameters, we produced a uniform, ordered, and high-aspect-ratio IrO2 nanotube array. We developed an acidic chemical bath for conformal IrO2 deposition at a thickness of 60 nm per batch. The results from grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD) suggest the successful formation of IrO2 film. The images obtained via scanning electron microscopy and qualitative elemental chemical analysis reveal free-standing iridium oxide nanotubes 400 nm in length after the removal of the AAO template by phosphoric acid. Electrochemical analysis of this IrO2 nanotube array in charge storage capacity (CSC) was performed to evaluate its potential as a neural-electronic interface electrode. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Repeated impacts can cause damage to not only a surface but also inside the material. Mechanisms include stress-wave propagation into the material, reflection of the waves at the back surface, and subsequent repeated reflections in the vicinity of the impact and the back surface. Impact damage performance was observed for polyurethane-coated fibre composites with structured geometries at the back surfaces. Repeated impacts by rubber balls on the coated side caused damage and delamination of the coating. The laminates with structured back surfaces showed longer durability than those with a flat back surface. The in-situ acoustic measurement indicates that the acoustic power within the pulse duration was 25-40% lower using the structured back surfaces. The observed effect can be attributed to scattered reflection at the back surface to reduce the high intensity duration of the acoustic waves. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Various approaches have been explored to enhance the efficiency of thin film solar cells by adopting new materials, novel device structures and implementing various light-trapping techniques. Generally, the light trapping is achieved by texturization of thin film transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer by chemical etching. In the present study, we have etched the surface of the glass substrate by Aluminium-Induced Texturization (AIT) process. A set of experiments is carried out with different thicknesses of the Aluminium and annealed for different durations. The effect of AIT on the glass surface roughness is studied using AFM analysis. The optical transmission and haze of the etched glass substrates are measured using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Aluminium-doped Zinc oxide (AZO) layer is deposited on the etched glass and the effect of glass etching on the properties of AZO thin film in terms of surface roughness, and optical properties are studied.

AB Effective charge carrier separation and charge transport at the interface layers of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) play a vital role in attaining superior photo conversion efficiency. The charge carrier separation and transport at the interfaces of DSSC can be improved by preparing suitable material interfaces based on the band edge offset. Present work reports the preparation of copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) modified titania as an efficient photoanode for DSSC. The structural analyses confirm the crystallinity of the samples in anatase phase with nanoscale crystallite size distribution. The optical analyses show an elevated absorption of the modified samples compared to the pristine titania. A prototype dye sensitized solar cell was fabricated using pristine and modified photoanodes, and the performance have been evaluated through I-V analysis with and without illumination. Cu and Ag modified titania photoanode showed 4.4 and 15 times enhanced photo conversion efficiency (PCE) respectively, compared to the pristine titania and this may be attributed to the effective charge separation and charge transport. The above result opens up a new area of research in modifying the photoanode of the next generation solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interaction of quinacridone (QA) on silver and gold clusters has been investigated using computational methods. This interaction induces variations in the structural parameters of QA, which are confirmed by the electrostatic potential plot and the vibrational analysis. The red shift in the simulated UV-Vis spectra confirms the process of adsorption on metal clusters, which is mainly due to the electrostatic interaction between the metals and QA. Reduction in the hole reorganization energy along with the increment in hyperpolarizability points to a possible use of QA adsorbed on silver cluster as an effective material in organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices.

AB An approach of determining thermal conductivity of zeolite is introduced, due to the lack of its thermal properties data for heat transfer calculations in adsorption and catalytic applications. Faujasite (FAU) as one of the important zeolites, whose framework consists of sodalite cages with pores formed by 12-membered rings, was chosen as model zeolite. Pellet-shaped samples made of FAU-type zeolite and binder pseudoboehmite were prepared with different binder fractions and porosities. Apparent thermal conductivity was determined using laser flash method. Results showed that the use of pseudoboehmite increased material's heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, and the apparent thermal conductivity of porous composites decreased with porosity. The thermal conductivity of FAU-type zeolite at 20 degrees C and 1 atm. was found to be 0.10 W/(m.K) by extrapolating measurement results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present first-principle calculations of structural, electronic, and optical properties of zinc-blende (z) BxAlyGa1-x-yN quaternary alloy, using alchemical mixing of plane-wave pseudopotentals method based on density functional theory (DFT). Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to describe exchange-correlation potential coupled with the Perdew, Burk and Ernzerhof (PBE) flavour. The calculated structural properties, equilibrum lattice constant and bulk modulus are in excellent agreement with available theoretical and experimental data. The bandgaps obtained depend on alloying concentrations x and y. The bandgap and density of states (DOS) are in good agreement with available theoretical data. The optical spectra obtained are given in the energy range of 0-8 eV. The results obtained in this calculation indicate that z - BxAlyGa1-x-yN alloy is a desirable material for manufacturing of deep ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs).

AB In the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) community, several formulations have been proposed to solve PDEs involving second-order spatial derivatives (e.g. elliptic problems). In this paper, we show that, when the discretisation is restricted to the usage of Gauss-Lobatto points, there are important similarities between two common choices: the Bassi-Rebay 1 (BR1) method, and the Symmetric Interior Penalty (SIP) formulation. This equivalence enables the extrapolation of properties from one scheme to the other: a sharper estimation of the minimum penalty parameter for the SIP stability (compared to the more general estimate proposed by Shahbazi [1]), more efficient implementations of the BR1 scheme, and the compactness of the BR1 method for straight quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes.

AB The high computational cost of solving numerically the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations, together with the poor performance of most numerical formulations for compressible flow in the low Mach number regime, has led to the necessity for more affordable numerical models for Computational Aeroacoustics. For low Mach number subsonic flows with neither shocks nor thermal coupling, both flow dynamics and wave propagation can be considered isentropic. Therefore, a joint isentropic formulation for flow and aeroacoustics can be devised which avoids the need for segregating flow and acoustic scales. Under these assumptions density and pressure fluctuations are directly proportional, and a two field velocity-pressure compressible formulation can be derived as an extension of an incompressible solver. Moreover, the linear system of equations which arises from the proposed isentropic formulation is better conditioned than the homologous incompressible one due to the presence of a pressure time derivative. Similarly to other compressible formulations the prescription of boundary conditions will have to deal with the backscattering of acoustic waves. In this sense, a separated imposition of boundary conditions for flow and acoustic scales which allows the evacuation of waves through Dirichlet boundaries without using any tailored damping model will be presented.

AB The nucleation of sulphuric acid molecules plays a key role in the formation of aerosols. We here present a three dimensional particle Monte Carlo model to study the growth of sulphuric acid clusters as well as its dependence on the ambient temperature and the initial particle density. We initiate a swarm of sulphuric acid-water clusters with a size of 0.329 nm with densities between 10(7) and 10(8) cm(-3) at temperatures between 200 and 300 K and a relative humidity of 50%. After every time step, we update the position of particles as a function of size-dependent diffusion coefficients. If two particles encounter, we merge them and add their volumes and masses. Inversely, we check after every time step whether a polymer evaporates liberating a molecule. We present the spatial distribution as well as the size distribution calculated from individual clusters. We also calculate the nucleation rate of clusters with a radius of 0.85 nm as a function of time, initial particle density and temperature. The nucleation rates obtained from the presented model agree well with experimentally obtained values and those of a numerical model which serves as a benchmark of our code. In contrast to previous nucleation models, we here present for the first time a code capable of tracing individual particles and thus of capturing the physics related to the discrete nature of particles.

AB We develop a non-intrusive reduced basis (RB) method for parametrized steady-state partial differential equations (PDEs). The method extracts a reduced basis from a collection of high-fidelity solutions via a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and employs artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), to accurately approximate the coefficients of the reduced model. The search for the optimal number of neurons and the minimum amount of training samples to avoid overfitting is carried out in the offline phase through an automatic routine, relying upon a joint use of the Latinhypercube sampling (LHS) and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm. This guarantees a complete offline-online decoupling, leading to an efficient RB method - referred to as POD-NN - suitable also for general nonlinear problems with a nonaffine parametric dependence. Numerical studies are presented for the nonlinear Poisson equation and for driven cavity viscous flows, modeled through the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both physical and geometrical parametrizations are considered. Several results confirm the accuracy of the POD-NN method and show the substantial speed-up enabled at the online stage as compared to a traditional RB strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The objective of this work is to investigate the challenges encountered in Scale-Resolving Simulations (SRS) of turbulent wake flows driven by spatially-developing coherent structures. SRS of practical interest are expressly intended for efficiently computing such flows by resolving only the most important features of the coherent structures and modelling the remainder as stochastic field. The success of SRS methods depends upon three important factors: i) ability to identify key flow mechanisms responsible for the generation of coherent structures; ii) determine the optimum range of resolution required to adequately capture key elements of coherent structures; and iii) ensure that the modelled part is comprised nearly exclusively of fully-developed stochastic turbulence. This study considers the canonical case of the flow around a circular cylinder to address the aforementioned three key issues. It is first demonstrated using experimental evidence that the vortex-shedding instability and flow-structure development involves four important stages. Aseries of SRS computations of progressively increasing resolution (decreasing cut-off length) are performed. An a prioribasis for locating the origin of the coherent structures development is proposed and examined. The criterion is based on the fact that the coherent structures are generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The most important finding is that the key aspects of coherent structures can be resolved only if the effective computational Reynolds number (based on total viscosity) exceeds the critical value of the KH instability in laminar flows. Finally, a quantitative criterion assessing the nature of the unresolved field based on the strain-rate ratio of mean and unresolved fields is examined. The two proposed conditions and rationale offer a quantitative basis for developing "good practice" guidelines for SRS of complex turbulent wake flows with coherent structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We implemented the elastic lattice polymer model on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and show that the GPU is very efficient for polymer simulations of dense polymer melts. The implementation is able to perform up to 4.1 . 10(9) Monte Carlo moves per second. Compared to our standard CPU implementation, we find an effective speed-up of a factor 92. Using this GPU implementation we studied the equilibrium properties and the dynamics of non-concatenated ring polymers in a melt of such polymers, using Rouse modes. With increasing polymer length, we found a very slow transition to compactness with a growth exponent nu approximate to 1/3. Numerically we find that the longest internal time scale of the polymer scales as N-3.1, with N the molecular weight of the ring polymer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, a parallel Fokker-Planck-DSMC algorithm for rare fied gas flow simulation in complex domains at all Knudsen numbers was developed by the authors.
   Fokker-Planck-DSMC (FP-DSMC) is an augmentation of the classical DSMC algorithm, which mitigates the near-continuum deficiencies in terms of computational cost of pure DSMC. At each time step, based on a local Knudsen number criterion, the discrete DSMC collision operator is dynamically switched to the Fokker-Planck operator, which is based on the integration of continuous stochastic processes in time, and has fixed computational cost per particle, rather than per collision. In this contribution, we present an extension of the previous implementation with automatic local mesh refinement and parallel load-balancing. In particular, we show how the properties of discrete approximations to space-filling curves enable an efficient implementation. Exemplary numerical studies highlight the capabilities of the new code. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The advection equation is the basis for mathematical models of continuum mechanics. In the approximate solution of nonstationary problems it is necessary to inherit main properties of the conservatism and monotonicity of the solution. In this paper, the advection equation is written in the symmetric form, where the advection operator is the half-sum of advection operators in conservative (divergent) and non-conservative (characteristic) forms. The advection operator is skew-symmetric. Standard finite element approximations in space are used. The standard explicit two-level scheme for the advection equation is absolutely unstable. New conditionally stable regularized schemes are constructed, on the basis of the general theory of stability (well-posedness) of operator-difference schemes, the stability conditions of the explicit Lax-Wendroff scheme are established. Unconditionally stable and conservative schemes are implicit schemes of the second (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and fourth order. The conditionally stable implicit Lax-Wendroff scheme is constructed. The accuracy of the investigated explicit and implicit two-level schemes for an approximate solution of the advection equation is illustrated by the numerical results of a model two-dimensional problem.

AB An unstructured electrostatic Particle-In-Cell (EUPIC) method is developed on arbitrary tetrahedral grids for simulation of plasmas bounded by arbitrary geometries. The electric potential in EUPIC is obtained on cell vertices from a finite volume Multi-Point Flux Approximation of Gauss' law using the indirect dual cell with Dirichlet, Neumann and external circuit boundary conditions. The resulting matrix equation for the nodal potential is solved with a restarted generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) and an ILU(0) preconditioner algorithm, parallelized using a combination of node coloring and level scheduling approaches. The electric field on vertices is obtained using the gradient theorem applied to the indirect dual cell. The algorithms for injection, particle loading, particle motion, and particle tracking are parallelized for unstructured tetrahedral grids. The algorithms for the potential solver, electric field evaluation, loading, scatter-gather algorithms are verified using analytic solutions for test cases subject to Laplace and Poisson equations. Grid sensitivity analysis examines the L-2 and L-infinity norms of the relative error in potential, field, and charge density as a function of edge-averaged and volume-averaged cell size. Analysis shows second order of convergence for the potential and first order of convergence for the electric field and charge density. Temporal sensitivity analysis is performed and the momentum and energy conservation properties of the particle integrators in EUPIC are examined. The effects of cell size and timestep on heating, slowing-down and the deflection times are quantified. The heating, slowing-down and the deflection times are found to be almost linearly dependent on number of particles per cell. EUPIC simulations of current collection by cylindrical Langmuir probes in collisionless plasmas show good comparison with previous experimentally validated numerical results. These simulations were also used in a parallelization efficiency investigation. Results show that the EUPIC has efficiency of more than 80% when the simulation is performed on a single CPU from a non-uniform memory access node and the efficiency is decreasing as the number of threads further increases. The EUPIC is applied to the simulation of the multispecies plasma flow over a geometrically complex CubeSat in Low Earth Orbit. The EUPIC potential and flowfield distribution around the CubeSat exhibit features that are consistent with previous simulations over simpler geometrical bodies. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A nonlinear system of partial differential equations capable of describing the nonlinear propagation and attenuation of finite amplitude perturbations in thermoviscous media is presented. This system constitutes a full nonlinear wave model that has been formulated in the conservation form. Initially, this model is investigated analytically in the inviscid limit where it has been found that the resulting flux function fulfills the Lax-Wendroff theorem, and the scheme can match the solutions of the Westervelt and Burgers equations numerically. Here, high-order numerical descriptions of strongly nonlinear wave propagations become of great interest. For that matter we consider finite difference formulations of the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes associated with explicit strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) time integration methods. Although this strategy is known to be computationally demanding, it is found to be effective when implemented to be solved in graphical processing units (GPUs). As we consider wave propagations in unbounded domains, perfectly matching layers (PML) have been also considered in this work. The proposed system model is validated and illustrated by using one- and two-dimensional benchmark test cases proposed in the literature for nonlinear acoustic propagation in homogeneous thermoviscous media.

AB A turbulent inflow for a rapid and low noise switch from RANS to Wall-Modelled LES on curvilinear grids with compressible flow solvers is presented. It can be embedded within the computational domain in practical applications with WMLES grids around three-dimensional geometries in a flexible zonal hybrid RANS/LES modelling context. It relies on a physics-motivated combination of Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation (ZDES) as the WMLES technique together with a Dynamic Forcing method processing the fluctuations caused by a Zonal Immersed Boundary Condition describing roughness elements. The performance in generating a physically-sound turbulent flow field with the proper mean skin friction and turbulent profiles after a short relaxation length is equivalent to more common inflow methods thanks to the generation of large-scale streamwise vorticity by the roughness elements. Comparisons in a low Mach-number zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate turbulent boundary layer up to Re-theta = 6 100 reveal that the pressure field is dominated by the spurious noise caused by the synthetic turbulence methods (Synthetic Eddy Method and White Noise injection), contrary to the new low-noise approach which may be used to obtain the low-frequency component of wall pressure and reproduce its intermittent nature. The robustness of the method is tested in the flow around a three-element airfoil with WMLES in the upper boundary layer near the trailing edge of the main element. In spite of the very short relaxation distance allowed, self-sustainable resolved turbulence is generated in the outer layer with significantly less spurious noise than with the approach involving White Noise. The ZDES grid count for this latter test case is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the Wall-Resolved LES requirement and a unique mesh is involved, which is much simpler than some multiple-mesh strategies devised for WMLES or turbulent inflow.

AB The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been extensively used to simulate varieties of electromagnetic interaction problems. However, because of its Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) condition, the maximum time step size of this method is limited by the minimum size of cell used in the computational domain. So the FDTD method is inefficient to simulate the electromagnetic problems which have very fine structures. To deal with this problem, the Hybrid Implicit Explicit (HIE)-FDTD method is developed. The HIE-FDTD method uses the hybrid implicit explicit difference in the direction with fine structures to avoid the confinement of the fine spatial mesh on the time step size. So this method has much higher computational efficiency than the FDTD method, and is extremely useful for the problems which have fine structures in one direction. In this paper, the basic formulations, time stability condition and dispersion error of the HIE-FDTD method are presented. The implementations of several boundary conditions, including the connect boundary, absorbing boundary and periodic boundary are described, then some applications and important developments of this method are provided. The goal of this paper is to provide an historical overview and future prospects of the HIE-FDTD method. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a multidimensional asymptotic preserving scheme for the approximation of a mixture of compressible flows. Fluids are modelled by two Euler systems of equations coupled with a friction term.
   The asymptotic preserving property is mandatory for this kind of model, to derive a scheme that behaves well in all regimes (i.e. whatever the friction parameter value is). The method we propose is defined in ALE coordinates, using a Lagrange plus remap approach. This imposes a multidimensional definition and analysis of the scheme. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We consider in this paper the mathematical and numerical modeling of reflective boundary conditions (BC) associated to Boltzmann-Poisson systems, including diffusive reflection in addition to specularity, in the context of electron transport in semiconductor device modeling at nano scales, and their implementation in Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes. We study these BC on the physical boundaries of the device and develop a numerical approximation to model an insulating boundary condition, or equivalently, a pointwise zero flux mathematical condition for the electron transport equation. Such condition balances the incident and reflective momentum flux at the microscopic level, pointwise at the boundary, in the case of a more general mixed reflection with momentum dependant specularity probability p((k) over right arrow). We compare the computational prediction of physical observables given by the numerical implementation of these different reflection conditions in our DG scheme for BP models, and observe that the diffusive condition influences the kinetic moments over the whole domain in position space.

AB A third-order accurate gas-kinetic scheme based on the correction procedure via reconstruction (CPR) framework is developed for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on triangular meshes. The scheme combines the accuracy and efficiency of the CPR formulation with the multidimensional characteristics and robustness of the gas-kinetic flux solver. Comparing with high-order finite volume gas-kinetic methods, the current scheme is more compact and efficient by avoiding wide stencils on unstructured meshes. Unlike the traditional CPR method where the inviscid and viscous terms are treated differently, the inviscid and viscous fluxes in the current scheme are coupled and computed uniformly through the kinetic evolution model. In addition, the present scheme adopts a fully coupled spatial and temporal gas distribution function for the flux evaluation, achieving high-order accuracy in both space and time within a single step. Numerical tests with a wide range of flow problems, from nearly incompressible to supersonic flows with strong shocks, for both inviscid and viscous problems, demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the present scheme.

ID APPROXIMATIONS
AB In this paper, we apply the so-called generalized empirical interpolation method (GEIM) to address the problem of sensor placement in nuclear reactors. This task is challenging due to the accumulation of a number of difficulties like the complexity of the underlying physics and the constraints in the admissible sensor locations and their number. As a result, the placement, still today, strongly relies on the know-how and experience of engineers from different areas of expertise. The present methodology contributes to making this process become more systematic and, in turn, simplify and accelerate the procedure. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is recognized as a promising method for high-fidelity flow predictions in turbomachinery applications. The presented approach consists of the coupling of several instances of the same LES unstructured solver through an overset grid method. A high-order interpolation, implemented within this coupling method, is introduced and evaluated on several test cases. It is shown to be third order accurate, to preserve the accuracy of various second and third order convective schemes and to ensure the continuity of diffusive fluxes and subgrid scale tensors even in detrimental interface configurations. In this analysis, three types of spurious waves generated at the interface are identified. They are significantly reduced by the high-order interpolation at the interface. The latter having the same cost as the original lower order method, the high-order overset grid method appears as a promising alternative to be used in all the applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) method suitable for hybrid unstructured meshes that allows for local refinement and de-refinement of the computational grid during the evolution of the flow. The adaptive implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method introduced in this work (ForestDG) is based on a topological representation of the computational mesh by a hierarchical structure consisting of oct-quad- and binary trees. Adaptive mesh refinement (h-refinement) enables us to increase the spatial resolution of the computational mesh in the vicinity of the points of interest such as interfaces, geometrical features, or flow discontinuities. The local increase in the expansion order (p-refinement) at areas of high strain rates or vorticity magnitude results in an increase of the order of accuracy in the region of shear layers and vortices.
   A graph of unitarian-trees, representing hexahedral, prismatic and tetrahedral elements is used for the representation of the initial domain. The ancestral elements of the mesh can be split into self-similar elements allowing each tree to grow branches to an arbitrary level of refinement. The connectivity of the elements, their genealogy and their partitioning are described by linked lists of pointers. An explicit calculation of these relations, presented in this paper, facilitates the on-the-fly splitting, merging and repartitioning of the computational mesh by rearranging the links of each node of the tree with a minimal computational overhead. The modal basis used in the DG implementation facilitates the mapping of the fluxes across the non conformal faces.
   The AMR methodology is presented and assessed using a series of inviscid and viscous test cases. Also, the AMR methodology is used for the modelling of the interaction between droplets and the carrier phase in a two-phase flow. This approach is applied to the analysis of a spray injected into a chamber of quiescent air, using the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. This enables us to refine the computational mesh in the vicinity of the droplet parcels and accurately resolve the coupling between the two phases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Basket analytics is a powerful tool in the retail context for acquiring knowledge about consumer shopping habits and preferences. In this paper, we propose a business analytics approach that mines customer visit segments from basket sales data. We characterize a customer visit by the purchased product categories in the basket and identify the shopping intention or mission behind the visit e.g. a 'breakfast' visit to purchase cereal, milk, bread, cheese etc. We also suggest a semi-supervised feature selection approach that uses the product taxonomy as input and suggests customized categories as output. This approach is utilized to balance the product taxonomy tree that has a significant effect on the data mining results. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a real case of a major European fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) retailer. Apart from its theoretical contribution, the proposed approach extracts knowledge that may support several decisions ranging from marketing campaigns per customer segment, redesign of a store's layout to product recommendations.

AB Intelligent systems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) allow to eliminate duplicated sensed data and to efficiently route them to a central processing unit. Thus, augmenting WSN lifetime while keeping sensors connectivity and routing the sensed information through an optimized network structure. This work discusses a set of improved exact solution strategies that were effective to the design of a minimum energy consumption structure for the sensors data communication. We present an extended version of a primal-dual model for the minimum cost dominating tree (DT) problem, as well as valid inequalities to improve its linear relaxation. We discuss structural properties of dominating sets and trees used to conceive efficient cutting plane strategies. We adapt accordingly reduction techniques from dominating sets to the DT problem. The new solution techniques allow to handle to optimality challenging benchmark and new randomly generated DT instances with up to 100 nodes, which was not possible to achieve with state-of-the-art models for the problem.

AB Mining incrementally closed item sets is an essential problem in data mining. Once closed item sets and their frequencies are found, the frequentation of a found closed item set is always determined. In recent times, concept lattice has been used as an intermediate structure for the purpose of mining incrementally (frequent) closed sets. However, lattice operations are very time-consuming when data fluctuates as well as the memory for lattice is consumed a lot when data becomes large. This paper proposes an intermediate structure called constructive set to produce closed sets along with their occurrence frequencies. The constructive set is constructed from a set of group patterns - an extended form of bit chains. This paper also proposes algorithms based on the constructive set for mining incrementally closed sets when adding and removing transactions. The proposed algorithms along with storing and calculating on bit data have significant advantages shown through experiments and comparisons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social network data contains many hidden relationships. The most well known is the communities formed by users. Moreover, typical social network data, such as Twitter, can also be interpreted in terms of three-dimensional relationships; namely the users, issues discussed by the users, and terminology chosen by the users in these discussions. In this paper, we propose a new problem to generate co-clusters in these three dimensions simultaneously. There are three major differences between our problem and the standard co-clustering problem definition: a node can be a member of more than one clusters; all the nodes are not necessarily members of some cluster; and edges are signed and cluster are expected to have high density of positive signed edges, and low density of negative signed edges. We apply our method to the tweets of British politicians just before the Brexit referendum. Our motivation is to discover clusters of politicians, issues and the sentimental words politicians use to express their feelings on these issues in their tweets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Falls are the leading cause of disability and death among the elderly. Over the years, several inertial-based wearable devices for automatic fall and pre-fall detection have been devised. Under controlled condition, these systems show a high performance for unbalance detection (up to 100% of specificity and sensitivity), however the mean lead time before the impact is about 200-400 ms. Although this period of time is enough to active an impact reduction system (i.e wearable airbag) to minimize injury, it is necessary to increase it so as to improve the system efficiency and reliability. A user's muscle behavior analysis could be more strategic than that of a kinematic evaluation one, permitting a rapid recognition of an imbalance event. This also holds true for several research studies on muscles response during a state of imbalance, whereas a limit number of them deal with the development of wearable electromyography (EMG)-based systems for human imbalance detection, suitable for predicting a lack of balance in real time. With respects these limitations, the main purpose of this work has been the development of a low computational cost expert system for real time and automatic fall risk detection. The analysis of this is achieved through lower limb muscles behavior monitoring. A Machine Learning scheme has been chosen in order to overcome the well-known drawbacks of threshold approaches widely used in pre-fall systems, in which the algorithm parameters have to be set according to the users' specific physical characteristics. Ten kinds of time-domain features, commonly used in the analysis of the lower-limb muscle activity, have been investigated. With a view to reducing the processing complexity, the Markov Random Field (MRF) based Fisher-Markov feature selector was tested. It showed a high degree of accuracy in the EMG-based features selection for lack of balance detection. The Co-Contraction Index, Integrated EMG and Willison Amplitude features have been also considered. The supervised classification phase has been obtained through a low computational cost and a high classification accuracy level Linear Discriminant Analysis. The developed system shows high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity (about 90%) in controlled conditions, with a mean lead-time before the impact of about 775 ms. Therefore, the feasibility of a quick and wearable surface EMG-based unbalance detection system, by using Machine Learning methodology, has been demonstrated. The system may recognize a fall event during the initial phase, increasing the decision making time and minimizing the incorrect and inappropriate activations of the protection system, in real life scenario.

AB Recognition of signature is a method of identification, whereas verification takes the decision about its genuineness. Though recognition and verification both play important role in forensic sciences, however, recognition is of special importance to the banking sectors. In this paper, we present a methodology to analyse 3D signatures captured using Leap motion sensor with the help of a new feature-set extracted using convex hull vertices enclosing the signature. We have used k-NN and HMM classifiers to classify signatures. Experiments carried out using our dataset as well as publicly available datasets reveal that the proposed feature-set can reduce the computational burden significantly as compared to existing features. It has been observed that a 10-fold computational gain can be achieved with non-noticeable loss in performance using the proposed feature-set as compared with the existing high-level features due to significant reduction in the feature vector size. On a large dataset of 1600 samples, two of the existing features take approximately 60s and 3s to recognise signatures using k-NN and HMM classifiers. However, features constructed using convex hull vertices take 1.9s and 0.4s, respectively. Our proposed system can be used in applications where recognition and verification need to be performed quickly on large datasets comprising with billions of samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With growing academic interest and pragmatic need, adaptive two-stage production modeling becomes an emergent research topic for decision sciences and production management. Although prior research has addressed sequential production process, the primary focus was limited to efficiency analysis with a narrow scope of applications. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been commonly used for earlier studies; however, its lack of learning and deficiency in predictive capability seriously diminish the practical utility of DEA and call for an intelligent information-processing technique for further advancement. This paper uniquely presents an output-focused backpropagation neural network (BPNN) approach with capabilities to capture patterns of high performers, a significant departure from conventional efficiency driven DEA analysis, as well as a promising analytic paradigm. In so doing, the proposed standalone BPNN can predict above-average performance and supports managerial decision-making in setting progressive performance targets in consecutive stages. The sound empirical application to the two-stage bank production process proves the effectiveness of the proposed analytic paradigm. In brief, the intelligent learning model advances existing two-stage production modeling with a methodological breakthrough and makes significant contributions to the existing literature.

AB Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are designed to aid the radiologist in interpreting medical images. They are usually based on lesion detection and segmentation algorithms whose performance depends on a large number of parameters. While time consuming and sub-optimal, parameter values are most often selected through manual search strategies. Genetic or evolutionary algorithms (GA) are effective optimization methods that mimic biological evolution. Genetic algorithms have been shown to efficiently manage complex search spaces, and can be applied to all kinds of objective functions, including discontinuous, nondifferentiable, or highly nonlinear ones. In this study, we have adopted an evolutionary approach to the problem of parameter optimization. We show that the genetic algorithm is able to effectively converge to a better solution than manual optimization on a case study for digital breast tomosynthesis CAD. Parameter optimization was framed as a constrained optimization problem, where the function to be maximized was defined as the weighted sum of sensitivity, false positive rate and segmentation accuracy. A modified Dice coefficient was defined to assess the segmentation quality of individual lesions. Finally, all viable solutions evaluated by the GA were studied by means of exploratory data analysis techniques, such as association rules, to gain useful insights on the strength of the influence of each parameter on overall algorithm performance. We showed that this combination was able to identify multiple ranges of viable solutions with good segmentation accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Markowitz portfolio optimization problem is heavily dependent on the input parameters. To this end, the uncertainties are considered in the portfolio problem. Furthermore, in order to relax the normality assumption of Markowitz portfolio problem, higher moments (skewness and kurtosis) are also incorporated. Introducing the concepts of set ordered relations and the idea of robust counterpart from Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998, 1999), robust multiobjective portfolio models with higher moments are analytically built. Meanwhile, multiobjective particle swarm optimization is employed to obtain various (robustly) efficient solutions. Finally, using the data from the real stock market, various robustly efficient frontiers are characterized as well as the portfolio performances compared. The empirical results indicate that the robustly efficient solutions obtained by the combination of uncertainties and higher moments in the portfolio problem would be immensely helpful for investors and portfolio managers.

ID DATA VISUALIZATION
AB In statistics, machine learning, and related fields, feature selection is the process of choosing a smaller subset of features to work with. This is an important topic since selecting a subset of features can help analysts to interpret models and data, and to decrease computational runtimes, While many techniques are purely automatic, the data visualization community has produced a number of interactive approaches where users can make decisions taking into account their domain knowledge. In this paper we propose a new visualization technique based on radial axes that allows analysts to perform feature selection effectively, in contrast to previous radial axes methods. This is achieved by employing alternative scaled axes that provide insight regarding the features that have a smaller contribution to the visualizations. Therefore, analysts can use the technique to carry out interactive backwards feature elimination, by discarding the least relevant features according to the information on the plots and their expertise. Our approach can be coupled with any linear dimensionality reduction method, and can be used when performing analyses of cluster structure, correlations, class separability, etc. Specifically, in this paper we focus on combining the proposed technique with methods designed for classification. Lastly, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal through a case study analyzing high-dimensional medical chronic conditions data. In particular, clinicians have used the technique for determining the most important features that discriminate between patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Watermarking is utilized for securing multimedia data exchange. The techniques used to embed a watermark typically require optimizing scheme parameters often through applying meta-heuristic optimization techniques. Although meta-heuristic techniques have been widely used due to their performance enhancing capability, they are not suitable for time sensitive applications due to their large time consumption. In this paper, a time-efficient optimization based on machine learning is proposed to find the best embedding strength parameter for robust image watermarking in terms of both the imperceptibility and robustness. First, a watermark embedding scheme is designed in the Discrete Cosine Transform domain. which provide a proper robustness against common watermarking attacks. Then, a training process is performed through selecting set of images upon which the watermarking is applied and optimized using the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. Observation data is collected, which includes the optimum strength values along with the feature vectors that represent the training images. The features, of an image, are extracted by calculating the optimization fitness function at different values of the embedding strength. Finally, new set of images are chosen to be watermarked using the optimum embedding parameters that are predicted through the K-Nearest Neighborhood regression method. Experimental results show that the proposed method consumes considerably less time to evaluate the optimum solutions compared to using meta-heuristic optimization. Meanwhile, the error between the optimum and predicted optimum solutions has negligible impact on the optimization objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sequence classification for credit-card fraud detection

AB Due to the growing volume of electronic payments, the monetary strain of credit-card fraud is turning into a substantial challenge for financial institutions and service providers, thus forcing them to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. However, modern data-driven and learning-based methods, despite their popularity in other domains, only slowly find their way into business applications.
   In this paper, we phrase the fraud detection problem as a sequence classification task and employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to incorporate transaction sequences. We also integrate state-of-the-art feature aggregation strategies and report our results by means of traditional retrieval metrics.
   A comparison to a baseline random forest (RF) classifier showed that the LSTM improves detection accuracy on offline transactions where the card-holder is physically present at a merchant. Both the sequential and non-sequential learning approaches benefit strongly from manual feature aggregation strategies. A subsequent analysis of true positives revealed that both approaches tend to detect different frauds, which suggests a combination of the two. We conclude our study with a discussion on both practical and scientific challenges that remain unsolved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Towards a common implementation of reinforcement learning for multiple
   robotic tasks
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Reinforcement learning; Robotics; Exploration
AB Mobile robots are increasingly being employed for performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RI.) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a, core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the earning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(lambda) (TOSL) with QBIASSE can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lipid transmethylation methods described in the literature are not always evaluated with care so to insure that the methods are effective, especially on food matrix or biological samples containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The aim of the present study was to select a method suitable for all lipid species rich in long chain n-3 PUFA. Three published methods were adapted and applied on individual lipid classes. Lipid (trans) methylation efficiency was characterized in terms of reaction yield and gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The acid-catalyzed method was unable to convert triglycerides and sterol esters, while the method using an incubation at a moderate temperature was ineffective on phospholipids and sterol esters. On the whole only the method using sodium methoxide and sulfuric acid was effective on lipid classes taken individually or in a complex medium. This study highlighted the use of an appropriate (trans) methylation method for insuring an accurate fatty acid composition.

AB An iTRAQ-based strategy was applied to investigate proteome changes in mud shrimp during long-term frozen storage under different conditions. A total of 226 proteins was identified as differential abundance proteins (DAPs) in mud shrimp from two frozen treatment groups (-20 degrees C and -40 degrees C) compared with the fresh control group. The proteome changes in mud shrimp muscle stored under -20 degrees C was much greater than that under -40 degrees C. Correlation analysis between DAPs and quality traits of mud shrimp muscle showed that 12 proteins were correlated closely with color (L*, a*, and b* value) and texture (hardness, elasticity, and chewiness). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that most of these proteins were involved in protein structure, metabolic enzymes, and protein turnover. Among them, several proteins might be potential protein markers for color, and some proteins are good candidate predictors for textural properties of mud shrimp muscle.

AB The objective of this study was to fractionate lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3) and investigate their structural properties and prebiotic activities. Two main fractions of resistant starch precipitated gradually by ethanol at concentrations of 20% and 30% were named as LRS3-20% and LRS3-30%, respectively. The swelling power and solubility of LRS3-20% were smaller compared to LRS3-30%, and their moisture and resistant starch contents were not significantly different. LRS3-20% and LRS3-30% had molecular weights mainly of 2.0x10(4)-4.0x10(4) and 1.0x10(4)-2.0x10(4) g/mol. Layered strips and gully shapes were evident on the rough surfaces of LRS320%, while LRS3-30% displayed a relatively smooth surface. Both LRS3-20% and LRS3-30% had a B-type crystalline structure with LRS3-20% containing more ordered structures and double-helices. Furthermore, LRS3-20% displayed higher prebiotic activities against Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Lactobacillus acidophilus compared to LRS3-30% and high amylose maize starch. This effect was related to its rough surface and double helix structure.

AB A new enzymatic methodology is herein proposed to measure free asparagine content in wheat grains and to predict their potential for Maillard reaction products. Our model estimates the acrylamide levels generated during the industrial heat treatment of whole-grain wheat based on free asparagine and glucose measurements. We selected fifteen wheat varieties currently grown in Belgium as benchmark for the present study. While conventional chromatographic methods require a long and tedious multi-step sample preparation, the proposed method takes advantage of being simple and quick. Statistical analysis of free asparagine content indicates that selected wheat varieties can be classified into seven content levels from 0.0149% to 0.0216% of the dry matter. Based on our analysis, the varieties KWS Ozon, Benchmark and Pionier appears to be the most suitable for thermal processing (i.e. cooking applications).

AB Discrimination of geographical origin of extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) is of great importance for legislation and consumers worldwide. The feasibility of a rapid discrimination of four different geographical origins of EVOOs with terahertz spectroscopy system was examined. Different chemometrics including least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) combined with principal component analysis (PCA), genetic algorithm (GA) were compared to obtain the best discrimination model. The results demonstrated that there were apparent differences among the four different geographical origins of EVOOs in fatty acid compositions and the absorbance spectra, and an excellent classification (accuracy was 96.25% in prediction set) could be achieved using the LS-SVM method combine with GA. It can be concluded that THz spectroscopy together with chemometrics would be a promising technique to rapid discriminate the geographical origin of EVOOs with high efficiency.

AB This study investigated the effect of, and interactions between, US Brown Swiss (BS) genetics and season on milk yield, basic composition and fatty acid profiles, from cows on low-input farms in Switzerland. Milk samples (n = 1,976) were collected from 1,220 crossbreed cows with differing proportions of BS, Braunvieh and Original Braunvieh genetics on 40 farms during winter-housing and summer-grazing. Cows with more BS genetics produced more milk in winter but not in summer, possibly because of underfeeding potentially high-yielding cows on low-input pasture-based diets. Cows with more Original Braunvieh genetics produced milk with more (i) nutritionally desirable eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids, throughout the year, and (ii) vaccenic and a-linolenic acids, total omega-3 fatty acid concentrations and a higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio only during summer-grazing. This suggests that overall milk quality could be improved by re-focussing breeding strategies on cows' ability to respond to local dietary environments and seasonal dietary changes.

AB A rapid, sensitive, and validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of four iminosugars, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), D-fagomine (FAG), 2-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-DNJ (Gal-DNJ), and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-fagomine (Glu-FAG), in mulberry leaves. The method used hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Based on this method, the seasonal variations of iminosugars in the leaves of different mulberry species (Morus alba, Morus multicaulis Perr, Morus atropurpurea Roxb. and Morus wittiorum Hand-Mazz.) collected in Guangzhou, China, during 10 consecutive months in 2013 were investigated. The results indicated that the maximum content of DNJ in the leaves of all four species occurred in summer (June or July). The highest FAG level was found in spring (April or May). The highest levels of Gal-DNJ and Glu-FAG were recorded in autumn (September or October).

AB The conversion of whey permeates to galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) was studied by the enzymatic action of beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae in a continuous flow packed-bed reactor. A novel method of enzyme immobilization involving covalent immobilization of beta-galactosidase on 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane(3-APTES)-modified glass beads was developed by the cross-linking method. The pH and temperature dependence of the enzymatic efficiency of the glass bead-immobilized enzyme was compared with that of the free enzyme. Increased pH and thermal stabilities were observed for the immobilized enzyme versus the free enzyme. The reusability of the enzyme immobilized packed-bed reactor was studied and only about 4.6% of GOS yield was lost after eight reuses. Repeated cycle reactions were also carried out to improve the formation of GOS. The results showed that the GOS formation increased and a maximum GOS yield of 39.3% with 56.4% lactose conversion was obtained after the 2nd cycle of passing.

AB Bivalve black clam, Villorita cyprinoides is traditional seafood in Southwestern coast of Arabian Sea. In this study, bioactivity-guided purification of ethyl acetate: methanol extract of black clam was carried out. Two irregular meroterpenoids {tetrahydro-3-methoxy-5-((E)-8,12-dimethyloct-8-enyl)-pyran-2-one (1) and dihydro-5-(8-(9,12-dihydro-8-methyl-11-propyl-2H-pyran-8-yl)-ethyl)-furan-2(3H)-one (2)} and two hexahydro-isochromenyl-meroterpenoids (3-4) were identified. The structures were characterized by detailed spectroscopy and their antioxidant/anti-inflammatory potentials were evaluated. Compound 2 registered significantly greater 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability (IC50 < 0.65 mg/mL) than other analogues (IC50 >= 0.70 mg/mL). Ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelating ability was higher for 1-2 (IC50 similar to 0.84 mg/mL) than alpha-tocopherol (IC50 0.89 mg/mL). The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory potential of furano-meroterpenoid analogue, 2 (IC50 0.76 mg/mL) was greater than other compounds (IC50 > 0.90 mg/mL). An optimum hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance of furano-meroterpenoid and lesser steric bulk manifested towards its greater bioactivities compared to other compounds. These anti-inflammatory and antioxidant leads could be used as potential functional food components.

AB Although some commercial vaccines against grass carp reovirus (GCRV) are available, given the many varieties of GCRV and limited types of vaccines, the disease caused by GCRV remains a major problem, which leads to economic losses in grass carp aquaculture. A reovirus strain (GCRV-HN14) was recently isolated from local diseased fish in our laboratory. The S11 segment of GCRV-HN14 was speculated to encode the virus capsid protein VP35. In our study, the Si 1 segment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) to construct the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-s11, which was then transfected into CIK cells, and the VP35 protein was successfully expressed. Grass carp was immunized with pcDNA3.1-s11, and the in vivo distribution and expression of the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmids were analyzed by PCR and Western blot. Recombinant plasmids were detected in the blood, liver, spleen, kidney, and muscle. However, protein expression could only be detected in the muscle. The immune protection of the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmid in grass carp was evaluated using a series of experiments. Results showed that the population of white blood cells significantly increased at 1, 7, and 14 days post-immunization (dpi) and reached a peak with (9.58 +/- 0.72) x 10(7)/ml at 7 dpi (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The percentage of neutrophils reached a peak with (24.13 +/- 2.38)% at 7 dpi (P < 0.01), whereas the lymphocytes peaked with (93.30 +/- 4.71)% at 14 dpi (P < 0.05). Serum antibody levels were significantly enhanced in immunized fish at 14, 21, and 28 dpi (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression levels of type I interferon, immunoglobulin M, Toll like receptor 22, and major histocompatibility complex class I were significantly up-regulated in the head kidney and spleen of immunized fish (P< 0.05). Grass carp immunized with pcDNA3.1-s11 exhibited a higher survival percentage (70.4%-73.3%) than the controls (5%-13%). Overall, as a DNA vaccine, the pcDNA3.1-s11 plasmid could induce immune protection against GCRV. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage requires investments, but the costs and effectiveness of interventions to increase coverage remain poorly characterized. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify peer-reviewed studies published in English that reported interventions aimed at increasing immunization coverage and the associated costs and effectiveness of the interventions. We found limited information in the literature, with many studies reporting effectiveness estimates, but not providing cost information. Using the available data, we developed a cost function to support future programmatic decisions about investments in interventions to increase immunization coverage for relatively low and high-income countries. The cost function estimates the non-vaccine cost per dose of interventions to increase absolute immunization coverage by one percent, through either campaigns or routine immunization. The cost per dose per percent increase in absolute coverage increased with higher baseline coverage, demonstrating increasing incremental costs required to reach higher coverage levels. Future studies should evaluate the performance of the cost function and add to the database of available evidence to better characterize heterogeneity in costs and generalizability of the cost function.

AB Background: Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Annual vaccination is effective in its prevention and is recommended especially in susceptible populations such as the elderly over 65 years, children younger than 5, pregnant women, and people with chronic diseases. Overall, South Korea has a high vaccination rate owing to its National Immunization Program, although the method and extent of its coverage varies among the target subgroups. The aim of this study is to assess the trend of influenza vaccination coverage between 2005 and 2014 in South Korea to address the influence of sociodemographic and disease factors on vaccination behavior. Also, we aim to compare the vaccination coverage of target subgroups and evaluate the effect of relevant policies to provide suggestions for their improvement.
   Methods: A total of 61,036 respondents from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys III to VI were included.
   Results: The total influenza vaccination coverage increased from 38.0% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2014. Vaccination coverage was higher among the elderly aged >= 65 years (range, 70.0-79.8%; p-for-trend <0.001) and children under 5 (range, 64.6-78.9%; p-for-trend < 0.001) than among pregnant women (range, 9.4-37.8%; p-for-trend = 0.122) and people with chronic diseases (range, 29.6-42.6%; p-for-tren d = 0.068) from 2005 to 2014. High vaccination coverage was associated with female gender, rural residence, low education level, high income, and increasing number of chronic diseases. But the effect of high income on high vaccination coverage was absent in the elderly aged >= 65 years and children under 5.
   Conclusion: Influenza vaccination rates have steadily increased from 2005 to 2014 in South Korea. Disparities between target groups correspond to their financial coverage under the National Immunization Program, and financial aids remove the influence of high income on higher vaccination rates. Future vaccination policies should focus on pregnant women and people with chronic diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This position paper replaces the May 2006 WHO position paper on tetanus vaccines (Tetanus vaccines: WHO position paper, 2006). The position paper summarizes the recent developments in the field of tetanus prevention and provides revised guidance on the optimal timing of recommended tetanus vaccine booster doses.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation table. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of TT-containing vaccines (TTCVs) were discussed by SAGE in October 2016; evidence presented at the meeting can be accessed at: http://www.who.intfimmunization/sage/ meetings/2016/october/presentations_background_docs/en/.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of mice inoculated with M. bovis BCG Pasteur recombinant expressing the PLD protein and challenged with a C. pseudotuberculosis virulent strain. Four groups were immunized with a sterile 0.9% saline solution (G1), 10(6) CFU of M. bovis BCG Pasteur (G2), 10(6) CFU of M. bovis BCG/pld (G3) or 106 CFU of M. bovis BCG/pld with a booster with rPLD (G4) and challenged with 10(4) CFU of C pseudotuberculosis MIC-6 strain. The highest survival rate of 88% was observed in G4, followed by 77% in G3 and 66% in G2. A significant statistical difference was observed in the levels of cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-10 in vaccinated groups (G3 and G4) when compared with the control group (G1) (p < 0.05). The results seem promising as the recombinant vaccine elicited a cellular immune response and provided significant survival after a high virulent challenge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB African Horse Sickness Virus (AHSV) (Orbivirus genus, Reoviridae family) causes high mortality in naive domestic horses with enormous economic and socio-emotional impact. There are nine AHSV serotypes showing limited cross neutralization. AHSV is transmitted by competent species of Culicoides biting midges. AHS is a serious threat beyond the African continent as endemic Culicoides species in moderate climates transmit the closely related prototype bluetongue virus. There is a desperate need for safe and efficacious vaccines, while DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated) vaccines would accelerate control of AHS. Previously, we have shown that highly virulent AHSV with an in-frame deletion of 77 amino acids (aa) in NS3/NS3a is completely safe, does not cause viremia and shows protective capacity. This deletion mutant is a promising DISA (Disabled Infectious Single Animal) vaccine platform, since exchange of serotype specific virus proteins has been shown for all nine serotypes. Here, we show that a prototype NS3 competitive ELISA is DIVA compliant to AHS DISA vaccine platforms. Epitope mapping of NS3/NS3a shows that more research is needed to evaluate this prototype serological DIVA assay regarding sensitivity and specificity, in particular for AHSVs expressing antigenically different NS3/NS3a proteins. Further, an experimental panAHSV PCR test targeting genome segment 10 is developed that detects reference AHSV strains, whereas AHS DISA vaccine platforms were not detected. This DIVA PCR test completely guarantees genetic DIVA based on in silico and in vitro validation, although test validation regarding diagnostic sensitivity and specificity has not been performed yet. In conclusion, the prototype NS3 cELISA and the PCR test described here enable serological and genetic DIVA accompanying AHS DISA vaccine platforms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The live, temperature-attenuated vaccine strain 1B of Chlamydia abortus, the aetiological agent of ovine enzootic abortion (OEA), has been implicated in cases of vaccine breakdown. The aim of this study was to understand the nature of this attenuation through sequencing of the vaccine parent strain (AB7) and the derived mutant strains 1B and 1H, as well as to clarify the role of the vaccine strain in causing disease through comparative whole genome analysis.
   Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed on: vaccine parent strain AB7; N-methyl-N'-nitroN-nitrosoguanidine (NTG)-induced temperature attenuated mutant strain 1B grown from the commercial live vaccines Cevac Chlamydia and Enzovax; strain 1H a reverted NTG mutant; and 5 strains isolated from cases of OEA originating from animals from the original vaccine safety trial (2 strains) or from vaccinated ewes or ewes exposed to vaccinated animals (3 strains).
   Results: We confirmed that AB7 is in a different lineage from the reference strain 526/3. The genome of vaccine strain 1B contains ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) created by the NTG treatment, which are identical to those found in strain 1H. The strains from OEA cases also cluster phylogenetically very tightly with these vaccine strains.
   Conclusions: The results show that C abortus vaccine strain 1B has an identical genome sequence to the non-attenuated "reverted mutant" strain 1H. Thus, the protection of the 1B vaccine is unlikely to be due to the NTG induced SNPs and is more likely caused by the administration of high doses of C. abortus elementary bodies that stimulate protective immunity. Vaccine-identical strains were also isolated from cases of disease, as well as strains which had acquired 1-3 SNPs, including an animal that had not been vaccinated with either of the commercial live OEA vaccines, indicating that the 1B vaccine strain may be circulating and causing disease.

AB Introduction: HPV vaccine uptake is lowest among young adults. Little is known about the most effective way to decrease missed opportunities (MO) and increase uptake of the vaccine in this vulnerable population.
   Objectives: To determine the impact of a clinical intervention bundle on the rate of MO and uptake of the vaccine among young adult women.
   Methods: From 2/2014 to 7/2015, an intervention bundle (designating physician and nurse champions, pre-screening patients' charts, empowering nurses to recommend immunization, providing no-cost vaccinations, placing prompts in clinic note templates, eliminating requirement for pre-vaccination pregnancy test) was implemented at an urban, hospital-based OB/GYN clinic. Medical records were reviewed for all vaccine-eligible (non-pregnant, 11-26 years) women seen between 2/2013 and 9/2016. Impact of the bundled interventions on the monthly rates of MO and vaccine uptake was estimated by analyzing immunization trends with an interrupted time-series model using counterfactual comparison groups in order to control for pre-existing trends.
   Results: There were 6,463 vaccine-eligible visits during our study period. The prevalence of women who had both completed and initiated the series was significantly higher, 20.3% and 29.7% respectively, in the last month, compared to their counterfactuals (p < 0.01). In the last study month, the rate of MO was significantly lower than its counterfactual (19.73 per 100 encounters lower, p < 0.01). Hispanic women had attributable reductions in their rates of MO that were twice that of White women. Statistically significant attributable reductions were also seen among Spanish speakers, publicly insured, and uninsured women.
   Conclusions: Implementation of this intervention bundle effectively reduced the monthly rate of MO and increased the prevalence of women who had initiated and completed the HPV vaccine series. The reduction of MO was most drastic among Hispanic, publicly insured and uninsured women compared to White and privately insured. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as a major global health threat. Having access to any type of information in social media has been suggested as a potential influence on the growth of anti vaccination groups. Recent studies w.r.t. other topics than vaccination show that access to a wide amount of content through the Internet without intermediaries resolved into major segregation of the users in polarized groups. Users select information adhering to theirs system of beliefs and tend to ignore dissenting information.
   Objectives: The goal was to assess whether users' attitudes are polarized on the topic of vaccination on Facebook and how this polarization develops over time.
   Methods: We perform a thorough quantitative analysis by studying the interaction of 2.6 M users with 298,018 Facebook posts over a time span of seven years and 5 months. We applied community detection algorithms to automatically detect the emergence of communities accounting for the users' activity on the pages. Also, we quantified the cohesiveness of these communities over time.
   Results: Our findings show that the consumption of content about vaccines is dominated by the echo chamber effect and that polarization increased over the years. Well-segregated communities emerge from the users' consumption habits i.e., the majority of users consume information in favor or against vaccines, not both.
   Conclusion: The existence of echo chambers may explain why social-media campaigns that provide accurate information have limited reach and be effective only in sub-groups, even fomenting further opinion polarization. The introduction of dissenting information into a sub-group is disregarded and can produce a backfire effect, thus reinforcing the pre-existing opinions within the sub-group. Public health professionals should try to understand the contents of these echo chambers, for example by getting passively involved in such groups. Only then it will be possible to find effective ways of countering anti-vaccination thinking. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the past decades protein nanoparticles have successfully been used for vaccine applications. Their particulate nature and dense repetitive subunit organization makes them perfect carriers for antigen surface display and confers high immunogenicity. Nanoparticles have emerged as excellent candidates for vectorization of biological and immunostimulating molecules. Nanoparticles and biomolecular nanostructures such as ferritins or virus like particles have been used as diagnostic and therapeutic delivery systems, in vaccine development, as nanoreactors, etc. Recently, a new class of bacterial protein compartment has been discovered referred to as encapsulin nanocompartment. These compartments have been used for targeted diagnostics, as therapeutic delivery systems and as nanoreactors. Their biological origin makes them conveniently biocompatible and allows genetic functionalization. The aim of our study was to implement encapsulin nanocompartements for simultaneous epitope surface display and heterologous protein loading for rational vaccine design. For this proof-of-concept-study, we produced Thermotoga maritima encapsulin nanoparticles in E. coli. We demonstrated the ability of simultaneous display in our system by inserting Matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza A virus at the nanoparticle surface and by packaging of a fluorescent reporter protein (GFP) into the internal cavity. Characterization of the nanoparticles by electronic microscopy confirmed homogenously shaped particles of 24 nm diameter in average. The results further show that engineering of the particle surface improved the loading capacity of the heterologous reporter protein suggesting that surface display may induce a critical elastic deformation resulting in improved stiffness. In Balb/c mice, nanoparticle immunization elicited antibody responses against both the surface epitope and the loaded cargo protein. These results confirm the potential of encapsulin nanocompartments for customized vaccine design and antigen delivery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: There exists a significant gap in vaccine coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) among college-aged students. This study assessed sexual risk-taking behavior among university students and analyzed predictors of HPV vaccine initiation and completion in this population.
   Materials and methods: Data (n = 746) were from an anonymous online, cross-sectional survey distributed to university students, between the ages of 19-26 years, at a private Midwestern university. Both chi-square and multivariable logistics regression models estimated the association between sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk factors (including number of vaginal sexual partners, number of oral sexual partners, initiation of oral sex, and initiation of vaginal sex), with HPV vaccine initiation and completion.
   Results: A significant number of participants (40%) had not received a single dose of the HPV vaccine series. Of those who initiated the series, more than half (51%) did not achieve completion. Additionally, a greater number of participants have had multiple (4 or more) oral sexual partners than vaginal sexual partners (25.7% vs. 20.3%). After adjusting for covariates, it was found that sexual risk factors were not significantly associated with HPV vaccine initiation or completion.
   Conclusion: HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates are suboptimal among university students. High levels of sexual-risk taking behaviors associated with HPV infection persist, yet are not significant predictors of HPV vaccine behaviors in this age group. To increase uptake among 18-26-year-old students, future public health interventions should focus on HPV vaccine education and uptake across the entire population, irrespective of sexual risk profile.

AB Objective: Patients with chronic conditions have higher rates of severe influenza-related illness and mortality. However, influenza vaccination coverage in high-risk populations continues to be suboptimal. We describe the association between cumulative disease morbidity, measured by a previously validated multimorbidity index, and influenza vaccination among community-dwelling adults.
   Methods: We obtained interview and medical record data for participants >= 18 years who sought outpatient care for influenza-like illness between 2011 and 2016 as part of an outpatient-based study of influenza vaccine effectiveness. We defined cumulative disease morbidity by using medical diagnosis codes to calculate a multimorbidity-weighted index (MWI) for each participant. MWI and influenza vaccination status was evaluated by logistic regression. Akaike information criterion was calculated for all models.
   Results: Overall, 1458 (48%) of participants out of a total of 3033 received influenza vaccination. The median MWI was 0.9 (IQR 0.00-3.5) and was higher among vaccinated participants (median 1.6 versus 0.0; p < 0.001). We found a positive linear association between MWI and vaccination, and vaccination percentages were compared between categories of MWI. Compared to patients with no multimorbidity (MWI- 0), odds of vaccination were 17% higher in the second category (MWI 0.01-1.50; [OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.92-1.501), 58% higher in the third category (MWI 1.51-3.00; [OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.26-1.99]), 130% higher in the fourth category (MWI 3.01-6.00; [OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.78-2.98]) and 214% higher in the fifth category (MWI 6.01-45.00;[OR: 3.14, 95% CI: 2.41-4.10]). Participants defined as high-risk had 86% greater odds of being vaccinated than non-high-risk individuals (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.56-2.21). The AIC was lowest for MWI compared with high-risk conditions.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a dose response relationship between level of multimorbidity and likelihood of influenza vaccination. Compared with high-risk condition designations, MWI provided improved precision and a better model fit for the measurement of chronic disease and influenza vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination remains the most cost-effective biomedical approach for controlling influenza disease. In times of pandemics, however, these vaccines cannot be produced in sufficient quantities for worldwide use by the current manufacturing capacities and practices. What is needed is the development of adjuvanted vaccines capable of inducing an adequate or better immune response at a decreased antigen dose. Previously we showed that the protein adjuvant rOv-ASP-1 augments influenza-specific antibody titers and survival after virus challenge in both young adult and old-age mice when administered with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3). In this study we show that a reduced amount of rOv-ASP-1, with 40-times less IIV3 can also induce protection. Apparently the potency of the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvanted IIV3 vaccine is independent of the IIV3-specific Th1/Th2 associated antibody responses, and independent of the presence of HAI antibodies. However, CD4(+) T helper cells were indispensable for the protection. Further, rOv-ASP-1 with or without IIV3 elicited the increased level of various chemokines, which are known chemoattractant for immune cells, into the muscle 4 h after immunization, and significantly induced the recruitment of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils into the muscles. The recruited monocytes had higher expression of the activation marker MHCII on their surface as well as CXCR3 and CCR2; receptors for IP-10 and MCP-1, respectively. These results show that the rOvASP-1 adjuvant allows substantial antigen sparing of IIV3 by stimulating at the site of injection the accumulation of chemokines and the recruitment of immune cells that can augment the activation of CDA4(+) T cell immune responses, essential for the production of antibody responses. Protection elicited by the rOvASP-1 adjuvanted IIV3 vaccine also appears to function in the absence of MyD88-signaling. Future studies will attempt to delineate the precise mechanisms by which the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvanted IIV3 vaccine works. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Rotavirus remains a major cause of diarrhea among children under 5 years of age. The efficacy of RotaSIIL, a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, was shown in an event-driven trial in Niger. We describe the two-year safety follow-up of this trial.
   Methods: Follow-up of safety outcomes began upon administration of the first dose of RotaSIIL or placebo. Adverse events were followed until 28 days after the third dose, and serious adverse events were followed until 2 years of age. Suspected cases of intussusception were evaluated at first point of contact and then referred to hospital for surgical evaluation. Causes of death were obtained by chart review and verbal autopsy. Passive surveillance was carried out in health centers. Community health workers carried out active surveillance in villages. Between-group differences were evaluated using the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test.
   Results: A total of 4092 children were randomized, and 4086 received at least one dose of RotaSIIL or placebo, constituting the intention-to-treat population, who accrued a total of 7385 child-years of follow-up time. At two years of follow-up, 58 (2.8%) participants who received RotaSIIL and 49 (2.4%) participants who received placebo had died (p = 0.38). Most deaths were due to infectious causes common to the study area. One participant had confirmed intussusception, 542 days after receiving the third dose of RotaSIIL. A total of 395 (19.3%) participants receiving RotaSIIL and 419 (20.5%) participants receiving placebo experienced any serious adverse event (p = 0.36). Most serious adverse events were hospitalizations due to infection (malaria, lower respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis) or marasmus. Overall, 1474 (72.1%) participants receiving RotaSIIL and 1456 (71.1%) participants receiving placebo had at least one adverse event (p = 0.49) in the follow-up period.
   Conclusions: At two years of follow-up, RotaSIIL was found to be safe. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Sedation for immunizations is of particular importance in a subset of paediatric patients with anxiety disorders, needle phobia, developmental or behavioural disorders. The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) Melbourne offers a unique immunization under sedation service for these patients. We aimed to evaluate the number and types of patients using inpatient sedation for immunizations, distraction and sedation techniques used, and outcomes of these procedures.
   Methods: A medical record review was conducted on all patients who had immunization under sedation between January 2012 to December 2016 in the RCH Day Medical Unit (DMU).
   Results: A total of 139 children and adolescents had 213 vaccination encounters. More than half of the vaccination encounters involved multiple vaccines. A total of 400 vaccines were administered. One third of patients (32.3%) had multiple DMU admissions for vaccinations. The median age of patients was 13 years. There were only 10 (4.7%) failed attempts at vaccination; all due to patient non-compliance with prescribed sedation. The majority of patients (58.9%) had a diagnosis of needle phobia.
   Sedation was most commonly adequately achieved with inhaled nitrous oxide (54.7% sole agent). Midazolam was often used as an adjunct therapy (42.8%). Local anaesthetic cream or play therapy, were used in only 5.9% and 3.9% of patients respectively, although this may reflect poor documentation rather than actual practice.
   Conclusions: For a subset of paediatric patients for which standard immunization procedures have failed, distraction techniques and conscious sedation enable immunizations to be given safely and effectively. Future research will develop protocols to streamline immunization procedures under sedation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Nicaragua implemented an influenza vaccination program for pregnant women with high risk obstetric conditions in 2007. In 2014, the recommendation of influenza vaccination expanded to include all pregnant women. Given the expansion in the recommendation of vaccination, we evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women and their healthcare providers towards influenza vaccination and its recommendation.
   Methods: We conducted surveys among pregnant women and their healthcare providers from June to August 2016 at two hospitals and 140 health facilities in Managua. The questions were adapted from the U.S. national CDC influenza survey and related to knowledge, attitudes and practices about influenza vaccination and barriers to vaccination. We analyzed reasons for not receiving vaccination among pregnant women as well as receipt of vaccination recommendation and offer by their healthcare providers.
   Results: Of 1,303 pregnant women enrolled, 42% (5 4 5) reported receiving influenza vaccination in the 2016 season. Of those who reported not receiving vaccination, 46% indicated barriers to vaccination. Pregnant women who were vaccinated were more likely to be aware of the recommendation for vaccination and the risks of influenza illness during pregnancy and to perceive the vaccine as safe and effective, compared to unvaccinated pregnant women (p-values < 0.001). Of the 619 health workers enrolled, over 89% recalled recommending influenza vaccination to all pregnant women, regardless of obstetric risk. Of the 1,223 women who had a prenatal visit between the start date of the influenza vaccination and the time of interview, 44% recalled receiving a recommendation for influenza vaccination and 43% were offered vaccination. Vaccination rates were higher for those receiving a recommendation and offer of vaccination compared with those who received neither (95% vs 5%, p-value < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Pregnant women in Managua had positive perceptions of influenza vaccine and were receptive to receiving influenza vaccination, especially after the offer and recommendation by their healthcare providers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mucosal vaccines are a promising platform for combatting infectious diseases for which we still lack effective preventative measures. Optimizing these vaccines to generate the best protective immune responses with the least complicated immunization regimen is imperative. Mucosal barriers are the first line of defense against many pathogens and, as such, we looked to their biology for strategies to improve vaccine delivery. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a key cytokine in both healthy and inflamed mucosal tissues. IL-22 promotes epithelial cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, upregulates mucin and antimicrobial peptides, all of which promote mucosal barrier integrity. In this study, we find that IL-22 impairs the development of a T cell response during mucosal immunization. Compared to wild-type control mice, 1L-22 deficient mice had increased antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses to intrarectal immunization using a protein and cholera toxin adjuvant vaccine. When immunized systemically with the same protein antigen adsorbed to alum, no differences in the CD4 T cell response between wild-type and 1L-22 deficient mice were detected. This suggests that transiently inhibiting IL-22 during mucosal vaccination could enhance T cell responses. The broad-applicability of this proposed approach would allow for improvement of many existing mucosal vaccine regimens and have positive implications in the development of more efficacious mucosal vaccines.

AB Aim: To determine if patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) benefit from vaccination with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13), Prevenar13 (R), compared to a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), Pneumovax (R), in terms of immune response.
   Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes substantial morbidity in patients with CLL, a group known to respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines. Comparative studies with conjugated vaccines are lacking.
   Methods: 128 treatment naive CLL patients from eight hematology clinics in Sweden were randomized to vaccination with PCV13 (n = 63) or PPSV23 (n = 65) after stratification by IgG level and CLL clinical stage (Rai). Blood samples for evaluation of immune response were obtained at baseline, and at one and six months after vaccination. Analyses for each of the 12 pneumococcal serotypes common for PCV13 and PPSV23 were performed by opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: PCV13 elicited a superior immune response than PPSV23 in 10/12 serotypes one month after vaccination and in 5/12 serotypes six months after vaccination, measured as OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs). Geometric mean concentrations of serotype-specific IgG antibodies elicited by PCV13 as measured by ELISA, were higher than those elicited by PPSV23 in half of the common serotypes, both after one and six months. PPSV23 did not trigger a better immune response than PCV13 for any of the serotypes, regardless of analysis method or time point of analysis. Negative predictive factors for vaccination response were hypogammaglobulinemia and long disease duration. Both vaccines were well tolerated.
   Conclusions: In patients with previously untreated CLL, the efficacy of PCV13 in terms of immune response is superior to PPSV23 for most serotypes common for the two vaccines. We therefore propose that PCV13 should be included in vaccination programs against Streptococcus pneumoniae for CLL patients and administered as early as possible during the course of the disease.

AB Most active cancer immunotherapies able to induce a long-lasting protection against tumours are based on the activation of tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Cell death by hyperthermia induces apoptosis followed by secondary necrosis, with the production of factors named "danger associated molecular pattern" (DAMP) molecules (DAMPs), that activate dendritic cells (DCs) to perform antigen uptake, processing and presentation, followed by CTLs cross priming. In many published studies, hyperthermia treatment of tumour cells is performed at 42-45 degrees C; these temperatures mainly promote cell surface expression of DAMPs. Treatment at 56 degrees C of tumour cells was shown to induce DAMPs secretion rather than their cell surface expression, improving DC activation and CTL cross priming in vitro.
   Thus we tested the relevance of this finding in vivo on the generation of a tumour-specific memory immune response, in the TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate carcinoma transplantable model. TRAMP-C2 tumour cells treated at 56 degrees C were able not only to activate DCs in vitro but also to trigger a tumour-specific CTLdependent immune response in vivo. Prophylactic vaccination with 56 C-treated TRAMP-C2 tumour cells alone provided protection against TRAMP-C2 tumour growth in vivo, whilst in the therapeutic regimen, control of tumour growth was achieved combining immunization with adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing (3DP) has a potential to change how we envision manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry. A more common utilization for FDM 3DP is to build upon existing hot melt extrusion (HME) technology where the drug is dispersed in the polymer matrix. However, reliable manufacturing of drug-containing filaments remains a challenge along with the limitation of active ingredients which can sustain the processing risks involved in the HME process. To circumvent this obstacle, a single step FDM 3DP process was developed to manufacture thin-walled drug-free capsules which can be filled with dry or liquid drug product formulations. Drug release from these systems is governed by the combined dissolution of the FDM capsule 'shell' and the dosage form encapsulated in these shells. To prepare the shells, the 3D printer files (extension '.gcode') were modified by creating discrete zones, so-called 'zoning process', with individual print parameters. Capsules printed without the zoning process resulted in macroscopic print defects and holes. X-ray computed tomography, finite element analysis and mechanical testing were used to guide the zoning process and printing parameters in order to manufacture consistent and robust capsule shell geometries. Additionally, dose consistencies of drug containing liquid formulations were investigated in this work.

AB Although a variety of non-viral gene delivery systems have been developed, they still suffer from low efficiency and specificity. Herein, we present the assembly of a dendrimer complex comprising a DNA cargo and a targeting moiety as a new format for targeted gene delivery. A PAMAM dendrimer modified with histidine and arginine (HR-dendrimer) was used to enhance the endosomal escape and transfection efficiency. An EGFR-specific repebody, composed of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules, was employed as a targeting moiety. A polyanionic peptide was genetically fused to the repebody, followed by incubation with an HR-dendrimer and a DNA cargo to assemble the dendrimer complex through an electrostatic interaction. The resulting dendrimer complex was shown to deliver a DNA cargo with high efficiency in a receptor-specific manner. An analysis using a confocal microscope confirmed the internalization of the dendrimer complex and subsequent dissociation of a DNA cargo from the complex. The present approach can be broadly used in a targeted gene delivery in many areas.

AB This study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze lateral diffusion of drugs in dermatomed human skin. Lateral diffusion of calcein and methylene blue dyes in skin was investigated using confocal laser microscopy, calcein imaging, and histology studies. In in vitro permeation studies, two linear microdialysis probes were inserted into the dermis of untreated, poly lacto-glycolic acid microneedle-treated, and ablative lasertreated skin such that one was in the center of the diffusion area and the other was parallel, at 8mm from the central probe. Skin was mounted on Franz cells, sandwiched between donor containing diclofenac sodium solution and receptor containing phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. Qualitative techniques revealed faster lateral diffusion of the dyes in microneedle-treated skin than laser-treated skin. Rate of drug diffusion in the central probe in the microneedle-treated skin (11.8 +/- 2.5 mu g/h) was significantly higher than untreated and lasertreated skin (p < 0.05). Rate of lateral diffusion in untreated group (0.7 +/- 0.1 mu g/h) was significantly lower than microneedle and laser-treated skin (p < 0.05). Overall, in vitro microdialysis was demonstrated as a novel and valuable tool that can be employed for quantitative investigation of rate of vertical and lateral diffusion of drugs in intact and microporated skin.

AB Adenosine analogue drugs (such as fludarabine or cladribine) require transporter-mediated uptake into cells and subsequent phosphorylation for anticancer activity. Therefore, application of nanocarrier systems for direct delivery of active triphosphate forms has been proposed. Here, we applied isothermal titration calorimetry and zeta potential titration to determine the stoichiometry and thermodynamic parameters of interactions between 4th generation poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers (unmodified or sugar-modified for increased biocompatibility) and ATP as a model adenosine nucleotide. We showed that glycodendrimers have the ability to efficiently interact with nucleoside triphosphates and to form stable complexes via electrostatic interactions between the ionized phosphate and amino groups on the nucleotide and the dendrimer, respectively. The complexation process is spontaneous, enthalpy-driven and depends on buffer composition (strongest interactions in organic buffer) and pH (more binding sites in acidic pH). These properties allow us to consider maltose-modified dendrimers as especially promising carriers for adenosine analogues.

AB We report the development of effective drug loaded nanocarriers to combat multidrug resistant infection especially in case of osteomyelitis. The hollow mesoporous hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (hmHANPs) and solid/non-hollow hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (sHANPs) were synthesized by core-shell and co-precipitation techniques respectively. High encapsulation of the drug (ciprofloxacin) was observed in hmHANPs as compared to sHANPs, which may be due to the hollow porous structure of hmHANPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (FESEM), N-2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Approximately 80% of the encapsulated drug was released at pH 4.5 within 5 days in case of hmHANPs while at pH 7.4, a sustained drug release profile was obtained and only 48.73% of the drug was released after 9 days. The results of kinetic drug release revealed that drug loaded hmHANPs showed fickian diffusion and anomalous drug diffusion mechanism at pH 4.5 and 7.4 respectively. Owing to their porous structure and high drug loading capacity, hmHANPs showed enhanced antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (drug resistant strains of osteomyelitis) in comparison to that with sHANPs. In addition, hmHANPs showed a pH sensitive drug release profile, high surface area (105.33 m(2)/g) with increased pore volume (0.533 cm(3)/g) and superior antimicrobial activity against osteomyelitis as compared to sHANPs.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug, which also could be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as the Alzheimer's disease. However, its use has been limited due to its low solubility, inefficient pharmacokinetic profiles, and multiple side effects. PAMAM dendrimers, ethylenediamine core, generation 4.0 (amine terminal groups) and 4.5 (carboxylate terminal groups) (DG4.0 and DG4.5 respectively) are polymers that can increase drug solubility through complexation. Thus, the aim of this work was to obtain and characterize complexes between CBZ and dendrimers. Both DG4.0 and DG4.5 allowed the incorporation of similar to 20 molecules of CBZ per dendrimer, into their hydrophobic pockets. DG4.0-CBZ and DG4.5-CBZ complexes were found to be stable for 90 days at 37 degrees C and resistant to a lyophilization process, presenting controlled drug release. Also, the complexes nanotoxicity was tested ex vivo (human red blood cells), in vitro (N2a cell line), and in vivo (zebrafish). No hemolytic effect was observed in the ex vivo model. As regards in vitro toxicity, the DG4.5-CBZ complexes significantly reduced the toxicity caused by the free drug. Moreover, the DG4.5-CBZ did not cause neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, a stable and biocompatible drug delivery system based on the DG4.5 capable of complex the CBZ has been developed. This achievement highlights the advantages of using negatively charged dendrimers for nanomedicine.

AB Supramolecular structures based on cyclodextrins have been extensively used for drug delivery systems over decades. However, combining host and guest molecules in a pharmaceutical formulation is not a trivial process, being one of the majors concern the inclusion complex compatibility with other excipients presented in the final formulation. Herein, experimental and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the competition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with atenolol (ATE) or losartan (LOS), antihypertensive drugs widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Our findings, using nuclear magnetic resonance and isothermal titrations calorimetry experiments and molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that LOS remain included into CD cavity after excipient (SDS) addition, which was not verified for ATE ternary system, being the drug displaced by SDS molecule.

AB Heckel analysis is a widely used method for the characterisation of the compression behaviour of pharmaceutical samples during the preparation of solid dosage formulations. The present study introduces an optical version of the Heckel equation that is based on a combination of the conventional Heckel equation together with the linear relationship defined between the effective terahertz (THz) refractive index and the porosity of pharmaceutical tablets. The proposed optical Heckel equation allows us to, firstly, calculate the zero-porosity refractive index, and, secondly, predict the in-die development of the effective refractive index as a function of the compressive pressure during tablet compression. This was demonstrated for five batches of highly porous functionalised calcium carbonate (FCC) excipient compacts. The close match observed between the estimated in-die effective refractive index and the measured/out-of-die effective THz refractive index supports the validity of the proposed form of the equation. By comparing the measured and estimated in-die tablet properties, a clear change in the porosity and hence, the effective refractive index, due to post-compression elastic relaxation of the FCC compacts, has been observed. We have, therefore, proposed a THz-based compaction setup that will permit in-line monitoring of processes during tablet compression. We envisage that this new approach in tracking powder properties introduced in this preliminary study will lead to the onset of further extensive and detailed future studies.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP), though developed for nonmedical applications and once regarded as futuristic only, has recently been deployed for the fabrication of pharmaceutical products. However, the existing feeding materials (inks and filaments) that are used for printing drug products have various shortcomings, including the lack of biocompatibility, inadequate extrudability and printability, poor drug loading, and instability. Here, we have sought to develop a filament using a single pharmaceutical polymer, with no additives, which can be multi-purposed and manipulated by computational design for the preparation of tablets with desired release and absorption patterns. As such, we have used hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) and diltiazem, a model drug, to prepare both drug-free and drug-impregnated filaments, and investigated their thermal and crystalline properties, studied the cytotoxicity of the filaments, designed and printed tablets with various infill densities and patterns. By alternating the drug-free and drug-impregnated filaments, we fabricated various types of tablets, studied the drug release profiles, and assessed oral absorption in rats. Both diltiazem and HPMC were stable at extrusion and printing temperatures, and the drug loading was 10% (w/w). The infill density, as well as infill patterns, influenced the drug release profile, and thus, when the infill density was increased to 100%, the percentage of drug released dramatically declined. Tablets with alternating drug-free and drug-loaded layers showed delayed and intermittent drug release, depending on when the drug-loaded layers encountered the dissolution media. Importantly, the oral absorption patterns accurately reproduced the drug release profiles and showed immediate, extended, delayed and episodic absorption of the drug from the rat gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Overall, we have demonstrated here that filaments for 3D printers can be prepared from a pharmaceutical polymer with no additives, and the novel computational design allows for fabricating tablets with the capability of producing distinct absorption patterns after oral administration.

AB Removal of acetic acid from pretreated lignocellulose biomass is an important step for the consequent fermentation on production of cellulosic ethanol and biobased chemicals. This study elucidates the biological metabolism and tolerance response of acetic acid by a widely used biodetoxification fungus Amorphotheca resinae ZN1. Acetic acid is consumed as a prior substrate to glucose and xylose by A. resinae ZN1, and the consumption is highly accelerated by solid state culture. Acetic acid is metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle when glucose exists in the medium, while through the two cycles of both the TCA cycle and glyoxylate cycle when there is no sugar in the medium. The tolerance response of A. resinae ZN1 to acetic acid includes various biological processes such as activation of ions transport, increase in amino acids uptake and biosynthesis, as well as induction of ergosterol biosynthesis and ATP generation. The study provided important basis for the future biodetoxification strain modification for enhanced acetic acid removal.

AB To efficiently ferment intermediate cellodextrins released during cellulose hydrolysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered by introduction of a heterologous cellodextrin utilizing pathway consisting of a cellodextrin transporter and either an intracellular beta-glucosidase or a cellobiose phosphorylase. Among two types of cello dextrin transporters, the passive facilitator CDT-2 has not enabled better cellobiose fermentation than the active transporter CDT-1, which suggests that the CDT-2 might be engineered to provide energetic benefits over the active transporter in cellobiose fermentation. We attempted to improve cellobiose transporting activity of CDT-2 through laboratory evolution. Nine rounds of a serial subculture of S. cerevisiae expressing CDT-2 and cellobiose phosphorylase on cellobiose led to the isolation of an evolved strain capable of fermenting cellobiose to ethanol 10-fold faster than the original strain. After sequence analysis of the isolated CDT-2, a single point mutation on CDT-2 (N3061) was revealed to be responsible for enhanced cellobiose fermentation. Also, the engineered strain expressing the mutant CDT-2 with cellobiose phosphorylase showed a higher ethanol yield than the engineered strain expressing CDT-1 and intracellular beta-glucosidase under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that CDT-2 coupled with cellobiose phosphorylase may be better choices for efficient production of cellulosic ethanol with the engineered yeast

AB Amphotericin B is an antimicrobial membrane-acting drug used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections. However, the clinical utility of AmB is often low as a result of (i) dose-limiting toxicity which is closely associated with its aggregation wherein the selectivity for its target i.e. ergosterol in fungal membranes is diminished and (ii) limited oral bioavailablity. The latter is attributed to the unfavorable physicochemical properties of the AmB e.g., low solubility, gastrointestinal instability, and poor intestinal permeability. The hypothesis of present work was that by applying a lipid conjugation approach the aggregation induced toxicity of AmB vis-a-vis permeability can be overcome. From the array of fatty acids, the oleic acid (OA) was selected for conjugation due to its great impact on increasing the Caco-2 permeability of AmB. AmB-OA conjugate was synthesized using standard carbodiimide chemistry and characterized thoroughly. Due to the reported strong correlation between the self-aggregation of AmB and toxicity, the aggregation behavior of AmB and AmB-OA was studied by in silico modeling and confirmed experimentally. In vitro hemolytic studies and viability assays in kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) suggested that AmB in aggregated was state highly toxic but not AmB-OA. In silico modeling suggested possible aggregation conformation of AmB-OA dimers that retains the selectivity for cholesterol even in aggregated state when embedded in in silico generated lipid bilayers. The results were further confirmed by assessing the interactions of monomeric and aggregated state of AmB and AmB-OA with that of cholesterol and ergosterol containing liposomes employing circular dichroism spectroscopy. The findings were subsequently corroborated by in vivo nephrotoxicity studies. To conclude, the lipid conjugation approach may be a promising strategy for reducing the dose-limiting toxicity of AmB.

AB This study aimed to design the effective formulation of sorafenib (SF) to enhance the oral drug absorption. Three liposomal formulations of SF were prepared including uncoated liposome (SF-Lip), glycol chitosan-coated liposome (GC-SF-Lip), and Eudragit S100-glycol-chitosan coated liposome (SGC-SF-Lip). All formulations showed a narrow size distribution with a high encapsulation efficiency. Both GC-SF-Lip and SGC-SF-Lip exhibited good stability at acidic and neutral pHs without any significant drug leakage, while SF-Lip appeared to be unstable at pH 1.2. In the case of double coated SGC-SF-Lip, its size changed significantly at pH 7.4, due to the dissolution of Eudragit S100 coating layer into the surrounding medium. Compared to SF solution, all liposomal formulations demonstrated a higher cellular uptake in Caco-2 cells. In particular, SGC-SF-Lip displayed a lower cellular uptake than GC-SF-Lip at pH 6.5, but it achieved a similar cellular uptake to GC-SF-Lip at pH 7.4. Consistently, SGC-SF-Lip was less cytotoxic than GC-SF-Lip at pH 6.5, whereas it showed a comparable cytotoxicity to GC-SF-Lip at pH 7.4, implying the removal of the Eudragit S100 coating layer at pH 7.4. After an oral administration to rats, SGC-SF-Lip significantly improved the systemic exposure of SF, where its Cmax and AUC were approximately fourfold higher than the untreated drug. Collectively, SGC-SF-Lip appeared to be promising to enhance the oral absorption of SF.

AB There are no rapid dissolution based tests for determining coating thickness, integrity and drug concentration in controlled release pellets either during production or post-production. The manufacture of pellets requires several coating steps depending on the formulation. The sub-coating and enteric coating steps typically take up to six hours each followed by additional drying steps. Post production regulatory dissolution testing also takes up to six hours to determine if the batch can be released for commercial sale. The thickness of the enteric coating is a key factor that determines the release rate of the drug in the gastro-intestinal tract. Also, the amount of drug per unit mass decreases with increasing thickness of the enteric coating. In this study, the coating process is tracked from start to finish on an hourly basis by taking samples of pellets during production and testing those using BARDS (Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy). BARDS offers a rapid approach to characterising enteric coatings with measurements based on reproducible changes in the compressibility of a solvent due to the evolution of air during dissolution. This is monitored acoustically via associated changes in the frequency of induced acoustic resonances. A steady state acoustic lag time is associated with the disintegration of the enteric coatings in basic solution. This lag time is pH dependent and is indicative of the rate at which the coating layer dissolves. BARDS represents a possible future surrogate test for conventional USP dissolution testing as its data correlates directly with the thickness of the enteric coating, its integrity and also with the drug loading as validated by HPLC.

AB This study aims to evaluate the effects of Gelucire44/14 on the in vitro transport, in situ intestinal absorption, as well as in vivo antidiabetic efficacy of berberine (BBR). In the in vitro study, Gelucire44/14 (0.1%, v/v) increased the absorptive transport of BBR across the intestinal membrane of a rat and reduced the relative transport in the secretory direction, thus demonstrating its potential inhibitory effect on intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In the in situ absorption study, Gelucire44/14 (0.1%, v/v)increased BBR absorption, and this enhancing effect was more significant in the ileum than in the colon of a rat. Oral delivery of BBR with Gelucire44/14 (0.1%, v/v) to diabetic mice, compared with the BBR group, induced a significant hypoglycemic effect on day 7 and day 12 after administration. This result was well correlated with the results of the in vitro study, indicating the important contribution of the P-gp inhibitory effect of Gelucire44/14 to the improvement of the antidiabetic efficacy in vivo. In addition, Gelucire44/14 (0.1%, v/v) neither increased the levels of protein and lactate dehydrogenase in intestinal perfusion nor changed the morphology of the rat intestinal epithelium relative to those of the negative control. This finding suggested that 0.1% (v/v) Gelucire44/14 caused no apparent membrane damage to rat intestine. In conclusion, Gelucire44/14 exhibited potential for enhancing the oral absorption of BBR, thereby improving the antidiabetic efficacy of BBR.

AB Tribo-electrification is a common occurrence within the pharmaceutical industry where solid dosage forms constitute majority of pharmaceutical formulations. Tribo-electrification of powders leads to a range of complications such as adhesion of particulate material to the processing equipment resulting in segregation, affecting the content uniformity. Flurbiprofen, a highly charging material, was used as a model drug to investigate the tribo-electrification and adhesion characteristics by impregnating the model drug inside a mesoporous silica matrix. The model drug was impregnated using i) solvent loading, and ii) physical mixing methods, at varying degree of silica to drug ratio (5-20% w/w). The resulting mixtures were tribo-charged using a custom built device based on a shaking concept inside a stainless steel capsule, consisting of a Faraday cup and connected to electrometer. The electrostatic charge and the percentage adhesion of Flurbiprofen were reduced in both drug loading methods. The solvent impregnation method using acetone was more successful at reducing the electrostatic charge build up on flurbiprofen than physical powder mixing. The percentage adhesion to the shaking capsule was reduced notably as a result of loading the drug in the SBA-15 porous network. The results illustrate that the incorporation of highly charged model drug inside a low-charging pharmaceutical carrier system to be an effective approach in control the induction of tribo-electrification phenomena during powder processing.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen that causes a wide range of infections; it is becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. Quorum-sensing (QS) based therapeutics, which function by disabling pathogen virulence without killing pathogens, are a promising class of drugs that may be used to treat bacterial infections without eliciting resistance development. The use of QS drugs to treat pulmonary P. aeruginosa infections, however, has been greatly limited due to the inability to deliver QS drugs at sufficiently high concentrations past physiological barriers such as pulmonary mucus. Here we apply a block copolymer-directed self-assembly process, Flash NanoPrecipitation, to develop a series of QS-active formulations that are fully water dispersible, stable, and mucus-penetrating. These formulations inhibit P. aeruginosa virulence without inhibiting cell growth. Particle size (70 nm-400 nm) and release rate (1 h-14 days) can be tuned by altering constructs' physical properties and formulation excipients. We also demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of a QS nanocarrier platform technology that can penetrate through human cystic fibrosis pulmonary mucus. This work highlights the need to incorporate nanoformulation strategies into the development of next-generation antimicrobial therapeutics.

AB L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a sodium-independent exchanger transporting large neural amino acids and several amino-acid mimicking drugs across the cell membranes. LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood brain barrier (BBB) and in numerous cancer cells and is therefore a potential drug target. However, structural features affecting the ability to bind to LAT1 and the cellular translocation by LAT1 are unclear. In the present study we determined the binding to and transport through human LAT1 of several compounds into the human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). We show that the meta-conjugation of L-phenylalanine increases binding to human LAT1 compared to para-conjugation or aliphatic amino acid moiety. Furthermore, large, rigid and aromatic meta-substituted L-phenylalanine derivative enabled selective and efficient LAT1-mediated cellular uptake. Our results also demonstrates that in addition to binding studies, it is of utmost importance to determine the cellular accumulation of compounds. It provides crucial information on transport efficiency and selectivity of transport mechanisms that the compounds are able to utilize. Overall, these structural findings and the methodology used herein are exploitable to design LAT1-utilizing compounds, such as markers for cancer imaging and drug molecules, enabling more effective and safer treatments for cancer in the future.

AB In the present work the feasibility of using inner layer-embedded contact lenses (CLs) to achieve sustained release of highly water soluble drug, betaxolol hydrochloride (BH) on the ocular surface was investigated. Blend film of cellulose acetate and Eudragit S100 was selected as the inner layer, while silicone hydrogel was used as outer layer to construct inner layer-embedded contact lenses. Influence of polymer ratio in the blend film on in vitro drug release behavior in phosphate buffered solution or simulated tear fluid was studied and drug-polymer interaction, erosion and swelling of the blend film were characterized to better understand drug-release mechanism. Storage stability of the inner layer-embedded contact lenses in phosphate buffer solution was also conducted, with ignorable drug loss and negligible change in drug release pattern within 30 days. In vivo pharmacokinetic study in rabbits showed sustained drug release for over 240 h in tear fluid, indicating prolonged drug precorneal residence time. In conclusion, cellulose acetate/Eudragit S100 inner layer-embedded contact lenses are quite promising as controlled-release carrier of highly water soluble drug for ophthalmic delivery.

AB The aim of this work was to study the antifibrotic effect of pulmonary administration of tilorone to lung fibrosis. L-leucine coated tilorone particles were prepared and their aerosolization properties were analyzed using two dry powder inhalers (Easyhaler and Twister). In addition, the biological activity and cell monolayer permeation was tested. The antifibrotic effect of tilorone delivered by oropharyngeal aspiration was studied in vivo using a silica-induced model of pulmonary fibrosis in mice in a preventive setting. When delivered from the Easyhaler in an inhalation simulator, the emitted dose and fine particle fraction were independent from the pressure applied and showed dose repeatability. However, with Twister the aerosolization was pressure-dependent indicating poor compatibility between the device and the formulation. The formulation showed more consistent permeation through a differentiated Calu-3 cell monolayer compared to pristine tilorone. Tilorone decreased the histological fibrosis score in vivo in systemic and local administration, but only systemic administration decreased the mRNA expression of type I collagen. The difference was hypothesized to result from 40-fold higher drug concentration in tissue samples in the systemic administration group. These results show that tilorone can be formulated as inhalable dry powder and has potential as an oral and inhalable antifibrotic drug.

AB Wound healing following skin injury is a natural phenomenon that usually lacks quality, rapidity, and aesthetics. Thus, the purpose of this study was to fabricate a new easily applied in situ gel of cefadroxil (CDX) loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CDX-CSNPs) that could promote wound healing, capable of inhibiting the possible accompanying bacterial infection. The nanoparticles were prepared by double emulsion technique and the influence of formulation parameters on drug entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP) were investigated using a full factorial design. The results show that the optimized CDX-CSNP1 composed of low molecular weight chitosan (0.2%w/v) was spherical with EE%, PS, PDI and ZP of 84.25 +/- 0.02, 408.30 +/- 53.17 nm, 0.458 +/- 0.048 and 22.80 +/- 0.57 mV, respectively. DSC and XRD studies confirmed the amorphous nature of the drug. After ensuring the safety and non toxicity of CDX-CSNP1 in situ gel through cytotoxic study, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using a rat skin infection model against Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to the rats treated with free CDX, the CDX-CSNP1 treated group revealed a remarkable accelerated wound healing process and bacterial clearance which was further confirmed by the histopathological examination of skin biopsies.

AB Purpose: This study was performed to investigate how increasing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content within a formulation affects the dispersion of particles and the aerosol performance efficiency of a carrier based dry powder inhalable (DPI) formulation, using a custom dry powder inhaler (DPI) development rig.
   Methods: Five formulations with varying concentrations of API beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) between 1% and 30% (w/w) were formulated as a multi-component carrier system containing coarse lactose and fine lactose with magnesium stearate. The morphology of the formulation and each component were investigated using scanning electron micrographs while the particle size was measured by laser diffraction. The aerosol performance, in terms of aerodynamic diameter, was assessed using the British pharmacopeia Apparatus E cascade impactor (Next generation impactor). Chemical analysis of the API was observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
   Results: Increasing the concentration of BDP in the blend resulted in increasing numbers and size of individual agglomerates and densely packed BDP multi-layers on the surface of the lactose carrier. BDP present within the multi-layer did not disperse as individual primary particles but as dense agglomerates, which led to a decrease in aerosol performance and increased percentage of BDP deposition within the Apparatus E induction port and pre-separator.
   Conclusion: As the BDP concentration in the blends increases, aerosol performance of the formulation decreases, in an inversely proportional manner. Concurrently, the percentage of API deposition in the induction port and pre-separator could also be linked to the amount of micronized particles (BDP and Micronized composite carrier) present in the formulation. The effect of such dose increase on the behaviour of aerosol dispersion was investigated to gain greater insight in the development and optimisation of higher dosed carrier-based formulations.

AB The aim of this study was to introduce a fast and reliable differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)-based method to determine the monomolecular loading capacity of drugs with good glass-forming ability in mesoporous silica (MS). The proposed method is based on a solvent-free melting/fusion of drug into the MS during a heat-cool-heat cycle in the DSC. Overloaded drug-MS systems were analyzed in the DSC at different drug ratios (50, 60, 70, 80 and 90% w/w) to quantify the excess drug in the (the fraction not adsorbed to the MS surface). During the first heating, the drug will melt and fuse into the pores of the MS and upon subsequent quench cooling, the drug that is not adsorbed to the surface of the MS will amorphize into a separate phase (as drugs with good glass-forming ability do not crystallize upon quench-cooling from the melt). The drug molecules adsorbed to the MS surface are "immobilized" and will not contribute to a glass transition in the DSC and thus, the excess drug can be quantified simply by determining the change in the heat capacity over the glass transition (Delta C-p). Since the Delta C-p of overloaded samples decrease linearly with decreasing drug content, the monomolecular loading capacity of the drug in the MS can be determined by extrapolating to zero Delta C-p. This value corresponds to the highest drug load at which the drug is monomolecularly adsorbed to the surface of the MS and has no drug-related thermal events (glass transition), i.e. a thermodynamically stable system. Using this method, it was possible to determine the monomolecular loading capacity of four drugs with good glass-forming ability in four different MS. These determinations were in good agreement with the physical stability of the systems during an accelerated stability study, which indicates that the thermoanalytical method enabled fast and reliable determination of the monomolecular loading capacity of drugs in MS.

AB Gastrointestinal luminal pH shows a rise from the duodenum to the terminal ileum in healthy individuals. Our objectives were to compare the pH in the proximal small intestine (SI) (first 60 min of small intestinal transit) lumen of human volunteers and patients with symptomatic constipation; to quantify contractile pressure profiles of the proximal SI, and to assess the relationship between luminally-recorded contractile pressure and small intestinal transit times (SITT) of a non-disintegrating capsule that measures pH and pressure activity (wireless motility capsule). We used previously acquired records from 39 healthy subjects and 41 patients with symptomatic constipation. Mean pH (+/- SD) of the proximal SI was similar in healthy subjects and patients with constipation at 6.2 (+/- 0.6) and 6.3 (+/- 0.4), respectively. In 13 of the healthy subjects, pH did not rise uniformly in the proximal SI though the pH(median) was 6.0 (5th, 95th percentiles 3.09, 7.06) and the pH fluctuated over a mean period of 28 min. Large inter-individual variability in frequency of pressure activity (Ct) and area under pressure curve (AUC) were observed in the proximal SI of healthy subjects and patients with constipation. Median AUC was 3996 mmHg s(-1) (5th, 95th percentiles 948, 16866 mmHg s(-1)) in these two populations combined. Ct and AUC showed a strong direct linear correlation at r = 0.91, p < 1 x 10(-6). An inverse correlation (suggesting longer SITT with lower pressure activity) was observed between Ct/AUC and SITT in both healthy subjects and patients with symptomatic constipation. The pooled results for both groups showed: AUC and SITT correlation at r = -0.49, p < 1 x 10(-6). We concluded that both the frequency and amplitude of contractions in the proximal SI are important for the propagation of non-disintegrating capsules. The observed pH fluctuations in the proximal SI may impact supersaturation and precipitation of weakly basic drugs.

AB The purpose of the present study was to determine the solubility of raloxifene hydrochloride (RHCl) in ten solvents: water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400), Transcutol, 1-butanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethyl acetate (EA) at temperatures of 298.2-323.2 K and a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The solubility data obtained was fitted upon "Apelblat and Van't Hoff" equations. The maximum mole fraction solubility of RHCl was obtained in DMSO (5.02 x 10(-2) at 323.2 K), followed by PEG-400 (5.92 x 10(-3) at 323.2 K), EA (3.11 x 10(-3) at 323.2 K), Transcutol (1.22 x 10(-3) at 323.2 K), PG (2.19 x 10(-4) at 323.2 K), 1-butanol (1.96 x 10(-4) at 323.2 K), IPA (1.47 x 10(-4) at 323.2 K), ethanol (7.90 x 10(-5) at 323.2 K), EG (6.65 x 10(-5) at 323.2 K), and water (3.60 x 10(-5) at 323.2 K). Similar fashions were noticed at each studied temperature. The higher solubility of RHCl in DMSO, PEG-400, EA, and Transcutol was possibly referable to their lower polarity in comparison with water. The molecular interactions between the solute and solvent molecules were estimated by calculating parameters like activity coefficients, and more prominent solute-solvent molecular interactions were noted for RHCl-DMSO, RHCl-EA, and RHCl-PEG-400 in comparison with the other solute-solvent combinations. The outcomes of the "apparent thermodynamic analysis" showed that the dissolution of RHCl was "endothermic, spontaneous and entropy-driven" in all investigated solvents. The obtained solubility data of RHCl in commonly used solvents could be useful in the purification, recrystallization, and dosage form design of the drug.

AB The use of co-amorphous systems for solubility enhancement of poorly water-soluble drugs has recently gained interest in the field of pharmaceutical technology. However, undesired co-amorphisation of a drug may lead to an alteration of the performance of the drug product, e.g. the previously observed co-amorphisation of indomethacin and arginine upon storage of tablets containing both components in an initially crystalline form at room temperature (RT) and 75% relative humidity (RH). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further investigate this unintended co-amorphisation by storing plain crystalline.-indomethacin and arginine as well as physical mixtures of both components at RT and three different RH levels (28, 58, and 75% RH). After storage for up to 101 days, their properties were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and HPLC. Results showed that the solid state of plain gamma-indomethacin did not change during storage at all three storage conditions. In contrast, arginine was found to form a dihydrate upon storage at RT/58% RH and RT/75% RH. The physical mixtures, stored at RT/28% RH and RT/58% RH, remained crystalline and were chemically stable, while the formation of a co-amorphous salt between indomethacin and arginine as well as basic hydrolysis of indomethacin started already 1 day after exposure to RT/75% RH. Moreover, formation of a crystalline salt of indomethacin and arginine upon storage at RT/75% RH was observed. As neither of these instabilities occurred, if indomethacin was stored separately, the simultaneous effects of arginine and moisture on the solid state properties and chemical stability of indomethacin should be taken into account, if selecting arginine as excipient.

AB The anti-cancer drug pazopanib hydrochloride (PZH) has a very low aqueous solubility and a variable oral bioavailability. A new pharmaceutical formulation with an improved solubility may enhance the bioavailability and reduce the variability. A broad selection of polymer excipients was tested for their compatibility and solubilizing properties by conventional microscopic, thermal and spectrometric techniques. A wet milling and mixing technique was used to produce homogenous powder mixtures. The dissolution properties of the formulation were tested by a pH-switch dissolution model. The final formulation was tested in vivo in cancer patient following a dose escalation design. Of the tested mixture formulations, the one containing the co-block polymer Soluplus (R) in a 8: 1 ratio with PZH performed best in terms of in vitro dissolution properties. The in vivo results indicated that 300 mg of the developed formulation yields similar exposure and a lower variability (379 mu g/mL*h (36.7% CV)) than previously reported values for the standard PZH formulation (Votrient (R)) at the approved dose of 800 mg. Furthermore, the expected plasma-C-through levels (27.2 mu g/mL) exceeds the defined therapeutic efficacy threshold of 20 mu g/mL.

AB The use of various harmful organic solvents for microparticle formulations is still widespread. Here, an alternative low toxicity solvent (propylene carbonate; PC) is proposed for the preparation of poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) ( PLGA) microparticles. Based on the classical emulsification-solvent extraction methodology, the use of PC offers the unique advantage of an additional solvent extraction step using hydrolytic solvent cleavage during microparticle preparation. Spherical, rough-surfaced microparticles were obtained with a volume median diameter range from 20 to 60 mu m. The residual PC content has been identified to be the major factor for the solidification hindrance, leading to polymeric Tg shifting due to a plasticizing effect. When applying the enhanced PC extraction step, the residual PC content was lowered from 8.8% to 2.7% and subsequently Tg values shifted from 8.2 to 37.7 degrees C. Additionally, the hydrolytic solvent cleavage confirmed to have no impact on the PLGA stability. This method presents a significant advancement towards replacing of conventional solvents in the microparticle preparation due to more efficient solvent extraction.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of excipients on physical and aerosolization stability of spray dried Ciprofloxacin dry powder inhaler formulations. The model drug, Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, was co-spray dried with excipients such as disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, trehalose), mannitol and L-leucine. The spray dried samples were stored at two different relative humidity (RH) conditions of: (1) 20% and (2) 55% RH at 20 degrees C. Ciprofloxacin co-spray dried with disaccharides and L-leucine in the mass ratio of 1:1 demonstrated an increase in fine particle fraction (FPF) as compared with the spray dried Ciprofloxacin alone when stored at 20% RH. However, deterioration in FPF of Ciprofloxacin co-spray dried with disaccharide and mannitol was observed upon storage at 55% RH as compared to the corresponding formulations stored at 20% RH due to particle agglomeration. Whereas, 10% and 50% w/w L-leucine in the formulation showed no change in aerosol performance (FPF of 71.1 +/- 3.5% and 79.5 +/- 3.1%, respectively) when stored at 55% RH for 10 days as compared to 20% RH (FPF of 68.1 +/- 0.3% and 73.6 +/- 7.1%, respectively). L-Leucine demonstrated aerosolization stability by alleviating crystallization of Ciprofloxacin to some extent and preventing significant change in particle morphology. L-Leucine is well-recognized as aerosolization enhancer; our study has shown L-leucine is also a physical and aerosolization stabilizer for spray dried Ciprofloxacin DPI formulations. Such stability enhancing activities were attributed to the enrichment of L-leucine on the particle surface as confirmed by XPS data, and intermolecular interactions between L-leucine and Ciprofloxacin as measured by FT-IR.

AB The influence of a functionalized raw material particle structure on the granulation behavior and tabletabilty of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was investigated. Therefore, a milled grade of CaCO3 was compared to different binary mixtures of milled and functionalized CaCO3. Relevant properties of raw materials, ribbons and granules were measured. The starting materials and two fractions of dry granules were compressed to tablets. The tabletability of granules was compared to that of the powders and the influence of specific compaction force and granule size on tablet tensile strength was evaluated. Adding functionalized particles drastically influenced the granulation and tableting behavior of CaCO3. Increasing proportions increased the ribbon porosity and granule size. Tensile strength of tablets from powder mixtures and granules was increased as well. Nevertheless, adding functionalized CaCO3 led to a loss in tabletability induced by a previous compaction step to an extent depending on its proportion in the formulation. A clear influence of the particle morphology on granulation and tableting behavior was demonstrated by the study. The functionalized structure showed aspects of a more plastic deformation behavior. Adding functionalized CaCO3 to a mixture, even in small amounts, seemed to be beneficial to increase granule size and tablet strength.

AB Downstream processing aspects of a stable form of amorphous itraconazole exhibiting enhanced dissolution properties were studied. Preparation of this ternary amorphous solid dispersion by either spray drying or hot melt extrusion led to significantly different powder processing properties. Particle size and morphology was analysed using scanning electron microscopy. Flow, compression, blending and dissolution were studied using rheometry, compaction simulation and a dissolution kit. The spray dried material exhibited poorer flow and reduced sensitivity to aeration relative to the milled extrudate. Good agreement was observed between differing forms of flow measurement, such as Flow Function, Relative flow function, Flow rate index, Aeration rate, the Hausner ratio and the Carr index. The stability index indicated that both powders were stable with respect to agglomeration, de-agglomeration and attrition. Tablet ability and compressibility studies showed that spray dried material could be compressed into stronger compacts than extruded material. Blending of the powders with low moisture, freely-flowing excipients was shown to influence both flow and compression. Porosity studies revealed that blending could influence the mechanism of densification in extrudate and blended extrudate formulations. Following blending, the powders were compressed into four 500 mg tablets, each containing a 100 mg dose of amorphous itraconazole. Dissolution studies revealed that the spray dried material released drug faster and more completely and that blending excipients could further influence the dissolution rate.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between formulation/process variables versus the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of cyclosporine ophthalmic ointments and to explore the feasibility of using an in vitro approach to assess product sameness. A definitive screening design (DSD) was used to evaluate the impact of formulation and process variables. The formulation variables included drug percentage, percentage of corn oil and lanolin alcohol. The process variables studied were mixing temperature, mixing time and the method of mixing. The quality and performance attributes examined included drug assay, content uniformity, image analysis, rheology (storage modulus, shear viscosity) and in vitro drug release. Of the formulation variables evaluated, the percentage of the drug substance and the percentage of corn oil in the matrix were the most influential factors with respect to in vitro drug release. Conversely, the process parameters tested were observed to have minimal impact. An evaluation of the release mechanism of cyclosporine from the ointment revealed an interplay between formulation (e.g. physicochemical properties of the drug and ointment matrix type) and the release medium. These data provide a scientific basis to guide method development for in vitro drug release testing of ointment dosage forms. These results demonstrate that the in vitro methods used in this investigation were fit-for-purpose for detecting formulation and process changes and therefore amenable to assessment of product sameness.

AB The current study was designed to develop and optimize lazaroid loaded nano-structured lipid carriers (LAZ-NLCs) using design of experiment approach for enhancing lazaroid brain exposure. Response surface plots were used to determine the effects of independent variables (amount of PEGylating agent and liquid lipid) on dependent variables (particle size, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency), while numerical optimization was used for optimizing LAZ-NLCs composition. The optimal LAZ-NLCs were spherical in shape with measured size of 172.3 +/- 3.54 nm, surface charge of -4.54 +/- 0.87 mV and encapsulation efficiency of 85.01 +/- 2.60%. The optimal LAZ-NLCs were also evaluated for hemolytic potential, storage stability and solid-state properties. The plasma pharmacokinetics along with brain and hepatic distributions of control lazaroid citrate solution and optimal LAZ-NLCs formulation were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats after the single bolus intravenous administration. The optimized LAZ-NLCs and the control lazaroid citrate solution had similar plasma pharmacokinetic profiles; however, differential organ bio-distributions were observed. The lazaroid exposure in brain was enhanced by two times with a decreased liver exposure by half for the NLCs group compared to the solution group.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a 3D cell culture model of the human subcutaneous tissue, allowing the prediction of the immunogenicity of subcutaneously injected therapeutic proteins. Several hydrogels were evaluated as scaffolds to mimic the human subcutaneous tissue in vitro. Cytocompatibility of the hydrogels with the human myelomonocytic cell line (MUTZ-3) was investigated, as well as their influence on cellular phenotype changes. Elastic Young's moduli in compression of the hydrogels were measured by a texture analyser and compared to ex vivo human samples. MUTZ-3 cells were differentiated into dendritic cells before embedding in hydrogels. Agarose at various concentrations (0.5%, 0.35% and 0.25% w/v), Geltrex (R) matrix and HyStem (TM) scaffold (1% w/v) displayed a wide range of elastic Young's moduli from 560 kPa to 49 kPa, compared to the reference value of 23 kPa obtained for human tissue. With the exception of HyStem (TM), good cytocompatibility of hydrogels was shown at the concentrations tested. An optimal combination of MUTZ-3 cells with 0.25% agarose or Geltrex (R) is suggested.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a renewable green energy source that uses microorganisms to catalytically convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The efficiency of extracellular electron transfer (EET) from the microbe cell to the anode electrode plays a key role in the MFC. However, the insulating properties of the cell membrane limit the efficiency of EET. Herein, EET efficiency was improved by introducing a phenazine synthesis pathway into Escherichia coli. Through the heterologous expression of phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid production increased, and the maximum power density increased from 16.7 mW/m(2) to 181.1 mW/m(2). Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance of 6.7 Omega decreased to 4.2 Omega, which reflected the enhancement of the EET efficiency and the electricity power output. Our results imply that introducing a heterologous electron shuttle into E. coli could be an efficient approach to improving the EET efficiency and performance of an MFC.

AB Protective immunity to viral pathogens often includes production of neutralizing antibodies to virus capsid proteins. Many viruses produce capsid proteins by expressing a precursor polyprotein and related protease from a single open reading frame. The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) expresses a 3C protease (3Cpro) that cleaves a P1 polyprotein intermediate into individual capsid proteins, but the FMDV 3Cpro also degrades many host cell proteins and reduces the viability of host cells, including subunit vaccine production cells. To overcome the limitations of using the a wild-type 3Cpro in FMDV subunit vaccine expression systems, we altered the protease restriction sequences within a FMDV P1 polyprotein to enable production of FMDV capsid proteins by the Tobacco Etch Virus NIa protease (TEVpro). Separate TEVpro and modified FMDV P1 proteins were produced from a single open reading frame by an intervening FMDV 2A sequence. The modified FMDV P1 polyprotein was successfully processed by the TEVpro in both mammalian and bacterial cells. More broadly, this method of polyprotein production and processing may be adapted to other recombinant expression systems, especially plant-based expression.

AB We describe the genome sequence of Pseudomonas reinekei MT1 and Achromobacter xylosoxidans MT3, the most abundant members of a bacterial community capable of degrading chloroaromatic compounds. The MT1 genome contains open reading frames encoding enzymes responsible for the catabolism of chlorosalicylate, methylsalicylate, chlorophenols, phenol, benzoate, p-coumarate, phenylalanine, and phenylacetate. On the other hand, the MT3 strain genome possesses no ORFs to metabolize chlorosalicylates; instead the bacterium is capable of metabolizing nitro-phenolic and phenolic compounds, which can be used as the only carbon and energy source by MT3. We also confirmed that MT3 displays the genetic machinery for the metabolism of chlorocathecols and chloromuconates, where the latter are toxic compounds secreted by MT1 when degrading chlorosalicylates. Altogether, this work will advance our fundamental understanding of bacterial interactions.

AB The alpha-L-Rhamnosidase is an important enzyme with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries because it can release terminal L-rhamnose residues from various natural products. In this study, the B-factor-saturation mutagenesis strategy was used to increase the thermostability of alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus terreus. The D594Q and G827K/D594Q mutant enzymes were obtained by screening a series of mutants; they prolonged the half-life of the enzyme at 70 degrees C by 2.1-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. Analysis of the 3D structure showed that in the thermostable variants the number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges was increased, explaining the enhanced thermostability. Kinetic studies showed that the KM values for the D594Q and G827K/D594Q mutant enzymes decreased by 4.0% and 3.8%, respectively. Additionally, the kcat/K-M values for the D594Q and G827K/D594Q mutant enzymes increased by 15.5% and 9.2%, respectively. Moreover, the D594Q and G827K/D594Q mutant enzymes exhibited markedly improved isoquercitrin yield at 70 degrees C that increased by 13.5% and 11.0%, respectively. Therefore, the D594Q and G827K/D594Q mutant enzymes are more suitable for the industrial processes of isoquercitrin preparation.

AB Polymalic acid (PMA) is a water-soluble biopolymer produced by the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. In this study, the physiological response of A. pullulans against exogenous alcohols stress was investigated. Interestingly, ethanol stress was an effective inducer of enhanced PMA yield, although cell growth was slightly inhibited. The stress-responsive gene malate synthase (mls), which is involved in the glyoxylate shunt, was identified and was found to be regulated by exogenous ethanol stress. Therefore, an engineered strain, YJ-MLS, was constructed by overexpressing the endogenous mls gene, which increased the PMA titer by 16.2% compared with the wild-type strain. Following addition of 1% (v/v) of ethanol, a high PMA titer of 40.0 +/- 0.38 g/L was obtained using batch fermentation with the mutant YJ-MLS in a 5-L fermentor, with a strongest PMA productivity of 0.56 g/L h. This study was the interesting report to show strengthening of the carbon metabolic flow from the glyoxylate shunt for PMA synthesis, and also provided a new sight for re-recognizing the regulatory behavior of alcohol stress in eukaryotic microbes.

AB Bacillus thuringiensis L-7601 (B. thuringiensis L-7601), belonging to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. dendrolimus serotype H4a4b, is a wild-type strain which has the ability to produce melanin during the exponential phase of growth. The melanin produced is an excellent UV protective agent for the crystal insecticidal proteins. Here, we report the complete genome of B. thuringiensis L-7601 including one 5,790,408 bp chromosome and three plasmids. 6,519 CDSs and 150 RNA genes, including 106 tRNA genes, 39 rRNA genes and 5 ncRNA genes, were identified from the whole genome. In addition, our results indicated that homogentisic acid pathway is the melanogenic pathway in B. thuringiensis and accumulation of melanin is the consequence of hmgA frameshift mutant.

AB Infectious diseases caused by antibiotic multidrug-resistant microorganisms are major causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. Hence, there is an urgent need to search for new antimicrobial agents. Initially known as a defensive effector in the innate immunity of certain organs of the human body, human goose-type lysozyme 2 (hLysG2) has been shown to possess therapeutically useful potential against multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Developing a novel strategy for large-scale production that provides high yields of this protein with high purity, quality, and potency is critical for pharmaceutical applications. To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression, here we report the production of recombinant hLysG2 (rhLysG2) using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The strong inducible alcoholoxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter was used to drive expression of the optimized hLysG2 gene. Under the optimal expression conditions, the lyric activity of rhLysG2 reached 113 U/mL of culture supernatant in shake flask cultivation and this was increased to 2084 U/mL in fed batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography, rhLysG2 was produced with a yield of 137 mg/L, purity of > 99%, molecular weight of 21,504.6 Da, and specific activity of 13,500 U/mg. In vitro assays indicated that rhLysG2 possessed muramidase activity, isopeptidase activity, and free radical scavenging activity. This report describes an efficient strategy for the production of biologically active rhLysG2 in P. pastoris on a large scale with a high yield, which provides a solid foundation for possible future pharmaceutical applications.

AB Starvation is one of the most common forms of stress experienced in the wild life. Such conditions associate the other forms of stress such as acid, heat, oxidation, and so on. Organisms acclimate to such stresses and acquire the stress tolerances, which often trade-off their growth rates. To investigate whether starvation and the associated stresses may cause the changes in the growth and the central carbon metabolism, we stock-cultured the yeast S. cerevisiae on YNB agar plates up to a month and subsequently cultured in YNB broth. The pH of the agar medium just under the yeast's colonies sharply dropped from 5.0 to 3.9 in the first day, eventually reached approximately 3.0, and the viability logarithmically decreased. The surviving cells accumulated cell damages that were measured as the prolonged LPDs (lag phase durations). We did not, however, observe the effects of long-term stock-cultivations on the measured phenotypes: growth rates, the carrying capacities, and the glycolytic oscillations that are the temporal dynamics of the central carbon metabolism. Our study revealed that the contribution of cell damages to the total delay in growth was 78%, and that LPDs are closely related to damage recovery mechanisms.

AB While progress towards a Group A Streptococcus (GAS) vaccine has been stalled by a combination of scientific, regulatory, and commercial barriers, the problem persists. The high and globally-distributed burden of disease attributable to GAS makes vaccination an imperative global public health goal. Advances across a range of scientific disciplines in understanding GAS diseases have made the goal a realistic one and focused attention on the need for coordinated global action. With a view to accelerating GAS vaccine development, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) convened a global stakeholder consultation on the 12th and 13th of December 2016, in Seoul, South Korea. Topics discussed included: (1) gaps in current knowledge of global GAS epidemiology, burden of disease, and molecular epidemiology; (2) contribution of pre-clinical models to candidate vaccine evaluation and new immunological assays to address GAS immunology knowledge gaps; (3) status and future of the GAS vaccine development pipeline; and (4) defining a pathway to licensure, policy recommendations and availability of a vaccine. The meeting determined to establish a GAS vaccine working group to coordinate preparation of a global vaccine values proposition, preferred product characteristics, and a technical research and development roadmap. A new global GAS vaccine consortium will drive strategic planning to anticipate requirements for licensure, prequalification, and policy recommendations.

AB Licensing and decisions on public health use of a vaccine rely on a robust clinical development program that permits a risk-benefit assessment of the product in the target population. Studies undertaken early in clinical development, as well as well-designed pivotal trials, allow for this robust characterization. In 2012, WHO published guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of live attenuated dengue tetravalent vaccines. Subsequently, efficacy and longer-term follow-up data have become available from two Phase 3 trials of a dengue vaccine, conducted in parallel, and the vaccine was licensed in December 2015. The findings and interpretation of the results from these trials released both before and after licensure have highlighted key complexities for tetravalent dengue vaccines, including concerns vaccination could increase the incidence of dengue disease in certain subpopulations. This report summarizes clinical and regulatory points for consideration that may guide vaccine developers on some aspects of trial design and facilitate regulatory review to enable broader public health recommendations for second-generation dengue vaccines.

AB The NIH has developed live attenuated dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidates by deletion of 30 nucleotides (Delta 30) from the untranslated region of the viral genome. Although this attenuation strategy has proven to be effective in generating safe and immunogenic vaccine strains, the molecular mechanism of attenuation is largely unknown. To examine the mediators of the observed attenuation phenotype, differences in translation efficiency, genome replication, cytotoxicity, and type I interferon susceptibility were compared between wild type parental DENV and DENV Delta 30 attenuated vaccine candidates. We observed that decreased accumulation of subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) from the vaccine candidates in infected human cells causes increased type I IFN susceptibility and propose this as one of the of attenuation mechanisms produced by the 3' UTR Delta 30 mutation.

AB Infectious complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccines is among the most effective healthcare measures mainly for these subjects. However immunocompromised people vary in their degree of immunosuppression and susceptibility to infection and, therefore, represent a heterogeneous population with regard to immunization. To date there is no well- established evidence for use of vaccines in immunodeficient patients, and indications are not clearly defined even in high-quality reviews and in most of the guidelines prepared to provide recommendations for the active vaccination of immunocompromised hosts. The aim of this document is to issue recommendations based on published literature and the collective experience of the Italian primary immunodeficiency centers, about how and when vaccines can be used in immunocompromised patients, in order to facilitate physician decisions and to ensure the best immune protection with the lowest risk to the health of the patient.

AB The divergence of regulatory requirements and processes in developing and emerging countries contributes to hamper vaccines registration, and therefore delay access to high-quality, safe and efficacious vaccines for their respective populations. This report focuses on providing insights on the heterogeneity of registration requirements in terms of numbering structure and overall content of dossiers for marketing authorisation applications for vaccines in different areas of the world. While it also illustrates the divergence of regulatory processes in general, as well as the need to avoid redundant reviews, it does not claim to provide a comprehensive view of all processes nor existing facilitating mechanisms, nor is it intended to touch upon the differences in assessments made by different regulatory authorities. This report describes the work analysed by regulatory experts from vaccine manufacturing companies during a meeting held in Geneva in May 2017, in identifying and quantifying differences in the requirements for vaccine registration in three aspects for comparison: the dossier numbering structure and contents, the application forms, and the evaluation procedures, in different countries and regions. The Module 1 of the Common Technical Document (CTD) of 10 countries were compared. Modules 2-5 of the CTDs of two regions and three countries were compared to the CTD of the US FDA. The application forms of eight countries were compared and the registration procedures of 134 importing countries were compared as well. The analysis indicates a high degree of divergence in numbering structure and content requirements. Possible interventions that would lead to significant improvements in registration efficiency include alignment in CTD numbering structure, a standardised model-application form, and better convergence of evaluation procedures.

AB This article presented the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the use of on Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine excerpted from the BCG vaccines: WHO position paper February 2018 published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record [1]. This position paper replaces the 2004 WHO position paper on Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine [2] and the 2007 WHO revised BCG vaccination guidelines for infants at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [3]. It incorporates recent developments in the tuberculosis (TB) field, provides revised guidance on the immunization of children infected with HIV, and re-emphasizes the importance of the birth dose. This position paper also includes recommendations for the prevention of leprosy.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation tables. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of cholera vaccines were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in October 2017; evidence presented at these meetings can be accessed at: http://www. who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/presentations_background_docs/en/ (C)2018 World Health Organization.

   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation table. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of cholera vaccines were discussed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in April 2017; evidence presented at these meetings can be accessed at: www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/Aprilipresentations_background_docs/en/.

AB Therapeutic HPV vaccine is an agent to induce E7-specific Th1 immune responses to treat cervical neoplasia (CIN2-3). Our previous clinical trial has demonstrated that oral administration of HPV16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), GLBL101c, resulted in the regression of HPV16-related CIN3. Here we examined optimization of the E7-expressing L. casei for induction of the mucosal immune responses to E7. Various doses of HPV16 E7 molecule were displayed on the L casei. Immunization with E7-bound L. casei showed the induction of E7-specific mucosal IFNy-producing cells was dependent on displayed E7-doses but saturated beyond 0.3 mu/10(8) cells. A new agent, L casei with endogenous expression of E7 (IGMKK16E7), showed the optimal amount of displayed-E7. Immunization with IGMKK16E7 demonstrated 4-fold higher induction of E7-specific mucosal IFNy-producing cells when compared with the former one. Our new system provided the optimal E7-expressing L casei for displayed-E7 amount and induction of mucosal Th1 immune response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of oral rotavirus vaccines (ORVVs) has led to a reduction in number of hospitalisations and deaths due to rotavirus (RV) infection. However, the efficacy of the vaccines has been varied with low-income countries showing significantly lower efficacy as compared to high-income countries. The reasons for the disparity are not fully understood but are thought to be multi-factorial. In this review article, we discuss the concept that the disparity in the efficacy of oral rotavirus vaccines between the higher and lower socio-economical countries could be due the nature of the bacteria that colonises and establishes in the gut early in life. We further discuss recent studies that has demonstrated significant correlations between the composition of the gut bacteria and the immunogenicity of oral vaccines, and their implications in the development of novel oral RV vaccines or redesigning the current ones for maximum impact.

AB Introduction: Vaccination against influenza on an annual basis is widely recommended, yet recent studies suggest consecutive vaccination may reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE).
   Purpose: To assess whether when examining the entirety of existing data consecutive influenza vaccination reduces VE compared to current season influenza vaccination.
   Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to April 26, 2017; citations of included studies.
   Study selection: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of children, adults and/or the elderly that reported laboratory-confirmed influenza infection over 2 or more consecutive influenza seasons were eligible.
   Data extraction: Data related to study characteristics, participant demographics, cases of influenza infection by vaccination group and risk of bias assessment was extracted in duplicate.
   Data synthesis: Five RCTs involving 11,987 participants did not show a significant reduction in VE when participants vaccinated in two consecutive seasons (VE 71%, 95% Cl 62-78%) were compared to those vaccinated in the current season (VE 58%, 95% CI 48-66%) (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.62-1.26, p = 0.49, 12 = 39%). Twenty-eight observational studies involving 28,627 participants also did not show a reduction (VE for two consecutive seasons 41%, 95% CI 30-51% compared to VE for current season 47%, 95% CI 39-54%; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98-132, p = 0.09, 1(2) = 63%). Results from subgroup analyses by influenza type/subtype, vaccine type, age, vaccine match and co-morbidity support these findings; however, dose-response results were inconsistent. Certainty in the evidence was assessed to be very low due to unexplained heterogeneity and imprecision.
   Limitations: The inclusion of studies with relatively small sample sizes and low event rates contributed to the imprecision of summary VE and OR estimates, which were based on unadjusted data. Conclusion: Available evidence does not support a reduction in VE with consecutive influenza vaccination, but the possibility of reduced effectiveness cannot be ruled out due to very low certainty in this evidence.

ID ENTEROVIRUS 71; OUTBREAK
AB Coxsackievirus belongs to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family and is one of the major pathogens associated with human hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Historically, outbreaks of HFMD have mainly been caused by enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16. Recently, coxsackieviruses A6 and A10 have been associated with increased occurrences of sporadic HFMD cases and outbreak events globally. In this study, the immunogenicity of coxsackieviruses A6, A10, and A16 (CA6, CA10, and CA16), which were inactivated by formalin or beta-propiolactone (BPL) under different conditions, was evaluated as multivalent vaccine candidates. CA6 induced similar immune responses with both inactivation methods, and the immune efficacy of CA10 and CA16 was better following inactivation with BPL than with formalin. There was no sufficient cross-reactivity or cross-protectivity against heterologous strains in groups vaccinated with the BPL-inactivated (BI) monovalent vaccine. Sufficient neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses were induced in the BI-trivalent vaccinated group. These findings suggest that BI-CA6, CA10, and CA16 are potential multivalent vaccine candidates and that a multivalent vaccine is needed to control HFMD. The coxsackievirus multivalent vaccine could be useful for the development of effective HFMD vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: We sought to understand the relative advantage of pharmacies compared to doctors' offices for delivering HPV vaccination to adolescents.
   Methods: Participants were a national sample of 1500 U.S. parents of adolescents ages 11-17 recruited in 2014-15. In an online survey, items informed by Diffusion of Innovation Theory assessed parents' perceptions of the relative advantages of HPV vaccine delivery in pharmacies and doctors' offices.
   Principle findings: Many parents believed doctor's offices offered a better health care environment than pharmacies, with more privacy (77%) and a safer place for vaccination (70%). However, many parents also believed pharmacies were more accessible than doctors' offices, requiring less time for vaccinations (71%) and offering more convenient hours (59%). Parents were more willing to get their children HPV vaccine from pharmacists if they indicated more relative advantages in vaccine delivery in pharmacies (beta = .29; p<.001) and believed patient accessibility more important than health care environment beta= .20; p<.001).
   Conclusions: To be more appealing to parents as HPV vaccine providers, pharmacy providers within community and hospital settings should build on their relative advantage with respect to accessibility and enhance their appeal of their healthcare environment.

AB The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic and zoonotic virus with a fatality rate in humans of over 35%. Although several vaccine candidates have been developed, there is still no clinically available vaccine for MERS-CoV. In this study, we developed two types of MERS-CoV vaccines: a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene (Ad5/MERS) and spike protein nanoparticles formulated with aluminum (alum) adjuvant. Next, we tested a heterologous prime-boost vaccine strategy, which compared priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles and vice versa, with homologous prime-boost vaccination comprising priming and boosting with either spike protein nanoparticles or Ad5/MERS. Although both types of vaccine could induce specific immunoglobulin G against MERS-CoV, neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were induced only by heterologous prime-boost immunization and homologous immunization with spike protein nanoparticles. Interestingly, Th1 cell activation was induced by immunization schedules including Ad5/MERS, but not by those including only spike protein nanoparticles. Heterologous prime boost vaccination regimens including Ad5/MERS elicited simultaneous Th1 and Th2 responses, but homologous prime-boost regimens did not. Thus, heterologous prime-boost may induce longer-lasting immune responses against MERS-CoV because of an appropriate balance of Th1/Th2 responses. However, both heterologous prime-boost and homologous spike protein nanoparticles vaccinations could provide protection from MERS-CoV challenge in mice. Our results demonstrate that heterologous immunization by priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles could be an efficient prophylactic strategy against MERS-CoV infection.

TI Influenza vaccine effectiveness in hospitalised Hong Kong children:
   Feasibility of estimates from routine surveillance data
SO VACCINE
LA English

DE Influenza; Respiratory; Influenza vaccine; Vaccine effectiveness;
   Surveillance
AB Background: Hong Kong has a high burden of influenza hospitalisation. This study estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness in hospitalised Hong Kong children aged 6 months to below 6 years using data potentially obtainable from routine surveillance sources.
   Methods: This 'test-negative' case-control study was conducted over two summer and one winter influenza seasons in five public Hong Kong hospitals during 2015 and 2016. Patients admitted for febrile and/or respiratory-associated illnesses who met inclusion criteria were invited to participate. Case-patients were respiratory-associated admissions with nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained during the first 48 h of hospitalisation that tested positive for influenza A or B, whereas control-patients were those with specimens that tested negative for both influenza A and B. Reliability of a routinely collected influenza immunisation status form was evaluated. Vaccine effectiveness for administration of full or partial series of influenza vaccination was calculated as 1 minus the odds ratio for influenza vaccination history for case-patients versus control-patients.
   Results: 2900 eligible subjects had influenza vaccination status available. A simple record form, designed to collect upon admission information on influenza vaccination status, was found to be reliable when compared to confirmed vaccination status from immunisation records and guardians' self-reports. Influenza vaccine effectiveness for preventing influenza A or B hospitalisation in children aged from 6 months to below 6 years during the period June 2015 to November 2016 was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55%, 77%) from unconditional analyses and 64% (95% CI: 46%, 75%) from conditional analyses.
   Conclusions: Seasonal influenza vaccine was effective in preventing hospitalisation from influenza A or B in young Hong Kong children during 2015 and 2016. As influenza vaccination status is not currently routinely recorded, implementation of an influenza immunisation status form in all paediatric wards, and centralising the data in Hong Kong's central computerised database, could provide real-time monitoring of influenza vaccine effectiveness.

AB Background: Provider recommendation is associated with influenza vaccination receipt. The objectives of this study were to estimate the percentage of children 6 months-17 years for whom a provider recommendation for influenza vaccination was received, identify factors associated with receipt of provider recommendation, and evaluate the association between provider recommendation and influenza vaccination status among children.
   Methods: National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu) parentally reported data for the 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16 seasons were analyzed. Tests of association between provider recommendation and demographic characteristics were conducted using Wald chi-square tests and pairwise comparison t-tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine variables independently associated with receiving provider recommendation and the association between provider recommendation and influenza vaccination status.
   Results: Approximately 70% of children had a parent report receiving a provider recommendation for influenza vaccination for their child. The strongest association between receipt of provider recommendation and demographic characteristics was with child's age, with younger children (6-23 months, 2-4 years, and 5-12 years) being more likely to have a provider recommendation than older children (13-17 years). In addition, children living in a household above poverty with household income >$75,000 were more likely to have a parent report receipt of a provider recommendation than children living below poverty. Children with a provider recommendation were twice as likely to be vaccinated than those without.
   Conclusions: This study affirms the importance of provider recommendation for influenza vaccination among children. Ensuring that parents of all children receive a provider recommendation may improve vaccination coverage. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and related cancers; however, HPV vaccine uptake remains low in the US. After the 2011 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation for routine HPV vaccination of adolescent males, several studies have examined predictors for initiating the vaccine series in this population of interest, particularly with regard to provider recommendations. This study examined racial and ethnic differences for HPV vaccine initiation and provider recommendation in male adolescents. Based on prior HPV vaccine uptake estimates and healthcare utilization data, we hypothesized that minority adolescents would be more likely to initiate HPV vaccines, but less likely to receive a provider recommendation compared to white counterparts. We analyzed the 2014 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen), which included 10,753 male adolescents with provider-verified vaccination data in 50 US states, using multivariate logistic regression models to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in HPV vaccine initiation and provider recommendation. The odds of HPV vaccine initiation were 76 percent higher for Hispanic adolescents and 43 percent higher for non-Hispanic Other or Multiple race adolescents compared to white adolescents. Approximately half of parents reported receiving a provider recommendation for vaccination, with no significant difference in the odds of receiving a provider recommendation across racial/ethnic groups. Despite similar frequency of recommendations across racial and ethnic groups, male adolescents who are racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to initiate vaccination. Future research should focus on developing tailored interventions to increase HPV vaccine receipt among males of all racial/ethnic groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluating scenarios of locations and capacities for vaccine storage in

ID SUPPLY CHAINS
AB Many developing countries still face the prevalence of preventable childhood diseases because their vaccine supply chain systems are inadequate by design or structure to meet the needs of their populations. Currently, Nigeria is evaluating options in the redesign of the country's vaccine supply chain. Using Nigeria as a case study, the objective is to evaluate different regional supply chain scenarios to identify the cost minimizing optimal hub locations and storage capacities for doses of different vaccines to achieve a 100% fill rate. First, we employ a shortest-path optimization routine to determine hub locations. Second, we develop a total cost minimizing routine based on stochastic optimization to determine the optimal capacities at the hubs. This model uses vaccine supply data between 2011 and 2014 provided by Nigeria's National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) on Tuberculosis, Polio, Yellow Fever, Tetanus Toxoid, and Hepatitis B. We find that a two-regional system with no central hub (NC2) cut costs by 23% to achieve a 100% fill rate when compared to optimizing the existing chain of six regions with a central hub (EC6). While the government's leading redesign alternative - no central three-hub system (Gov NC3) - reduces costs by 21% compared with the current EC6, it is more expensive than our NC2 system by 3%. In terms of capacity increases, optimizing the current system requires 42% more capacity than our NC2 system. Although the proposed Gov NC3 system requires the least increase in storage capacity, it requires the most distance to achieve a 100% coverage and about 15% more than our NC2. Overall, we find that improving the current system with a central hub and all its variants, even with optimal regional hub locations, require more storage capacities and are costlier than systems without a central hub. While this analysis prescribes the no central hub with two regions (NC2) as the least cost scenario, it is imperative to note that other configurations have benefits and comparative tradeoffs. Our approach and results offer some guidance for future vaccine supply chain redesigns in countries with similar layouts to Nigeria's. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Staphylococcus aureus causes a chronic, contagious disease of the udder, or mastitis, in dairy cows. This infection is often refractory to antibiotic treatment, and has a significant economic impact on milk production worldwide. An effective vaccine to prevent S. aureus mastitis would improve animal health, reduce antibiotic dependence and inform human vaccine approaches. The iron-regulated surface determinant A (IsdA) and clumping factor A (ClfA) are conserved S. aureus extracellular-matrix adhesins and target vaccine antigens. Here we report the results of two bovine immunogenicity trials using purified IsdA and ClfA-cholera toxin A(2)/B chimeras (IsdA-CTA(2)/B and ClfA-CTA(2)/B). Cows were intranasally inoculated with IsdA-CTA(2)/B + ClfA-CTA(2)/B at dry off and followed for 70 days. Trial 1 utilized three groups with one or two booster doses at a total concentration of 600 or 900 lag. Trial 2 utilized two groups with one booster at a total concentration of 1200 mu g. Humoral immune responses in serum and milk were examined by ELISA. Responses in serum were significant between groups and provide evidence of antigen-specific IgG induction after vaccination in both trials. Cellular proliferation was detected by flow cytometry using antigen-stimulated PBMCs from day 60 of Trial 2 and revealed an increase in CD4+ T cells from vaccinated cows. IsdA and ClfA stimulation induced IL-4 expression, but not IFN-gamma or IL-17, in PBMCs from day 60 as determined by cytokine expression analysis. Opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus confirmed the functional in vitro activity of anti-IsdA antibodies from Trial 2 serum and milk. The vaccine was well tolerated and safe, and results support the potential of mucosally-delivered CTA(2)/B chimeras to protect cows from mastitis caused by S. aureus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ENCEPHALITIS; EFFICACY
AB Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is closely associated in the fetus with microcephaly and in the adults with Guillain-Barre syndrome and even male infertility. It is an urgent international priority to develop a safe and effective vaccine that offers protection to both women of childbearing age and their children. In this study, female immunocompetent BALB/c mice were immunized with a DNA-based vaccine candidate, pVAX1-ZME, expressing the prM/E protein of ZIKV, and the immunogenicity for maternal mice and the post-natal protection for suckling mice were evaluated. It was found that administration with three doses of 5014 pVAX1-ZME via in vivo electroporation induced robust ZIKV-specific cellular and long-term humoral immune responses with high and sustained neutralizing activity in adult mice. Moreover, using a maternal immunization protocol, neutralizing antibodies provided specific passive protection against ZIKV infection in neonatal mice and effectively inhibited the growth delay. This vaccine candidate is expected to be further evaluated in higher animals, and maternal vaccination shows great promise for protecting both women of childbearing age and their offspring against post-natal ZIKV infection. The vaccinated mothers and ZIKV-challenged pups provide key insight into Zika vaccine evaluation in an available fully immunocompetent animal model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In Australia's Northern Territory, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotype A2 (subtype adw2) vaccine was introduced in 1988 for Indigenous infants. Subsequently, the circulating viral genotype has been identified as subgenotype C4 (subtype ayw3). We assessed HBV vaccine effectiveness (VE) in light of this subtype mismatch.
   Methods: Participants of the Aboriginal Birth Cohort (ABC) study were recruited at birth (1987-1990), with HBV serology obtained at follow-up waves 3 (2005-2007) and 4 (2013-2015). Participants were immune if HBV surface antibody levels exceeded 10 IU/L. We determined the VE against any HBV infection (anti-HB+) and against chronic infection (HBsAg. or HBV DNA.), comparing non-vaccinated participants with those fulfilling United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for full HBV immunisation.
   Results: Of 686 participants in the ABC study, we obtained HBV serology from 388 at wave 4. 181 participants were immune to HBV and 97 had evidence of any infection. Seven participants were chronically infected, of whom five had received three vaccine doses, and anti-HBc seroconversion had occurred subsequent to the three vaccine doses for two of these seven participants. Comparing the 107 participants who had been vaccinated in accordance with CDC recommendations and 127 who had not been vaccinated, VE against any infection was 67% (95%Cl, 43-104%). The odds of being anti-HBc(+). was 87% lower in participants raised in urban settings compared to those born into families from remote areas (OR, 0.1; 95%Cl, 0.03-0.4).
   Conclusions: In a setting where there exists a subtype mismatch between vaccine and circulating genotype, the vaccine was largely effective in preventing chronic infection but sub-optimal against any infection. The implications of a high prevalence of anti-HBc seropositivity in this population are unclear and require further study. The fact that anti-HBc seropositivity was strongly associated with remote dwelling suggests ongoing viral exposure in remote settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Despite widespread utilization of influenza vaccines, effectiveness (VE) has not been routinely measured in Latin America.
   Methods: We used a case test-negative control design to estimate trivalent inactivated influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza among hospitalized children aged 6 months-5 years and adults aged >= 60 years which are age-groups targeted for vaccination. We sought persons with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), hospitalized at 71 sentinel hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Paraguay during January-December 2013. Cases had an influenza virus infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); controls had a negative rRT-PCR result for influenza viruses. We used a two-stage random effects model to estimate pooled VE per target age-group, adjusting for the month of illness onset, age and preexisting medical conditions.
   Results: We identified 2620 SARI patients across sites: 246 influenza cases and 720 influenza-negative controls aged <= 5 years and 448 cases and 1206 controls aged >= 60 years. The most commonly identified subtype among participants (48%) was the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus followed by influenza A (H3N2) (34%) and influenza B (18%) viruses. Among children, the adjusted VE of full vaccination (one dose for previously vaccinated or two if vaccine naive) against any influenza virus SARI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14-71%); VE was 58% (95% CI: 16-79%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 65% (95% CI:-9; 89%) against influenza A(H3N2) viruses associated SARI. Crude VE of full vaccination against influenza B viruses associated SARI among children was 3% (95% CI:-150; 63). Among adults aged >= 60 years, adjusted VE against any influenza SARI was 48% (95% CI: 34-60%); VE was 54% (95% CI: 37-69%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 43% (95% CI: 18-61%) against influenza A(H3N2) and 34% (95% CI:-4; 58%) against B viruses associated SARI.
   Conclusion: Influenza vaccine provided moderate protection against severe influenza illness among fully vaccinated young children and older adults, supporting current vaccination strategies. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background & aim: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be transmitted to infants, and is related to infants' later disease risk. Epigenetic change (such as DNA methylation) may be mechanism underlying the relationship. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether prenatal HBV infection could alter DNA methylation status in newborns.
   Method: We selected 12 neonates with intrauterine HBV infection whose mothers were HBsAg-positive during pregnancy, relative to 12 HBV-free neonates with HBsAg-negative mothers. The pattern of genome-wide DNA methylation in the umbilical cord blood was investigated by Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip.
   Result: The average level of global methylation in infected neonates exposed to maternal HBV infection was not significantly different from controls. However, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, we found differential significance in the cases group compared to the controls for 663 CpG sites, associated with 534 genes. Among these sites, 53.85% (357/663) had decreased methylation (Delta M < 0) and 46.15% (306/663) had increased methylation (Delta M > 0). The average percentage change (Delta beta) in methylation ranged from -46% to 36%. Validated by pyrosequencing, we identified 4 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites in the KLHL35 gene and additional CpGs for the CPT1B gene. These genes play a role in the development of hepatocellular and colorectal carcinoma and fatty acid oxidation, suggesting the candidature of these genes in HBV related disease.
   Conclusion: Prenatal HBV exposure, even without malformation or preterm birth, may alter the epigenome profile in newborns. We identified a set of genes with differentially methylated CpG sites presented in the cord blood of HBV-infected newborns with HBsAg-positive mothers, demonstrating that DNA methylation status at birth can be used as a biomarker of prenatal exposure. These DNA methylation differences suggest a possible role for epigenetic processes in neonatal development in response to prenatal HBV exposure.

AB An expression of calpain and caspase-1 as well as the concomitant ultrastructural alterations were investigated during necrosis of the mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The calpain expression was registered at 0 h and 1 h although caspase-1 did not induce any signals during these time periods. The rise of the cytoplasmic lytic zones contacted by calpain antibodies was identified as a morphologic event corresponding to the expression of calpain. Lytic zone's distribution followed by the appearance of the calpain/caspase-1 clusters assigned for lysis of the Golgi vesicles and ER. Also, the microapocrine secretion of the vesicles containing the calpain/caspase-1 clusters was detected. Further, the lysis of the plasma membrane occurred due to progression of intracellular lysis. Rupture of the plasma membrane resulted in the termination of secretion and dissemination of cell contents. The nuclei still had their normal shape. Nuclear lysis continued to rise with intranuclear lytic zones, of which the progression was accompanied with the presence of calpain/caspase-1 clusters. The data contribute to the concept of the initial role of calpain for tumor cell destruction, provide first evidence of the calpain/caspase-1 pathway in tumor cells, and highlight microapocrine secretion as a possible tumor cell death signalling mechanism.

AB We aimed to investigate the association of 12 extensively studied polymorphisms in adiponectin (ADIPOQ), adiponectin receptor-1 (ADIPOR1) and adiponectin receptor-2 (ADIPOR2) genes with myocardial infarction in Han Chinese. This is a hospital-based, cross-sectional, case-control study, including 717 myocardial infarction patients and 612 controls. Myocardial infarction was confirmed through electrocardiogram/anatomopathological examinations. All polymorphisms met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). The genotype/allele counts of ADIPOQ gene rs2241766 (p = 0.001/0.003) and ADIPOR2 gene rs10773989 (p < 0.001/ = 0.008) differed significantly between patients and controls. Under the recessive model, rs2241766 (odds ratio [OR] = 4.16, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.83-9.49, p = 0.001) and rs10773989 (OR = 8.40, 95% CI: 2.54-27.8, p < 0.001) were associated with the significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction. Haplotype analysis revealed none or marginal significance, and there was no likelihood of genetic interaction as indicated by multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Logistic regression analysis indicated that age, total cholesterol, hypertension, rs2241766, rs1342387, rs10773989 and rs1044471 were significant contributors, and a nomo-gram based on these contributors exhibited a good predictive utility (C-index: 0.795, p < 0.001). Our findings demonstrate that two polymorphisms, rs2241766 in ADIPOQ gene and rs10773989 in ADIPOR2 gene, especially under the recessive model of inheritance, played independent leading roles in susceptibility to myocardial infarction in Han Chinese.

AB The magur catfish (Clarias magur) is a facultative air-breather and regularly encounters with various environmental changes along with exposure to various bacterial pathogens in its natural habitats. Occurrence of various biochemical adaptational strategies related to nitrogen metabolism in magur catfish is already known. The present investigation aimed at determining the possible induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) production in this catfish while challenging with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) treatment, and also to determine the involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) in induction of inos gene. Intra-peritoneal injection of LPS led to more production and accumulation of NO in different body tissues of magur catfish as a consequence of induction of iNOS activity. The induction of iNOS activity was associated with the induction of inos gene as evidenced by more expression of inos mRNA and more abundance of iNOS enzyme protein in different tissues of magur catfish with certain variations in zonal specific expression patterns. Similar observations related to more production of NO and induction of inos gene were also made when the isolated hepatocytes were treated with LPS in vitro condition. LPS treatment also led to activation of NF kappa B in hepatic cells. However, in presence of a specific inhibitor of NF kappa B, the LPS-mediated induction of inos gene and extra production of NO were almost blocked, thereby suggesting that the induction of inos gene due to LPS treatment was mediated via the NF kappa B in magur catfish. It is hypothesized that the induction of iNOS activity, and more synthesis and accumulation of NO could serve as indicators to determine the pathophysiological conditions of the fish living in bacterial contaminated water bodies. Further, it can be contemplated that more synthesis of NO through iNOS enzyme probably serves as an important pharmacological tool against fish pathogen and also plays an important role in host defense mechanisms in this unique group of magur catfish.

AB Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and ER-negative (ER-) subtypes of breast cancer have distinct clinical outcomes because they respond differentially to endocrine therapies. We aimed to comprehensively analyze differentially expressed microRNA (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) and mRNAs in different ER subtypes as well as to identify prognosis-related RNAs. The expression levels of miRNAs, IncRNAs, and mRNAs between breast cancer and normal samples were compared using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed miRNAs, IncRNAs and mRNAs between ER and ER- samples were also screened. An ER subtype-related miRNA-IncRNA-mRNA network was constructed. IncRNAs and mRNAs in this network were further subjected to an analysis of their associations with patient prognosis. Sets of differentially expressed miRNAs, IncRNAs, and miRNAs between breast cancer and normal samples were identified among which 14 miRNAs, 78 IncRNAs, and 475 mRNAs were differentially expressed between ER subtypes. Relationships between these RNAs were analyzed. The resultant ER subtype-related miRNA-IncRNA-mRNA network consisted of 14 nodes, among which LINC0092 and chromosome 2 open reading frame 71 (C2orf71) were correlated with better prognosis of breast cancer. LINC0092 was co-expressed with SFRP1 and RGMA and regulated by hsa-miR-449a and hsa-miR-452-5p. C2orf71 was co-expressed with LINC00511 and regulated by hsa-miR-184. Cross-talk among differentially expressed miRNAs, IncRNAs, and miRNAs may be an important feature in ER+ and ER- subtypes of breast cancer. LINC0092 and C2orf71, two of these cross-talking RNAs, may serve as novel prognostic predictor of breast cancer because of their close associations with prognosis.

AB Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) cooperate with sex-related genes in post-transcriptional regulation and play extremely important roles in the establishment of sexually dimorphic traits in animals. However, the gonad miRNAs and expression patterns of miRNAs in sturgeon have not been investigated.
   Methods: In the present study, we used high-throughput small RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to discover gonad miRNAs from the ovaries and testes of Amur sturgeons (Acipenser schrenckii). Further, microarray and real-time PCR assays were performed to identify the expression patterns of gonad miRNAs.
   Results: As a result, a total of 679 conserved and 51 novel miRNAs were successfully discovered in the gonads of A. schrenckii. Moreover, we found wide sequence variations (isomiRs) in gonad miRNAs, including 5' and 3' isomiRs. Our microarray analysis further characterized the 730 miRNAs expression profiles, which indicated that 117 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected with sex-biased patterns: 71 testis-biased and 46 ovary biased miRNAs. Based on bioinformatics prediction, we found that there were functional differences between the testis-biased and ovary-biased miRNA targets involved in reproductive-related GO and KEGG pathways. Further, the association of the differentially expressed miRNAs and sex-related target mRNAs was uncovered. Finally, the expression patterns of 11 sex-biased miRNAs and 7 sex-related targets were validated in testes and ovaries using real-time PCR. Putative, negatively expressed miRNA-mRNA relationships were confirmed, such as Dmrt1 and asc-miR-2779, AR and asc-miR-203b-3p, fox12 and asc-miR-30d.
   Conclusion: This study provides information regarding the gonad miRNAs in sturgeon. The differential expression miRNAs in the gonads will help us to further understand the role of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in the ovary and testis of sturgeon.

AB Trichomes are epidermal outgrowths of plant tissues that can secrete or store large quantities of secondary metabolites, which contribute to plant defense responses against stress. The use of bioengineering methods for regulating the development of trichomes and metabolism is a widely researched topic. In the present study, we demonstrate that JcZFP8, a C2H2 zinc finger protein gene from Jatropha curcas L., can regulate trichome development in transgenic tobacco. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome profiling of overexpression JcZFP8 transgenic plants and wild type tobacco. Based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes, we determined that genes of the plant hormone signal transduction pathway was significantly enriched, suggesting that these pathways were modulated in the transgenic plants. In addition, the transcript levels of the known trichome related genes in Arabidopsis were not significantly changed, whereas CycB2 and MYB genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic plants. Despite tobacco and Arabidopsis have different types of trichomes, all the pathways were associated with C2H2 zinc finger protein genes. Our findings help us to understand the regulation of multicellular trichome formation and suggest a new metabolic engineering method for the improvement of plants.

AB Crassadoma gigantea is an important commercial marine bivalve species in Baja California and Mexico. In this study, we have applied RNA-Seq technology to profile the transcriptome of the C. gigantea for the first time. A total of 80,832,518 raw reads were produced from a Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, and 77,306,198 (95.64%) clean reads were generated after trimming the adaptor sequences. The transcriptome assembled into 158,855 transcripts with an N50 size of 1995 bp and an average size of 1008 bp. A number of DNA repair related genes, such as MSH3, EGF, TGF, IGF, FGF, encoding different groups of growth factors were found in the transcriptome data of C. gigantean. In addition, immune related genes Toll-like receptor (TLR) including TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 was also observed in C. gigantean. A set of 12 polymorphic micro satellite loci were firstly developed and characterized in C. gigantea. The results show that the number of alleles and expected heterozygosity ranged from 3 to 9 and from 0.254 to 0.820, respectively. The average polymorphic information content was 0.790. These microsatellite loci will facilitate future studies of population structure and conservation genetics in this species.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs, regulates message RNA (mRNA) by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) resulting in suppression of gene expression. In this study, we identified the expression and function of miR-128, which was found to be downregulated in glioma tissues and glioma cells by real time PCR. Overexpression of miR-128 mimics into LN229 and U251 cells could inhibit proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. However, the inhibitory effects of miR-128 mimics on the invasion and proliferation of glioma cells were reversed by overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Our data showed that COX-2 was a candidate target of miR-128. Luciferase activity of 3'-UTR of COX-2 was reduced in the presence of miR-128. Additionally, miR-128 obviously decreased COX-2 mRNA stability determined by real time PCR. Contrarily, we found that miR-128 inhibitor significantly increased the COX-2 mRNA expression, and elevated the protein expression of MMP9 and ki67, and promoted the proliferation of glioma cells. Furthermore, luciferase activity of the 3'-UTR was upregulated by miR-128 inhibitor. All of these results supported that miR-128 was a direct regulator of COX-2. Further studies proved that COX-2 was elevated in glioma tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with the levels of miR-128. These findings may establish miR-128 as a new potential target for the treatment of patients with gliomas.

AB The polyphenol resveratrol is found in many plant and fruits and is a constituent of our diet. Resveratrol has been proposed to have chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activities. On the cellular level, resveratrol activates stimulus-regulated transcription factors. To identify resveratrol-responsive elements within a natural gene promoter, the molecular pathway leading to c-Fos gene expression by resveratrol was dissected. The c-Fos gene encodes a basic region leucine zipper transcription factor and is a prototype of an immediate-early gene that is regulated by a wide range of signaling molecules. We analyzed chromatin-integrated c-Fos promoter-luciferase reporter genes where transcription factor binding sites were destroyed by point mutations or deletion mutagenesis. The results show that mutation of the binding sites for serum response factor (SRF), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) significantly reduced reporter gene transcription following stimulation of the cells with resveratrol. Inactivation of the binding sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or ternary complex factors did not influence resveratrol-regulated c-Fos promoter activity. Thus, the c-Fos promoter contains three resveratrol-responsive elements, the cAMP response element (CRE), and the binding sites for SRF and AP-1. Moreover, we show that the transcriptional activation potential of the c-Fos protein is increased in resveratrol-stimulated cells, indicating that the biological activity of c-Fos is elevated by resveratrol stimulation. Pharmacological and genetic experiments revealed that the protein kinase ERK1/2 is the signal transducer that connects resveratrol treatment with the c-Fos gene.

AB As constituent factors of Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways, Piwi proteins are essential for germline maintenance and gonadal development. Previous studies show that Piwi-piRNA pathways could be regulated by hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, however, related studies have not been reported in marine species. Here we reported the identification of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) piwil1 gene, which was abundantly expressed in testis and ovary in a tissue-specific manner. Phylogenetic and genomic structure analyses revealed that piwil1 was conserved in its sequence and function during vertebrate evolution. We also investigated the effects of HPG axis hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estradio1-17 beta (E2) and 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT), on gonadal piwil1 expression via in vivo and in vitro approaches. In ovary, hCG and E2 suppressed piwil1 expression both in vivo and in vitro, and MT increased piwil1 expression in vivo. In testis, hCG had upregulating effects on piwil1 expression in vivo and in vitro, and MT also increased piwil1 expression in vitro. In addition, E2 suppressed expression of piwil1 in vivo. These results indicated that the decreased or increased expression of piwil1 regulated by hormones might play a crucial role during gonadal differentiation and development in S. maximus.

AB Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a complex disorder with multiple pathogenic gene mutations. Protocadherin alpha 9 (PCDHA9) was identified as a potential candidate gene for HSCR by whole-exome sequencing in a Chinese family. Sanger sequencing in 298 HSCR cases revealed two sporadic Chinese patients with a novel missence PCDHA9 mutation (NM_031857; c.1280C > T[p.A1a427Val]) and one sporadic Chinese patient with another novel missence PCDHA9 mutation (c.1425C > G[p.Phe475Leu]). The silico predictions and 3D modeling suggest the deleterious effect of identified mutations on protein function. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed PCDHA9 was predominantly expressed in the myenteric plexus of human colon tissues. For mouse embryos, PCDHA9 was expressed in the stomach but rarely seen in the intestine during E10.5-12.5, then obviously expressed in the intestinal mucosa at E13.5 and extensively expressed in intestinal muscularis and mucosa at E14.5. Moreover, the down-regulation of PCDHA9 in the SH-SY5Y cell line promoted the proliferation and migration rate but inhibited the apoptotic rate. In summary, PCDHA9 is potentially related to HSCR and the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) may involve in the enteric nervous system (ENS) ontogeny.

AB Objective: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is constitutively expressed by vascular endothelium including glomerular endothelium. Functional polymorphisms, -786T > C (rs2070744) promoter variant, 27 bp VNTR (4b/a) in intron 4 and 894G > T (rs1799983) exon variant of eNOS are known to alter the eNOS expression and activity leading to altered NO levels and contribute to the development of vascular and renal disease risk. Thus it might have a role in SLE risk and development of glomerulonephritis. Hence, the present study is aimed to investigate the role of eNOS polymorphisms in South Indian SLE patients.
   Methods: Five hundred and four subjects (219 SLE cases and 285 controls) were included in the present case control study. Genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for -786T > C and 894G > T SNPs. Another, 4a4b variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism was genotyped using direct PCR method using primer pairs flanking the 27 bp direct repeat region in intron 4 of eNOS gene.
   Results: Our analysis revealed that intron 4 27 bp VNTR genotype frequency differ significantly between the SLE patients and controls (OR: 1.73, 95% CI %:1.18-2.54, P = 0.004). Further, "a allele" frequency was significantly higher in SLE patients as compared to the controls (20 vs. 13.8%) (OR: 1.56, 95%CI: 1.11-2.18, P = 0.01). However, promoter polymorphism -786T > C and missense variant 894G > T were not significantly different between the SLE cases and controls (OR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.64-1.33, P = 0.7 and OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 0.95-2.06, P = 0.095 respectively). Furthermore, no association was found between any of the three polymorphisms with lupus nephritis phenotype. Increased plasma nitrate levels were observed in SLE patients (36.79 +/- 2.83 mu M/L) as compared to healthy controls (28.53 +/- 1.94 mu M/L) (P = 0.01). In addition, the genotype-based simulations have indicated that combined effect of eNOS polymorphisms contribute to 30.5% variability in NO production.
   Conclusion: Results of the present study indicate that 27-bp VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of eNOS gene polymorphism may be the significant risk factor for SLE in south Indian subjects.

AB The swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) is among the most economically important seawater crustacean species in Asia. Despite its commercial importance and being well-studied status, genomic and transcriptomic data are scarce for this crab species. In the present study, limb bud tissue was collected at different developmental stages post amputation for transcriptomic analysis. Illumina RNA-sequencing was applied to characterise the limb regeneration transcriptome and identify the most characteristic genes. A total of 289,018 transcripts were obtained by clustering and assembly of clean reads, producing 150,869 unigenes with an average length of 956 bp. Subsequent analysis revealed WNT signalling as the key pathway involved in limb regeneration, with WNT4 a key mediator. Overall, limb regeneration appears to be regulated by multiple signalling pathways, with numerous cell differentiation, muscle growth, moult, metabolism, and immune-related genes upregulated, including WNT4, LAMA, FIP2, FSTL5, TNC, HUS1, SWI5, NCGL, SLC22, PLA2, Tdc2, SMOX, GDH, and SMPD4. This is the first experimental study done on regenerating claws of P. trituberculatus. These findings expand existing sequence resources for crab species, and will likely accelerate research into regeneration and development in crustaceans, particularly functional studies on genes involved in limb regeneration.

AB Background: Genome-wide linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing in a Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) family revealed that the SNP, rs539075, within intron 2 of the cadherin 2 gene (CDH2) co-segregated with the disease phenotype.
   Results: A study with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL +/- P) cases (N = 292) and controls (N = 287) established association of this SNP with NSCL +/- P as a risk factor. RT-PCR based expression analysis of the SNP-harbouring region of intron 2 of CDH2 in the clefted lip and/or palate tissues of 16 patients revealed that the mutant allele expressed in all those individuals having it (hetero-/homozygous), whereas the wild type allele expressed in < 50% of the samples in which it was present. The intronic transcript was also present in the prospective lip and palate region of 13.5 dpc mouse embryo, detected by RNA in situ hybridization and RT-PCR.
   Conclusions: These results including the in silico, characterization of the similar to 200 nt-intronic transcript showed that conformationally it fits best with noncoding small RNA, possibly a precursor of miRNA. Its function in the orofacial organogenesis remains to be elucidated which will enable us to define the role of this mutant ncRNA in the clefting of lip and palate.

AB Background: In this work, we examined the angiogenic function of microRNA-216b in an in vitro rat diabetic model of myocardial microvascular endothelial cells (MMECs).
   Methods: MMECs were extracted from Wistar rats (MMEC(WI)) or diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats (MMEC(GK)) and cultured in vitro. QRT-PCR was applied to compare miR-216b between MMEC(WI) and MMEC(GK). MiR-216b was downregulated in MMEC(GK). Its effects on angiogenic development, including invasion and proliferation, were evaluated. In MMEC(GK), putative miR-216b downstream target gene, frizzled class receptor 5 (FZD5), was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter, qRT-PCR and western blot assays, respectively. FZD5 was further downregulated in MMEC(GK) with stable miR-216b downregulation to evaluate its functional role in regulating diabetic angiogenesis.
   Results: MiR-216b was markedly overexpressed in MMEC(GK). MiR-216b downregulation significantly enhanced angiogenesis in MMEC(GK) by promoting invasion and proliferation. FZD5 was inversely upregulated in miR-216b-downregulated MMEC(GK). Subsequently, FZD5 downregulation suppressed angiogenic development, by inhibiting invasion and proliferation in miR-216b-downregulated MMEC(GK).
   Conclusion: MicroRNA-216b was overexposed in diabetic MMECs and its downregulation may actively enhance angiogenesis in diabetic angiopathy through inverse regulation on FZD5.

AB Ammonium is a major inorganic nitrogen source for tea plant growth and is mainly taken up and transported by ammonium transporters (AMTs). Here, we analyzed the NH4+ uptake kinetics of three tea cultivars, Longjing43 (LJ43), Zhongcha108 (ZC108) and Zhongcha302 (ZC302). The results revealed that ZC302 had a higher NH4+ uptake efficiency than the other two cultivars. The full CDS sequences of three Camellia sinensis ammonium transporter (CsAMT) genes, i.e., CsAMT1.1, CsAMT1.2 and CsAMT3.1, were cloned. Analysis of tissue-specific expression showed that CsAMT1.2 followed a root-specific expression pattern, while transcripts of CsAMT1.1 and CsAMT3.1 were mainly accumulated in leaves. The temporal course experiment on gene expression levels showed CsAMT1.1 and CsAMT3.1 followed a reciprocal expression pattern in leaves as CsAMT1.1 was up regulated by a short time (2 h, 6 h) nitrogen (N) supply both in the leaves and buds of LJ43 and ZC108; and the expression of CsAMT3.1 in leaves was increased by a long time (72 h) N supply, particularly in ZC302. Therefore, we inferred that CsAMT1.1 and CsAMT3.1 might play important roles in photorespiratory ammonium metabolism. The expression of CsAMT1.2 was extremely high in roots and can be greatly induced by N over a short period of time, especially in ZC302; thus, we concluded CsAMT1.2 might play an important role in ammonium uptake from soils in tea plant roots.

AB Introduction: Obesity is a serious health problem that leads to low quality of life and early mortality. To the purpose of prevention and gene therapy for such a worldwide disease, genome wide association study is a powerful tool for finding SNPs associated with increased risk of obesity. To conduct an association analysis, kernel machine regression is a generalized regression method, has an advantage of considering the epistasis effects as well as the correlation between individuals due to unknown factors.
   Materials and methods: In this study, information of the people who participated in Tehran cardio-metabolic genetic study was used. They were genotyped for the chromosomal region, evaluation 986 variations located at 16q12.2; build 38hg. Kernel machine regression and single SNP analysis were used to assess the association between obesity and SNPs genotyped data.
   Results: We found that associated SNP sets with obesity, were almost in the FTO (P = 0.01), AIKTIP (P = 0.02) and MMP2 (P = 0.02) genes. Moreover, two SNPs, i.e., rs10521296 and rs11647470, showed significant association with obesity using kernel regression (P = 0.02).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, significant sets were randomly distributed throughout the region with more density around the FTO, AIKTIP and MMP2 genes.
   Furthermore, two intergenic SNPs showed significant association after using kernel machine regression. Therefore, more studies have to be conducted to assess their functionality or precise mechanism.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant cancers in male and docetaxel is commonly used as an effective chemotherapeutic drug for PCa patients. However, docetaxel resistance inhibits the therapeutic effect of this agent, thus investigating the mechanism of chemoresistance to docetaxel of PCa may help to improve the prognosis of PCa patients. In our present study, we found that miR-223-3p was up-regulated in PCa cell lines (C4-2, LNCap, PC3, DU-145). Transfection with miR-223-3p inhibitor increased chemo-sensitivity to docetaxel and cell apoptosis rate in PCa cells compared with docetaxel + miR-223-3p mock group, especially in DU-145 cells which were more resistant to docetaxel. Bioinformatics study and luciferase reporter assay indicated that FOXO3 was a target of miR-223-3p and the results from western blot suggested that FOXO3 was negatively regulated by miR-223-3p. Further study revealed that up-regulation of FOXO3 by transfection with pCMV-FOXO3 decreased the IC50 values of docetaxel and increased cell apoptosis rate compared with docetaxel + pCMV-vector group, suggesting that overexpressed FOXO3 suppressed cell survival and sensitized PCa cells to docetaxel. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO3 abolished the effects of miR-223-3p inhibitor on chemo-sensitivity and apoptosis in PCa cells by increasing chemoresistance and decreasing cell apoptosis rate. Finally, the in vivo experiments showed that miR-223-3p inhibitor sensitized prostatic cancer mouse model to docetaxel by increasing the expression of FOXO3. In conclusion, our present study indicated that miR-223-3p regulated cell chemo-sensitivity by targeting FOXO3 in prostatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo, providing new potential therapeutic strategy for PCa treatment.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been the primary causative agent of cervical cancer, the most threatening cancer affecting millions of women worldwide. HPV, a small non enveloped DNA virus of high and low risk types contain intrinsically disordered region and it also plays significant role in the development of cervical cancer. HPV E7 contains an ordered Zinc finger motif that binds to pRB and alters its function. It utilizes both disordered N-terminal and structured C-terminal regions for cellular transformation. In this study, we have focused extensively on the evolutionary relationships of E7 among various HPV types and generated a 3D homology model of full length HPV 16 E7, since the structure have not been solved till date. We also analysed the stable conformation and atomic flexibility of modelled E7 through molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. To understand the disordered based binding sites of E7 oncoprotein, Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) analysis was carried out on the E7 oncoprotein. The validated model was taken forward for the identification of potential lead compounds and the most prominent compounds were selected for the molecular dynamics simulation of the 100 ns for the stability analysis. Overall, this study highlights the holistic E7 regions including important disordered based binding sites analysed through the MoRFs. The potential inhibitor compound that targets the structured C-terminal region of E7 oncoprotein were subjected for the pharmacological properties analysis and further validated for the binding modes of the compounds with the target structure. This study helps in providing a better intuition to develop a potent anti-HPV agent.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of I/D polymorphisms of ACE gene is associated with resistant hypertension and essential controlled hypertension.
   Results: Our results show that the homozygous mutant genotype DD was more represented among resistant than controlled (58.1% vs 41.9% respectively), however the homozygote wild was more represented among controlled than resistant (70.6% vs 29.4% respectively). But more heterozygous ID among controlled than resistant patients (63.6% vs 36.4% respectively). The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). Analysis of clinical parameters indicated that physical activity contributes to resistant hypertension (P < 0.05).
   Based on our findings, the homozygous mutant for DD of ACE gene is associated with resistant hypertension in our population. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the results of this study.

AB As a key member of the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily, CYP17 gene encodes 17a-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase that is critical for directing androgen synthesis. The CYP17 gene has been identified in several species, yet little is known about its distribution and expression profile during goose follicular development. In the present study, we obtained the full-length coding sequence of goose CYP17 (gCYP17) gene for the first time using RACE method. Its sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that gCYP17 was highly conserved with those of other birds and consisted of four main functional domains like other species. Results from immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting suggested that gCYP17 was predominantly located in theca interna throughout follicular development. Furthermore, levels of gCYP17 reached the maximum in theca layer of the 6-8 mm follicles which were significantly higher than in those of other follicles (P < 0.05). In addition, gCYP17 was expressed at much higher levels in the F4 theca layer than the F1 follicle (P < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicated that the fluctuating expression pattern and specific cellular localization of gCYP17 during follicular development might be closely related to androgen secretion, and thereby follicular maturation.

AB Aim: Life events are series of events that disrupt a person's psychological equilibrium and may enhance the development of a disorder such as suicide. Several studies have assessed a relationship between 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptor (5-HTR2A) gene polymorphisms with an increased risk of suicide. However, there has been no study about the association between three 5-HTR2A gene polymorphisms, A1438G (rs6311), T102C (rs6313) and C1354T (rs6314), suicide, stressful life, and loss events in a same time.
   Methods: Relatives of 191 suicide victims were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire designed according to Iranian culture. Venous blood was taken from all subjects for DNA isolation. 5-HTR2A polymorphisms in a total of 191 suicide victims and 218 healthy controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare genotype and allele frequencies between suicide and control groups. Correction for multiple comparisons was calculated using Bonferroni correction.
   Results: There was a significant association between the 102 C/C genotype of 5-HTR2A gene and suicide (R-2 = 8.700, P = 0.012). Furthermore, we found that suicide victims with a 102 C/C genotype had a significantly higher number of stressful life and loss events (P < 0.05). Genotype and allele distributions of A1438G (rs6311) and C1354T (rs6314) polymorphisms of 5-HTR2A gene showed no differences between suicide victims and control participants and there was no association between genotype distribution and higher number of stressful life and loss events (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that C102T (rs6313) polymorphism of 5-HTR2A gene may be involved in the susceptibility to suicide, higher number of stressful life and loss events, but A1438G (rs6311) and C1354T (rs6314) polymorphisms of 5-HTR2A gene were not associated with suicide, higher number of stressful life and loss events.

AB The presented study aims to experimentally investigate the sources of influence of exhaust gas recirculation on the tendency toward knock in the spark ignition engine. The three main sources of influence of exhaust gas recirculation on the engine tendency towards knock are known. The influence on flame propagation changes the profile of combustion and therefore the end-gas pressure and temperature profile. The thermal influence changes the thermal properties of the end-gas mixture and consequently its temperature profile, while the chemical influence changes the kinetic behaviour of the end-gas mixture. The study is based on the results from experimental setup with spark ignition engine that uses cooled exhaust gas recirculation system and air heater installed into the intake manifold. Experimental tests that employ a new approach were performed, where intake temperature is varied by air heater when engine is operated with different levels of exhaust gas recirculation. In this way the end-gas temperature and exhaust gas recirculation percentage were varied while the influence on flame propagation was partially compensated by the change of spark timing. The obtained results show that there is no clear chemical influence of the exhaust gases on the tendency towards knock as the cases with low and high levels of exhaust gas recirculation are all mixed when the temperature of the end-gas is set to the same values. This leads to the overall conclusion that the predominant factor in a tendency towards knock is the end-gas temperature profile.

AB In this study, alternative lignocellulosic biorefineries annexed to a typical sugarcane mill were investigated, to produce ethanol, lactic acid or methanol, or co-production of ethanol and lactic acid, all with surplus electricity for sale by conversion of sugarcane bagasse and harvesting residues (brown leaves) as accessible feedstock. In order to meet the energy demand of the sugar mill and biorefinery, burning a portion of feedstock or fossil source (coal) along with residues in the centralized combined heat and power unit were assumed as energy supplement strategies. A thorough Aspen Plus simulation was developed for each biorefinery scenario considering all required process units and supplementary units (i.e. combined heat and power, waste water treatment and evaporation). Furthermore, mass and energy balances along with costing data were applied to carry out techno-economic analysis, Monte Carlo finical risk study and life cycle assessment, in a multi-criteria desirability matrix. The lactic acid production biorefinery was found to be the most energy intensive process with highest chemical consumption and the highest conversion of biomass carbon input to products. Consumption of coal as an alternative source of energy enhanced the available biomass for valorization. Biorefineries with coal combustion producing ethanol or ethanol-lactic acid showed better environmental performance than methanol producing biorefineries, based on 1 ton of product. Although, the co-production of ethanol and lactic acid showed the largest likelihood of economic success, Methanol producing scenarios had a zero likelihood of an economic viability without substantial financial incentives or enhanced market prices.

AB Large-scale solar heating plants for district heating networks have gained great success in Europe, particularly in Denmark. A hybrid solar district heating plant with 5960 m(2) flat plate collectors and 4039 m(2) parabolic trough collectors in series was built in Taars, Denmark in 2015. The solar heating plant was used as a reference case in this study. A validated TRNSYS-GenOpt model was set up to optimize the key design parameters of the plant, including areas of both collector types, storage size, orientation of the parabolic trough collectors and so on. This study introduces a generic method to optimize the hybrid solar district heating systems based on levelized cost of heat. It is found that the lowest net levelized cost of heat of hybrid solar heating plants could reach about 0.36 DKK/kWh. The system levelized cost of heat can be reduced by 5-9% by use of solar collectors in the district heating network in this study. The results also show that parabolic trough collectors are economically feasible for district heating networks in Denmark. The generic and multivariable levelized cost of heat method can guide engineers and designers on the design, construction and control of large-scale solar heating plants.

AB Solar energy being intermittent in nature, can provide a sustainable, steady and high density energy source when converted into electrolytic hydrogen. However, in current photovoltaic market trend with 99% conventional single junction PV panels, this cannot be achieved efficiently and economically. The advent of the multi-junction solar cells (MJCs), with cell-efficiency exceeding 46%, has yet to receive wide spread acceptance in the current PV market in form of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system, because of its system design complexity, limiting its application scope and customers. The objective of this paper is to develop a low cost compact CPV system that will not only eliminate its application and installation related restrictions but it is also introducing a highly efficient and sustainable photovoltaic system for common consumer, to convert intermittent sunlight into green hydrogen. The developed CPV system negates the common conviction by showing two times more power output than the flat plate PV, in tropical region. In addition, sunlight to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 18% is recorded for CPV, which is two times higher than alone electricity production efficiency of flat plate PV.

AB Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) enable the integration of H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis and methanation reactions in a single reactor. The product gas may therefore potentially be sent directly to the existing natural gas pipelines. However, current power-to-methane (P2M) routes are not able to achieve acceptable CO2-to-CH4 conversion in a single SOEC reactor for direct integration into natural gas networks. In order to obtain higher CO2-to-CH4 conversions, a two-dimensional multiscale electro-thermo tubular SOEC model was developed to describe in detail the P2M processes along the whole cell and optimize the materials, flow modes, and operating conditions for CH4 production. The numerical simulations revealed that the stabilized Zr-based SOEC is unable to offer a sufficiently high electrochemical performance at methanation-favoring temperatures (250-650 degrees C). Such a temperature mismatch limits the peak CH4 production ratio in the tubular-stabilized Zr-based SOEC (with an inlet CO2 content of 20%) to only 13% at 1.5 V. In contrast, a tubular strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM)-based SOEC showed remarkable performance at or below 650 degrees C, improving the CH4 production ratio to over 50% at 550 degrees C and 1.3 V for the same inlet gas composition. However, the operating temperature was still too high to obtain an acceptable CO2-to-CH4 conversion for direct supply to natural gas pipelines. The model revealed that the H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis and methanation reactions can be synchronously enhanced by feeding a cold gas in counter-flow mode under pressurized conditions. At 29 bar, the tubular LSGM-based SOEC could achieve a CO2-to-CH4 conversion ratio of 98.7%, with an electricity-to-gas efficiency of 94.5% in the thermal neutral mode. The produced gas can be directly sent to the existing natural gas pipelines so that the curtailed renewable power can be stored more efficiently and utilized over a wider area.

AB In the present paper, a latent heat storage system using a heat-transfer enhancement technique has been built and tested. The potential of using a natural phase change material of Moroccan provenance for energy storage was studied by experimental analysis. The enhanced heat transfer surface of the compact finned-tube heat exchanger presents geometric complications. Therefore, a new method based on equivalent circular fin efficiency for the calculation of the effective heat transfer surface area was developed and applied to the system under study. In order to carry out the performance analysis for this innovative system, charging and discharging experiments were conducted for different heat transfer fluid flow rates. It was found that increasing the flow rate from 0.2 to 1 l/min divides melting time by 2.5 and solidification time by four. The average effectiveness was calculated for each flow rate and was proven to decrease during charging from 0.95 for a flow rate of 0.2 l/min to 0.63 for 1 l/min. Likewise, increasing flow rate from 0.2 to 1 l/min for discharging process decreases heat exchanger effectiveness from 0.99 to 0.7. The combination of the effectiveness-number of transfer units method with the procedure that was developed to compute the effective heat transfer area lead to derive an empirical correlation. This equation was used to compare the finned-tube compact storage system with other heat and cold storage units. The comparison showed that the present system displayed satisfactory results. The second use of the correlation was to design, through a case study, a heat storage system suitable for solar domestic hot water production in a residential building.

AB Microalgal biomass is the third-generation promising feedstock for production of biofuel and other valuable goods. The raw microalgal biomass and residues have low calorific value, high moisture, and high H/C and O/C atomic ratio which not suitable to use as solid fuel and many engineering applications. Torrefaction is a promising technique to upgrade microalgal biomass closed to solid coal properties by increasing the calorific value of microalgal biochar. However, the overview of torrefaction process for microalgal biochar is lacking in the literature study. Thus, an overview of recent dry and wet torrefaction of microalgal biomass is presented in this review. Wet torrefaction is a new technology for microalgal biochar production because it has some advantages compare with other pre-treatment methods. Besides, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research for fuel property of microalgal biochar after torrefaction process. Different torrefaction temperature, gases and holding time lead to various solid yield, energy yield and calorific value of biochar are comprehensively discussed. In addition, the used of microalgal biochar as bio-adsorbent to remove pollutants in wastewater are included as well. In short, this is a comprehensive summary of recent torrefaction technology for microalgal biochar as fuel.

AB Energy management and optimization play a key effect in the sustainable development. However, the uncertain data has a direct impact on the production prediction and energy optimization of complex petrochemical industries. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel energy management and optimization model based on the fuzzy extreme learning machine (FELM) method integrated the fuzzy set theory. The minimal, the median and the maximal values of the energy consumption data are obtained by data fuzzification to solve the problem of the fluctuation and uncertainty data. And the cross recombination of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) is applied in the training of the FELM. Moreover, the upper and the lower limits of efficiency values are obtained on the basis of the network generalization to analyze the energy conservation and saving potentials. Furthermore, the FELM has better predictive performance and training speed than fuzzy error back propagation network (FBP) and fuzzy radical basis function network (FRBF) though University of California Irvine (UCI) standard datasets. Finally, the proposed method is applied to manage and optimize the energy status of China ethylene industry in complex petrochemical industries. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and applicable in the energy-saving potential, which is indicated up to about 15%.

This model helps in ascertaining the influence of temperature on their performance of building integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BiPVT) system. The theoretically calculated results are experimentally validated in outdoor ambient environment. The electrical & thermal efficiencies are calculated for both high and low mass flow rate of water, <(m)over dot>(w). Daily average electrical efficiency of photovoltaic modules; m-Si, p-Si, a-Si, CdTe and CIGS with and without water flow are found to be 12.30%, 10.98%, 6.08%, 6.60% and 7.71%, and 11.41%, 10.30%, 5.86%, 6.26% and 6.99% respectively. In constant room temperature mode, variation in mass flow rate of water, rh is also evaluated. Overall thermal efficiency and overall exergy for all photovoltaic modules in both cases are also calculated. The characteristic equations of photovoltaic modules integrated on test cells are also developed for both cases.

Two grid-connected systems based on multi-crystalline: me-Si and two other ones based on thin film technology namely copper indium selenium; CIS modules. The monitoring data have been collected for one year to make an evaluation of all possible changes in climate environment. The goal of this study is to define the characteristics, the behavior and the sensitivity of the grid-connectedPV system to the environmental parameters. Various parameters were used for the outdoor performance evaluation of the four grid-connected PV systems; including performance ratio, temperature losses, final yield, reference yield, AC energy generated and system efficiency. It was found that the grid-connected PV systems based on me-Si technology perform much better than the systems based on CIS.
   The annual average daily performance ratios of the systems based on me-Si modules were found to be about 5.53% higher compared to those of the systems based on CIS module, and an annual average daily AC energy production about 42.85% higher than CIS.

AB An integrated combined cooling, heating and power process is investigated and analyzed by advanced exergy cost analysis method. In this process molten carbonate fuel cell, gas turbine and Stirling engine are used for providing the required power (6482 kW). A double effect H2O-Li/Br absorption refrigeration cycle supplies 980 kW cooling. Fuel cell exhaust heat is used to drive Stirling engine and absorption chiller. Also, gas turbine exhaust heat is used to produce steam for heating (2136.6 kW). The main result extracted from the endogenous and exogenous parts shows that cost interactions between the equipment in this hybrid system is not strong. Heat exchangers investment cost and exergy destruction cost are avoidable and unavoidable respectively, while opposite behavior is exhibited by the compressors. From avoidable exergy destruction cost point of view, compressor C-1 and from avoidable investment cost point of view, heat exchangers have high improvement potential. Also effects of key parameters on the exergoeconomic factor and exergy destruction cost rate are studied through the sensitivity analysis. Finally, three strategies are recommended for removing the inefficient costs and improving the system performance.

AB Our goal in this study was to design a hydrogen supply network to efficiently produce and manage hydrogen in case future hydrogen demand increases. Sludge from wastewater treatment plants can be converted into biogas using an anaerobic digestion process, and the generated biogas can be transformed into biomethane by amine technology as a biogas upgrading method. A cascade of four-associated technologies (COFAT) is developed in the proposed model as biomethane is converted into hydrogen by employing a biomethane-based steam reforming process. The suggested COFAT system which is not dependent on fossil fuels is integrated with a conventional steam methane reforming process and harnesses large amounts of hydrogen. Hydrogen management is performed using a hydrogen storage tank to meet regional hydrogen demand, and a hydrogen transport network is constructed using pipelines to transfer hydrogen between different regions. A dual-objective two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program was used as a mathematical model to minimize the costs and downside risk simultaneously, and uncertain hydrogen demand conditions were included. A case study of the Gyeongsang-do province in the Republic of Korea was used in the proposed model, a 24% reduction in the total costs and a reduction of 94 tons of CO2 eq of carbon emission per day were realized for the proposed hydrogen supply network assuming the present hydrogen purchase price of 3.5 US$ per kg. We believe that the results provide reasonable solutions for the construction of a future hydrogen supply network.

AB Hypersonic vehicle has become one of the research focuses because of its broad application prospects. The power supply issue in the long range/endurance of hypersonic propulsion system turns out to be one of the most important targets. Because the conventional power supply devices cannot meet the demands of a long range hypersonic air-breathing flight. In this work, a new scheme based on the expansion of high temperature cracked hydrocarbon fuel is proposed to solve the power generation problem. An analytical model for the expansion characteristics of the high temperature cracked hydrocarbon fuel is developed and validated by experiment data. The experimental results show that positive output work can be obtained with fuel working temperature even as low as 800 K and increases with fuel temperature. It also shows that the expansion work doing capability of cracked hydrocarbon fuel is much larger than the un-cracked fuel and greatly influenced by the fuel temperature, especially at the cracking temperature range. Especially, both experimental and calculation results show that the pressure also affects the high temperature thermal cracked hydrocarbon fuel expansion capability through influencing pyrolysis pathway of fuel and corresponding cracked components. The sensitivity analysis shows that the expansion work doing capability of fuel is more sensitive to the fuel temperature, especially at the hydrocarbon fuel pyrolysis starting and rapid increasing temperature region which is from 785 K to 855 K.

AB The aim of this study is to elucidate the transient behavior of thermodynamic variables in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) upon electrical load change, which can be used for optimizing cell microstructure and developing a reliable SOFC stack design. To overcome the insufficient durability and large performance degradation, SOFC technologies still need reliable cell microstructure and stack design prior to their market deployment. This is of significant concerns when considering actual operating conditions, in particular, sudden and severe electrical load change. Enhancing the dynamic stability of SOFC is essential to improve its durability under the electrical load change. To meet the needs, the local thermodynamic state and thermo-fluid environment should be examined in detail, which requires high-fidelity numerical simulations. In this study, a physical model is developed to resolve temporally and spatially reactions and transport phenomena taking place inside planar, anode-supported SOFC stacks. The model is validated by using in-house experimental measurements of a current response profile upon electrical load change. Then, the dynamic response of thermodynamic variables upon electrical load change is investigated by assuming potentiodynamic conditions. The results of this study show that the electrical current responds excessively to the potential steps and recovers its magnitude asymptotically to the quasi-steady state. A relaxation time is needed for its dynamic response and recovery. This is explained by the time-dependent variation of the electrochemical reaction zone and species transport in the anode. The former reacts quickly to electrical load change, influencing the hydrogen concentration, while the latter shows time-delay, affecting the diffusion of hydrogen between the reaction zone and fuel channel. The time-delay required for the response of hydrogen diffusion corresponds to the relaxation time needed for the electrical current response. These results indicate that the overall transient behavior is predominantly governed by species diffusion in the anode. The pressure field also shows similar trend of time-dependent variations, whereas the temperature does not change as much as other variables, implying that it needs much longer time to adjust itself to a new operating condition.

AB Second-order and third-order models are the two main methods for Stirling cycle analysis. A second-order one has relatively reliable accuracy without detailed cyclic information, while a third-order one provides relatively comprehensive operational information with uncertainty. In this work, a third-order model, Sage, is tried to be improved by a second-order model, Improved Simple Analytical Model, and 100 W beta-type Stirling engine is used as a modelling prototype engine. As suggested by Improved Simple Analytical Model, the gap of the piston seal and the empirical multiplier for heat transfer of cooler in Sage should be adjusted. This is accomplished by combining these two models so that the effects of seal leakage loss, gas spring hysteresis loss, and piston friction loss could be considered in an improved Sage. The improved Sage indicates that the overall relative errors for the indicated power output and the thermal efficiency are reduced by over 30 percentage points and 20 percentage points, respectively. Pressure-volume diagrams provided by the improved Sage are much closer to the experimental ones, and the pattern similarities of pressure-volume diagrams increase from 78.6-81.4% to 80.8-85.0%. Performance simulation of the Stirling engine is carried out by the improved Sage and the results show that regenerator takes a major role in improving the performance of the 100 W beta-type Stirling engine. Lengths of regenerator, heater and cooler are optimized for the maximum indicated power output and the maximum thermal efficiency respectively, and the optimized values are increased by 15.9% and 25.2%, respectively.

AB The supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) Brayton cycle with high temperature thermal energy storage is proposed to efficiently utilize solar thermal energy. A molten halide salt (mixture of 8.1 wt.%NaCl + 31.3 wt.%KCl + 60.6 wt. %ZnCl2) that can operate at a relatively high temperature is selected as a heat transfer fluid (HTF) and a storage medium. The proposed two-stage recompression Brayton cycle is used as power block to make full use of high-level solar energy and reduce power consumption. The thermodynamic performances and economic assessments are investigated to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed system, and the comparison between halide salt and nitrate salt is conducted. Theoretical results show that the solar-to-electric efficiency in the system with halide salt reaches to 19.16-22.03% in four representative days, which is higher than existing concentrated solar power plants with the tower central receiver, and the monthly averaged solar-to-electric efficiency of the halide salt system is increased by 11% as compared with the nitrate salt system. Research findings introduce a promising approach for the efficient utilization of the abundant solar resources in western China.

AB Biohydrogen production is considered as one of the most promising alternative processes to produce hydrogen due to its effectiveness, renewability, and environmental friendliness compared to the conventional way, such as thermochemical and electrochemical methods. Biohydrogen production via photofermentation produces hydrogen by photo-decomposing organic matters through the nitrogenase of photosynthetic bacteria. Despite its advantages, high energy requirement during nitrogenase-catalyzed reaction and low biohydrogen production efficiencies in the reality have become the foremost concern in a large scale application of photofermentation. Thus, an improvement of biohydrogen yield and light conversion efficiency is necessary to increase the feasibility of photofermentation. One of the simplest ways to improve photofermentation is by adding suitable chemical enhancer. Various studies have shown that an addition of some chemicals, such as iron, molybdenum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), vitamins, buffer solution, and others chemicals could increase the biohydrogen production rates and yields by a significant value. However, an addition of other chemicals, such as nickel ions, diphenylene iodonium, dimethylsulphoxide, and copper ions, might cause an adverse effect on the process. Addition of EDTA, molybdenum, ethanol or yeast may inhibit the photofermentation process, depending on the type of bacteria and substrates used during photofermentation process, as well as the concentration of the added chemicals. Hence, the importance and effects of chemicals addition on photofermentative biohydrogen production were discussed in this review paper.

AB The demand for better hygiene has increased the need for developing more effective sanitation systems and facilities for the safe disposal of human urine and faeces. Non-Sewered Sanitary systems are considered to be one of the promising alternative solutions to the existing flush toilet system. An example of these systems is the Nano Membrane Toilet (NMI) system being developed at Cranfleld University, which targets the safe disposal of human waste while generating power and recovering water. The NMT will generate energy from the conversion of human waste with the use of a micro-combustor; the heat produced will power a Stirling engine connected to a linear alternator to generate electricity. This study presents a numerical investigation of the thermodynamic analysis and operational characteristics of a quasi steady state model of the gamma type Stirling engine integrated into a combustor in the back end of the NMT system. The effects of the working gas, at different temperatures, on the Stirling engine performance are also presented. The results show that with the heater temperature of 390 degrees C from the heat supply via conduction at 820 W from the flue gas, the Stirling engine generates a daily power output of 27 Wh/h at a frequency of 23.85 Hz.

AB This paper presents a general thermodynamic model for hybrid Brayton central tower thermosolar plants. These plants have been proved to be technically feasible but research and development efforts need to be done in order to improve its commercial interest. From the thermodynamic viewpoint it is necessary to increase its performance to get larger power production with reduced fuel consumption, and so reduced emissions. A model for multi-step compression and expansion is developed with that aim. The model is flexible and allows to simulate recuperative or non-recuperative plants, with an arbitrary number of stages and working with different sub critical fluids. The results for multi-step configurations are compared with those obtained for a plant with one turbine and one compressor. Different working fluids are analyzed, including air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium. Several plant layouts and the corresponding optimal pressure ratios are analyzed. Configurations with two-stages compression with intercooling combined with one or two expansion stages can significantly improve overall plant efficiency and lower fuel consumption. Power block efficiencies can reach 0.50 and overall plant efficiency can attain values about 0.40 working with air or carbon dioxide. For instance, comparing with a single-stage plant running with air, a plant working with subcritical carbon dioxide and two compression stages with intercooling can reach an overall efficiency about 19% larger and a fuel conversion rate around 23% larger. For such configuration, the specific fuel consumption is predicted to be about 108 kg/(MW h) at design point conditions.

AB The energy demand worldwide has increased significantly with the increase in population. This is because energy is needed in almost every activity. For example, in industry, working, cleaning, transportation and commuting from one place to another. The majority of energy being used is obtained from fossil fuels, which are not renewable resources and require a longer time to recharge or return to its original capacity. Energy from fossil fuels is cheaper but it faces some challenges compared to renewable energy resources. Thus, one of the most potential candidates to fulfill the energy requirements are renewable resources and the most environmentally friendly fuel is hydrogen (H-2). Hydrogen exists mostly in plant materials and is not readily available in nature. It is necessary to produce hydrogen from available feedstock (water), which covers 70% of the earth. Moreover, hydrogen under standard pressure and temperature has an important merit; it can be obtained from renewable resources. Although, currently it is produced from fossil fuels. Hydrogen as a fuel is nonmetallic, non-toxic and can generate higher energy than gasoline on a mass basis. However, to employ hydrogen as a fuel, extensive research is essential to investigate and design on-board applications. Also, the cost of producing hydrogen (renewable) is expensive compared to gasoline (fossil). Thus, the production of H-2 from renewable resources and from fossil fuels requires tremendous effort. One of these efforts is to generate H-2 from biofuels as it is considered a promising technique that can help manage hydrogen from food waste. In addition, hydrogen storage materials are still lacking in both volumetric and gravimetric density. In this review, the key challenges that hydrogen industry are confronting are introduced and highlighted to facilitate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy.

AB In this study, we introduce a low-cost, efficient, porous catalytic material produced from chicken manure by pyrolysis (i.e., chicken manure biochar) for converting waste cooking oil into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME, i.e., biodiesel) via transesterification. Chicken manure can be pyrolysed at different temperatures (350, 450, 550, and 660 degrees C), and the properties of the resulting biochar are dependent on the temperature at which the biochar is made. The biochar in our study contained a large amount of inorganic compounds (mostly CaCO3) that expedite the catalytic activity during the transesterification of waste cooking oil, Compared to SiO2, the chicken manure biochar lowered the transesterification reaction temperature at which the highest FAME yield (95%) was achieved (350 degrees C). However, despite the catalytic effect of CaCO3 in the chicken manure biochar, undesirable thermal cracking of FAME occurred. To avoid this, the mass ratio of silica to chicken manure biochar was optimised. The optimal mass ratio of silica to chicken manure biochar was found to be less than 0.8. This study suggests an environmentally benign biodiesel production process that recycles organic waste such as chicken manure.

AB This work addresses a novel and green process for the co-production of lignin and oligosaccharides from rapeseed meal, examining the effects of the temperature (150-210 degrees C), reaction time (0-60 min) and catalyst amount (1-4 mol/L, CH3COOH) on the process. The yields to gas, liquid and solid varied by 0-18%, 22-64% and 34-74%, respectively. The solid consisted of high purity lignin (26-88 wt.%) together with unreacted cellulose (0-28 wt.%), hemicellulose (0-28 wt.%) and proteins (11-28 wt.%). Increasing the temperature and/or reaction time produced an increase in the liquid yield and a decrease in the solid yield due to the solubilisation of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic contents of the feedstock. Acetic acid exerted a positive catalytic effect, promoting the solubilisation of cellulose and hemicellulose and preventing humins formation. The relative amounts (wt.%) of C, H, O and N in the solid fraction shifted between 46-63, 5.8-6.4, 28-42 and 2-6, respectively. Py-GC/MS analysis revealed that the solid decomposed into phenols (1-19%), sugars (0-15%), N-compounds (0-31%), carboxylic acids (37-75%), hydrocarbons (4-20%) and furans (1-8%). The liquid phase comprised oligo-and mono/di-saccharides (33-51 C-wt.%, 0-3 C-wt.% and 0-6 C-wt.%) and carboxylic acids (40-62 C-wt.%). The progressive solubilisation of cellulose and hemicellulose produced an increase in the proportion of C together with a decrease in the amounts of H and O in the solid product, which also accounted for the increase and decrease observed in the proportions of phenols and sugars, respectively. An optimum was found at 186 C using an acid concentration of 1 mol/L and a total reaction time of 2 min. These conditions maximise the solubilisation of cellulose and hemicellulose without altering the lignin content of the solid; thus allowing the selective and simultaneous production of high purity (85 wt.%) lignin together with a rich oligossacharide (51 C-wt.%) solution. The acid can be recovered from the sugar mixture, which not only improves the efficiency of the process but also allows the production of a pure saccharide (92 C-wt.%) product.

AB H-2 is regarded as one of the cleanest future energy carrier that can be generated from renewable sources and will give rise to a reduction of CO2 emissions and environmental problems related to the use of petroleum based feedstock. Thus, the thermochemical routes from biomass for sustainable H-2 production compared to other biomass treatment routes have a great potential for its industrial implementation. Gasification of biomass and reforming of the bio-oil produced by biomass pyrolysis are the most researched pathways, although some studies dealing with supercritical water gasification and bio-oil gasification can also be found in the literature. Nevertheless, pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming strategy is gaining great attention due to its advantages compared to gasification and bio-oil reforming, especially those related to the optimization of each step (pyrolysis and catalytic steps) and bio-oil feeding. This review deals with the different reactor configurations, operating conditions and catalysts used in each process and compares the different alternatives in terms of H-2 production, with emphasis placing on the advantages of the two-step strategy.

AB The fracture-filled gas hydrate commonly occurs in marine fine-grained sediments and the fracture of rock in permafrost regions. Gas production from fracture-filled methane hydrate by the CO2 replacement method has been investigated. The reservoir condition of permafrost-associated gas hydrate in Muri Basin, Qilian Mountains was taken as an example to set up the experimental parameters. CO2, CO2/N-2 (3:1) and CO2/N-2 (1:3) were selected for gas replacement. Based on the results from six sets of laboratory experiments, we can learn that the factors affecting gas replacement included gas composition for replacement, pressure and the morphology of the hydrate. When the pressure was lower than the equilibrium pressure of CO2/N-2 binary hydrate and the equilibrium pressure of methane hydrate, there was a rapid decomposition process of methane hydrate and might be a transient water freezing process at the first few minutes. The ice around methane hydrate might inhibit the further decomposition of methane hydrate. A higher replacement rate and accumulative methane recovery ratio can be obtained when the morphology of methane hydrate was well distributed thin layer, which could be obtained with the ice layer by gradually increasing its temperature. The thin layer of hydrate is the main morphology of the fracture-filled gas hydrate found in the Qilian Mountain permafrost. Therefore, the gas production from hydrate by CO2/N-2 (3:1) replacement might be a good choice for gas production from hydrate in Muri Basin, Qilian Mountain.

AB A novel system consisting of an external heat source, a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC), a regenerator and an air standard Otto cycle engine is proposed to improve the performance of the DC-SOFC. Considering the electrochemical/chemical reactions, ionic/electronic charge transport, mass/momentum transport and heat transfer, a 2D tubular DC-SOFC model shows that the overall heat released in the cell can be smaller than, equal to or larger than the heat required by the internal Boudouard reaction. Three different operating modes of the proposed system are identified, and accordingly, analytical expressions for the equivalent power output and efficiency of the proposed system are derived under different operating conditions. The modeling results show that the Otto heat engine can effectively recover the waste heat from the DC-SOFC for additional power production especially at large operating current density. Comprehensive parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of the different operating conditions of DC-SOFC on its performance and heat generation. The effects of compression ratio, internal irreversibility factor and power dissipation of the Otto heat engine on the system performance improvement are also studied.

AB The paper is part of the development of a novel underwater isothermal Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system. Compared to conventional CAES plant, the performances of this system only depend on the electrical energy required for a round-trip cycle; performances of each sub-system of the power conversion process takes part of the overall efficiency. Consequently, this work is focused on an optimal energy management of the electrical power conversion system driving the isothermal hydro-pneumatic mechanism enabling the air compression/expansion. After examining inherent characteristics of conversion components challenging the overall conversion efficiency, we propose an efficient platform layout based on the segmentation of the energy conversion multiplying power conversion systems with different power ranges. Then, we establish control laws required by the electrical multi-machines system in order to drive pumping systems closed to their best efficiency points. However, these laws subject the conversion platform to a transient and variable operating needing the design of robust controller structures. Finally, we develop a dynamic reversible modelling of the multi-physic conversion platform along with the control scheme. The layout is modelled on Matlab Simulink environment and the paper closes with simulation results. We evaluate the dynamic performances of the compressed air storage system in both storage and production mode. Moreover, the effectiveness of power segmentation for the grid integration of the proposed system is discussed.

AB Glycerol carbonate (GC), an oxygenated fuel additive was synthesized from oversupplied glycerol in transesterification with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over fishmeal biochar. Fishmeal was carbonized at various temperatures (550-750 degrees C). The most suitable carbonization temperature based on GC yield was utilized in transesterification. Biochar was characterized to investigate textural and basic properties and surface functional groups. Thermal treatment, methanol washing, and solvent addition techniques were adopted to investigate biochar reusability after each reuse. At the most suitable reaction conditions of 85 degrees C, 2 wt% catalyst dosage, and DMC-to-glycerol molar ratio of 2, 99.5% GC yield and complete conversion of glycerol were attained over biochar carbonized at 650 degrees C. Strong basicity of biochar initiated decarboxylation reaction, which resulted in formation of glycidol (0.5%). Addition of methanol without catalyst treatment after each reuse sustained GC yield of 93% at the end of fifth reuse.

Manage. 163 (2018) 13-21]. Normally, activation energy is obtained from a model-free method which is then used to evaluate the reaction mechanism using master plots and finally Arrhenius pre-exponential factor is estimated. In the original paper, the pre-exponential factors were obtained directly from the model-free methods such as Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) without specifying reaction mechanism. The estimated pre-exponential factors were then used to evaluate the thermodynamic behavior of Chinese Liquor-industry waste during pyrolysis. A confusion was created which needed further discussion for the readers.

AB The sine cosine algorithm (SCA), a recently proposed population-based optimization algorithm, is based on the use of sine and cosine trigonometric functions as operators to update the movements of the search agents. To optimize performance, different parameters on the SCA must be appropriately tuned. Setting such parameters is challenging because they permit the algorithm to escape from local optima and avoid premature convergence. The main drawback of the SCA is that the parameter setting only affects the exploitation of the prominent regions. However, the SCA has good exploration capabilities. This article presents an enhanced version of the SCA by merging it with particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO exploits the search space better than the operators of the standard SCA. The proposed algorithm, called ASCA-PSO, has been tested over several unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions, which show its superiority over the SCA and other recent and standard meta-heuristic algorithms. Moreover, to verify the capabilities of the SCA, the SCA has been used to solve the real-world problem of a pairwise local alignment algorithm that tends to find the longest consecutive substrings between two biological sequences. Experimental results provide evidence of the good performance of the ASCA-PSO solutions in terms of accuracy and computational time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models treat the decision-making units (DMUs) as black boxes: inputs enter the system and outputs exit the system, with no consideration for the intermediate steps characterizing the DMUs. As a result, intermediate measures are lost in the process of changing the inputs to outputs and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to provide individual DMU managers with specific information on what part of a DMU is responsible for the overall inefficiency. This study defines a two-stage DEA model, where each DMU is composed of two sub-DMUs in series, the intermediate products by the sub-DMU in Stage 1 are partly consumed by the sub-DMU in Stage 2, and the initial inputs of the DMU can be freely allocated in both stages. Also, there are additional inputs directly consumed in Stage 2 while part of the outputs of Stage I are final outputs. We develop four new linear models to determine the upper and lower bounds of the efficiencies of the two sub-DMUs in a non-cooperative setting and a linear model to calculate the overall efficiency of DMU in a cooperative setting. That is, the overall efficiency of a DMU is modelled in a cooperative setting via upper and lower bounds obtained in the non-cooperative one. The proposed two-stage DEA method allows for important applications to several management areas. A case study in the banking industry is presented to demonstrate the applicability and exhibit the efficacy of the proposed models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of NaOH and NaCl on the rheology and gel properties of hen egg white were investigated. As the concentration of NaOH increased, egg white gel exhibited lower opacity and particle turbidity with coincidental increase in zeta potential, while the addition of NaCl resulted in the formation of opaque egg white gel and increase of surface hydrophobicity, particle turbidity and zeta potential. Rheological tests showed that alkali treatment will affect the unfolding state of egg white proteins during the heat stage while NaCl addition can inhibit the unfolding of egg white proteins. The results of correlation analysis indicated that random coil and alpha-helix were in good correlation with gel textural properties. Therefore, the rheology and gel properties of alkali/salt-induced egg white dispersions were closely related to the changes in surface hydrophobicity, molecule surface charge, and protein secondary structure.

AB A procedure based on liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and phase separation using magnetically stirred salt-induced high-temperature liquid-liquid extraction (PS-MSSI-HT-LLE) was developed to extract and pre-concentrate ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and enrofloxacin (ENRO) from animal food samples before electroanalysis. Firstly, simple LLE was used to extract the fluoroquinolones (FQs) from animal food samples, in which dilution was performed to reduce interference effects to below a tolerable threshold. Then, adapted PS-MSSI-HT-LLE protocols allowed re-extraction and further pre-concentration of target analytes in the diluted acid samples for simultaneous electrochemical quantification at low concentration levels. To improve the peak separation, in simultaneous detection, a baseline-corrected second-order derivative approach was processed. These approaches allowed quantification of target FQs from animal food samples spiked at levels of 0.80 to 2.00 mu mol L-1 in chicken meat, with recovery values always higher than 80.5%, as well as in milk samples spiked at 4.00 mu mol L-1, with recovery values close to 70.0%.

AB Production of sparkling wines involve a second alcoholic fermentation and contact with yeast less over an extended period of time, which influences the aroma composition and sensory quality of the resulting wines. Sparkling wines obtained with two yeast strains inoculated as free cells, immobilized in alginate bed and bioimmobilized as biocapsules, were aged during 32 months. Among the volatile compounds, high Odor Activity Values were obtained with isoamyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, hexanol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, decanal, octanoic acid, decanoic acid and TDN. Taken together these contribute more than 70% of the overall aromatic series value. Although some results rely more on the yeast strain than the inoculation format, specific aroma compounds were associated with the immobilization format, allowing the classification of sparkling wines by PCA. As a result the aroma quality of sparkling wines could be improved using immobilized yeasts.

AB Optimization process is an important aspect in the natural product extractions. Herein, an alternative approach is proposed for the optimization in extraction, namely, the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE). The approach combines the Latin hypercube sampling, the feasible range of independent variables, the Monte Carlo simulation, and the threshold criteria of response variables. The GLUE method is tested in three different techniques including the ultrasound, the microwave, and the supercritical CO2 assisted extractions utilizing the data from previously published reports. The study found that this method can: provide more information on the combined effects of the independent variables on the response variables in the dotty plots; deal with unlimited number of independent and response variables; consider combined multiple threshold criteria, which is subjective depending on the target of the investigation for response variables; and provide a range of values with their distribution for the optimization.

AB The goal of this project was to create hydrogels, a type of soluble biopolymer delivery system to encapsulate flavored nanoemulsions that are released under artificial saliva conditions. Low methoxyl (LM) pectin and whey protein isolate (WPI) at pH 4.0 were used to form the hydrogels at a ratio of 4:1 (w/w), respectively. Orange oil, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and WPI were used to make stable nanoemulsions loaded with flavor oil. The nanoemulsions were encapsulated into hydrogels with a mean diameter of 768 +/- 36 nm. The ability of the hydrogels to encapsulate the orange oil and release the flavor in the presence of artificial saliva was determined using size distribution data, confocal microscopy, and the release of limonene as assessed by solid-phase microextraction using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that the encapsulation of flavor nanoemulsions in filled hydrogels reduces the release of limonene.

AB In this work, we report the phytochemical profile and antioxidant activity of caper berries (Capparis spinosa L.) before and after a fermentation process. The phytochemical profiles were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn). Twenty-one compounds were characterized, and seven of them quantified. The main component of non-fermented berries was glucocapparin, which was degraded upon the fermentation process. Most of the compounds were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins. The main differences observed upon the fermentation process were a decrease in epicatechin concentration, the hydrolysis of quercetin glycosides, and the degradation of glucosinolates. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as the antioxidant activities by the in vitro antioxidant assays DPPH and ABTS(.+), were determined, observing that the values were slightly higher after the fermentation process.

AB Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) and its extracts have been frequently reported as possessing bioactive properties, offering the potential for use in development/enrichment of food products with additional functional capabilities, providing health benefits to consumers. The antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activity of lemon balm extract, as well as its potential hepatotoxicity were thoroughly evaluated. The extracts were then incorporated into cupcakes and their preserving effect, chemical composition, colour parameters and antioxidant activity were compared with those provided by potassium sorbate. In general, the variables with the largest differences among different storage times were energy level, sucrose, glucose, palmitic acid (C6:0) and oleic acid (C18:1n9). On the other hand, L* (top), a* (top), b* (top), pH, capric acid (C10:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) showed the greatest variation according to cupcake formulation. The results observed indicate that the lemon balm extract rich in rosmarinic acid can provide advantageous functional properties to bakery products.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prosopis alba exudate gum (G) as encapsulating matrix component on water-solid interactions, physical state, oxidative damage and appearance properties of alginate-chitosan encapsulates containing fish oil. With this purpose, water sorption isotherms were obtained at 25 degrees C. G increased the hygroscopicity of encapsulates, showing a higher monolayer water content (7.87 +/- 0.47% db.) than control (1.07 +/- 0.04% db.). G introduction reduced the plasticizing effect of water, increasing the a(w) range (a(w) < 0.45) at which samples were in amorphous state and providing the highest protection against lipid oxidation. Appearance properties (chromatic and optical) were affected by hydration and were better maintained in samples containing G at a(w) > 0.52. These results allow considering Prosopis alba exudate gum, as a novel excipient to protect fish oil encapsulated in low moisture polyelectrolyte systems, with the added benefits of employing an undervalued natural resource.

AB An untargeted metabolomics approach based on HRMS has been applied to Colombian green coffee to develop a discrimination model to highlight the most differential compounds. For this purpose, 41 green coffee samples of different genotypes collected from 5 regions were analysed. Samples were extracted with aqueous and organic solvents to cover a wide range of compounds. Sample extracts were randomly injected and data were preprocessed with XCMS software. PCA was used to verify quality control samples behaviour, and PLS-DA and DDSIMCA were employed to create models for discrimination using VIP variable selection method. Thirteen different compounds correctly separate green coffee samples according to their origin, several related to the quality and health benefits of coffee. Model validation was achieved using both cross-validation and an additional set with coffee samples from different harvest year. The results reveal that UHPLC-(Q) ToF MS-based metabolomics is a suitable tool to develop food origin discrimination strategies.

AB Proanthocyanidins with different structures were prepared from three condensed tannin-rich plant materials and then characterized using HPLC-ESI-MS coupled with thiolysis and MALDI-TOF MS. Their effects on acrylamide formation in asparagine-glucose models and fried potato crisps were determined. Results showed that all proanthocyanidins significantly and dose dependently mitigated acrylamide formation at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mu g/mL in chemical model system. Using the food model, acrylamide formation were inhibited when potato crisps were soaked in 0.01-1 mg/mL proanthocyanidin solutions for 15 min at room temperature before frying. Proanthocyanidins reduced up to 44.2% of the acrylamide level as concentration was increased to 0.1 mg/mL, whereas higher concentration resulted in a decrease of inhibition. B-type proanthocyanidins had stronger inhibitory activity than A-type. Unit composition and DP had nearly no effect on their inhibitory activity based on same mass. This study showed that proanthocyanidins with various structures were promising additives to mitigate harmful acrylamide.

AB Numerous critical reviews have evaluated exposure to toxic and carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from a number of pathways; including workplace air, cement and packaging materials. The contribution of foodstuffs to dietary Cr(VI) has been increasingly under investigation, however no summary of this work has been carried out. The objective of this article is to review the last twenty years of chromium speciation research in foodstuffs. Alkaline extraction, used for chromium speciation in other solids, is the most widely-reported procedure. Previous measurement of Cr(VI) in foodstuffs is questionable due to the reducing power of organic matter and antioxidants, leading to the development of speciated isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SIDMS) techniques to monitor interconversions. Evaluation of the genotoxicity of trivalent chromium (Cr(III)), which acts through a different pathway to that of Cr(VI), requires reconsideration towards measurement of Cr(III), which is present at higher concentrations in foodstuffs following reduction of the more-bioavailable Cr(VI).

AB This article reviews recent developments in methods of sample preparation and analytical methodologies for the quantification of anthocyanins and their extraction from food sources. Various methods for sample extraction and purification are highlighted and evaluated. The use of UV-diode array, along with improved liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) and/or the combination of both methods have facilitated the identification of analytes. The use of one-dimensional and two-dimensional HPLC has significantly improved resolution with a shorter amount of time. Other LCxLC combinations to improve orthogonality are also discussed. The most efficient anthocyanin extraction method from food sources is pressurized liquid extraction. Moreover, electrospray ionization (ESI) and MS2/time-of-flight are currently the most popular instruments used for identification of anthocyanins; being positive mode of ESI the most widely used procedure for anthocyanin identification. Several databases for mass spectrometry polyphenol identification have been described for reference.

AB A direct competitive biomimetic immunosorbent assay method based on molecularly imprinted polymer was developed for the determination of trichlorfon. A CdSe/ZnS quantum dot label was used as the marker. The hydrophilic imprinted film was synthesized directly on the surface of a 96-well plate, and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analyses. The method exhibited high stability, selectivity, and sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection and sensitivity of the biomimetic immunosorbent assay method were 9.0 mu g L-1 and 5.0 mg L-1 (0.1 mg kg(-1) and 62.5 mg kg(-1) for vegetable sample), respectively. Low cross-reactivity values of 19.2% and 15.6% were obtained for the structural analogues. Spinach and rape samples spiked with trichlorfon were extracted and determined by this method with recoveries ranging from 83.6% to 91.1%. The method was applied for the detection of trichlorfon residues in leek and cucumber samples, and results correlated well with those obtained using GC.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on color properties, phenolic profile and antioxidant activities of mulberry juice. Mulberry juice was separately fermented at 37 degrees C for 36 h using Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei. The results showed that lactic acid fermentation impacted on the color of the juice. Moreover, the study demonstrated that LABs impacted on the phenolic profile of the juice. Syringic acid, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and quercetin were the predominant phenolic acid, anthocyanin and flavonol respectively in the lactic-acid-fermented mulberry juice. The degree of radical scavenging activity was species-specific with the L. plantarum fermented juice having the highest radical scavenging activities. The correlation analysis demonstrated that flavonols and anthocyanins were mostly responsible for the increased in 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) scavenging activity while phenolic acids and flavonols were responsible for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity and reducing power capacity of the fermented juice.

AB A Headspace-Solid Phase Microextraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of furan, 2-methylfuran, 2-ethylfuran, 2-butylfuran, 2-pentylfuran, 2-acetylfuran, furfural and furfuryl alcohol in jarred baby food. The method was specific for the analytes. Good precision was obtained both in terms of intra-day repeatability (RSD <= 5.02) and interday precision (RSD <= 5.55%). The recovery values were between 98.42% and 99.8%. Linearity was established over two order of magnitude, and the achieved LODs and LOQs ranged between 0.018 and 0.035 ng/g and 0.060-0.117 ng/g, respectively, depending on the analyte. Finally, the method was successfully applied to investigate the content of furan and furan derivatives in several commercial baby food samples containing fruit or meat. The results showed that this simple, rapid and solvent free procedure could be used routinely for the analysis of baby food providing competent quantitative data functional to risk assessment.

AB In this study, tomato seeds were obtained as by-products and submitted to fermentation with the proteolytic strain Bacillus subtilis A14h. The resulting peptide mixture was fractionated and purified through different chromatographic steps. Fractions were assayed for antioxidant and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities and peptides were identified by using nano-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem (nLC-MS/ MS). Most of the identified peptides were smaller than 1000 Da and had different aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues. Their sequences were novel but some of them showed active domains previously reported in other bioactive peptides. The hexapeptide DGVVYY showed an IC50 value of 2 mu M in angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitory activity, whereas the pentapeptide GQVPP displayed a 97% of DPPH activity at 0.4 mM. The results revealed that B. subtilis fermentation of tomato by-products could be a good strategy for obtaining added-value peptides that might be used as an ingredient in functional foods and nutraceuticals.

AB Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is a functional food with potential health benefits, consumed either as hot or cold beverage. To ensure quality control of its various products, accurate measurement of active metabolites is warranted. Herein, we propose a combination of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analytical platforms for the untargeted characterization of metabolites in two roselle cultivars, Aswan and Sudan-1. The analyses revealed 33 metabolites, including sugars, flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic and aliphatic organic acids. Their relative contents in cultivars were assessed via principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures analysis (OPLS). Impact of the different extraction methods (decoction, infusion and maceration) was compared by quantitative H-1 NMR spectroscopy, revealing cold maceration to be optimal for preserving anthocyanins, whereas infusion was more suited for recovering organic acids. The metabolite pattern revealed by the different extraction methods was found in good correlation for their ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzyme.

AB The validation of biomarkers and tools for the prediction of beef texture remains a challenging task. In this study, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) quantified 29 protein biomarkers in the m. Longissimus thoracis of Charolais cattle sampled early post-mortem. Myosin heavy chain 1 (MHC1, slow-oxidative fibers) and Retinal dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1, oxidative enzyme) discriminated between tender and juicy vs. tough meat with residues classes and are validated as prime biomarkers of beef texture. Several proteins belonging to energy metabolism, heat shock and oxidative stress, cytoskeletal, cell signaling and apoptosis were related with tenderness. Among the unusual proteins, Four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) and Tripartite motif protein 72 (TRIM72) correlated respectively negatively and positively with beef tenderness. Principal component regression was used for the first time to explain beef texture traits using biomarkers. The results are very promising as they revealed sophisticated mechanisms behind the tenderizing process.

AB The stability of lycopene with high Z-isomers content during thermal treatment and light irradiation was investigated. Purified (all-E)-lycopene was thermally isomerized to the Z-isomers in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) at 50 degrees C for 24 h. The total content of the Z-isomers of lycopene reached 56.1%. Then, the mixture of lycopene isomers was stored in the dark at 4, 25, and 40 degrees C for 30 days, and under light irradiation using a fluorescent light at 4 degrees C for 336 h. The degradation rate of lycopene during thermal treatment rose with increasing temperature and the activation energy for decomposition of the mixture of lycopene isomers was calculated to be 71.0 kJ mol(-1). The degradation rate of lycopene isomers was almost the same under thermal treatment. On the other hand, during light irradiation, isomerization was promoted rather than decomposition, i.e. (9Z)- and (13Z)-lycopene converted to the (all-E)-isomer.

AB In this study, the effects of UV-B radiation on the isoflavones accumulation, physiological and nutritional quality, water status, and characteristics of proteins in germinated soybeans were investigated. The results showed that isoflavones content in soybeans increased with appropriate intensity and time of UV-B radiation and decreased with excessive treatment. Fresh weight, length, free amino acids, reducing sugar contents and bulk water (T-23) in germinated soybeans decreased with increasing radiation time, indicating that UV-B inhibited the growth and nutrients metabolism of soybean during germination. Cell damage was detected in germinated soybeans with excessive UV-B radiation, as shown by the black spots in cotyledons and the increased intercellular water determined by LF-NMR. Germination resulted in an increase in random coil structures, while UV-B radiation induced no obvious changes in FT-IR spectrum and protein conformation of soybeans. Both UV-B radiation and germination caused the increase in soluble proteins, especially in 1.0-75.0 kDa fraction.

AB The Meishan iron deposit contains 338 Mt of iron-ore reserves at 39% Fe and represents the largest magnetite-apatite deposit in the Ningwu Basin of eastern China. Controversy has long existed about whether this deposit had a hydrothermal or iron-oxide melt origin. Iron mineralization is genetically related to plutons that are composed of gabbro-diorite, which were emplaced at 130 +/- 1 Ma. These rocks have SiO2 contents of 51.72-54.60 wt%, Na2O contents of 3.47-4.04 wt%, K2O contents of 2.02-2.69 wt%, and K2O/Na2O ratios of 0.51-0.73. These rocks are enriched in LILEs and LREEs and depleted in Nb, Ta, and Ti, which indicates that the magma originated through partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle source in a subduction environment. A pattern of decreasing initial Sr isotopic ratios and increasing epsilon Nd(t) values with time in Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks of the Ningwu Basin may indicate incorporation of increasing proportions of asthenospheric mantle material into the source magma, which is consistent with the processes of lithospheric thinning and asthenospheric upwelling in eastern China related to Mesozoic subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Two stages of magnetite are found in the gabbro-diorite: (1) early-crystallized magnetite as euhedral-subhedral crystals in larger clinopyroxene crystals, and (2) later-crystallized magnetite and accompanying ilmenite grains in the voids between plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals. The formation of magnetite before clinopyroxene, combined with the results of Fe-Ti oxide geothermometry and analysis of magnetite V content, indicates that the oxygen fugacity of the source magma was greater than Delta FMQ + 2.2 at an early stage (> 640 degrees C) but decreased to Delta FMQ - 2.66 as abundant magnetite crystallized at a later stage (similar to 489 degrees C). The early crystallization of magnetite at a high oxygen fugacity does not support a Fenner evolution trend for the primitive magma and diminishes the likelihood of liquid immiscibility, which could have generated an iron-rich melt, and is thus inconsistent with an iron-oxide melt origin for the Meishan iron deposit. The 6345 values of pyrite (6.6-15.1 parts per thousand) and anhydrite (15.6-16.9 parts per thousand) in the deposit and the occurrence of evaporites under the volcanic rocks likely indicate that the iron ores and alteration rocks of the Meishan deposit were formed by the circulation of fluids of evaporitic origin driven by heat from the hypabyssal gabbro-diorite intrusives. In the late magmatic stage, oxygen fugacity decreased to a reducing range, triggering the reduction of sulfate to reduced sulfur and leading to local gold and pyrite mineralization.

Although loess is loose and fragile, loess columns are popular and they can stand stably for hundreds of years, thereby forming a spectacular landform. The formation of such special column-shaped soil structures is puzzling, and the underlying fundamentals remain unclear. The present study focuses on quantifying and examining the geometrical shape and spatial alignment of structural blocks of the Malan loess at different locations in the Loess Plateau of China. The structural blocks under investigation include clay- and silt-sized particles, aggregates, fragments, lumps, and columns, which vary in size from microns to tens of meters. Regardless of their size, the structural blocks of the Malan loess are found to be similar in shape, i.e., elongated with a length-to-width ratio of approximately 2.6. The aggregates, fragments, lumps, columns, and macropores between aggregates exhibit strong concentration in the vertical or subvertical alignment. These phenomena imply that the Malan loess is anisotropic and it is composed of a combination of vertically aligned strong units and vertically aligned weak segments. Based on this, "vertiloess" structure is proposed to denote this combination. The vertiloess structure prevents horizontal erosion, but favors spalling, peeling, toppling, falling and cracking-sliding of vertical loess pieces, thereby forming loess columns.

AB The Late Paleozoic strata are well exposed in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, Northwest China. The strata contain numerous plant fossils. Hence, Yongchang County is a good location to study Paleozoic plants and plate movement. Using well-preserved cordaitean cones and seeds from the lower Permian Taiyuan Formation of Yongchang County, two new species of fossil plants are described, one attributed to the new organ genus Hexianthus (H. shenii sp. nov.) and the other to the seed genus Samaropsis (S. shenii sp. nov.). The micro- and macro-scale features of the cones, including the epidermal features of the bracts and scales, are analyzed in the laboratory. Numerous cordaitean cones with helically arranged bracts and scales (H. shenii sp. nov.) present in the Taiyuan Formation of Yongchang County share similar characteristics with the cordaitean cones which are endemic to the Cathaysian flora. This suggests that the study region was characterized by the Cathaysian flora in the Cisuralian, similar to the Hexi Corridor to the south of the study region. Based on the study of fossil cuticles and their associated plants, the study region of Yongchang County probably had a warm and humid climate during the Cisuralian. In addition, according to the associations between different fossil plants from several localities in Gansu Province (from the Cathaysian flora in the lower Permian to the Cathaysian-Angaran mixed flora in the upper Permian), a possible boundary between the Cathaysian and Angaran floras in Gansu Province can be placed along the Hexi Corridor, which provides important information for the study of floral associations in Northwest China during the Late Paleozoic.

AB Atmospheric CO2 starvation, aridity, fire and warm season precipitation have all been proposed as major contributors to C-4 plant expansion during the Late Miocene. However, the driving factors responsible for the distribution of C-4 plants in the early and mid-Miocene still remain enigmatic. Here we report pedogenic carbon and oxygen isotope data (delta C-13(pedo), delta O-18(pedo)), along with magnetic susceptibility (MS) results, from the Zhuang Lang drilling core on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Elevated delta C-13(pedo). values ( > -5 parts per thousand) signal a prominent C-4 expansion and substantially increased delta O-18(pedo). and MS values indicate enhanced Asian summer monsoon (ASM) precipitation. Both of these conditions are observed during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), 14.5-17 million years ago. The marked increase in C-4 plants, associated with warm temperatures and increased precipitation, strongly suggests the control of an enhanced ASM on C-4 expansion on the CLP during the MMCO. This finding contrasts with the late-Miocene C-4 expansion associated with cooling and drying conditions observed in low latitudes and argues for regionally specific control of C-4 plant distribution/expansion.

AB Early Paleozoic boninites occur in the Central Qilian orogenic belt, Northwest China. Their petrogenesis provides insights into lithosphere process and tectonic evolution of the Qilian block. In this paper, we carry out a study of geochronological, geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions for the Early Paleozoic boninites in the Lajishan area of the Central Qilian block. The Lajishan boninites (similar to 483 Ma) have high Al2O3/TiO2 (36.7-64.7) and CaO/TiO2 (31.1-49.6) ratios, and high MgO (7.86-10.47 wt%), Cr (439-599 ppm) and Ni (104-130 ppm) contents, indicating that the boninites result from a refractory mantle source. They are depleted in high field-strength elements (HFSE) and enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), coupled with slightly high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values of 0.7059-0.7074 and low epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -1.05 to +2.66, indicating that the mantle source was metasomatized by subducted slab-derived components. We found that an assemblage of low-Ca group and high-Ca group boninites occurred in the Lajishan belt. The high-Ca group boninites were derived from relatively fertile mantle with slightly higher melting degree, whereas the low-Ca group boninites were generated by partial melting of more refractory mantle wedge peridotites with slightly lower melting degree. The assemblage of low-Ca group and high-Ca group boninites reveals that the low-Ca group boninites were generated by the further melting of the more refractory mantle source after the segregation of the high-Ca group boninitic magmas in response to the back-arc basin opening. In the light of reported boninites worldwide, a diagram of Zr/Y vs. CaO/Al2O3 is used to identify boninites in fore-arc and back-arc regions. We suggest that the Lajishan boninites represent the products of back-arc basin development in response to the northward subduction of the Qaidam-West Qinling ocean slab.

AB At the junction between the North China Craton (NCC) and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), northern Liaoning province, NE China, there are widespread Jurassic igneous rocks. The tectonic setting and petrogenesis of these rocks are unresolved. Zircon U-Pb dating, whole-rock geochemistry, and Hf isotopic compositions of Jurassic granitoids were investigated to constrain their ages and petrogenesis in order to understand the tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean along the northeastern margin of the NCC. Geochronological data indicate that magmatism occurred between the early and late Jurassic (180-156 Ma). Despite the wide range in ages of the intrusions, Jurassic granitoids were likely derived from a similar or common source, as inferred from their geochemical and Hf isotopic characteristics. Compared to the island arc andesite-dacite-rhyolite series, the Jurassic granitoids are characterized by higher SiO2, Al2O3, and Sr contents, and lower MgO, FeOT, Y, and Yb contents, indicating that the primary magmas show typical characteristics of adakitic magmas derived from partial melting of thickened lower crust. These findings, combined with their epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+1.4 to +5.4) and two-stage model ages (1515-1165 Ma), indicate the primary magmas originated from partial melting of juvenile crustal material accreted during the Mesoproterozoic. They are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, K, Th, Ba, and U) and light rare-earth elements (REE), and depleted in high-field-strength elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti, and P) and heavy REE. Based on these findings and previous studies, we suggest that the Jurassic adakitic granitoids (180-156 Ma) were formed in an active continental margin and compressive tectonic setting, related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate.

AB As faults can be barriers to or conduits for fluid flow, it is critical to understand fault seal processes and their effects on the sealing capacity of a fault zone. Apart from the stratigraphic juxtaposition between the hanging wall and footwall, the development of fault rocks is of great importance in changing the sealing capacity of a fault zone. Therefore, field-based structural analysis has been employed to identify the meso-scale and micro scale deformation features and to understand their effects on modifying the porosity of fault rocks. In this study, the Lenghu5 fold-and-thrust belt (northern Qaidam Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau), with well-exposed outcrops, was selected as an example for meso-scale outcrop mapping and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) micro-scale structural analysis. The detailed outcrop maps enabled us to link the samples with meso-scale fault architecture. The representative rock samples, collected in both the fault zones and the undeformed hanging walls/footwalls, were studied by SEM micro-structural analysis to identify the deformation features at the micro-scale and evaluate their influences on the fluid flow properties of the fault rocks. Based on the multi-scale structural analyses, the deformation mechanisms accounting for porosity reduction in the fault rocks have been identified, which are clay smearing, phyllosilicate-framework networking and cataclasis. The sealing capacity is highly dependent on the clay content: high concentrations of clay minerals in fault rocks are likely to form continuous clay smears or micro- clay smears between framework silicates, which can significantly decrease the porosity of the fault rocks. However, there is no direct link between the fault rocks and host rocks. Similar stratigraphic juxtapositions can generate fault rocks with very different magnitudes of porosity reduction. The resultant fault rocks can only be predicted only when the fault throw is smaller than the thickness of a faulted bed, in which scenario self-juxtaposition forms between the hanging wall and footwall.

AB The Machangqing Cu-Mo-dominated polymetallic deposit is a porphyry-skarn-epithermal Cu-Mo (-Au) metallogenic system located in the middle part of the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. The skarn mineralization of the Machangqing deposit mainly occurs along the contacts between the alkalic porphyry intrusions and the surrounding Lower Ordovician Xiangyang Formation rocks. We present LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages and trace element data for titanite from the Machangqing deposit in order to investigate the origin of this deposit. Based on mineral textures and assemblages, two types of titanite are recognized in Machangqing: magmatic titanite (Type I) from the granite porphyry and hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized skarn. The coarse-grained magmatic titanite is euhedral and occurs as discrete grains in the interstices of feldspar, quartz and biotite, whereas fine- to medium-grained hydrothermal titanite crystals (Type II) are euhedral to subhedral and occur in association with skarn minerals such as garnet, pyroxene and magnetite. Magmatic titanite has lower FeO, Al2O3, F and Nb/Ta but higher TiO2, Th/U, HFSEs and Lu/Hf than hydrothermal titanite. The magmatic titanite has higher LREE/HREE ratios and total REE contents with stronger negative Eu anomalies than its mineralized skarn counterpart. Trace elemental characteristics of hydrothermal titanite in Machangqing are consistent with relatively low F contents and oxygen fugacities when compared to the neighboring Beiya gold-dominated polymetallic deposit in the same metallogenic belt. The weighted average Pb-206/U-238 age of 34.3 +/- 1.2 Ma of hydrothermal titanite is within error but slightly younger than the age of magmatic titanite (37.5 +/- 4.1 Ma), indicating that the skarn mineralization followed the emplacement of the granite porphyry and was broadly coeval with the porphyry mineralization. The porphyry and skarn types of mineralization at Machangqing were formed from the same metallogenic system. Different ore-forming conditions, such as oxygen fugacities and F contents, might be responsible for different metal enrichments at the Machangqing and Beiya deposits.

AB Patients associated with multiple co-occurring health conditions often face aggravated complications and less favorable outcomes. Co-occurring conditions are especially prevalent among individuals suffering from kidney disease, an increasingly widespread condition affecting 13% of the general population in the US. This study aims to identify and characterize patterns of co-occurring medical conditions in patients employing a probabilistic framework. Specifically, we apply topic modeling in a non-traditional way to find associations across SNOMED-CT codes assigned and recorded in the EHRs of > 13,000 patients diagnosed with kidney disease. Unlike most prior work on topic modeling, we apply the method to codes rather than to natural language. Moreover, we quantitatively evaluate the topics, assessing their tightness and distinctiveness, and also assess the medical validity of our results. Our experiments show that each topic is succinctly characterized by a few highly probable and unique disease codes, indicating that the topics are tight. Furthermore, inter-topic distance between each pair of topics is typically high, illustrating distinctiveness. Last, most coded conditions grouped together within a topic, are indeed reported to co-occur in the medical literature. Notably, our results uncover a few indirect associations among conditions that have hitherto not been reported as correlated in the medical literature.

AB New advances in telemedicine, ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence have supported the emergence of more advanced applications and support systems for chronic patients. This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution.

AB We outline the construction of compatible B-splines on 3D surfaces that satisfy the continuity requirements for electromagnetic scattering analysis with the boundary element method (method of moments). Our approach makes use of Non-Uniform Rational B-splines to represent model geometry and compatible B-splines to approximate the surface current, and adopts the isogeometric concept in which the basis for analysis is taken directly from CAD (geometry) data. The approach allows for high-order approximations and crucially provides a direct link with CAD data structures that allows for efficient design workflows. After outlining the construction of div- and curl-conforming B-splines defined over 3D surfaces we describe their use with the electric and magnetic field integral equations using a Galerkin formulation. We use Bezier extraction to accelerate the computation of NURBS and B-spline terms and employ H-matrices to provide accelerated computations and memory reduction for the dense matrices that result from the boundary integral discretization. The method is verified using the well known Mie scattering problem posed over a perfectly electrically conducting sphere and the classic NASA almond problem. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the approach to handle models with complex geometry directly from CAD without mesh generation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The long-term change of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for managing water resources in areas with extreme climates, such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study proposed a modified algorithm for estimating ET based on the MOD16 algorithm on a global scale over alpine meadow on the TP in China. Wind speed and vegetation height were integrated to estimate aerodynamic resistance, while the temperature and moisture constraints for stomatal conductance were revised based on the technique proposed by Fisher et al, (2008). Moreover, Fisher's method for soil evaporation was adopted to reduce the uncertainty in soil evaporation estimation. Five representative alpine meadow sites on the TP were selected to investigate the performance of the modified algorithm. Comparisons were made between the ET observed using the Eddy Covariance (EC) and estimated using both the original and modified algorithms. The results revealed that the modified algorithm performed better than the original MOD16 algorithm with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.26 to 0.68, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.56 to 0.78 mm d(-1). The modified algorithm performed slightly better with a higher R-2 (0.70) and lower RMSE (0.61 mm d(-1)) for after-precipitation days than for non precipitation days at Suli site. Contrarily, better results were obtained for non-precipitation days than for after precipitation days at Arou, Tanggula, and Hulugou sites, indicating that the modified algorithm may be more suitable for estimating ET for non-precipitation days with higher accuracy than for after-precipitation days, which had large observation errors. The comparisons between the modified algorithm and two mainstream methods suggested that the modified algorithm could produce high accuracy ET over the alpine meadow sites on the TP.

AB Source apportionment is critical for guiding development of efficient watershed nitrogen (N) pollution control measures. The ReNuMa (Regional Nutrient Management) model, a semi-empirical, semi-process-oriented model with modest data requirements, has been widely used for riverine N source apportionment. However, the ReNuMa model contains limitations for addressing long-term N dynamics by ignoring temporal changes in atmospheric N deposition rates and N-leaching lag effects. This work modified the ReNuMa model by revising the source code to allow yearly changes in atmospheric N deposition and incorporation of N-leaching lag effects into N transport processes. The appropriate N-leaching lag time was determined from cross-correlation analysis between annual watershed individual N source inputs and riverine N export. Accuracy of the modified ReNuMa model was demonstrated through analysis of a 31-year water quality record (1980-2010) from the Yongan watershed in eastern China. The revisions considerably improved the accuracy (Nash-Sutcliff coefficient increased by similar to 0.2) of the modified ReNuMa model for predicting riverine N loads. The modified model explicitly identified annual and seasonal changes in contributions of various N sources (i.e., point vs. nonpoint source, surface runoff vs. groundwater) to riverine N loads as well as the fate of watershed anthropogenic N inputs. Model results were consistent with previously modeled or observed lag time length as well as changes in riverine chloride and nitrate concentrations during the low-flow regime and available N levels in agricultural soils of this watershed. The modified ReNuMa model is applicable for addressing long-term changes in riverine N sources, providing decision-makers with critical information for guiding watershed N pollution control strategies.

AB Floodplain mapping using hydrodynamic models is difficult in data scarce regions. Additionally, using hydrodynamic models to map floodplain over large stream network can be computationally challenging. Some of these limitations of floodplain mapping using hydrodynamic modeling can be overcome by developing computationally efficient statistical methods to identify floodplains in large and ungauged watersheds using publicly available data. This paper proposes a geomorphic model to generate probabilistic 100-year floodplain maps for the Conterminous United States (CONUS). The proposed model first categorizes the watersheds in the CONUS into three classes based on the height of the water surface corresponding to the 100-year flood from the streambed. Next, the probability that any watershed in the CONUS belongs to one of these three classes is computed through supervised classification using watershed characteristics related to topography, hydrography, land use and climate. The result of this classification is then fed into a probabilistic threshold binary classifier (PTBC) to generate the probabilistic 100-year floodplain maps. The supervised classification algorithm is trained by using the 100-year Flood Insurance Rated Maps (FIRM) from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA FIRMs are also used to validate the performance of the proposed model in areas not included in the training. Additionally, HEC-RAS model generated flood inundation extents are used to validate the model performance at fifteen sites that lack FEMA maps. Validation results show that the probabilistic 100 year floodplain maps, generated by proposed model, match well with both FEMA and HEC-RAS generated maps. On average, the error of predicted flood extents is around 14% across the CONUS. The high accuracy of the validation results shows the reliability of the geomorphic model as an alternative approach for fast and cost effective delineation of 100-year floodplains for the CONUS.

AB Lakes provide enormous economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to citizens. These ecosystem services may be adversely impacted by climate change. In the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA, many lakes have been at historic low levels and water augmentation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problem. White Bear Lake (WBL) is a notable example. Its water level declined 1.5 m during 2003-2013 for reasons that are not fully understood. This study examined current, past, and future lake evaporation to better understand how climate will impact the water balance of lakes within this region. Evaporation from WBL was measured from July 2014 to February 2017 using two eddy covariance (EC) systems to provide better constraints on the water budget and to investigate the impact of evaporation on lake level. The estimated annual evaporation losses for years 2014 through 2016 were 559 +/- 22 mm, 779 +/- 81 mm, and 766 +/- 11 mm, respectively. The higher evaporation in 2015 and 2016 was caused by the combined effects of larger average daily evaporation and a longer ice-free season. The EC measurements were used to tune the Community Land Model 4 - Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (CLM4-LISSS) to estimate lake evaporation over the period 1979-2016. Retrospective analyses indicate that WBL evaporation increased during this time by about 3.8 mm year(-1), which was driven by increased wind speed and lake-surface vapor pressure gradient. Using a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP8.5), lake evaporation was modeled forward in time from 2017 to 2100. Annual evaporation is expected to increase by 1.4 mm year(-1) over this century, largely driven by lengthening ice-free periods. These changes in ice phenology and evaporation will have important implications for the regional water balance, and water management and water augmentation strategies that are being proposed for these Metropolitan lakes.

AB The high solubility and conservative behaviour of chloride make it ideal for use as an environmental tracer of water and salt movement through the hydrologic cycle. For such use the spatial distribution of chloride deposition in rainfall at a suitable scale must be known. A number of authors have used point data acquired from field studies of chloride deposition around Australia to construct relationships to characterise chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast; these relationships have allowed chloride deposition to be interpolated in different regions around Australia. In this paper we took this a step further and developed a chloride deposition map for all of Australia which includes a quantification of uncertainty. A previously developed four parameter model of chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast for Australia was used as the basis for producing a continental scale chloride deposition map. Each of the four model parameters were made spatially variable by creating parameter surfaces that were interpolated using a pilot point regularisation approach within a parameter estimation software. The observations of chloride deposition were drawn from a literature review that identified 291 point measurements of chloride deposition over a period of 80 years spread unevenly across all Australian States and Territories. A best estimate chloride deposition map was developed from the resulting surfaces on a 0.05 degree grid. The uncertainty in the chloride deposition map was quantified as the 5th and 95th percentile of 1000 calibrated models produced via Null Space Monte Carlo analysis and the spatial variability of chloride deposition across the continent was consistent with landscape morphology. The temporal variability in chloride deposition on a decadal scale was investigated in the Murray-Darling Basin, this highlighted the need for long-term monitoring of chloride deposition if the uncertainty of the continental scale map is to be reduced. Use of the derived chloride deposition map was demonstrated for a probabilistic estimation of groundwater recharge for the southeast of South Australia using the chloride mass balance method.

AB In this study, a novel surrogate model assisted multiobjective memetic algorithm (SMOMA) is developed for optimal pumping strategies of large-scale coastal groundwater problems. The proposed SMOMA integrates an efficient data-driven surrogate model with an improved non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII) that employs a local search operator to accelerate its convergence in optimization. The surrogate model based on Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) is developed and evaluated as an approximate simulator to generate the patterns of regional groundwater flow and salinity levels in coastal aquifers for reducing huge computational burden. The KELM model is adaptively trained during evolutionary search to satisfy desired fidelity level of surrogate so that it inhibits error accumulation of forecasting and results in correctly converging to true Pareto-optimal front. The proposed methodology is then applied to a large-scale coastal aquifer management in Baldwin County, Alabama. Objectives of minimizing the saltwater mass increase and maximizing the total pumping rate in the coastal aquifers are considered. The optimal solutions achieved by the proposed adaptive surrogate model are compared against those solutions obtained from one-shot surrogate model and original simulation model. The adaptive surrogate model does not only improve the prediction accuracy of Pareto-optimal solutions compared with those by the one-shot surrogate model, but also maintains the equivalent quality of Paretooptimal solutions compared with those by NSGAII coupled with original simulation model, while retaining the advantage of surrogate models in reducing computational burden up to 94% of time-saving. This study shows that the proposed methodology is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multiobjective optimizations of coastal aquifer managements.

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a well-known technique for improving water quality and increasing groundwater resources. Denitrification (i.e. removal of nitrate) can be enhanced during MAR by coupling an artificial recharge pond with a permeable reactive layer (PRL). In this study, we examined the suitability of a multi-isotope approach for assessing the long-term effectiveness of enhancing denitrification in a PRL containing vegetal compost. Batch laboratory experiments confirmed that the PRL was still able to enhance denitrification two years after its installation in the infiltration pond. At the field scale, changes in redox indicators along a flow path and below the MAR-PRL system were monitored over 21 months during recharge and non-recharge periods. Results showed that the PRL was still releasing non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon five years after its installation. Nitrate concentration coupled with isotopic data collected from the piezometer network at the MAR system indicated that denitrification was occurring in the saturated zone immediately beneath the infiltration pond, where recharged water and native groundwater mix. Furthermore, longer operational periods of the MAR-PRL system increased denitrification extent. Multi-isotope analyses are therefore proved to be useful tools in identifying and quantifying denitrification in MAR-PRL systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we explored how landscape characteristics such as topography, geology, soils and land cover influence the way catchments respond to changing climate conditions. Based on an ensemble of 15 regional climate models bias-corrected with a distribution-mapping approach, present and future streamflow in 14 neighboring and rather similar catchments in Northern Sweden was simulated with the HBV model. We established functional relationships between a range of landscape characteristics and projected changes in streamflow signatures. These were then used to analyze hydrological consequences of physical perturbations in a hypothetically ungauged basin in a climate change context. Our analysis showed a strong connection between the forest cover extent and the sensitivity of different components of a catchment's hydrological regime to changing climate conditions. This emphasizes the need to redefine forestry goals and practices in advance of climate change-related risks and uncertainties.

AB Microbial contamination of recreational beaches is often at its worst after heavy rainfall events due to storm floods that carry fecal matter and other pollutants from the watershed. Similarly, overflows of untreated sewage from combined sewerage systems may discharge directly into coastal water or via rivers and streams. In order to understand the effect of rainfall events, wind-directions and tides on the recreational water quality, GEMSS, an integrated 3D hydrodynamic model was applied to assess the spreading of Escherichia cob (E. cob) at the Sandvika beaches, located in the Oslo fiord. The model was also used to theoretically investigate the effect of discharges from septic tanks from boats on the water quality at local beaches. The model make use of microbial decay rate as the main input representing the survival of microbial pathogens in the ocean, which vary widely depending on the type of pathogen and environmental stress. The predicted beach water quality was validated against observed data after a heavy rainfall event using Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) and the overall result indicated that the model performed quite well and the simulation was in - good agreement with the observed E. coil concentrations for all beaches. The result of this study indicated that: 1) the bathing water quality was poor according to the EU bathing water directive up to two days after the heavy rainfall event depending on the location of the beach site. 2) The discharge from a boat at 300-meter distance to the beaches slightly increased the E. coil levels at the beaches. 3) The spreading of microbial pathogens from its source to the different beaches depended on the wind speed and the wind direction.

AB There are serious concerns between forest and water quantity, Chinese extensive land area makes the relationship more complicated, thus, the effects of forest structure on hydrological processes in China were not fully comprehended. In this research, forest's hydrological functions, including rainfall partitioning, litter interception, evapotranspiration (ET), were analyzed in China. The results showed that throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69.3 +/- 8.8% and 84.4 +/- 5.6%. Then was canopy interception which varied from 14.6 +/- 1.4% to 29.1 +/- 3.3%. Throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation, canopy thickness and canopy density. Canopy interception was correlated with gross precipitation, LAI, canopy density, biomass, mixed degree, uniform angle index, aggregation index. Stemflow accounted for only 1.2 +/- 0.32% of gross precipitation, with the greatest fraction of 2.1 +/- 0.2% in XBH site and the least fraction of 0.3 +/- 0.1% in DB site. Gross precipitation was the main factor in determining stemflow. DB site had the greatest litter interception (7.7 +/- 0.8 mm) and HB site had the least (0.9 +/- 0.3 mm). Litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass (0.66) than total litter mass (0.46). Path-coefficient analysis showed that stand density, Shannon-Wiener index, litter mass, size ratio had greater impact on litter interception than other factors. ET was mainly influenced by precipitation, and it also correlated with LAI, canopy density and biomass. In north China, ET percentage (the ratio of ET and precipitation) was 82.7-109.5%, while it decreased to 63.1-88.5% in south China, ET demand in XBS site was larger than precipitation. ET percentage increased with increasing latitude and elevation, decreased with increasing temperature.

AB River deltas sustain important ecosystems with rich biodiversity and large biomass, as well as human populations via the availability of water and food sources. Anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, tourism and agriculture, may pose threats to river deltas. The knowledge of the factors controlling the regional water quality regime in these areas is important for planning sustainable use and management of the water resources. Here, hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical techniques were combined to investigate the shallow aquifer of the Pinios River (Thessaly) deltaic plain with respect to water quality, hydrogeochemical evolution and interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies.
   Water quality assessment indicated that most of the river and groundwater samples fully comply with the criteria set by the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC). The river is recharged mainly from springs of the Tempi valley and the shallow aquifer, and to a lesser degree from precipitation, throughout the year. The hydrogeochemical characteristics indicated a cation (Ca, Mg, and Na) bicarbonate water type, which evolves to calcium -chloride, sodium-bicarbonate and sodium-chloride water type, in the northern part of the delta. Calcite and dolomite dissolution determined the major ion chemistry, but other processes, such as silicate weathering and cation exchange reactions, also contributed. In the northern part of the plain, the interaction with the deeper aquifer enriched the shallow aquifer with Na and Cl ions.
   Principal Component Analysis showed that five components (PCs) explain 77% of the total variance of water quality parameters; these are: (1) salinity; (2) water-silicate rocks interaction; (3) hardness due to calcite dissolution, and cation exchange processes; (4) nitrogen pollution; and (5) non-N-related artificial fertilizers. This study demonstrated that the variation of water hydrochemistry in the deltaic plain could be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes. The interpretation of the PCA results dictated the parameters used for the development of a modified Water Quality Index (WQI), to provide a more comprehensive spatial representation of the water quality of the river delta.

AB A rapid method for in-situ elemental composition analysis of metal-laden water would be indispensable for studying polluted water. Current analytical lab methods to determine water quality include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. However only two field methods, colorimetry and absorptiometry, exist for elemental analysis of water. Portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry is an effective method for elemental analysis of soil, sediment, and other matrices. However, the accuracy of PXRF is known to be affected while scanning moisture-laden soil samples. This study sought to statistically establish PXRF's predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A total of 390 metal-laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in South Africa were analyzed via PXRF and ICP-AES. The PXRF showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification. For the collected water samples, the best relationships between ICP and PXRF elemental data were obtained for K and Cu (R-2 = 0.92). However, when scanning ICP calibration solutions with elements in isolation, PXRF results indicated near perfect agreement; Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Pb produced an R-2 of 0.99 while Zn and Mn produced an R-2 of 1.00. The utilization of multiple PXRF (stacked) beams produced stronger correlation to ICP relative to the use of a single beam in isolation. The results of this study demonstrated the PXRF's ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal-laden water as reported by ICP for several elements. Additionally this study indicated the need for a "Water Mode" calibration for the PXRF and demonstrates the potential of PXRF for future study of polluted or contaminated waters.

AB Stream depletion due to groundwater extraction by wells may cause impact on aquatic ecosystem in streams, conflict over water rights, and contamination of water from irrigation wells near polluted streams. A variety of studies have been devoted to addressing the issue of stream depletion, but a fundamental framework for analytical modeling developed from aquifer viewpoint has not yet been found. This review shows key differences in existing models regarding the stream depletion problem and provides some guidelines for choosing a proper analytical model in solving the problem of concern. We introduce commonly used models composed of flow equations, boundary conditions, well representations and stream treatments for confined, unconfined, and leaky aquifers. They are briefly evaluated and classified according to six categories of aquifer type, flow dimension, aquifer domain, stream representation, stream channel geometry, and well type. Finally, we recommend promising analytical approaches that can solve stream depletion problem in reality with aquifer heterogeneity and irregular geometry of stream channel. Several unsolved stream depletion problems are also recommended.

AB Studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of significance for environmental and industrial applications. Two-dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption is presented by means of Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique. Five basic characteristics of Taylor dispersion and vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications are also analyzed. The results reveal that bed absorption affects both the longitudinal and vertical concentration distributions and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate in the upper layer. Additionally, the cross-sectional concentration distribution shows an asymptotic Gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption. The vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time. The obtained results are essential for practical implements with strict environmental standards.

AB Rainfall or snow-melted water recharge easily saturates loose top soils with a less permeable underlayer, such as cultivated soil slope and partially thawed top soil layer, and thus, may influence the velocity of water flow. This study suggested a methodology and device system to supply water from the bottom soil layer at the different locations of slopes. Water seeps into and saturates the soil, when the water level is controlled at the same height of the soil surface. The structures and functions of the device, the components, and the operational principles are described in detail. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted under slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees and flow rates of 2, 4, and 8 L min(-1) to measure the water flow velocities over eroding and non-eroded loess soil slopes, under saturated conditions by using electrolyte tracing. Results showed that flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17% to 88% greater than those on non-saturated slopes. Flow velocity increased rapidly under high flow rates and slope gradients. Saturation conditions were suitable in maintaining smooth rill geo-morphology and causing fast water flow. The saturated soil slope had a lubricant effect on the soil surface to reduce the frictional force, resulting in high flow velocity. The flow velocities of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates were approximately 14% to 33% lower than those of non-eroded rills on saturated loess slopes. Compared with that on a saturated loess slope, the eroding rill on a non-saturated loess slope can produce headcuts to reduce the flow velocity. This study helps understand the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation of saturated soil slopes.

AB In data scarce basins, such as the Nile River Basin (NRB) in Africa, constraints related to data availability, quality, and access often complicate attempts to estimate runoff sensitivity using conventional methods. In this paper, we show that by integrating the concept of the aridity index (AI) (derived from the Budyko curve) and climate elasticity, we can obtain the first order response of the runoff sensitivity using minimal data input and modeling expertise or experience. The concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff. The approach does not account for human impacts on runoff modification and or diversions. By making use of freely available gauge-corrected satellite data for precipitation, temperature, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration, we derived the sensitivity indicator (beta) to determine the runoff response to changes in precipitation and temperature for four climatic zones in the NRB, namely, tropical, subtropical, semiarid and arid zones. The proposed sensitivity indicator can be partitioned into different elasticity components i.e: precipitation (epsilon(p)), potential evapotranspiration (epsilon(ETp)), temperature (epsilon(T)) and the total elasticity (epsilon(tot)). These elasticities allow robust quantification of the runoff response to the potential changes in precipitation and temperature with a high degree of accuracy. Results indicate that the tropical zone is energy-constrained with low sensitivity, (beta < 1.0), implying that input precipitation exceeds the amounts that can be evaporated given the available energy. The subtropical zone is subdivided into two distinct regions, the lowland (Machar and Sudd marshes), and the highland area (Blue Nile Basin), where each area has a unique sensitivity. The lowland area has high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The subtropical-highland zone moves between energy-limited to water-limited conditions during periods of wet and dry spells with varying sensitivity. The semiarid and arid zones are water limited, with high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The calculated runoff elasticities show that a 10% decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19% in the tropical zone and 30% in the arid zones. On the other hand, a 10% precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 14% in the tropical zone and 22% in the arid zone. The estimated runoff changes are consistent with the result obtained using other methods. Thus, the elasticity approach combines data parsimony and analytical simplicity to produce results that are practically useful for most purposes while facilitating communication with stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge. More research is needed to extend the application of the method to incorporate the effects of human activities, and land use change.

AB A Gini-coefficient based stochastic optimization (GBSO) model was developed by integrating the hydrological model, water balance model, Gini coefficient and chance-constrained programming (CCP) into a general multi-objective optimization modeling framework for supporting water resources allocation at a watershed scale. The framework was advantageous in reflecting the conflicting equity and benefit objectives for water allocation, maintaining the water balance of watershed, and dealing with system uncertainties. GBSO was solved by the non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithms-II (NSGA-II), after the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model have been quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs of CCP model, and the chance constraints were converted to the corresponding deterministic versions. The proposed model was applied to identify the Pareto optimal water allocation schemes in the Lake Dianchi watershed, China. The optimal Pareto-front results reflected the tradeoff between system benefit (alpha(SB)) and Gini coefficient (alpha(G)) under different significance levels (i.e. q) and different drought scenarios, which reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems. A lower q generally implies a lower risk of violating the system constraints and a worse drought intensity scenario corresponds to less available water resources, both of which would lead to a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme. Thus, the proposed modeling framework could help obtain the Pareto optimal schemes under complexity and ensure that the proposed water allocation solutions are effective for coping with drought conditions, with a proper tradeoff between system benefit and water allocation equity.

AB In this study, we focus on the behavior of geogenic, toxic trace elements, particularly As, Cs, Cd, and Pb, during their transportation in two rivers for irrigation commonly used in monsoon Asia; one river originates from an active volcano, Mt. Asama, and the other originates from a currently inactive volcano, Yatsugatake Mountains in Nagano, Japan. These rivers were investigated to understand the role of river water as a pollutant of rice and other aquatic plants (via irrigation) and aquatic animals. The results indicated that the behavior of toxic trace elements in river water are likely controlled by their interactions with particulate Fe, Al, and Ti compounds. The majority of Pb and Cd is transported as particulate matter with Fe, Al, and Ti, while the majority of As is transported in the dissolved form, predominantly as arsenate, with low abundance of particulate matter. Cs is transported either as the dissolved form or as particulate matter in both rivers. The investigated elements are transported in the rivers as particulate and dissolved forms, and the ratio of these forms is controlled by the pH and presence of particulate Fe, Al, and Ti phases in the river water. With respect to Cs in both rivers, the parameter governing the concentration and transportation of Cs, in the bimodal form (i.e., particulate and dissolved forms), through the river possibly shifts from sorption to pH by particulate Fe-Al-Ti, according to the abrupt increase in the concentration of Cs in the river. The chemical attraction of particulate Fe-Al-Ti for Cs is weaker than that for Pb and Cd, indicating that the lower electronegativity of Cs weakens the chemical attraction on a colloid for the competitive sorption with the other trace elements. The different relationships between As and Fe in the river and in the irrigation water and soil water, as well as those in paddy rice, suggested that As in paddy rice is not directly derived from As in the irrigation water from the river under flooding.

AB During the last years there has been an increasing interest in assessing health risks caused by exposure to contaminants found in soil, air, and water, like heavy metals or emerging contaminants. This work presents a study on the spatial patterns and interaction effects among relevant heavy metals (Sb, As and Pb) that may occur together in different minerals. Total organic carbon (TOC) have been analyzed too because it is an essential component in the regulatory mechanisms that control the amount of metal in soils. Even more, exposure to these elements is associated with a number of diseases and environmental problems. These metals can have both natural and anthropogenic origins. A key component of any exposure study is a reliable model of the spatial distribution the elements studied. A geostatistical analysis have been performed in order to show that selected metals are auto-correlated and cross-correlated and type and magnitude of such cross-correlation varies depending on the spatial scale under consideration. After identifying general trends, we analyzed the residues left after subtracting the trend from the raw variables. Three scales of variability were identified (compounds or factors) with scales of 5, 35 and 135 km. The first factor (F1) basically identifies anomalies of natural origin but, in some places, of anthropogenics origin as well. The other two are related to geology (F2 and F3) although F3 represents more clearly geochemical background related to large lithological groups. Likewise, mapping of two major structures indicates that significant faults have influence on the distribution of the studied elements. Finally, influence of soil and lithology on groundwater by means of contingency analysis was assessed.

AB Urbanization disturbs groundwater flow through the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces and through modifications to the subsoil by constructed drainage and other infrastructure (trenches and excavations, e.g. water supply). The impact of these disturbances on groundwater contributions to urban streams (i.e. baseflow) is poorly understood. While high flows caused by impervious runoff to streams are a common focus of urban studies, the route taken by groundwater to become streamflow in urban landscapes is not generally considered. To assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater sources to streams, both rainfall and baseflow were sampled weekly for stable isotopes of water in two nearby streams one draining a peri-urban catchment and the other draining a forested, natural catchment. In addition, to study the rate of groundwater discharge to the stream, monthly baseflow recession behavior was investigated. We found that baseflow in the forested catchment was constant in stable isotope values (delta O-18 =- 5.73 parts per thousand +/- 0.14 parts per thousand) throughout the year. Monthly baseflow recession constants were close to 1 and had little variation (ranging 0.951-0.992), indicating a well-mixed groundwater store and long residence times. In contrast, the urban baseflow isotopic composition featured distinct seasonal variations (delta O-18 =- 3.35 parts per thousand +/- 1.20 parts per thousand from October to March and delta O-18 = -4.54 parts per thousand +/- 0.43 parts per thousand from April to September) and high week-to-week variability in summer, reflecting a contribution of recent rainfall to baseflow. Recession constants were lower (ranging 0.727-0.955) with pronounced seasonal variations, suggesting shorter residence times and the likely presence of a variety of stores and pathways. These results provide evidence that the urban catchment has diversified groundwater pathways, and its groundwater storage is drained faster than that of the forested catchment. It highlights some of the subsurface hydrological consequences of urbanization. Restoring low-flow aspects of the flow regime through nature-mimicking stormwater management requires careful consideration of how the behavior of natural groundwater pathways can be restored or replicated using innovative stormwater control measures.

AB Micro-scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far. Characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands. As opposed to the common macro-scale (or bulk) representation of groundwater flow and transport processes, a pore network model (PNM) simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores. Here, a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3D unstructured pore network was developed; its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3D approach. Water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from mu CT images. The modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits. Results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth, which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity. The increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth, which extended the flow path of fluid particles. Results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally, but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core-scale; this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core-scale and field-scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils. Transport simulations revealed that for a given solute, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity. Longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective-dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil; it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile.

AB Real time hydrologic forecasting requires near accurate initial condition of soil moisture; however, continuous monitoring of soil moisture is not operational in many regions, such as, in Ganga basin, extended in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Here, we examine the impacts of perturbation/error in the initial soil moisture conditions on simulated soil moisture and streamfiow in Ganga basin and its propagation, during the summer monsoon season (June to September). This provides information regarding the required minimum duration of model simulation for attaining the model stability. We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity model for hydrological simulations after validation. Multiple hydrologic simulations are performed, each of 21 days, initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon season for deficit, surplus and normal monsoon years. Each of these simulations is performed with the initial soil moisture condition obtained from long term runs along with positive and negative perturbations. The time required for the convergence of initial errors is obtained for all the cases. We find a quick convergence for the year with high rainfall as well as for the wet spells within a season. We further find high spatial variations in the time required for convergence; the region with high precipitation such as Lower Ganga basin attains convergence at a faster rate. Furthermore, deeper soil layers need more time for convergence. Our analysis is the first attempt on understanding the sensitivity of hydrological simulations of Ganga basin on initial soil moisture conditions. The results obtained here may be useful in understanding the spin-up requirements for operational hydrologic forecasts.

AB Hyperconcentrated sediment-laden floods often occur in a braided reach of the Lower Yellow River, usually leading to significant channel evolution. A one-dimensional (1D) morphodynamic model using a dynamically coupled solution approach is developed to simulate hyperconcentrated flood and channel evolution in the braided reach with an extremely irregular cross-sectional geometry. In the model, the improved equations for hydrodynamics account for the effects of sediment concentration and bed evolution, which are coupled with the equations of non-equilibrium sediment transport and bed evolution. The model was validated using measurements from the 1977 and 2004 hyperconcentrated floods. Furthermore, the effects were investigated of different cross-sectional spacings and allocation modes of channel deformation area on the model results. It was found that a suitable cross-sectional distance of less than 3 km should be adopted when simulating hyperconcentrated floods, and the results using the uniform allocation mode can agree better with measurements than other two allocation modes.

AB River ice breakup dates (BDs) are not merely a proxy indicator of climate variability and change, but a direct concern in the management of local ice-caused flooding. A framework of stacking ensemble learning for annual river ice BDs was developed, which included two-level components: member and combining models. The member models described the relations between BD and their affecting indicators; the combining models linked the predicted BD by each member models with the observed BD. Especially, Bayesian regularization back-propagation artificial neural network (BRANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were employed as both member and combining models. The candidate combining models also included the simple average methods (SAM). The input variables for member models were selected by a hybrid filter and wrapper method. The performances of these models were examined using the leave-one-out cross validation. As the largest unregulated river in Alberta, Canada with ice jams frequently occurring in the vicinity of Fort McMurray, the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray was selected as the study area. The breakup dates and candidate affecting indicators in 1980-2015 were collected. The results showed that, the BRANN member models generally outperformed the ANFIS member models in terms of better performances and simpler structures. The difference between the R and MI rankings of inputs in the optimal member models may imply that the linear correlation based filter method would be feasible to generate a range of candidate inputs for further screening through other wrapper or embedded IVS methods. The SAM and BRANN combining models generally outperformed all member models. The optimal SAM combining model combined two BRANN member models and improved upon them in terms of average squared errors by 14.6% and 18.1% respectively. In this study, for the first time, the stacking ensemble learning was applied to forecasting of river ice breakup dates, which appeared promising for other river ice forecasting problems.

AB Snow has a unique characteristic in the water cycle, that is, snow falls during the entire winter season, but the discharge from snowmelt is typically delayed until the melting period and occurs in a relatively short period. Therefore, reliable observations from an optimal snow monitoring network are necessary for an efficient management of snowmelt water for flood prevention and hydropower generation. The Dual Entropy and Multiobjective Optimization is applied to design snow monitoring networks in La Grande River Basin in Quebec and Columbia River Basin in British Columbia. While the networks are optimized to have the maximum amount of information with minimum redundancy based on entropy concepts, this study extends the traditional entropy applications to the hydrometric network design by introducing several improvements. First, several data quantization cases and their effects on the snow network design problems were explored. Second, the applicability the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) products as synthetic datasets of potential stations was demonstrated in the design of the snow monitoring network of the Columbia River Basin. Third, beyond finding the Pareto-optimal networks from the entropy with multi-objective optimization, the networks obtained for La Grande River Basin were further evaluated by applying three hydrologic models. The calibrated hydrologic models simulated discharges using the updated snow water equivalent data from the Pareto-optimal networks. Then, the model performances for high flows were compared to determine the best optimal network for enhanced spring runoff forecasting.

AB Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake which frequently happens sediment resuspension induced by wind-induced waves. The experiments are carried on to simulate the wave disturbance processes in wave flume by setting a series of wave periods (1.2 s, 1.5 s, 1.8 s) and wave heights (2 cm, 10 cm). It aims to analyze the characteristics of sediment resuspension and the mechanisms of nutrients release and to evaluate the effects of sediment dredging on sediment resuspension and nutrients release in Lake Taihu. The results show that wave shear stress during 2 cm and 10 cm wave height processes ranges 0.018-0.023 N/m(2) and 0.221-0.307 N/m(2), respectively. Wave shear stress has no significant differences between wave periods. Wave height has much more effects on sediment resuspension. Wave height of 2 cm could induce total suspended solids (TSS) reaching up to 5.21 g/m(2) and resuspension flux of sediment (M) up to 1.74 g/m(2). TSS sharply increases to 30.33-52.41 g/m(2) and M reached up to 48.94 g/m(2) when wave height reaches to 10 cm. The disturbance depth under different sediment bulk weights ranges from 0.089 to 0.161 mm. Variation of suspended solids in 3 layers (1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm above sediment interface) has no significant differences. Organic matter, TN and TP have positive relationship with SS. Organic matter is only accounted for 5.7%-7.3% of SS. The experiments under different sediment bulk densities (1.34 g/cm(3), 1.47 g/cm(3) and 1.59 g/cm(3)) find that TSS and M fall by 44.2% and 39.8% with sediment bulk density increasing, respectively. Total TN, DTN, TP and DTP decrease by 24.3%-33.6%. It indicates that sediment dredging could effectively reduce SS concentration and nutrient levels in water column. The researches provide a theoretical basis for sediment dredging to control the shore zone of Lake Taihu for lake management.

AB Quantitative understanding of controls on thaw layer thickness (TLT) dynamics in the Arctic peninsula is essential for predictive understanding of permafrost degradation feedbacks to global warming and hydro biochemical processes. This study jointly interprets electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements and hydro-thermal numerical simulation results to assess spatiotemporal variations of TLT and to determine its controlling factors in Barrow, Alaska. Time-lapse ERT measurements along a 35-m transect were autonomously collected from 2013 to 2015 and inverted to obtain soil electrical resistivity. Based on several probe-based UT measurements and co-located soil electrical resistivity, we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds associated with the boundary between the thaw layer and permafrost using a grid search optimization algorithm. Then, we used the obtained thresholds to derive the UT from all soil electrical resistivity images. The spatiotemporal analysis of the ERT-derived TLT shows that the TLT at high-centered polygons (HCPs) is smaller than that at low-centered polygons (LCPs), and that both thawing and freezing occur earlier at the HCPs compared to the LCPs. In order to provide a physical explanation for dynamics in the thaw layer, we performed 1-D hydro thermal simulations using the community land model (CLM). Simulation results showed that air temperature and precipitation jointly govern the temporal variations of UT, while the topsoil organic content (SOC) and polygon morphology are responsible for its spatial variations. When the topsoil SOC and its thickness increase, TLT decreases. Meanwhile, at LCPs, a thicker snow layer and saturated soil contribute to a thicker TLT and extend the time needed for TLT to freeze and thaw. This research highlights the importance of combination of measurements and numerical modeling to improve our understanding spatiotemporal variations and key controls of TLT in cold regions.

AB In this study, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasting models are developed for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity. Firstly, the partial mutual information (PMI) capable of capturing the linear and nonlinear dependence is investigated regarding its utility to identify relevant predictors and exclude those that are redundant through the comparison with partial linear correlation. An efficient input selection technique is crucial for decreasing model data requirements. Then, the interconnection between global climate indices and regional ETo is identified. Relevant climatic indices are introduced as additional predictors to comprise information regarding ETo, which ought to be provided by meteorological data unavailable. The case study in the Jing River and Beiluo River basins, China, reveals that PMI outperforms the partial linear correlation in excluding the redundant information, favouring the yield of smaller predictor sets. The teleconnection analysis identifies the correlation between Nino 1 + 2 and regional ETo, indicating influences of ENSO events on the evapotranspiration process in the study area. Furthermore, introducing Nino 1 + 2 as predictors helps to yield more accurate ET forecasts. A model performance comparison also shows that nonlinear stochastic models (SVR or RF with input selection through PMI) do not always outperform linear models (MLR with inputs screen by linear correlation). However, the former can offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets. Therefore, efforts such as screening model inputs through PMI and incorporating global climatic indices interconnected with ETo can benefit the development of ETo, forecasting models suitable for data-scarce regions.

AB The process of evaporation interacts with the soil, which has various comprehensive mechanisms. Multiphase flow models solve air, vapour, water, and heat transport equations to simulate non-isothermal soil moisture transport of both liquid water and vapor flow, but are only applied in non-vegetated soils. For (sparsely) vegetated soils often energy balance models are used, however these lack the detailed information on non-isothermal soil moisture transport. In this study we coupled a multiphase flow model with a two-layer energy balance model to study the impact of non-isothermal soil moisture transport on evaporation fluxes (i.e., interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation) for vegetated soils. The proposed model was implemented at an experimental agricultural site in Florida, US, covering an entire maize-growing season (67 days). As the crops grew, transpiration and interception became gradually dominated, while the fraction of soil evaporation dropped from 100% to less than 20%. The mechanisms of soil evaporation vary depending on the soil moisture content. After precipitation the soil moisture content increased, exfiltration of the liquid water flow could transport sufficient water to sustain evaporation from soil, and the soil vapor transport was not significant. However, after a sufficient dry-down period, the soil moisture content significantly reduced, and the soil vapour flow significantly contributed to the upward moisture transport in topmost soil. A sensitivity analysis found that the simulations of moisture content and temperature at the soil surface varied substantially when including the advective (i.e., advection and mechanical dispersion) vapour transport in simulation, including the mechanism of advective vapour transport decreased soil evaporation rate under wet condition, while vice versa under dry condition. The results showed that the formulation of advective soil vapor transport in a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer continuum can affect the simulated evaporation fluxes, especially under dry condition.

AB Nitrogen reactive transport modeling is subject to uncertainty in model parameters, structures, and scenarios. By using a new variance-based global sensitivity analysis method, this paper identifies important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport with simultaneous consideration of these three uncertainties. A combination of three scenarios of soil temperature and two scenarios of soil moisture creates a total of six scenarios. Four alternative models describing the effect of soil temperature and moisture content are used to evaluate the reduction functions used for calculating actual reaction rates. The results show that for nitrogen reactive transport problem, parameter importance varies substantially among different models and scenarios. Denitrification and nitrification process is sensitive to soil moisture content status rather than to the moisture function parameter. Nitrification process becomes more important at low moisture content and low temperature. However, the changing importance of nitrification activity with respect to temperature change highly relies on the selected model. Model-averaging is suggested to assess the nitrification (or denitrification) contribution by reducing the possible model error. Despite the introduction of biochemical heterogeneity or not, fairly consistent parameter importance rank is obtained in this study: optimal denitrification rate (Kden) is the most important parameter; reference temperature (T-r) is more important than temperature coefficient WO; empirical constant in moisture response function (m) is the least important one. Vertical distribution of soil moisture but not temperature plays predominant role controlling nitrogen reaction. This study provides insight into the nitrogen reactive transport modeling and demonstrates an effective strategy of selecting the important parameters when future temperature and soil moisture carry uncertainties or when modelers face with multiple ways of establishing nitrogen models.

AB Hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands, serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes. In western North America, mountain peatlands exist in different hydro geological settings, across a range climatic conditions, and vary in floristic composition. The sustainability of these ecosystems, particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range, is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle. We conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands, with differing vegetation, hydrogeological setting (sloping vs basin), and climate (strong vs weak monsoon influence). Growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis, and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site. The sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season. Alternatively, the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients. A zero-flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland; shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration. The differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets. Higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone, which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover. This research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds, they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration, which were several-fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands.

AB Hydrological and hydrodynamic models are core tools for simulation of large basins and complex river systems associated to wetlands. Recent studies have pointed towards the importance of online coupling strategies, representing feedbacks between floodplain inundation and vertical hydrology. Especially across semi-arid regions, soil-floodplain interactions can be strong. In this study, we included a two-way coupling scheme in a large scale hydrological-hydrodynamic model (MGB) and tested different model structures, in order to assess which processes are important to be simulated in large semi-arid wetlands and how these processes interact with water budget components. To demonstrate benefits from this coupling over a validation case, the model was applied to the Upper Niger River basin encompassing the Niger Inner Delta, a vast semi-arid wetland in the Sahel Desert. Simulation was carried out from 1999 to 2014 with daily TMPA 3B42 precipitation as forcing, using both in-situ and remotely sensed data for calibration and validation. Model outputs were in good agreement with discharge and water levels at stations both upstream and downstream of the Inner Delta (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 for most gauges), as well as for flooded areas within the Delta region (NSE = 0.6; r = 0.85). Model estimates of annual water losses across the Delta varied between 20.1 and 30.6 km(3)/yr, while annual evapotranspiration ranged between 760 mm/yr and 1130 mm/yr. Evaluation of model structure indicated that representation of both floodplain channels hydrodynamics (storage, bifurcations, lateral connections) and vertical hydrological processes (floodplain water infiltration into soil column; evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water) are necessary to correctly simulate flood wave attenuation and evapotranspiration along the basin. Two-way coupled models are necessary to better understand processes in large semi-arid wetlands. Finally, such coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling proves to be an important tool for integrated evaluation of hydrological processes in such poorly gauged, large scale basins. We hope that this model application provides new ways forward for large scale model development in such systems, involving semi-arid regions and complex floodplains.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Drought; Joint deficit index; Gaussian copula; Geostatistics
ID PRECIPITATION
AB The characterization of droughts and their impacts is very dependent on the time scale that is involved. In order to obtain an overall drought assessment, the cumulative effects of water deficits over different times need to be examined together. For example, the recently developed joint deficit index (JDI) is based on multivariate probabilities of precipitation over various time scales from 1- to 12-months, and was constructed from empirical copulas. In this paper, we examine the Gaussian copula model for the JDI. We model the covariance across the temporal scales with a two-parameter function that is commonly used in the specific context of spatial statistics or geostatistics. The validity of the covariance models is demonstrated with long-term precipitation series. Bootstrap experiments indicate that the Gaussian copula model has advantages over the empirical copula method in the context of drought severity assessment: (I) it is able to quantify droughts outside the range of the empirical copula, (ii) provides adequate drought quantification, and (iii) provides a better understanding of the uncertainty in the estimation.

AB The chloride mass balance method of estimating groundwater recharge is generally applied at a point scale but water resources management generally requires information at a regional scale. To estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation. This study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging: in data-sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates, while in data-dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge. The uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall, the chloride exported in runoff, the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling. This study focused on the coal bearing Sydney, Gunnedah, Gloucester and Surat Basins of Eastern New South Wales (Australia). Historically, groundwater recharge to the Permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water. The increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance. We found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers (up to 20% of long-term mean annual rainfall) and lowest in the Permian units (-1% of long-term mean annual rainfall). The magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate. The method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty. The method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge, because of the integration of energy and water balances and sometimes carbon balance. The additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge. However, these models usually have a large number of parameters. The uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates. This study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model. It is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the Campaspe catchment in southeast Australia. A Monte Carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors. The results show that for a mean rainfall of 398 mm/y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters, the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144 mm/y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters. This upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236 mm/y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions. Through several synthetic test cases, this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty, whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50%. The reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antireflection (AR) layers for Si were investigated for applications in optical communication in the wavelength range of 1270-1330 nm. The Essential Macleod software was used to find the optimal thicknesses of the AR coatings with two different structures of AlOx/TiOx bilayer and SiNx single-layer. The simulations revealed reflectances lower than 0.5% for both AlOx/TiOx and SiNx AR structures. Furthermore, atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition were used to grow the AlOx/TiOx and SiNx layers, respectively. For the fabricated structures, average reflectances of 0.2% (AlOx/TiOx ) and 0.3% (SiNx) were achieved in the wavelength range of 1270-1330 nm. For the AlOx/TiOx bilayer, a lower transmittance of similar to 88% was obtained, compared with that of the SiNx single-layer of similar to 99%. An additional air annealing at 300 degrees C for 2 h led to a crystallization of the amorphous TiOx into anatase phase, which yielded an improved transmittance of similar to 99%, comparable with that of the SiNx single-layer structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the oxidation state of Ti in TiOx influenced the absorption in the near-infrared region.

AB Eight PbO-ZnO-TeO2-B2O3 glasses were prepared with a standard melting method from pure oxides. The substitution of TeO2 by B2O3 leads to an increase in the glass-transition temperature from 292 to 457 degrees C and to an increase in the optical band gap from 3.66 eV to 4.03 eV. The values of the non-linear refractive index were estimated at around 6 x 10(-12) esu. Raman scattering spectra suggest a transformation in TeO2 and B2O3 based part of the glasses network.

AB Glassy and partially crystallized samples of (Ge1-xGax)S-2 (0 mol % <= x <= 50 mol%) were prepared and investigated for the Ga effect on their physical and structural properties. For low Ga content (0 mol% <= x <= 30 mol %), homogeneous glassy samples were prepared and present good physical properties, such as high glass transition temperature (> 400 degrees C) and Vickers hardness (> 2.60 GPa). With the Ga substitution for Ge, the thermal stability of samples decreases, leading to the precipitation of alpha-Ga2S3 crystallites when x > 40 mol%. Structural evolution of (Ge1-xGax)S-2 samples was investigated by Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction techniques. The correlation between the physical properties and structural evolution was established.

AB A helpful method to process Fe-based metallic glass called pneumatic-injection 3D printing is proposed. Considering the characteristics of Fe-based metallic glass particles, such as large particle size, high density, and complex surface ions, their wettability and suspension stability were investigated using experiments based on the Washburn equation. The effect of pH value, powder's morphology and granularity on wettability was qualitatively analyzed. Multiple dispersants for the slurries of Fe-based metallic glass powder were tested. The experimental results revealed the wettability of the spherical powder with a size range of 45-200 pm was relatively high. An alkaline environment was not conducive to the wetting and stable dispersion. Ammonium polyacrylate was found to be the best dispersing agent for the Fe-based metallic glass powder. A uniform, stable Fe-based metallic glass slurry with a solid content of 50% was prepared. The width of the printed line increased with the pressure and decreased with increasing nozzle speed. The study of printing parameters provides guidance to improve the quality and accuracy of pneumatic-injection 3D printing of metallic glass.

ID HYBRIDS
AB FTIR and Raman spectroscopy indicate the glass structure during synthesis of tin fluoride phosphate glass was pyrophosphate, mainly built up from Q(1) end groups with a low concentration of Q(2) polymeric chains. However, sub-optimal melting produced significantly higher concentrations of orthophosphate Q(0) structural units. The variations in NH and P-OH vibrations in the spectra revealed that a critical time and temperature of melting were necessary for the conversion of NH4H2PO2 to produce sufficient P2O5 for glass forming. During melting, P2O5 and SnF2 form a low-temperature melt, which facilitates melting of the SnO and promotes the formation of a more stable glass structure. The fluorine breaks the POP bonds and induces depolymerisation. The density of the glass reached a maximum at 450 degrees C for 25 min driven by the need for conversion of NH4H2PO4 to P2O5 and miscibility of SnO in the melt. Inadequate melting times and temperatures gave low T-g values because of weak F-Sn and F-P linkages. Glass stability improved with melting due to increased P2O5 and SnO miscibility enabling stronger Sn-O-P linkages. The results show that melting conditions during synthesis strongly influence critical glass properties and future industrial scale-up will require an understanding of optimum processing.

AB The glass-to-crystal transition of Na1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) (NAGP), and Na1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)(3) (NATP), both crystallizing in variants of the Na-superionic conducting (NASICON) structure, has been investigated by solid-state NMR. The ceramic materials produced by annealing the precursor glasses above the glass transition temperature are candidate materials for solid-state separator membranes in sodium ion batteries. The different local structural environments involving both network former and network modifier species have been characterized by comprehensive Na-23, Al-27 and P-31 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) experiments. In crystalline Na1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) samples multiple phosphate environments are observed, corresponding to n Al and 4-n Ge species in their second coordination spheres. In contrast, no site resolution is observed in the analogous Na1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)(3) system. This can be understood on the basis of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data, which reveal a significant lattice expansion in the former, but no lattice expansion in the latter material. Al-27 MAS-NMR data reveal that in the glassy state, Al occurs with coordination numbers four, five and six, with the fraction of four-coordinated Al being substantially higher in the NATP glasses than in the NAGP glasses. Na-23 MAS-NMR and spin echo decay measurements reveal distinct differences between glassy and crystallized materials with regard to the local environments and the spatial distributions of the sodium ions.

AB A current bottleneck in structure determination of macromolecular complexes by cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is the large amount of data needed to obtain high-resolution 3D reconstructions, including through sorting into different conformations and compositions with advanced image processing. Additionally, it may be difficult to visualize small ligands that bind in sub-stoichiometric levels. Volta phase plates (VPP) introduce a phase shift in the contrast transfer and drastically increase the contrast of the recorded low-dose cryo-EM images while preserving high frequency information. Here we present a comparative study to address the behavior of different data sets during image processing and quantify important parameters during structure refinement. The automated data collection was done from the same human ribosome sample either as a conventional defocus range dataset or with a Volta phase plate close to focus (cfVPP) or with a small defocus (dfVPP). The analysis of image processing parameters shows that dfVPP data behave more robustly during cryo-EM structure refinement because particle alignments, Euler angle assignments and 2D & 3D classifications behave more stably and converge faster. In particular, less particle images are required to reach the same resolution in the 3D reconstructions. Finally, we find that defocus range data collection is also applicable to VPP. This study shows that data processing and cryo-EM map interpretation, including atomic model refinement, are facilitated significantly by performing VPP cryo-EM, which will have an important impact on structural biology.

AB The Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is the etiological agent of fire blight, a devastating disease which affects Rosaceae such as apple, pear and quince. The siderophore desferrioxamine E plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis by scavenging iron from the host. DfoJ, DfoA and DfoC are the enzymes responsible for desferrioxamine production starting from lysine. We have determined the crystal structures of each enzyme in the desferrioxamine E pathway and demonstrate that the biosynthesis involves the concerted action of DfoJ, followed by DfoA and lastly DfoC. These data provide the first crystal structures of a Group II pyridoxal-dependent lysine decarboxylase, a cadaverine monooxygenase and a desferrioxamine synthetase.
   DfoJ is a homodimer made up of three domains. Each monomer contributes to the completion of the active site, which is positioned at the dimer interface. DfoA is the first structure of a cadaverine monooxygenase. It forms homotetramers whose subunits are built by two domains: one for FAD and one for NADP(+) binding, the latter of which is formed by two subdomains. We propose a model for substrate binding and the role of residues 43-47 as gate keepers for FAD binding and the role of Arg97 in cofactors turnover. DfoC is the first structure of a desferrioxamine synthetase and the first of a multi-enzyme siderophore synthetase coupling an acyltransferase domain with a Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetase (NRPS)-Independent Siderophore domain (NIS).

AB This paper presents a new algorithm to automatically segment the myofibrils, mitochondria and nuclei within single adult cardiac cells that are part of a large serial-block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) dataset. The algorithm only requires a set of manually drawn contours that roughly demarcate the cell boundary at routine slice intervals (every 50th, for example). The algorithm correctly classified pixels within the single cell with 97% accuracy when compared to manual segmentations. One entire cell and the partial volumes of two cells were segmented. Analysis of segmentations within these cells showed that myofibrils and mitochondria occupied 47.5% and 51.6% on average respectively, while the nuclei occupy 0.7% of the cell for which the entire volume was captured in the SBF-SEM dataset. Mitochondria clustering increased at the periphery of the nucleus region and branching points of the cardiac cell. The segmentations also showed high area fraction of mitochondria (up to 70% of the 2D image slice) in the sub-sarcolemmal region, whilst it was closer to 50% in the intermyofibrillar space. We finally demonstrate that our segmentations can be turned into 3D finite element meshes for cardiac cell computational physiology studies. We offer our large dataset and MATLAB implementation of the algorithm for research use at www.github.com/CellSMB/sbfsem-cardiac-cell-segmenter/. We anticipate that.this timely tool will be of use to cardiac computational and experimental physiologists alike who study cardiac ultrastructure and its role in heart function.

AB Pure TiO2 nanostructures were synthesized by hydrothermal method using NaOH and KOH as solvents. Structural, optical and morphological analyses of TiO2 nanostructures were presented in this letter. Powder X-ray diffraction study was used to identify the anatase, rutile and titanate phase formation of TiO2 nanostructures. The presence of functional groups in TiO2 nanostructures was identified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. UV-vis-NIR reflectance spectra explain the absorption nature of titanate nanostructures and bandgap was calculated as 3.43 eV and 2.96 eV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the tube and rodlike morphologies of nano TiO2 synthesized using different solvents. The length and diameter of titanate nanotubes are 24 nm and 4 nm respectively. The length of the nanorod is 30 nm and the width is 4.5 nm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In-situ formed micro and sub-micro/nano TiC-VC carbides reinforced Fe-based laser cladding layers were successfully obtained by optimizing the particle size of iron, ferrotitanium-ferrovanadium and graphite powders. Microstructure, hardness and corrosion resistance of the cladding layers were comparatively investigated. The results indicated that optimizing the particle size of the cladding alloy powders, the average particle size of the carbides decreased significantly, and the distribution range of sizes became more narrower. Moreover, the micro scale complex carbides of TiC and C0.88V transformed into sub-micro/nano scale single phase carbides TiVC2. The hardness of the cladding layer increased slightly, however, the corrosion resistance increased significantly, due to the formation of a passive film and carbide refinement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel visible light sensitive Cu(II)-nanocluster grafted Na-K2Ti6O13 photocatalyst was prepared via molten salt method followed by impregnation technique. The prepared samples were characterized with various analytical techniques to validate the grafting of nanocluster onto the surface of Na-K2Ti6O13. TEM analysis shows belt-like morphology with diameter of 10-20 nm. In addition, a cluster of size less than 5 nm was observed on the surface of the catalyst belt, indicating the grafting of Cu(II) rather than its doping onto the catalyst lattice. The surface modified Na-K2Ti6O13 nano-belt showed propitious photocatalytic activity over pure Na-K2Ti6O13 for the degradation of Rhodamine B. Among the series of different wt% Cu-grafting, 0.1% Cu-grafted Na-K2Ti6O13 showed highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of dye with 87% degradation within 80 min of illumination. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to direct interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) from VB of Na-K2Ti6O13 to the surface grafted Cu(II) nanocluster. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a series of Cr2O3/La2Ti2O7 composite photocatalysts were fabricated via a simple two-step method; their morphology, crystalline structure and optical property were characterized respectively. Compared with the pure La2Ti2O7, all the as-prepared nanocomposites exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity in degradation of different pollutants under visible light irradiation, and the optimal mass ratio of Cr2O3 was 14%. The pseudo-first-order model was applied to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of composites for Rhodamine B (RhB) and reactive brilliant red X-3B (X-3B) degradation reaction. In addition, the photocurrent and photoluminescence (PL) were measured, respectively. And the active species participated in photocatalytic process were demonstrated by trapping test.

AB Three porous carbons were prepared by using citric acid and sucrose as carbon source, and then the AgBrO3/AgBr nanoparticles were loaded on the porous carbon by using the impregnation-precipitation method. Multi-analysis technologies were used to investigate the structures, morphologies and elements chemical states of the as-prepared samples. Rhodamine B solution was used as wastewater model to evaluate the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity of the hybrids. It was found that the citric acid concentration affect the number of reducing groups on porous carbon, thus affecting the structures and composition of the AgBrO3/AgBr photocatalysts. The AgBrO3/AgBr/porous carbon hybrid exhibits significant enhancements in adsorption and photocatalytic performances. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphologies and structures of the as-prepared products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The visible-light-response photocatalytic performances were investigated by photo-degradation of reactive blue 19 (RB-19) dye. The results showed that the favorable photocatalytic activity of the PET-supported composites can be attributed to the improved separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and the primary active species in the photo-degradation process were h(+) and O-center dot(2). The photocatalysts using PET as a matrix material made them much easier to be recycled than powder composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of fluorine into graphene endows it with unusual physical and chemical properties. Developing a valid and safe fluorinating method and advancing the fundamental understanding of fluorination mechanism are highly anticipated. Here, a photochemical route for synthesizing fluorinated graphene oxide via one-step ultraviolet (UV) irradiation using F-TEDA-BF4 (Selectfluor) as fluorinating reagent is reported. The results suggest that, unlike the general view, the oxygenic groups are not contributed to the reactivity of graphene. An electrophilic fluorination mechanism including UV induced electronic excitation and single electron transfer process is put forward. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) is a widely accepted bone substitute material due to its biocompatibility and intrinsic osteoconductive properties. For various tissue-engineered applications including 3D-printing fabrication of bone substitutes, composite scaffolds combining calcium phosphate such as nHA with synthetic polymer such as polycaprolactone (PCL) have been extensively explored to enhance the mechanical and physiochemical properties. In this study, 3D-printed PCL/nHA scaffolds were developed using mechanical extrusion-based 3D bioprinter. Scaffold morphology, chemical composition, mechanical strength, cell proliferation, and mineralization were quantitatively analyzed at various concentrations of nHA (0, 10, 20 and 30 wt%). The experimental results suggest essential data to optimize mechanical properties, printability, cellular interactions, and osteoconductivity of 3D-printed PCL/nHA composite scaffolds.

AB Graphene-nickel (G-Ni) matrix composites were fabricated through in-situ growing graphene in bulk nickel matrix using a powder metallurgy method. Sucrose as precursor of graphene was dispersed into nickel powders to grow graphene, avoiding a traditional dispersion process of graphene in metal matrix. Multi-layer graphene was synthesized in-situ in nickel matrix, meanwhile nickel matrix was densified at high temperature. The nickel matrix acts as support and catalyst of graphene, and graphene grow in-situ in nickel matrix serving as reinforcement. This in-situ growth method offers a homogeneous dispersion of graphene and well-contacted interfaces between graphene and nickel matrix, which provides a guarantee for high load transfer from nickel matrix to graphene.

AB Toward achieving Li-ion batteries with high energy density, SWCNT/Sn composite paper was electrochemically prepared and the addition effect of formaldehyde (HCHO) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on Sn electrodeposition morphology was studied. PEG improved the wettability of electroplating bath to enable inhomogeneous Sn embeddedness inside SWCNT paper, and HCHO delivered more nuclear growth. The synergetic effect resulted in a composite paper in which Sn particles with several-hundred nanometer order were distributed. Compared with a commercially-available Cu foil (18 mu m-thickness) with 32 mg at 2 cm(2) (phi 16 mm), the weight of the SWCNT paper (5 mg) is one sixth of that of the Cu foil. The dramatic reduction of the component greatly contributes to the increase in energy density of batteries. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of electrolyte pH on anodic growth of Ni-Ti-O nanopores on NiTi alloy was investigated. Through manipulating HCl, NaCl, and NaOH concentrations in the electrolyte composed of 95 vol% ethylene glycol, 5 vol% H2O, and 0.15 M Cl , the electrolyte pH was varied from 0.82 to 13.5. Although the pH has little influence on surface morphology and composition of the nanopores, it can significantly impact their growth rate. Initially, increase of the pH decreases the growth rate from 13.8 nm/s at pH = 0.82 to 5.7 nm/s at pH = 7.0. However, when the pH exceeds 7.0, its value increases with the pH and reaches up to 15.8 nm/s at pH = 13.5. The knowledge gained from this study should be valuable in the anodization of other valve metals and their alloys. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, planar heterojunction oxide solar cells (PHOSC) in both (p-i-n) and (n-i-p) configurations are fabricated using the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtered tin oxide (SnO2), copper (II) oxide (CuO) and nickel oxide (NiO) as n-type, absorber and p-type layers, respectively. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of tetragonal SnO2, monoclinic CuO, and cubic NiO phases. The cross-sectional SEM analysis showed the columnar growth for the sputtered metal oxide layers and XPS analysis revealed the valence states of metal oxides. Optical bandgap of n-type, absorber and p-type layers were found to be 3.7, 1.2 and 3.5 eV, respectively which leads to a staircase arrangement in the energy level alignment. The fabricated device with 600 nm thickness shows power conversion efficiency (PCE) (eta) of 2.3% with enhanced open-circuit voltage (V-oc) = 0.75 V, short-circuit current density (J(sc)) = 5.73 mA/cm(2) and fill factor (FF) of about 54% for (n-i-p) configuration. Similarly for (p-i-n) configuration, (eta) of 0.4% is achieved with decreased J(sc). This new strategy paves the way for easier, stable and large scale fabrication of planar oxide solar cells.

ID CHEMICAL ACTIVATION; PETROLEUM COKE; POTASSIUM
AB Synthesis of activated carbon by chemical activation results in materials with high surfaces areas and pore volumes (e.g., >1800 m(2)/g and >1 cm(3)/g). The main problems are the large amount of chemical required and the waste water created. To solve these problems, we have studied the recycle of KOH, focusing on the impacts of impurities originating in the starting materials and transferring to the solution used for washing the product. After activation of petroleum coke and carbon black, potassium was recovered in an aqueous solution including mainly KOH and K2CO3. The higher the fraction of the more active form of potassium (i.e., KOH), the higher the level of activation in subsequent experiments. The presence of sulphur increased the fraction of KOH recovered. Full recovery of potassium was achieved using HNO3 in the washing solution, but this acid also dissolved others species, such as Si and Al, that were detrimental for carbon activation.

TI Effect of metal oxide charge transfer layers on the photovoltaic

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Carbon nanotube solar cells; Hole extraction; Metal oxide interfacial
   layers
AB Despite the prominence of silicon solar cells, various alternative solar cell technologies have attracted the attention of researchers. Several attempts have been made to bring down the cost and complexities involved in the fabrication of solar cells. In this work, solar cells with TiO2 as absorber layer and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) as active charge generation layer have been fabricated by spin coating nano pastes of TiO2 and MWCNT over transparent conducting substrates. An efficiency of 0.40% was observed for TiO2-MWCNT solar cells, which was further enhanced to 1.03% and 1.27% by insertion of Co3O4 and Cu2O layers respectively, in between the MWCNT and the carbon electrode. This significant increase in efficiency is attributed to the effective hole extraction by the metal oxide layers, which resolves the work function mismatch between the MWCNT and carbon electrode. These demonstrations reveal the advantages of using metal oxide interfacial layers for effective hole extraction in carbon nanotube based solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sewage sludge composition is simulated by adding CaO and P2O5 to a basalt in order to produce glasses with low viscosity at high temperatures. Raman spectroscopy shows the presence of Q(0) and Q(2) silicate groups. The increase of Vickers microhardness is related to an nucleation of crystalline phases (magnetite, diopside, akermanite) that crystallize upon thermal treatments.

ID THIN-FILM ELECTRODES; CONVERSION
AB Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) study of rhodamine 6G dye has been carried out by photocurrent-voltage (I-V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations based on Al doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes. The Al concentration was varied from 1 to 5 at.% for Al doped ZnO. The absorption spectrum of the dye shows remarkable absorption in the range of 538-650 nm indicating its possible use as a photosensitizer for ZnO. The I-V characteristics measured in the dark and under 80W simulated illumination revealed enhanced DSSC performance for the AZO electrode with 2 at.% Al concentration. The electrochemical impedance spectra of Al doped ZnO samples was in good agreement with earlier results. This is a clear indication that rhodamine dye-sensitized AZO electrodes are superior to unsensitized ones in DSSC application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 3-Dimensional silver nanowires (3D AgNWs) conductive networks attached on melamine foams (MFs) were pre-constructed in shape memory epoxy resin through dip-coating and vacuum infusion in this work. Due to the porous structure and excellent mechanical properties of MFs, AgNWs were distributed selectively and stably in the resin, bringing in high conductivity to the composites (similar to 25 S/cm at 0.8 wt% AgNWs content). Owing to the high conductivity, the composites possess excellent shape memory properties, which can recover in 25 s with ultralow fillers content under 3 V. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mono- and co-doped MXene(Ti3C2Tx)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT) composites (MPTs) are prepared by in situ chemical method. The obtained co-doped-MPTs electrode materials with lamellar composite microstructure, which could facilitate the transmission of electrons and ions, provide improved electrochemical performances. The potential window of the doped MPTs can be enlarged to 1.8 V. Compared with 1,5-naphathalene disulfonic acid/H3PMo12O40 co-doped MPTs, 1,5-naphathalene disulfonic acid/anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) co-doped MPTs can provide higher specific capacitance of 323 F/g (more than two times as much as that of pristine MXene and PEDOT) and ideal capacitive behavior, which could be attributed to the co-doping effect as well as the Faradaic reaction of AQS.

AB As catalytic active sites of nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are always under debate, synthesis of high purity pyridinic-N dominated CNMs is an effective approach to study the relation between pyridinic-N and active sites, as well as catalytic mechanism for ORR. Herein, the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) etched by hydrofluoric (HF) acid can be used to synthesize pure pyridinic-N, suggesting that the exposed edge-patterned surface facilitates to synthesize pure pyridinic-N. Moreover, it reveals that the carbon atoms adjacent to pyridinic-N could be the catalytic active sites for ORR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printed samples produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) have low inter-layer shear strength and poor bending mechanical properties owing to the technological characteristics of the accumulation of raster pattern and layers. The present study input ultrasonic vibration energy to 3D printed samples under pressure, and investigated the effects of ultrasonic vibration on the bending and dynamic mechanical properties of FDM 3D printed ABS samples. It was found that ultrasonic strengthening increased the bending strength of ABS samples by 10.8%, increased the bending modulus by 12.5%, and improved the dynamic mechanical properties. The combination of ultrasonic strengthening technology and FDM 3D printing technology can improve the flexural and dynamic mechanical properties of existing FDM 3D printed samples, and is important in broadening the application of 3D printed parts.

AB Monometallic Pd@ZIF-8, Ni@ZIF-8 and bimetallic PdxNiy@ZIF-8 catalysts have been successfully synthesized by a simple liquid impregnation-reduction method. The structure of catalysts and the electronic states of introduced metals were characterized and their catalytic performances were evaluated in Cu free and ligands free Sonogashira coupling reaction under atmosphere. Compared with monometallic catalyst, the as-synthesized bimetallic Pd5Ni95@ZIF-8 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance with 94.50% yield. Therefore, the above experimental results suggested a synergistic effect derived from palladium and nickel, which enhanced Sonogashira coupling reaction obviously. Moreover, modification of Ni@ZIF-8 with trace of palladium can effectively promote its catalytic activity, indicating an economical way to develop efficient catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The fast oxide ion conductor, La2Mo2O9 undergoes a structural phase transition around 580 degrees C from room temperature monoclinic (alpha) to high temperature cubic (beta). The beta phase is the one of interest as a fast oxide ion conductor, and thus efforts are made to stabilize it to lower temperatures. The alpha and beta phases have very similar X-ray diffraction patterns, posing characterization problem in this quest. A new reliable protocol is proposed to clearly identify the phase in a short time. This is done without referring to peak splitting, which can be problematic with fine powders. One can use scan speed of 12 s/step in the 2 theta = 14 degrees - 16.5 degrees range to detect three peaks that vanish after phase transition to the beta form. This examination is extended further to detect the cubic beta phase of La2Mo1.0W1.0O9 in the same scan range. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Europium-doped lutetium oxide (Eu:Lu2O3) nano-powders were synthesized by a co-precipitation method from europium and lutetium nitrates using ammonium hydrogen carbonate (AHC) as the precipitant. Fine and low agglomerated powders with average particle size of 68 nm were obtained by calcining the precursor at 1100 degrees C for 4 h. Using this powder as starting material, Eu:Lu2O3 transparent ceramics with the average grain size of similar to 46 sm were fabricated by vacuum sintering at 1650 degrees C for 30 h, whose in-line transmittance reaches 66.3% at 611 nm. The influences of air annealing on optical transmittance, decay time, spectroscopic properties, light output and thermally stimulated luminescence of Eu:Lu2O3 ceramics were investigated in detail. Based on radioluminescence spectra, the light output of the annealed Eu:Lu2O3 ceramics is 10 times higher than that of the commercially available BGO single crystal, and it indicates that transparent Eu:Lu2O3 scintillation ceramics is a promising candidate for X-ray radiation detectors.

AB A series of novel polymer-rare earth complexes with Eu3+ ions have been synthesized and investigated successfully, including the binary complexes containing the single ligand poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (EAA) and the ternary complexes using 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), dibenzoylmethane (DBM) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) as the second ligand. Their structures have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which confirm that both EAA and small molecules participate in the coordination reaction with rare earth ions, and they can disperse homogeneously in the polymer matrixes. Both ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence tests for the complexes have been recorded. The relationship between fluorescence intensity of polymer-rare earth complexes and the quantity of ligand EAA has been studied and discussed. The films casted from the complexes solution can emit strong characteristic red light under UV light excitation. All these results suggest that the complexes possess potential application as luminescent materials.

AB This paper investigates the drop-on-demand inkjet printing of a nematic liquid crystal (LC) onto a variety of substrates. Achieving both a well-defined droplet boundary and uniformity of the LC director in printed droplets can be challenging when traditional alignment surfaces are employed. Despite the increasing popularity of inkjet printing LCs, the mechanisms that are involved during the deposition process such as drop impact, wetting and spreading have received very little attention, in the way of experiments, as viable routes for promoting alignment of the resultant LC droplets. In this work, radial alignment of the director and uniformity of the droplet boundary are achieved in combination via the use of a partially-wet polymer substrate, which makes use of the forces and flow generated during droplet impact and subsequent wetting process. Our findings could have important consequences for future LC inkjet applications, including the development of smart inks, printable sensors and lasers.

AB We have investigated the effect of blending electron deficient heterocycle Benzothiadiazole (BT) on the photo physical properties of conjugated polymer Poly [2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEHPPV). Quantum yield (QY) value has been found to increase from 37% for pure MEH-PPV to 45% for an optimum MEH-PPV:BT blend ratio of 1:3. This can be attributed to the efficient energy transfer from the wide bandgap BT (host) to the small bandgap MEH-PPV (guest). The FTIR spectrum of MEH-PPV:BT blended thin film indicates suppression of aromatic C-H out-of-plane and in-plane bending, suggesting planarization of the conjugated polymer chains and, hence, leading to increase in the conjugation length. The increase in conjugation length is also evident from the red-shifted PL spectra of MEH-PPV:BT blended films. Single layer MEH-PPV:BT device shows lower turn-on voltage than single layer MEH-PPV alone device. Further, the effect of electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS on the current-voltage characteristics is investigated in the PLED devices with MEHPPV:BT blend as the active layer. PEDOT:PSS with higher conductivity as HIL reduces the turn on voltage from 4.5 V to 3.9 V and enhances the current density and optical output in the device.

AB BaZn2(BO3)(2) self-activated phosphors were prepared by the conventional high temperature solid-state method. The PL spectra of BaZn2(BO3)(2)powders prepared under reductive and air atmosphere consist of a weak ultraviolet emission band (similar to 410 nm) and a broad emission band which were centered at similar to 500 and 545 nm, respectively. According to the spectral analysis and EPR results, the green and yellow emissions may arise from the transitions of photo-generated electron close to the conduction band to the deeply trapped hole in single ionized oxygen vacancy (V+ o) centers and single negatively charged interstitial oxygen ion (O- i), respectively. An efficient broadband near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting was demonstrated in Yb3+ doped BaZn2(BO3)(2) phosphor. Upon excitation with an ultraviolet photon at 375 nm, the emissions of two NIR photons at 983 nm from Yb3+ ions were achieved. The dependences of the visible and NIR emissions, the decay lifetime, the energy transfer efficiency, and the quantum efficiency on the Yb3+ doping content were investigated in detail. The results indicated that the maximum energy transfer and the corresponding downconversion quantum efficiency could reach between 68.5% and 168.5%.

The energy levels of the Tm3+ in the NaBi(MoO4)(2) host were determined from polarized optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra measured at 77.4 K. Radiative properties of the crystals were calculated in context of Judd-Ofelt theory. Raman spectra of the crystal were studied. The concentration dependences of emission decay times of H-3(4) and F-3(4) levels were analyzed. The potential of the crystal for building tunable and ultrafast pulse lasers is shown on the base of cross sections and gain coefficient in the range of 1.9 mu m.

AB Mg-3/Al-1 and Mg3Al1-xTbx layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with terephthalate anion were synthesized using sol-gel method. The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy (FLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Tb3+ substitution effects in the Mg3Al1-xTbx LDHs were investigated by changing the Tb3+ concentration in the cation layers. The study indicates that the organic guest-terephthalate in the interlayer spacing of the LDH host influences the luminescence of the hybrid inorganic-organic materials.

AB Radiation therapy is one of the primary therapeutic techniques for treating cancer, administered to nearly twothirds of all cancer patients. Although largely effective in killing cancer cells, radiation therapy, like other forms of cancer treatment, has difficulty dealing with hypoxic regions within solid tumors. The incomplete killing of cancer cells can lead to recurrence and relapse.
   The research presented here is investigating the enhancement of the efficacy of radiation therapy by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit UV photons. UV photons, with wavelengths between 230 nm and 280 nm, are able to inactivate cells due to their direct interaction with DNA, causing a variety of forms of damage. UV emitting nanoparticles will enhance the treatment in two ways: first by generating UV photons in the immediate vicinity of cancer cells, leading to direct and oxygen-independent DNA damage, and second by down-converting the applied higher energy X-rays into softer X-rays and particles that are more efficiently absorbed in the targeted tumor region. The end result will be nanoparticles with a higher efficacy in the treatment of hypoxic cells in the tumor, filling an important, unmet clinical need.
   Our preliminary experiments show an increase in cell death using scintillating LuPO4:Pr nanoparticles over that achieved by the primary radiation alone. This work describes the fabrication of the nanoparticles, their physical characterization, and the spectroscopic characterization of the UV emission. The work also presents in vitro results that demonstrate an enhanced efficacy of cell killing with x-rays and a low unspecific toxicity of the nanoparticles.

AB Transition metal dichalcogenides two-dimensional materials are of great importance for future electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this work, triangular WS2 monolayers with size up to 130 mu m were prepared via chemical vapor deposition method. WS2 monolayers presented uniform Raman intensity, while quenched photoluminescence (PL) was observed in the center. The PL quenching in the central part of WS2 monolayer flakes was attributed to the gradually increasing sulfur vacancies toward the center. The proportion of negative trion (X-) in PL spectrum increases with increasing sulfur vacancies in WS2. The enhanced binding energy of X- suggests higher Fermi level and n-doping level with larger sulfur vacancy concentration. Our findings may be beneficial to the development of integrated devices, and also explore the defect-induced optical and electrical properties for nanophotonics.

AB The luminescence properties of y(NbxTa1-x)O-4 mixed crystals were studied. Local structure modifications arise due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the substitutional ions in the mixed crystal and can be traced using the luminescence spectroscopy. In particular, it is shown that the intensity of exciton emission under interband VUV excitation increases for intermediate values of x with the maximum at x = 0.4 relatively to the intensity observed in the constituents of the mixed crystals-YTaO4 and YNbO4. From the luminescence excitation spectra it follows that the probability of exciton creation from the separated e-h pairs increases for intermediate values of x as well. Using numerical simulation it is shown that the effect is connected with the variation of the thermalization length of hot electrons and holes, which is minimal at x = 0.4.

AB In recent years upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) received great attention because of their outstanding optical properties. Especially in bioanalytical applications this class of materials can overcome limitations of common probes like high background fluorescence or blinking. Nevertheless, the requirements for UCNPs to be applicable in biological samples, e.g. small size, water-dispersibility, excitation at low power density are in contradiction with the demand of high brightness. Therefore, a lot of attention is payed to the enhancement of the upconversion luminescence. This review discuss the recent trends and strategies to boost the brightness of UCNPs, classified in three main directions: a) improving the efficiency of energy absorption by the sensitizer via coupling to plasmonic or photonic structures or via attachment of ligands for light harvesting; b) minimizing non-radiative deactivation by variations in the architecture of UCNPs; and c) changing the excitation wavelength to get bright particles at low excitation power density for applications in aqueous systems. These strategies are critically reviewed including current limitations as well as future perspectives for the design of efficient UCNPs especially for sensing application in biological samples or cells.

AB R&D consortia have been regarded as an effective means of promoting innovation. Several R&D consortia obtain public financial support, which may affect their governance structure and performance. This study investigates the governance mechanisms of publicly funded R&D consortia and their effects on innovation performance. Few studies have empirically addressed the effect of project monitoring by the government or the role of project leadership in R&D consortia. Focusing on a major support program for R&D consortia in Japan and using a sample of 251 firms that participated in publicly funded R&D consortia from 2004 to 2009, we empirically confirm that to enhance firms' innovation performance, both project leadership as internal discipline and government monitoring as external discipline matter. Our results show that project leadership directly improves firms' innovation performance, while firms' commitment indirectly affects performance. Project leadership and government monitoring also promote commitment. Furthermore, both factors are complementary: consortia members are more willing to accept a project leader's coordination under stricter government monitoring.

AB This article examines how the excise tax affects firms' R&D investment, performance, and market strategy in the US medical device industry. The Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices beginning in January 2013, and thus this study compares the medical device firms with other high-tech firms before and after the tax incidence. Using COMPUSTAT data from 2006 to 2015, the author finds that the excise tax reduced R&D investment, sales revenue, gross margins, and earnings for medical device firms. In addition, the excise tax increased their global market sales intensity, global market diversification, and customer diversification in the US domestic market.

AB Innovation studies has largely focused on technological assets, while leaving other sources and forms of innovation less tackled. Among this neglected corpus, this article stresses the important role played by symbolic value in the consumption and production processes of innovative goods and services. I explore especially Internet-memes that represent iconic productions of the Internet 'lead culture', which embed significant symbolic values. This article therefore, refers to the economic sociology and innovation management literature to emphasise the force of these creations of symbolic value by culture-lead communities, through their production of Internet-memes. I argue that Internet-memes represent a widespread source of innovation in various sectors (from cultural industries to less expect ones like finance). While exploratory, the present study extends the debate on the nature of innovation, its symbolic and cultural aspects and its diffusion processes. It ultimately suggests potential new paths for innovation policies to tackle these new forms of innovations.

AB The aim of this article is to develop a model of change in urban context to map key steps towards changing an institutional logic: How can new ideas that aim at changing the dominant logic become practice in a city? To this end, the article explores the innovation process of institutions, thereby bringing together areas of research on institutional entrepreneurship, innovation processes, and transformation. Our model interlinks invention, innovation and adoption of new institutions to achieve a new institutional logic for more sustainable development in a city. We introduce 'workset' as an interim step between action and practice and identify local adopters as key for diffusion. We illustrate our framework using a case study of urban institutional entrepreneurship in the socioeconomic system of a German city. Our findings indicate that the roles of local institutional entrepreneurs and local adopters partly overlap, that worksets are crucial for broader diffusion of new institutions, and that a robust design supports the adoption of the institutional innovation.

AB Prior studies of open innovation have highlighted the effects of different flows of knowledge between firms and external partners such as flows of software code, technical solutions, or new product ideas-and how firms face a "paradox of openness" about how open to be to external sources while also appropriating value. There are increasingly flows of more provisional knowledge as well, in the form of product innovation rumors exchanged within online technology blogs. Our study objective was to understand how product innovation rumors are used by firms as both inflows and outflows of provisional knowledge and their effect on the innovation process. Using interview data within a high-technology firm whose forthcoming products were the subject of rumor within technology blogs, we develop propositions regarding how inflows of product innovation rumors affect innovation decisions (while addressing concerns about appropriability and intrafirm knowledge flows) and how outflows from firms may affect stakeholders outside the firm (through selective revealing and influence of technology blog editors). Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of open innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain.

AB As knowledge production becomes more specialized, studying complex and multi-faceted empirical realities becomes more difficult. This has created a growing need for cross-fertilization and collaboration between research disciplines. According to prior studies, the sharing of concepts, ideas and empirical domains with other disciplines may promote cross-fertilization. We challenge this one-sided view. Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated an effect we call 'encapsulation' - which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization. Our findings inform research on research specialization, cross-fertilization and effectiveness of inter-disciplinary collaboration.

AB Background: In the investigation of lung cancer, current practice in many healthcare systems would support bronchoscopy regardless of CT findings in patients with hemoptysis. We sought to identify the cause, the diagnostic yield of CT and bronchoscopy and the requirement for bronchoscopy in at risk patients with hemoptysis with a normal CT scan through our rapid access lung cancer clinic (RALC).
   Methods: Initially, a chart review was performed on all patients with hemoptysis (2011-2012) and thereafter a prospective analysis was performed (2013-2016).
   Results: Our analysis represents the largest study to date in outpatients with hemoptysis. In our retrospective study, 155 patients reported hemoptysis. Causes were lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (47%) and lung cancer (16%). Our prospective study included 182 patients. The causes of hemoptysis were RTIs (50%) and lung cancer (18%). There were no false negative CT-scans for lung cancer. 47/57 present with lung cancer underwent bronchoscopy and 43/47 were positive for lung cancer (92%). Patients with hemoptysis and lung cancer have a higher stage of malignancy with a predominance of squamous cell lung carcinoma. Smoking status, the duration of hemoptysis or description of hemoptysis were not predictive of lung cancer however lung cancer was not identified in patients age < 50.
   Conclusions: One sixth of patients presenting with hemoptysis to our lung cancer clinic had lung cancer. No patient identified with cancer related haemoptysis had a CT negative for lung cancer and a combination of bronchoscopy plus endobronchial ultrasound trans-bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) in those patients with a CT suspicious of lung cancer is 92% sensitive for lung cancer causing hemoptysis.

AB Background: Studies concerning sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory features of Mycobacterium kansasii pulmonary disease are few and based on small patient cohorts. The objective of the study was to evaluate characteristics of patients from whom M. kansasii respiratory isolates were recovered and to provide a detailed description of M. kansasii disease.
   Basic procedures: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients for whom at least one positive M. kansasii culture was obtained at the Department of Internal Medicine, Pulmonology and Allergology of the Warsaw Medical University between the year 2000 and 2015. Patients were categorized as having mycobacterial disease or as isolation cases based on the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) diagnostic criteria.
   Main findings: The study comprised of 105 patients (63 females, 42 males, mean age 64.6 +/- 17.8 years). Of these, 86 (81.9%) were diagnosed as having M. kansasii disease. The proportion of positive smear microscopy was significantly higher in patients with M. kansasii disease compared to M. kansasii isolation (P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between M. kansasii disease and isolation cases in terms of clinical symptoms or comorbidities. Patients with M. kansasii disease presented most commonly (43/86, 50%) fibro-cavitary disease upon radiology. Lesion distribution usually showed bilateral upper lobe involvement. Among the 191 isolates genotyped, all were identified as M. kansasii type I.
   Principal conclusions: The findings from this study support the relaxation of the diagnostic criteria for the definition of M. kansasii disease, set forth by ATS/IDSA. Molecular typing did not differentiate isolates from patients with true disease from those with isolation only; the role of bacterial virulence factors thus remains elusive.

   TERM; CARE
AB Background: As exercise may mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its effect has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials. The objective of the present systematic review was to describe the impact of exercise training on cognition in COPD.
   Methods: Electronic searches of four databases were performed from inception until March 24, 2015 and last updated 23rd October 2017. Included studies reported on at least one cognitive outcome before and after a formal exercise-training program in individuals with COPD. Two reviewers independently rated study quality using the Downs and Black checklist. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42015017884).
   Results: Seven articles, representing six exercise interventions in 293 individuals with COPD (55% males, mean age 67 +/- 2 year) were included. Although each study documented a significant pre-post training improvement in at least one cognitive domain, the heterogeneity in study design, exercise intervention and cognitive outcome measures among studies precluded a meta-analysis. The only randomized controlled trial available reported an improvement on a letter verbal fluency task in the exercise group only.
   Conclusions: Exercise training may positively impact cognition in COPD patients, but current evidence is limited by the heterogeneity of study design, exercise intervention and cognitive outcome measures. Future studies should emphasize comprehensive reporting of intervention parameters, including program length, type(s) of exercise, and duration of individual sessions, in order to facilitate applied insights to inform replication and/or program development.

AB Background: Previous studies showed an impairment of the LTP-like plasticity to TMS in restless legs syndrome (RLS). Clinically, repetitive TMS (rTMS) was effective in alleviating the sensory-motor complaints of patients, although the effects induced by low-frequency (inhibitory) rTMS have not yet been investigated. An impaired LTD-like mechanism of cortical plasticity has been hypothesized, which we have directly assessed in this pilot study.
   Methods: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right first dorsal interosseus muscle were recorded at the stimulus intensity of 110% of the resting motor threshold (rMT) from 13 right-handed patients and ten age-matched right-handed healthy controls. Median peak-to-peak amplitudes were calculated in all participants at baseline (T-0), after the first train of a single evening session of low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS over the left primary motor cortex (T-1), and after the whole rTMS procedure (T-2), which consists of 20 trains with 50 stimuli per train and intertrain interval of 30 s (1000 stimuli in total).
   Results: No differences were found for rMT and MEPs size between the two groups at To. Smaller MEPs amplitudes at both T-1 and T-2 were observed in all subjects, although this was significantly more pronounced in controls than in patients.
   Conclusions: Compared to normal individuals, patients exhibited an impairment of the LTD-like mechanisms induced by inhibitory rTMS, thus adding support to the involvement of GABA in RLS pathophysiology. Although future studies with a larger population are needed, TMS is confirmed to be effective in noninvasive probing of the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of RLS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Introduction: Sleep quality relates to mental health in clinical and non-clinical populations. However, there is more evidence of this relationship in clinical populations. Therefore, there is lack of evidence on how these variables relate and on which sociodemographic factors influence this relationship in non-clinical populations. In this study we hypothesize that in a non-clinical population sleep quality predicts mental health indicators and that age, country and gender moderate this relationship.
   Methods: In a sample of 1552 subjects from Portugal, Spain and Brazil, self-reported sleep quality and mental health indicators were assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, respectively. A multivariate linear regression model was used to test the research hypotheses.
   Results: This adjusted model explained 10.1%, 12.3% and 13.1% of the variability of Depression, Anxiety and Stress, respectively, suggesting multiple sources of variance.
   Conclusions: Our results confirmed that sleep quality predicts mental health in non-clinical populations, and that the variable country is a significant moderator of this relationship. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hundreds and hundreds of bacterial protein toxins are presently known. Traditionally, toxin identification begins with pathological studies of bacterial infectious disease. Following identification and cultivation of a bacterial pathogen, the protein toxin is purified from the culture medium and its pathogenic activity is studied using the methods of biochemistry and structural biology, cell biology, tissue and organ biology, and appropriate animal models, supplemented by bioimaging techniques. The ongoing and explosive development of high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic approaches have set in motion a revolution in many fields of biology, including microbiology. One consequence is that genes encoding novel bacterial toxins can be identified by bioinformatic and computational methods based on previous knowledge accumulated from studies of the biology and pathology of thousands of known bacterial protein toxins. Starting from the paradigmatic cases of diphtheria toxin, tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins, this review discusses traditional experimental approaches as well as bioinformatics and genomics-driven approaches that facilitate the discovery of novel bacterial toxins. We discuss recent work on the identification of novel botulinum-like toxins from genera such as Weissella, Chryseobacterium, and Enteroccocus, and the implications of these computationally identified toxins in the field. Finally, we discuss the promise of metagenomics in the discovery of novel toxins and their ecological niches, and present data suggesting the existence of uncharacterized, botulinum-like toxin genes in insect gut metagenomes.

AB Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) type FA is the only known naturally occurring chimeric BoNT of domains of BoNT/A and BoNT/F. BoNT/FA consists of an F5-like light chain (LC), a unique heavy chain (HC) trans-location domain, and a HC receptor binding domain similar to BoNT/A1. Previous analyses of purified BoNT/FA have indicated a 5-10-fold greater potency in cultured human or rat neurons as compared to BoNT/A1 and a 400-500-fold greater potency compared to BoNT/B1. However, in vivo potency in mice was about 5-fold lower than BoNT/A1 or/B1. In this report, species specificity was examined by cell-based assays using primary neurons from mice and examining VAMP1 and 2 cleavage. The data indicated similar potency of BoNT/FA in primary mouse spinal cord neurons as previously observed in primary rat and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neuronal cell models, and equal enzymatic cleavage of mouse VAMP1 and 2 isoforms. Since the duration of action of BoNTs is due to continuous enzymatic activity of the LC in the neuronal cytosol, BoNT/FA was expected to have a short duration of action due to its F-type LC. In this report the duration of action of BoNT/FA was compared to that of BoNT/Ft/F5, and/B1 in both hiPSC derived neurons and in the in vivo mouse model. The data indicate a duration of action of BoNT/FA similar to BoNT/B1, while BoNT/F5 had a short duration of action similar to BoNT/F1. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Local intramuscular injections of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) are effective in the treatment of focal dystonias, muscle spasms, and spasticity. However, not all clinical effects of BoNT/A may be explained by its action at peripheral nerve terminals. For example, the therapeutic benefit may exceed the duration of the peripheral neuroparalysis induced by the neurotoxin. In cellular and animal models, evidence demonstrates retrograde transport of catalytically active BoNT/A in projection neurons. This process of long-range trafficking is followed by transcytosis and action at second-order synapses. In humans, several physiological changes have been described following intramuscular delivery of BoNT/A. In particular, clinical studies have documented a decrease in Renshaw cell-mediated inhibition (i.e., recurrent inhibition), which may be important therapeutically for normalizing uncoordinated movements and overflow of muscle activity. In this review, we present data obtained in animal and experimental models that support direct central actions of BoNT/A mediated via retrograde axonal trafficking. We also discuss the reorganization of central circuitry induced by BoNT/A in patients, and the potential contribution of these effects to the therapeutic efficacy of the neurotoxin.

AB The therapeutic applications of botulinum toxin (BoNT) have grown manifold since its initial approval in 1989 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, and other facial spasms. Although it is the most potent biologic toxin known to man, long-term studies have established its safety in the treatment of a variety of neurologic and non-neurologic disorders. This review focuses on some novel and uncommon uses of BoNT in the treatment of movement disorders, such as oromandibular dystonia, including bruxism, anterocollis, camptocormia, tremor, tics, tardive and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and restless legs syndrome. Despite a paucity of randomized controlled trials and lack of FDA approval for these movement disorders, there is growing body of evidence that BoNT provides benefit to patients with these hyperkinetic movement disorders and that BoNT is a safe treatment when used by clinicians skilled in the administration of the drug for these conditions.

AB The aim of this article is to provide a review of the use of injections of botulinum toxin in the management of selected symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease and other forms of parkinsonism. Sialorrhea is defined as inability to control oral secretions, resulting in excessive saliva in the oropharynx. There is a high level of evidence for the treatment of sialorrhea in parkinsonism with injections of different forms of botulinum toxin type A as well as botulinum toxin type B. Tremor can be improved by the use of botulinum toxin injections but improved tremor control often leads to concomitant motor weakness, limiting its use. Levodopa induced dyskinesias are difficult to treat with botulinum toxin injections because of their variable frequency and direction. Apraxia of eyelid opening, a sign more commonly seen in progressive supranuclear palsy and other tauopathies, often improves after botulinum toxin injections. Recent data suggest that regardless of the underlying mechanism, pain in parkinsonism can be alleviated by botulinum toxin injections. Finally, freezing of gait, camptocormia and Pisa syndrome in parkinsonism almost invariably fail to respond to botulinum toxin injections. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stagnant water bodies have generally received little attention regarding the presence of endocrine disruptive compounds, although they can integrate diverse pollutants from multiple different sources. Many compounds of anthropogenic as well as natural origin can contribute to the overall estrogenicity of surface waters and some of them can exhibit adverse effects on aquatic biota even in very low concentrations. This study focused on freshwater ponds and reservoirs affected by water blooms and determined the estrogenic activity of water by in vitro bioassay as well as concentrations of several important groups of estrogenic compounds (estrogenic hormones, alkylphenols, and phytoestrogens) by LC-MS/MS analyses. Estrogenic hormones were found at concentrations up to 7.1 ng.L-1, similarly to flavonoids, whose concentrations did not exceed 12.5 ng.L-1. Among alkylphenols, only bisphenol A and 4-tert-octylphenol were detected in levels reaching 100 ng.L-1 at maximum. Estrogenic activity of water samples varied from below the quantification limit to 1.95 ng.L-1. There does not seem to be any general causal link of the massive phytoplankton occurrence with the estrogenicity of water or concentration of phytoestrogens, since they showed no direct relationship with the phytoplankton abundance or composition across sites. The contribution of the analysed compounds to the estrogenic activity was calculated in three scenarios. In minimum scenario, just the compounds above quantification limit (LOQ) were taken into account and for most samples, only minor part (<6%) of the biological activity could be explained. In the mean and maximum scenarios, we included also compounds below LOQ into the calculations at the level of LOQ/2 and LOQ respectively. In these cases, a considerable part of the estrogenic activity could be attributed to the possible presence of steroid estrogens below LOQ However, for the samples with estrogenic activity greater than 1 ng.L-1, more than 50% of the estrogenic activity remained unexplained even in the maximum scenario. Probably other compounds or possible interactions between individual substances cause the estrogenic activity in these types of water bodies and in this case, the results of LC-MS/MS analyses cannot sufficiently predict the biological effects. A complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency constructed a 4000-m(2) parking lot in Edison, New Jersey in 2009. The parking lot is surfaced with three permeable pavements [permeable interlocking concrete pavers (PICP), pervious concrete (PC), and porous asphalt (PA)]. Samples of each permeable pavement infiltrate, surface runoff from traditional asphalt, and rainwater were analyzed in duplicate for 22 metals (total and dissolved) for 6 years.
   In more than 99% of the samples, the concentration of barium, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel and zinc, and in 60%-90% of the samples, the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and antimony in infiltrates from all three permeable pavements met both the groundwater effluent limitations (GEL) and maximum contaminant levels (MCL). The concentration of aluminum (50%) and iron (93%) in PICP infiltrates samples exceed the GELs; however, the concentration in more than 90% samples PA and PC infiltrates met the GELS.
   No measurable difference in metal concentrations was found from the five sources for arsenic, cadmium, lead, antimony, and tin. Large concentrations of eleven metals, including manganese, copper, aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, silica, strontium and vanadium, were detected in surface runoff than the rainwater. Chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, aluminum, zinc, iron and magnesium concentrations in PICP infiltrates; calcium, barium, and strontium concentrations in PA infiltrates; sodium, potassium and vanadium concentrations in PC infiltrates were statistically larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates.

AB Packing nano mediators into anaerobic system is an attractive technology to strengthen refractory pollutant removal and methane production from wastewater, but is limited by the drawbacks such as easy loss and poor mass transfer. In this study, GAC/NZVI mediator was added into EGSB reactor to investigate the enhancement effects and mechanism for anaerobic digestion of tetracycline wastewater and its impacts on microbial community structure. The results indicated that GAC/NZVI could enhance COD and TOC removal by 12.1% and 10.3%, while have no evident influence on tetracycline removal and sulfide production. The biogas production and methane content were increased by 21.2% and 26.9%, respectively. GAC/NZVI addition resulted in formation of densely packed aggregates, and evidently increased the electrical conductivity and EPS content in sludge. Fe content in sludge was 20.43% with the loss of only 5.4% during 34 d operation. Microbial community analysis revealed that GAC/NZVI addition could both increase the Chao 1 richness index and Shannon diversity index of bacteria and archaea. It was notable that total methanogens contents increased from 74.7% to 81.74% at genera level, resulting in higher methane production, while Treponema increase might promote the degradation of tetracycline and its metabolite, leading to higher COD removal.

AB Intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) was realized in a macroporous carrier in which a photocatalyst was present on the outer surface, while a biofilm accumulated inside the carrier. In ICPB, photocatalysis products are rapidly biodegraded by a protected biofilm, leading to mineralization of the refractory organics, such as antibiotics. However, mineralization in ICPB could be compromised if the photocatalysis products remain refractory or are inhibitory. To address this, we attempted to increase metabolic activity by providing a readily biodegradable co-substrate (acetate) that could act as a source of energy and electrons to improve biotransformation and mineralization of the refractory antibiotic tetracycline (TCH). When we added acetate during ICPB of TCH, TCH removal increased by similar to 5%, mineralization increased by similar to 20%, and almost all photocatalysis products disappeared. Acetate addition also led to an increase in active biomass, an increase in the biomass's respiratory activity, and evolution of the microbial community to having more members able to biodegrade photocatalysis and biotransformation intermediates. Thus, providing an easily biodegradable co-substrate was an effective means for enhancing TCH removal and mineralization with the ICPB technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing attention has been paid to the anammox community for its significant function in high efficiency wastewater treatment. However, bacterial interaction in terms of bacterial communication is still elusive. This study firstly explored the intra- and interspecific communication of bacteria in the anammox community using metagenomic sequence data obtained during bioreactor operation. We verified the existence of multiple bacterial communication gene (BCG) subtypes by alignment with the constructed BCG database containing 11 identified gene subtypes. Bacterial communication was more active at the initial start-up than in the high loading-rate phase, and was correlated with the gradually decreasing bacterial diversity. Hdts, one of the key genes that produced the intraspecific signaling molecule AHL, and RpfF, the key gene that produced the intra- and interspecific signaling molecule DSF, were the primary communication engines in the anammox community because of their high abundance. Anammox bacteria mainly used Hdts genes to communicate with others, while RpfF gene played a core role characterized by their multiple correlations with other BCG subtypes. Interestingly, bacteria with abundant BCGs were more inclined to interact with the bacteria with the same functional traits, indicating the potential communication-related interaction among these bacteria in addition to the frequently reported substrate co-utilization. This highlights the primary importance of AHL and DSF for the anammox community, and thereby hints at a potential strategy for the target regulation of the signals to improve anammox viability and competitive capacity in wastewater treatment.

AB This study examined the electrochemical (EC) reduction of iodinated contrast media (ICM) exemplified by iopamidol and diatrizoate. The method of rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) was used to elucidate rates and mechanisms of the EC reactions of the selected ICMs. Experiments were carried at varying hydrodynamic conditions, concentrations of iopamidol, diatrizoate, natural organic matter (NOM) and model compounds (resorcinol, catechol, guaiacol) which were used to examine interactions between products of the EC reduction of ICMs and halogenation-active species. The data showed that iopamidol and diatrizoate were EC-reduced at potentials < -0.45 V vs. s.c.e. In the range of potentials -0.65 to -0.85 V their reduction was mass transfer-controlled. The presence of NOM and model compounds did not affect the EC reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate but active iodine species formed as a result of the EC-induced transformations of these ICMs reacted readily with NOM and model compounds. These data provide more insight into the nature of generation of iodine-containing by-products in the case of reductive degradation of ICMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of in situ electrochemical generation of ferrous (Fe(II)) ions for phosphorus (P) removal in wastewater treatment was investigated with attention to the efficacy, kinetics and mechanism. At concentrations typical of municipal wastewater, P could be removed by in situ Fe(II) with removal efficiency higher than achieved on addition of FeSO4 and close to that of FeCl3 under both anoxic and oxic conditions. The generation of alkalinity due to water electrolysis at the cathode created much higher pH conditions compared to FeSO4 dosing thereby resulting in very different pathways of Fe solid phase formation and associated P removal mechanisms. The remarkably similar dependence of P removal on accumulated Fe for all investigated currents, initial P concentrations and DO conditions indicated that kinetic aspects did not play a role in P removal during in situ Fe(II) dosing. Thermodynamic modelling was undertaken to investigate possible solid phase formation pathways under anoxic conditions and these insights were extended to oxic conditions. The exclusive formation of ferrous hydroxide during anoxic in situ Fe(II) dosing implied that P removal occurred via coprecipitation and adsorption. Under oxic conditions, the high pH conditions would have resulted in rapid Fe(II) oxidation and formation of ferric oxyhydroxides with associated coprecipitation and adsorption effecting P removal in a similar pattern to that observed under anoxic conditions. In situ Fe(II) dosing represents a versatile option for chemical P removal with the precise control of Fe dosage to optimize FeP forms for possible P recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has posed a major threat to both human health and environmental ecosystem. Although the disinfection has been proved to be efficient to control the occurrence of pathogens, little effort is dedicated to revealing potential impacts of disinfection on transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly for free-living ARGs in final disinfected effluent of urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP). Here, we investigated the effects of chlorine disinfection on the occurrence and concentration of both extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and intracellular ARGs (iARGs) in a full-scale UWWTP over a year. We reported that the concentrations of both eARGs and iARGs would be increased by the disinfection with chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Specifically, chlorination preferentially increased the abundances of eARGs against macrolide (ermB), tetracycline (tetA, tetB and tetC), sulfonamide (sul1, sul2 and sul3), beta-lactam (ampC), aminoglycosides (aph(2')-Id), rifampicin (katG) and vancomycin (vanA) up to 3.8 folds. Similarly, the abundances of iARGs were also increased up to 7.8 folds after chlorination. In terms of correlation analyses, the abundance of Escherichia coli before chlorination showed a strong positive correlation with the total eARG concentration, while lower temperature and higher ammonium concentration were assumed to be associated with the concentration of iARGs. This study suggests the chlorine disinfection could increase the abundances of both iARGs and eARGs, thereby posing risk of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in environments.

AB Along southern California beaches, the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) used to quantify the potential presence of fecal contamination in coastal recreational waters have been previously documented to be higher during wet weather conditions (typically winter or spring) than those observed during summer dry weather conditions. FIB are used for management of recreational waters because measurement of the bacterial and viral pathogens that are the potential causes of illness in beachgoers exposed to stormwater can be expensive, time-consuming, and technically difficult. Here, we use droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (digital PCR) and digital reverse transcriptase PCR (digital RT-PCR) assays for direct quantification of pathogenic viruses, pathogenic bacteria, and source-specific markers of fecal contamination in the stormwater discharges. We applied these assays across multiple storm events from two different watersheds that discharge to popular surfing beaches in San Diego, CA. Stormwater discharges had higher FIB concentrations as compared to proximal beaches, often by ten-fold or more during wet weather. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that the stormwater discharges contained human fecal contamination, despite the presence of separate storm sewer and sanitary sewer systems in both watersheds. Human fecal source markers (up to 100% of samples, 20-12440 HF183 copies per 100 ml) and human norovirus (up to 96% of samples, 25-495 NoV copies per 100 ml) were routinely detected in stormwater discharge samples. Potential bacterial pathogens were also detected and quantified: Campylobacter spp. (up to 100% of samples, 16-504 gene copies per 100 ml) and Salmonella (up to 25% of samples, 6-86 gene copies per 100 ml). Other viral human pathogens were also measured, but occurred at generally lower concentrations: adenovirus (detected in up to 22% of samples, 14-41 AdV copies per 100 ml); no enterovirus was detected in any stormwater discharge sample. Higher concentrations of avian source markers were noted in the stormwater discharge located immediately downstream of a large bird sanctuary along with increased Campylobacter concentrations and notably different Campylobacter species composition than the watershed that had no bird sanctuary. This study is one of the few to directly measure an array of important bacterial and viral pathogens in stormwater discharges to recreational beaches, and provides context for stormwater-based management of beaches during high risk wet-weather periods. Furthermore, the combination of culture-based and digital PCR-derived data is demonstrated to be valuable for assessing hydrographic relationships, considering delivery mechanisms, and providing foundational exposure information for risk assessment.

AB Enhanced pond systems (EPS) consist of a series of ponds that have been designed to work in synergy to provide both cost-effective enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery, in the form of algal biomass, for beneficial reuse. Due to the limited number of full-scale EPS systems worldwide, our understanding of factors governing both enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery is limited. This paper investigates the seasonal performance of a full-scale municipal wastewater EPS with respect to nutrient removal from the liquid fraction, microalgal biomass production and subsequent removal through the system. In the high rate algal pond both microalgal productivity (determined as organic matter and chlorophyll a biomass) and NH4-N removal varied seasonally, with significantly higher biomass and removal rates in summer than in spring (p < 0.05) or winter (p < 0.01). Microalgal biomass was not successfully harvested in the algal harvester pond (AHP), most likely due to poor flocc formation coupled with relatively short hydraulic residence time (HRT). High percentage removal rates, from sedimentation and zooplankton grazing, were achieved in the maturation pond (MP) series, particularly in winter and spring. However, in summer decreased efficiency of biomass removal and the growth of new microalgal species suggests that summer-time HRT in the MPs could be shortened. Further modifications to the operation of the AHP, seasonal changes in the HRT of the MPs and potential harvesting of zooplankton grazers are all potential strategies for improving resource recovery and producing a higher quality final discharge effluent.

AB Secondary water supply systems (SWSSs) refer to the in-building infrastructures (e.g., water storage tanks) used to supply water pressure beyond the main distribution systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of SWSSs on microbial community structure and the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens, the latter of which are an emerging public health concern. Higher numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, Legionella and mycobacterial gene markers were found in public building taps served by SWSSs relative to the mains, regardless of the flushing practice (P < 0.05). In residential buildings, genes of L. pneumomhila, Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba vermiformis were primarily detected in tanks and taps compared to the mains. Long water retention time, warm temperature and loss of disinfectant residuals promoted microbial growth and colonization of potential pathogens in SWSSs. Varied levels of microbial community shifts were found in different types of SWSSs during water transportation from the distribution main to taps, highlighting the critical role of SWSSs in shaping the drinking water microbiota. Overall, the results provided insight to factors that might aid in controlling pathogen proliferation in real-world water systems using SWSSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cathodic methanogenesis is a promising method for accelerating and stabilising bioenergy recovery in anaerobic processes. The change in composition of microbial (especially methanogenic) communities in response to an applied potential-and especially the associated pH gradient-is critical for achieving this goal, but is not well understood in cathodic biofilms. We found here that the pH-polarised region in the 2 mm surrounding the cathode ranged from 6.9 to 10.1, as determined using a pH microsensor; this substantially affected methane production rate as well as microbial community structure. Miseq sequencing data of a highly conserved region of the mcrA gene revealed a dramatic variation in alpha diversity of methanogens concentrated in electrode biofilms under the applied potential, and confirmed that the dominant microbes at the cathode were hydrogenotrophic methanogens (mostly basophilic Methanobacterium alcaliphilum). These results indicate that regional pH variation in the microenvironment surrounding the electrode is an ecological niche enriched with Methanobacterium. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The chemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewaters is complex and is known to vary by operator, geologic formation, and fluid age. A time series of hydraulic fracturing fluids, flowback fluids, and produced waters was collected from two adjacent Marcellus Shale gas wells for organic chemical composition analyses using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Hierarchical clustering was used to compare and extract ions related to different fluid ages and many halogenated organic molecular ions were identified in flowback fluids and early produced waters based on exact mass. Iodinated organic compounds were the dominant halogen class in these clusters and were nearly undetectable in hydraulic fracturing fluid prior to injection. The iodinated ions increased in flowback and remained elevated after ten months of well production. We suggest that these trends are mainly driven by dissolved organic matter reacting with reactive halogen species formed abiotically through oxidizing chemical additives applied to the well and biotically via iodide-oxidizing bacteria. Understanding the implications of these identified halogenated organic compounds will require future investigation in to their structures and environmental fate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   Thoracic spinal stenosis
ID BONE SCALPEL; PIEZOSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Laminoplasty and laminectomy are 2 common surgical procedures used in treating degenerative and neoplastic diseases of the spinal canal. Routinely used instruments, such as the Kerrison rongeur and high-speed drill, can result in potentially serious complications, such as dural injury and thermal and mechanical damage to neurovascular structures. We adopted piezoelectric bone surgery, which permits a selective cut of mineralized tissues, to perform posterior procedures on the thoracic spine, where the relationship between bone and the spinal cord is critical. The aim of this article was to evaluate the use of piezoelectric surgery for performing dorsal spine laminectomy and laminoplasty.
   METHODS: The Mectron piezosurgery device was developed for cutting bone with microvibrations that are created by the piezoelectric effect. This instrument allows a safe and precise bone cut, and it is characterized by no heat generation, thus avoiding thermal injury to bone and soft tissues. We used this device to perform 8 laminoplasties for tumors of the dorsal spine and 2 laminectomies for thoracic spinal stenosis in 10 patients.
   RESULTS: There were no procedure-related intraoperative complications, such as dural injury or damage to neural structures.
   CONCLUSIONS: The piezoelectric device showed excellent results in terms of safety and precise bone cutting properties when performing posterior surgical procedures in the dorsal spine, where thermal injury produced by the conventionally used drill may damage the spinal cord closer to bony elements.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe an endoscopic anterolateral surgical route to the lateral portion of Meckel's cave.
   METHODS: A sublabial transmaxillary transpterygoid approach was performed in 6 cadaveric heads (12 sides). A craniectomy was drilled between the foramen rotundum (FR) and foramen ovale (FO) with defined borders. Extradural dissection was performed up to the V2-V3 junction of the trigeminal ganglion. The working space was analyzed using anatomic measurements.
   RESULTS: The approach allowed for extradural dissection to the lateral aspect of Meckel's cave and provided excellent exposure of V2, V3, and the V2-V3 junction at the gasserian ganglion. The mean distance between the FR and FO along the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone was 21.3 +/- 2.8 mm (range, 18-24.4 mm). The mean distance of V2 and V3 segments from their foramina to the gasserian ganglion junction was 12.0 +/- 2.3 mm (range, 9.2-14.6 mm) and 15.2 +/- 2.7 mm (range, 12.3-18.5 mm), respectively (6 sides). A potential working area (mean area, 89 mm(2)) is described. Its superior edge is from the FR to the V2-V3 junction at the gasserian ganglion, its inferior edge is from the FO to the V2-V3 junction at the gasserian ganglion, and its base is from the FO to the FR. The surgical anatomy of the infratemporal fossa, pterygopalatine fossa, and lateral Meckel's cave is highlighted.
   CONCLUSIONS: An endoscopic anterolateral sublabial transmaxillary transpterygoid approach between the FR and FO avoids crossing critical neurovascular structures within the cavernous sinus and pterygopalatine fossa and can provide a safe surgical corridor for laterally based lesions in Meckel's cave.

AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic sinus occlusion complicated with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) can be treated successfully endovascularly. However, no studies have reported the use of endovascular transvenous approaches alone to recanalize the occluded sinuses for treatment of the involved dAVFs without stent deployment. In this study, we presented a 75-year-old man with occlusion of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses complicated with a dAVF.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This patient initially suffered intermittent headache, nausea, and vomiting but developed seizures and hemiplegic paralysis 2 months later. Neurologic examination revealed mildly decreased motor function in grade IV in the left limb. Intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture was 300 mm H2O. Magnetic resonance imaging venography disclosed sinus occlusion and dAVFs accounting for encephaledema. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses and cortical reflux with the sinus junction unobstructed. The feeding arteries of the left transverse sinus dAVFs were muscular branches of the left vertebral artery and external carotid artery, and the draining vein was from the superior sagittal sinus to the contralateral transverse sinus. Balloon angioplasty plus mechanical cracking (pulling a microcatheter back and forth) was used to recanalize the occluded sinuses. The symptoms disappeared after endovascular recanalization of the occluded left transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, and follow-up venography revealed opened sinuses with complete disappearance of the dAVF.
   CONCLUSION: Endovascular transvenous recanalization may be a better alternative therapy for selected patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas complicated by sinus occlusion without stent deployment.

AB BACKGROUND: We report the surgical management of a lesional drug resistant epilepsy caused by a meningioangiomatosis associated with a type Illc focal cortical dysplasia located in the left supplementary motor area in a young male patient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A first anatomically based partial surgical resection was performed on an 11-year-old under general anesthesia without infra operative mapping, which allowed for postoperative seizure control (Engel IA) for 6 years. The patient then exhibited intractable right sensatory and aphasic focal onset seizures despite 2 appropriate antiepileptic drugs. A second functional-based surgical resection was performed using intraoperative corticosubcortical functional mapping with direct electrical stimulation under awake conditions. A complete surgical resection was performed, and a left partial supplementary motor area syndrome was observed. At 6 months post-operatively, the patient is seizure free (Engel IA) with an ongoing decrease in antiepileptic drug therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative functional brain mapping can be applied to preserve the brain function and networks around a meningioangiomatosis to facilitate the resection of potentially epileptogenic perilesional dysplastic cortex and to tailor the extent of resection to functional boundaries.

   VIDEOANGIOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative blood flow assessments during cerebral bypass would ideally assess vessel patency, downstream perfusion, and risk of postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS). Previous studies using indocyanine green-based flow analyses (ICG-BFA) have identified multiple parameters that can intraoperatively track bypass-related changes in cerebral perfusion and potentially predict postoperative risk of HPS. Herein, we determine the most robust parameter and anatomic location for intraoperative ICG-BFA assessment of bypass-related perfusion changes and prediction of postoperative risk of HPS.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of an institutional review board-approved prospective database identified patients undergoing superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass. Demographic and clinical information, as well as manually calculated and automated pre-and postbypass intraoperative ICG-BFA data from cortical, arterial, and venous regions of interest were recorded and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Seven patients underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass (4 Moyamoya, 3 carotid occlusions). Average age was 48.2 +/- 13.9 years (3 female, 4 male). Although all parameters measured showed trends toward improvement postbypass, only changes in arterial and venous automated ICG-BFA slope (also known as blood flow index [maximum intensity/rise time]) reached significance. None of the patients experienced symptomatic HPS, despite 5 of 7 (71.4%) having an increased HPS risk based on previously published ICG-BFA data.
   CONCLUSIONS: ICG-BFA has utility for the intraoperative assessment of bypass-related changes in cerebral perfusion, with automated blood flow index being the most robustly affected parameter. Although previously published ICG-BFA indices did not predict the development of symptomatic postoperative HPS, larger-scale studies correlating observed ICG-BFA changes with risk of HPS are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to discuss along with literature knowledge the post-traumatic clinical progression of cases with symptoms of transient spinal cord impact and cases of spinal concussion following exposure of the vertebral column to vertical forces.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 cases, all falls from height, were diagnosed with spinal concussion. It was determined that the vertebral column had been exposed to the effects of vertical forces, and the spinal cord had been affected by vertical forces. In all cases, spinal magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic X-ray examinations were performed at the time of admission. Clinical symptoms of the cases were recorded by scoring based on the Torg Grading System.
   RESULTS: Cases were started on conservative treatment because radiologic symptoms that would explain the clinical symptoms could not be detected. Most frequently encountered were the neurologic symptoms related to the upper thoracic and lower cervical segments being affected. In 7 cases, urinary incontinence was also detected. Symptoms related to the spinal cord being affected were completely recovered in 1-3 days in all cases.
   CONCLUSION: As a result of the vertebral column being affected by vertical forces, the most frequently affected are the thoracic segments of the spinal cord. These cases show similarities to real spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality cases when evaluated along with clinical and radiologic symptoms. Absolute differential diagnosis from real spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality cases cannot be made until total neurologic recovery takes place.

   injury; SCIWORA
ID RADIOGRAPHIC ABNORMALITIES; SCIWORA
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality (SCIWORA) show varying clinical prognostic courses independent of radiological findings. The fact that patients cannot be evaluated using a specific terminologic standard has led to the emergence of the real SCIWORA definition. In this study, clinical progressions of 11 patients diagnosed with SCIWORA were analyzed, and terminologic differences were discussed.
   METHODS: The clinical findings of 11 adults with a diagnosis of SCIWORA at the time of diagnosis and in the long term were analyzed according to the ASIA classification scheme. The presence of a correlation between radiological findings from the early and late periods and the clinical findings was investigated. High-dose methyl-prednisolone treatment was administered to all newly diagnosed patients in the early period, and the clinical response was observed. Clinical, prognostic, and radiological comparisons with SCIWORA cases reported in the literature were conducted.
   RESULTS: Seven patients received a diagnosis of cervical SCIWORA, and 4 patients had thoracal SCIWORA. Neuro-logic findings at the time of diagnosis and in the early and late periods vary independent of radiological findings. In the cases where significant neurologic recovery was not observed within the first 3 days, significant recovery also was not seen in the later period. In the cases where neurologic recovery was seen, improvements in sphincter function and sensory and motor deficits were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients diagnosed with SCIWORA, early neurologic response is the determining factor for prognosis. Clinical findings and prognosis demonstrate no correlation with radiological findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior, direct lateral, and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions (ALIF, DLIF, and TLIF) are usually combined with posterior fixation to treat degenerative spinal diseases. Outcomes of ALIF, TLIF, or DLIF combined with a new wedge-shaped interfacet cage plate have not been reported. We assessed early clinical outcomes of patients treated with interbody fusion and facet fixation using a titanium wedge-shaped cage plate.
   METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included patients (n = 80) who underwent 1-level interbody fusion and facet joint fixation via ALIF (n = 24) or DLIF (n = 26) with bilateral facet fixation or TLIF with ipsilateral pedicle screws and contralateral facet fixation (n = 30). Duration of surgery, estimated blood loss, pain (visual analog scale), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and Macnab score were assessed up to 12 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: All patients had a significant decrease in pain scores (P < 0.01) and an increase in ODI scores (P < 0.01), without significant differences between treatment groups. Most surgical outcomes were excellent or good (n = 75, 93.8%) with 5 patients (6.2%) having satisfactory outcomes. Within 2 months, all patients returned to their previous work (66, 82.5%) or lighter work (14, 17.5%). Two patients had fusion failure requiring reoperation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Facet fixation with the wedge-shaped cage plate was associated with minimal soft tissue damage and a low level of postoperative pain. ALIF, DLIF, and TLIF combined with this technique showed good early postoperative clinical and radiologic outcomes. Further studies are needed to assess long-term results and compare them with other fusion methods.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stent-assisted coil embolization (SAC) is one of the treatment options for patients with intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical outcomes of patients who underwent coil embolization for acutely ruptured aneurysms without antiplatelet premedication.
   METHODS: A total of 449 patients with acutely ruptured aneurysms underwent endovascular treatment without antiplatelet premedication between April 2006 and October 2015. Among them, 55 patients underwent SAC (SAC group) and 394 underwent coiling without stent assistance (non-SAC group). Periprocedural complications and clinical outcomes at postictal 6 months were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The rate of hemorrhagic complications showed no significant difference (SAC group vs. non-SAC group, 9.1% vs. 4.8%). Although procedural thromboembolism occurred more frequently in the SAC group (25.5% vs. 12.4%; P = 0.01), poor clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale score >= 3) were comparable (30.9% vs. 22.1%). In the multivariate analysis, Hunt-Hess grade (odds ratio [OR] = 4.22; P < 0.001), hemorrhagic complications (OR = 4.01; P = 0.018), and age (OR = 1.04, P = 0.001) were independent predictors of poor clinical outcomes, but stent-assisted coil embolization and procedural thromboembolism were not.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although procedure-related thrombo-embolism occurred more frequently, comparable treatment outcomes could be achieved with antiplatelet premedication-free SAC in patients with acutely ruptured aneurysms. The use of stents and thromboembolic complications were not significant risk factors for poor clinical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of white matter injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the mammillothalamic tract (MTT) or corticospinal tract (CST) is more affected by aSAH in the same patients with good outcome (Grade 5 on Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   METHODS: Between June 2013 and September 2016, 21 patients with aSAH with good outcome and 21 sex- and age-matched normal healthy control participants were recruited. DTI was obtained at 8.92 +/- 2.4 weeks after onset. Moreover, reconstruction of the CST and the MTT was completed with DTI-studio software. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured. In addition, the motricity index and MiniMental State Examination scores were obtained.
   RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference detected in the ADC and FA values of the CST between the patient and control groups (P > 0.05). On the contrary, there was a statistically significant difference in ADC and FA values of the MTT between the patient and control groups (P < 0.05). In addition, in the patient group, no correlation (P > 0.05) was observed between motricity index scores and DTI parameters (ADC and FA), whereas the Mini-Mental State Examination showed a positive correlation with FA (r = 0.591, P = 0.029) without correlation to ADC (r = 0.142, P = 0.628).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with good outcomes (Grade 5 on Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months) after aSAH appeared to suffer an injury of the MTT without an associated injury of the CST compared with the control group. This injury showed a correlation with cognitive dysfunction.

AB OBJECTIVE: According to level 2 evidence, earlier evacuation of acute subdural or epidural hematomas necessitating surgery is associated with better outcome. Hence, guidelines recommend performing these procedures immediately. Literature on the extent and causes of prehospital and intrahospital intervals in patients with trauma requiring emergent craniotomies is almost completely lacking. Studies delineating and refining the interval before thrombolytic agent administration in ischemic stroke have dramatically reduced the door-to-needle time. A similar exercise for trauma-to-decompression time might result in comparable reductions.
   We aim to map intervals in emergent trauma craniotomies in our level 1 trauma center, screen for associated factors, and propose possible ways to reduce these intervals.
   METHODS: We analyzed patients who were primarily referred (1R; n = 45) and secondarily referred (after computed tomography imaging in a community hospital [2R; n = 22]) to our emergency department (ED) and underwent emergent trauma craniotomies between 2010 and 2016.
   METHODS: We analyzed patients who were primarily referred (1R; n = 45) and secondarily referred (after computed tomography imaging in a community hospital [2R; n = 22]) to our emergency department (ED) and underwent emergent trauma craniotomies between 2010 and 2016.
   RESULTS: Median prehospital interval (between emergency call and arrival at the ED) was 42 minutes for 1R patients. Median intrahospital interval (between initial ED arrival and skin incision [SI]) was 140 minutes and 268 minutes for 1R and 2R patients, respectively. In 1R patients, ED- SI interval was positively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale score (rho = .49; P < 0.001), but not with age, time of ED arrival, or extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 6 months.
   Based on outlier analysis, we propose prehospital and intrahospital measures to improve performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on emergency call-SI interval in emergent trauma craniotomy, with a median of 174 minutes and >297 minutes for 1R and 2R patients, respectively, in our center.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal epidural lymphoma with compressive myelopathy is a rarely found condition. The aims of this study are to describe the clinical features and to analyze its treatment outcome and prognostic factors.
   METHODS: We searched for all pediatric patients with newly diagnosed spinal epidural lymphoma from 1999 to 2014 in our institution. We evaluated the clinical features, including neurologic status, time interval to treatment, treatment modality, and outcomes.
   RESULTS: Twelve of 302 pediatric patients with lymphoma (4.0%) presented with compressive myelopathy, and they were all found to have spinal epidural lymphoma. In 11 patients, epidural space was the only site of lymphoma involvement. The median age was 9 years (range, 5-15 years). Common initial symptoms were back pain and low extremity weakness. Surgery was performed on 9 patients, biopsy on 2 patients, and radiation therapy on 1 patient. In 9 patients who received surgery, 6 patients with preoperative motor power grade >= II attained improvement in weakness. Three patients with preoperative motor power grade <II had no improvement in weakness at 1 month post-operatively. One patient who received radiation therapy had no improvement. All patients who had surgery developed some degree of kyphotic deformity later.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal epidural lymphoma with compressive myelopathy is a serious disease in children necessitating urgent treatment. Preserved motor power is a meaningful prognostic factor of neurologic improvement. Treatment should be individualized based on the patient's neurologic condition.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the Assessment System of Thoracolumbar Osteoporotic Fracture (ASTLOF), which can effectively guide the treatment of single-segmental thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures but fails to guide the treatment of multisegmental thoracolumbar mild osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (MSTMOVCF).
   METHODS: A prospective case series study was designed to enroll elderly patients with MSTMOVCF who had been treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty/percutaneous vertebroplasty (PKP/PVP) from June 2013 to June 2016. Surgery indication was based on revised ASTLOF. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used to evaluate the postoperative improvement of back pain, and clinical effects were assessed according to the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Some imaging measures, such as height of anterior and middle column and Beck value, were measured before the operation and 12 months after the operation. Complications also were collected.
   RESULTS: A total of 193 patients underwent PKP/PVP surgery. At postoperative 2 days, 3 months, and 1-year follow-up, whereas VAS and ODI scores decreased (P < 0.0001, for all) significantly as well as SF-36, the height of anterior and middle column increased (P < 0.0001, for all) compared with preoperation. Beck value at 1-year followup was greater than preoperation (P = 0.001). The improvement rate of ODI was 86.4 +/- 8.3%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MSTMOVCF who undergo surgery with PKP/PVP can achieve great clinical results. Patients with the sum of revised ASTLOF scores of multiple injured vertebrae >= 5 should be recommended for surgery. The consistency and repeatability of the revised ASTLOF need further study.

AB BACKGROUND: Giant pituitary adenomas represent a surgical challenge. We present the results of the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for giant pituitary adenomas.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 55 patients with giant pituitary adenomas (>4 cm in maximum diameter) who underwent surgery with an EEA between 2008 and 2016. Factors affecting the extent of resection were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 55.5 years. Tumors were nonfunctional in all but 4 patients, including 2 with growth hormone secreting tumors, 1 with an adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting tumor, and 1 with prolactinoma. Gross total resection was achieved in 24 patients (44%), and near-total resection (>90%) was achieved in 26 patients (47%). A multilobular configuration (P = 0.002) and cavernous sinus invasion (P = 0.044) negatively affected the extent of resection, whereas tumor size, intraventricular, and anterior or posterior fossa extension did not. Ten patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients with hormone-secreting adenomas required adjuvant medical and/or radiotherapy to achieve biochemical remission. Postoperative vision was improved or normalized in 32 patients (66%), stable in 15 patients (31%), and worsened in 1 patient. A new hormonal deficit occurred in 8 patients (17%), whereas recovery of an existing hormonal deficit occurred in 6 patients (20%). The mean duration of follow-up was 41 months. Tumor recurrence/progression occurred in 6 patients (11%). Complications included apoplexy of residual tumor resulting in ischemic stroke in 1 patient, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak in 1 patient, and permanent diabetes insipidus in 4 patients (7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery with the EEA is an excellent option for managing giant pituitary adenomas. It results in superior clinical outcomes to those obtained using traditional microscopic transphenoidal and transcranial approaches as reported in the literature.

AB OBJECTIVE: Few studies have evaluated the need for supplementary instrumentation after lumbar interbody fusion under the condition of whole body vibration (WBV) that is typically present in vehicles. This study aimed to determine the effect of posterior pedicle screw fixation on dynamic response of the whole lumbar spine to vertical WBV after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).
   METHODS: A previously validated nonlinear, osteoliga-mentous finite element (FE) model of the intact L1-sacrum human lumbar spine was modified to simulate single-level (L4-L5) TLIF without and with bilateral pedicle screw fixation (BPSF). Transit dynamic analysis was performed on the 2 developed models under a sinusoidal vertical vibration load of +/- 40 N and a compressive follower preload of 400 N. The resulting dynamic response results for the 2 models in terms of stresses and deformations were recorded and compared.
   RESULTS: When compared with no fixation, BPSF decreased dynamic responses of the spinal levels to the vertical vibration after TLIF. At the fused level (L4-L5), vibration amplitudes of the von-Mises stresses in L4 inferior endplate and L5 superior endplate decreased after BPSF by 48.0% and 46.4%, respectively. At other disc levels (L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L5-S1), vibration amplitudes of the disc bulge, von-Mises stress in annulus ground substance and intradiscal pressure also produced 4.2%-9.0%, 2.3%-8.9%, and 3.4%-8.8% deceases, respectively, after BPSF.
   CONCLUSIONS: After TLIF, application of BPSF can be helpful in the prevention of spine injury during vertical WBV.

   STANDARD; EXPERIENCE; EFFICACY
AB OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (RA), a gold standard imaging tool for the evaluation of cerebral aneurysms after clipping, can currently be performed intraoperatively in a hybrid operating room (OR). However, its role in intraoperative aneurysmal surgery is unclear. We aimed to study the value of intraoperative 2-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA) and 3D-RA for the evaluation of aneurysms after clipping, in terms of clip repositioning.
   METHODS: We included patients with cerebral aneurysms who were treated with microsurgical clipping in a hybrid OR. After aneurysmal clipping and indocyanine green video angiography assessment, intraoperative 2DDSA and 3D-RA with volume-rendering (VR) images of the clipped aneurysm were obtained. The incidence rate of clip repositioning was determined, and aneurysm-related factors associated with suboptimal clipping that required clip revision after intraoperative angiography evaluation were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Between September 2016 and August 2017, 24 consecutive patients with 35 aneurysms were treated with microsurgical clipping. A clip repositioning rate of 17.1% was revealed after intraoperative 3D-VR imaging and initial indocyanine green-video angiography. 3D-VR was able to demonstrate all aneurysmal remnants, whereas 2D-DSA helped confirm flow stagnation in compromised vessels. Challenging aneurysms of size >7 mm (P = 0.043) and neck width > 4 mm (P = 0.012) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of suboptimal aneurysmal clipping.
   CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid OR, with angiography facilities for high-resolution 2D-DSA and 3D-VR images, allows neurosurgeons to perform high-quality surgery. The routine use of intraoperative 3D-RA may not be necessary; however, it is invaluable for treating challenging aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiologic and clinical outcome of three-dimensional correction using the uniplanar pedicle screw (UPS) combined with vertebral body derotation technique for treatment of Lenke 5C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
   METHODS: Fifty patients treated with posterior selective fusion by UPS or polyaxial pedicle screw (PPS) were enrolled. Radiologic parameters, including degree of main curve, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and apical vertebral rotation, were evaluated preoperatively, post-operatively, and at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Scoliosis Research Society Version 22 questionnaire was assessed preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up.
   RESULTS: Preoperative lumbar Cobb angle was 48.9 degrees in the UPS group and 49.1 degrees in the PPS group (P = 0.59). Postoperatively, no difference in the correction of the main curve magnitude between the 2 groups was observed (74.4% vs. 73.9%, P = 0.74). Correction rate of apical vertebral rotation in the UPS group was significantly higher compared with the PPS group. No difference in average thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis was observed between the 2 groups. At last follow-up, Scoliosis Research Society Version 22 scores were improved in both groups, of which the self-image score in the UPS group was significantly higher compared with the PPS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of UPS combined with vertebral body derotation technique can reduce vertebral rotation and obtain better patient self-image score when favorable coronal and sagittal realignment is achieved. This improvement remains superior during 2-year follow-up. This combined application is a promising option to achieve spinal three-dimensional correction in treating Lenke 5C curve.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite advances in endoscopic techniques, retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas (CPs) are difficult to remove completely, because the low-lying optic chiasm often provides an obstacle to an endoscopic endonasal approach. This study aimed to identify the endoscopic surgical outcomes of the retrochiasmatic CP and resolve the issues related to low-lying optic chiasm.
   METHODS: We reviewed 154 consecutive patients with CP who underwent endonasal endoscopic resection from February 2009 to April 2017 at 2 independent institutions. The topographic relationship of the tumor with the third ventricle, stalk, and optic chiasm and clinical outcomes were investigated.
   RESULTS: Retrochiasmatic CPs were found in 142 of 154 patients (92.2%). The median follow-up time was 25 months. Gross total resection and near-total resection were achieved in 113 patients (79.6%) and 21 patients (13.8%), respectively. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks were found in 16 patients (11.3%). Low-lying and high-lying chiasms were found in 44 patients (31.0%) and 98 patients (69.0%), respectively. Low-lying chiasm did not affect clinical outcomes including the extent of resection. Patients with low-lying chiasm showed a marginal trend for postoperative visual deterioration. The ventricular growth pattern representing the origin of the tumor and previous surgery were significantly associated with the position of the optic chiasm (P = 0.007 and 0.001, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: An endoscopic endonasal approach is an effective surgical approach for retrochiasmatic CP, even in tumors with low-lying chiasm. However, a thorough and careful dissection is necessary to prevent visual deterioration.

ID DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION
AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty (PCN) is an effective treatment for cervical herniated intervertebral disc (C-HIVD). In this retrospective study, we evaluated clinical predictors that affect the successful outcome of PCN.
   METHODS: Fluoroscopically guided PCN was conducted for C-HIVD by one pain physician. Successful outcome was defined as a combination of greater than 50% pain relief on the numerical rating scale pain score, no increase in analgesics, and no cervical epidural steroid injection during the 3-month follow-up period. The relationship between outcomes and independent variables, including patient demographics, comorbid diseases, pain duration, type of disc herniation, presence of spinal stenosis, pain location, analgesics, and shape of the PCN needle tip, were investigated using multivariable analyses.
   RESULTS: Of 201 patients, 134 experienced a successful outcome after PCN. In the positive outcome group, shorter pain durations, rarer central canal stenosis, increased unilateral radiculopathy versus axial pain, and more frequent use of the curved tip technique, were reported. Multivariable analyses revealed that unilateral radiculopathy (P = 0.013) and use of the curved-tip technique (P = 0.027) were independent positive predictors of successful PCN outcomes; conversely, longer pain duration (P = 0.014) and concurrent spinal stenosis (P < 0.001) were negative predictors. No serious complications related to PCN occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the success rate of PCN was 66.7% in patients with C-HIVD. Shorter pain duration, the absence of cervical central canal stenosis, pain location (i.e., unilateral radiculopathy vs. axial pain), and the use of the curved-tip technique were positive predictors of successful PCN.

TI Arterial Spin Labeling Method as a Supplemental Predictor to Distinguish

ID BLOOD-VOLUME MEASUREMENTS; CONTRAST-ENHANCED MR; BRAIN-TUMORS;
   PERFUSION; DIFFERENTIATION; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative evaluation of malignancy in gliomas is important for surgical planning, particularly to determine whether a 1,3-bis-2-chloroethyl-1-nitrosourea wafer should be placed into the tumor cavity. In some cases, the intraoperative pathologic diagnosis of World Health Organization grade differs from the final diagnosis. Supplemental methods in addition to the routine contrast tomography or magnetic resonance imaging sequences may provide a more accurate preoperative diagnosis. Because tumor vascularity has been useful in distinguishing between low-and high-grade gliomas, we evaluated the accuracy of the arterial spin labeling (ASL) method, which could measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) without using contrast medium, to determine the malignancy of gliomas.
   METHODS: This study included 102 patients with glioma (grade II, n = 40; grade III, n = 18; grade IV, n = 44). All patients underwent ASL to determine the tumor blood flow (TBF) and CBF in the middle cerebral region. The relative tumor vascular index (tVI), which is calculated as TBF divided by CBF in the contralateral middle cerebral region, was used to avoid dispersion of the absolute TBF value.
   RESULTS: tVI was significantly greater (1.46 +/- 0.751) in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (1.05 +/- 0.343) (P = 0.003). As for each grade, tVI was statistically higher in grade IV than in grade II (P = 0.03) gliomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive ASL method provides additional information to distinguish high-grade glioma from low-grade gliomas without using contrast medium.

   COILS; RETREATMENT; OCCLUSION; COMPLICATIONS; PREDICTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Although it is well known that coiled aneurysms can recanalize over time, long-term outcomes of re-embolization for recurred aneurysms have not been adequately investigated. We studied the retreatment outcomes of re-embolized aneurysms during follow-up monitoring and assessed the risk factors related to further recanalization.
   METHODS: A total of 129 patients with 133 aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Each aneurysm was subjected to re-embolization because of major recanalization after initial coil embolization and underwent midterm and extended monitoring after retreatment. Cumulative medical records and radiologic data were assessed. Repeat recurrence rates and related risk factors were assessed by binary logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 47 aneurysms (35.3%) showed re-recanalization at 6 months after re-embolization, with 17 and 30 instances of minor and major recanalization, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that posterior circulation (hazard ratio [HR], 6.129; P = 0.010), large aneurysm (> 7 mm) (HR, 13.598; P < 0.001), and incomplete occlusion at the second coiling (HR, 9.975; P = 0.001) were significant factors for repeat recanalization. Of 86 aneurysms showing complete occlusion at the midterm, 76 were further evaluated (>= 12 months), showing 18 aneurysms (23.7%) of delayed re-recanalization during a follow-up of 230.1 aneurysm-years. Of 15 aneurysms with minor recanalization at 6 months, 6 (40.0%) progressed to major recanalization during a follow-up of 44.0 aneurysm-years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most re-coiled aneurysms (64.7%) showed complete occlusion at the 6-month follow-up. However, posterior circulation, large aneurysm (>7 mm), and incomplete occlusion at the second coiling were risks for further recanalization. The midterm and delayed re-recanalization rates of the re-embolized aneurysms seem to be higher than those of the initial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Status dystonicus (SD) is a life-threatening complication in which episodes of dystonic movements become increasingly frequent and severe, requiring urgent hospital admission, and can lead to respiratory, metabolic, and bulbar complications. Pharmacologic treatment has been the mainstay management for this complication; however, many refractory patients will still require further treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapeutic strategy that has been used for dystonia, and now it has been proposed to be used for SD.
   METHODS: In this case series, we describe our experience with early DBS placement in 5 patients with SD to control symptoms that are refractory to pharmacologic therapy. In addition, we present a literature review of this therapy in the treatment of SD.
   RESULTS: Before discharge, symptomatic relief (decrease of dystonic movements and resolution of abnormal postures) was evidenced in all patients with a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 1-7) after surgery was performed. A follow-up Unified Dystonia Rating Scale score and Burke-Fahn-Marsden rating scale motor subscale score, at 6 months after hospital discharge with values being inferior to 20 and 30, respectively, for all cases. None of the patients had a recurrence of SD in the last follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: DBS surgery is a suitable, versatile, reversible and adequate therapy in the treatment of SD that is refractory to initial pharmacologic treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Mobi-C cervical disc arthroplasty (MCDA) is an alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of MCDA and ACDF for symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease.
   METHODS: Databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials. Studies were included based on eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and quality of evidence assessment were performed.
   RESULTS: Four studies with 785 patients were included. For clinical outcomes, MCDA were superior to ACDF with fewer subsequent surgical interventions (P < 0.00001), lower neck pain scores (P = 0.01), lower incidences of adjacent segment degeneration at both superior and inferior levels (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.01, respectively), greater range of motion of the operated segment (P < 0.0001), and higher patient satisfaction (P = 0.007). No significant differences were observed between groups regarding operative time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, and neck disability index and arm pain scores (P > 0.05). Subgroup analyses indicated that for patients with 2-level cervical degenerative disc disease, MCDA demonstrated lower neck disability index and arm pain scores and higher patient satisfaction (P < 0.05) compared with ACDF.
   CONCLUSIONS: MCDA had fewer subsequent surgical interventions, lower neck pain scores, lower incidences of adjacent segment degeneration at superior and inferior levels, greater range of motion, and higher patient satisfaction scores than ACDF. MCDA was similar to ACDF regarding operative time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, and neck disability index and neck pain scores.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and radiologic features of pathologic atlantoaxial displacement (PAAD) in pediatric patients and to compose a treatment algorithm for anomaly-related PAAD.
   BACKGROUND: Criteria of different types of PAAD and treatment algorithms have been widely reported in the literature but are difficult to apply to patients with odontoid abnormalities, C2-C3 block, spina bifida C1, and children.
   METHODS: We evaluated results of treatment of 29 pediatric patients with PAAD caused by congenital anomalies of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ), treated in Ilizarov Center in 2009-2017, including 20 patients with atlantoaxial displacement (AAD) and 9 patients with atlantoaxial rotatory fixation.
   RESULTS: There were 14 males (48.3%) and 15 females (51.7%). We singled out 3 groups of patients: nonsyndromic (6 patients, 20.7%), Klippel-Feil syndrome (13 patients, 44.8%), and syndromic (10 patients, 34.5%). Odontoid abnormalities and C1 dysplasia were widely represented in the syndromic group. Local symptoms predominated in the nonsyndromic and KFS groups. In the syndromic group, all patients had AAD and myelopathy. A pronounced decrease of space available for chord C1 and increase of anterior atlantodental interval were noted compared with other groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a unified treatment algorithm of pediatric anomaly-related PAAD. Syndromic AAD are often accompanied by anterior and central dislocation and myelopathy and atlantooccipital dissociation. These patients require early aggressive surgical treatment. Non-syndromic and Klippel-Feil syndrome AAD, atlantoaxial subluxation, and atlantoaxial fixation often manifest by local symptoms and need to eliminate CVJ instability. Existing classifications of symptomatic atlantoaxial displacement are not always suitable for patients with CVJ abnormalities.

TI Watertight Dural Closure in Pediatric Craniotomies-Is It Really
   Necessary?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Children; Craniotomy; CSF leak; Dura closure; Hydrocephalus; Infection;
   Pseudomeningocele
AB BACKGROUND: Dural closure after intracranial procedures is considered crucial to reduce postoperative complications such as pseudomeningocele (PM), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) leaks, hydrocephalus, and infections. However, watertight dural closure (WTDC) is often difficult to achieve, and dural substitutes often are used. We describe our experience with non-WTDC in children.
   METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively. Redo and craniectomy cases were excluded. Collected data included demographics, surgical etiology, various radiologic parameters, ventricular opening, usage of drains and shunts, dural closure technique, and complications.
   RESULTS: In total, 163 cases aged 3 months to 18.5 years (90 +/- 56 months) were included. Main surgical indications were tumors (120, 74%) and epilepsy (29, 18%). In total, 122 (74%) cases were supratentorial. The ventricular system was opened in 69 (42%) cases. In 145 (89%) cases, a non-WTDC was performed. Fibrin glue was used in 22 (13%) cases. In 156 cases (96%), a dural substitute was used. One patient (0.6%) had a CSF leak. At 3 months, 20% had a radiologic PM but only 8.4% were noticed clinically. At 1 year, 7.7% had a radiologic PM but only 3% were noticed clinically. Overall, 3% needed a PM tap, and 15 patients (9%) underwent CSF diversion procedures. There were no infections. The only factor significantly associated with PM or a need for CSF surgery was an infratentorial location.
   CONCLUSIONS: Non-WTDC after cranial surgery in children was associated with a low rate of clinically significant PM, infections, leaks, and hydrocephalus. Non-WTDC is fast and reduces the need to harvest additional tissue, thus minimizing the surgical incision.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atlas; Bony variations; Cervical spine; Nonmetric variant;
   Retrotransverse foramen; Spine
ID VERTEBRAL ARTERY; PRIMATES; PREVALENCE; GROOVE
AB BACKGROUND: The retrotransverse foramen is a nonmetric variant of C1 that consists of an abnormal accessory foramen on the posterior root of the transverse process.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: During a study on the prevalence of the retrotransverse foramen in 150 dry C1 vertebrae, we observed an exceptional C1 (0.67%) with a right double retrotransverse foramen of the 14 C1 vertebrae (9.3%). This has not been reported previously in the literature. No osteogenic reaction and no degenerative signs were observed in this C1 with the double retrotransverse foramen.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeons should be aware of the possible presence of the "conventional" retrotransverse foramen and the "exceptional" double retrotransverse foramen so that they can safely plan to prevent surgical complications. This will thus ensure better patient management by neurosurgeons.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively compare ideal radio surgical target volumes defined by a manual method (surgeon) to those determined by Adaptive Hybrid Surgery (AHS) operative planning software in 7 patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS).
   METHODS: Four attending surgeons 13 neurosurgeons and 1 ear, nose, and throat surgeon) manually contoured planned residual tumors volumes for 7 consecutive patients with VS. Next, the AHS software determined the ideal radiosurgical target volumes based on a specified radiotherapy plan. Our primary measure was the difference between the average planned residual tumor volumes and the ideal radiosurgical target volumes defined by AHS (dRV(Aus-planned))
   RESULTS: We included 7 consecutive patients with VS in this study. The planned residual tumor volumes were smaller than the ideal radiosurgical target volumes defined by AHS (1.6 vs. 4.5 cm(3), P = 0.004). On average, the actual post-operative residual tumor volumes were smaller than the ideal radiosurgical target volumes defined by AHS (2.2 cm(3) vs. 4.5 cm(3); P = 0.02). The average difference between the ideal radiosurgical target volume defined by AHS and the planned residual tumor volume (dRV(AHs-planned)) was 2.9 +/- 1.7 cm(3), and we observed a trend toward larger dRV(AHS-planned) in patients who lost serviceable facial nerve function compared with patients who maintained serviceable facial nerve function (4.7 cm(3) vs. 1.9 cm(3) P = 0.06),
   CONCLUSIONS: Planned subtotal resection of VS diverges from the ideal radiosurgical target defined by AHS, but whether that influences clinical outcomes is unclear.

   hypersensitivity process; Pathogenesis; sASDH; Subacute subdural

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathologic mechanism of subacute subdural hematoma (sASDH).
   METHODS: Three typical cases of sASDH were reported, and related literature in Chinese published in the past 15 years was reviewed.
   RESULTS: Intervals from onset of acute subdural hematoma to surgery or symptom deterioration resulting in sASDH were 12.5-15.5 days (mean 14.1 days). Delayed liquefaction of hematoma clots occurred in all 3 reported cases. One patient achieved good curative effect after administration of dexamethasone, and another patient relapsed owing to poor drainage after evacuation of hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: The conversion of acute subdural hematoma to sASDH is an inflammatory reaction process with very regular in time, and it is speculated that the pathologic mechanism may be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Antigen released during the liquefaction process of blood clot, with subdural neomembrane cells as antigen-presenting cells, is presented to the T lymphocytes released from the capillaries in the neomembrane and forms sensitized T lymphocytes. When the subsequent antigen is released from the blood clots with a delayed liquefaction and is exposed to sensitized T lymphocytes, the delayed hypersensitivity process occurs.

AB BACKGROUND: Skull base surgeons split the tentorium to expand exposure, minimize brain retraction, and combine the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments for resection of large skull base lesions. The aim of this study was to describe stepwise techniques for splitting the tentorium to access deeply located skull base lesions and morphometrically assess gained exposure.
   METHODS: Surgical exposures were performed through transsylvian, subtemporal, posterior transpetrosal, and combined posterior supratentorial/infratentorialetranssinus approaches. A custom software program was used to trace the surgical exposure region of interest for area analysis with the ability to accurately assess most irregular areas. Qualitative morphometric assessment was done of the gain in anatomic exposure achieved by splitting the tentorium.
   RESULTS: In the transsylvian transtentorial approach, mean surface area increased 154.17%, from 0.14 cm(2) before expansion to 0.32 cm(2) after expansion. In the subtemporal transtentorial approach, mean surface area increased 137.61%, from 0.66 cm(2) before expansion to 1.52 cm(2) after expansion. In the posterior transpetrosal transtentorial approach, mean surface area increased 171.06%, from 1.08 cm(2) before expansion to 2.81 cm(2) after expansion. In the combined supratentorial/infratentorialetranssinus approach, mean surface area increased 222.03%, from 0.78 cm(2) before expansion to 2.38 cm(2) after expansion.
   CONCLUSIONS: With splitting of the tentorium, a substantial area of expansion is obtained, minimizing the need for brain retraction and improving visualization of deep neurovascular structures in the skull base.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the indications and outcomes of upper cervical cord stimulation in trigeminal neuropathy.
   METHODS: A consecutive single-center series of patients was retrospectively reviewed. It included 12 patients with trigeminal neuropathy treated with upper cervical spinal cord stimulation. Clinical features, complications, and outcomes were reviewed.
   RESULTS: All patients had a successful trial before the definitive implantation of a spinal cord stimulator at the level of the craniocervical junction. The mean follow-up period was 4.4 years (range, 0.3-21.1 years). The average coverage in the pain zone was 72% and the median baseline, trial, and postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) was 7, 3, and 3, respectively. When compared with the baseline, the mean reduction achieved in the postoperative average numeric rating scale was 4 points, accounting for a 57.1% pain reduction. The long-term failure rate was 25%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite there being enough evidence to consider upper cervical spinal cord stimulation as an effective treatment for patients with neuropathic trigeminal pain, a randomized controlled trial is needed to fully assess its indications and outcomes and compare it with other therapeutic approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is a viable alternative for treatment of wide-neck and fusiform aneurysms originating from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), but coverage of the PICA and vertebral perforating arteries may be a concern. The aim of this study was to examine procedural, clinical, and angiographic outcomes of patients with PICA aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device.
   METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of PICA aneurysms treated with the Pipeline device at 3 neurovascular centers, including periprocedural complications and clinical and angiographic outcomes.
   RESULTS: In 16 procedures, 14 PICA aneurysms were treated with the Pipeline device. These included 11 saccular aneurysms with a mean size of 7.4 mm (range, 2.0-11.1 mm) and 3 fusiform aneurysms with a mean diameter of 6.1 mm (range, 5.0-8.0 mm) and mean length of 10.3 mm (range, 6.0-15.0 mm). One patient developed a PICA territory infarct with mild leg weakness that resolved in < 7 days. Overall complication rate was 7% (1/14) per patient and 6% (1/16) per procedure. Mean duration of clinical follow-up was 13.5 months (range, 3 weeks to 61.7 months), with all patients returning to baseline functional status. Complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 58%(7/12) of cases with angiographic follow-up (mean, 15 months; range, 4-61 months). All covered PICAs remained patent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion of PICA aneurysms is a safe and viable treatment option when traditional endovascular options are unlikely to preserve parent vessel patency.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes in aggressively treated patients with aneurysmal intracerebral hematoma (ICH) and signs of brain herniation, and to investigate possible predictive factors.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 43 patients with aneurysmal ICH who presented to the Emergency Department with brain herniation and received aggressive surgical treatment between 2008 and 20%, Emergency surgical clipping, hematoma removal, and external decompression were combined as an aggressive surgical treatment. Outcomes were assessed using in-hospital survival and the Glasgow Outcome Scale at a 6-month follow-up.
   RESULTS: All the patients were World Federation of Neurological Societies grade V on presentation. The mean hematoma volume was 59.1 +/- 16.5 mL. The in-hospital mortality rate was 48.8%. At the 6-month follow-up, favorable outcomes were achieved in 7 patients (16.3%). Significant factors related to death included bilateral mydriasis, lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, larger hematoma volume, and no recovery of pupil reactivity after surgery. Bilateral restoration of pupil reactivity and higher initial GCS score were associated with 6-month favorable outcomes. Patients with an intrasylvian hematoma were more likely than those with an intraparenchymal hematoma to achieve a favorable outcome (62.5% vs. 5.7%; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the protocol of aggressive surgical treatment in patients with a herniated aneurysmal ICH might be warranted. Despite mydriasis, favorable outcomes might be achieved in some patients, However, careful individual patient-centered decision making is essential, particularly when bilateral pupil dilation persists.

AB BACKGROUND: Indications for surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases have become better defined in recent years, and suitable outcome measures have been established against a changing backdrop of patient characteristics, tumor behavior, and oncologic treatments. Nonetheless, variations still exist in the local management of patients with spinal metastases. In this study, we aimed to review global trends and habits in the surgical treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases, and to examine how these have changed over the last 25 years.
   METHODS: In this cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases, data were collected using a secure Internet database from 22 centers across 3 continents. All patients were invited to participate in the study, except those unable or unwilling to give consent.
   RESULTS: There was a higher incidence of colonic, liver, and lung carcinoma metastases in Asian countries, and more frequent presentation of breast, prostate, melanoma metastases in the West. Trends in surgical technique were broadly similar across the centers. Overall survival rates after surgery were 53% at 1 year, 31% at 2 years, and 10% at 5 years after surgery (standard error 0.013 for all). Survival improved over successive time periods, with longer survival in patients who underwent surgery in 2011-2016 compared with those who underwent surgery in earlier time periods.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical habits have been fairly consistent among countries worldwide and over time. However, patient survival has improved in later years, perhaps due to medical advances in the treatment of cancer, improved patient selection, and operating earlier in the course of disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to provide a longitudinal description of cortical plasticity caused by electroacupuncture (EA) of sciatic nerve transection and direct anastomosis in rats.
   METHODS: Sixteen rats in a sciatic nerve transection and direct anastomosis model were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. EA intervention in the position of ST-36, GB-30 was conducted continuously for 4 months in the intervention group. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and gait assessment were performed every month after intervention.
   RESULTS: The somatosensory area was more activated in the first 2 months and then deactivated in the rest 2 months when EA was applied. The pain-related areas had the same activation pattern as the somatosensory area. The limbic/paralimbic areas fluctuated more during the EA intervention, which was not constantly activated or deactivated as previous studies reported. We attributed such changes in somatosensory and pain-related areas to the gradual reduction of sensory afferentation. The alterations in limbic/paralimbic system might be associated with the confrontation between the upregulating effect of paresthesia or pain and the downregulating effect of EA intervention through the autonomic nerve system. The gait analysis showed significantly higher maximum contact mean intensity in the intervention group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The alterations in the brain brought about by the long-term therapeutic effect of EA could be described as a synchronized activation pattern in the somatosensory and pain-related areas and a fluctuating pattern in the limbic/paralimbic system.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery for spinal metastases can improve survival but has high morbidity that can potentially diminish benefits. New objective methods of predicting overall survival would be beneficial for surgical decision making. Morphometrics quantifies patient frailty and has been successfully used to predict overall survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. This study evaluated whether morphometrics can predict survival in patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases.
   METHODS: Using a retrospective registry of patients with spinal metastases who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy, we identified patients with primary prostate cancer. Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken from most recent lumbar spine computed tomography. Patients were stratified into lowest, middle, and highest tertiles based on psoas muscle area. Primary outcome measure was overall survival from the date of computed tomography scan.
   RESULTS: We identified 92 patients. Median survival for all patients was 124 days (95% confidence interval, 98-197 days). Patients in the smallest third for average psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 117 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.43; P = 0.004). Patients in the middle third for average psoas size also had shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 113 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.25; P = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases, morphometric analysis of psoas muscle size can identify patients at risk for shorter survival. This technique can aid in surgical decision making by weighing expected survival and fitness versus potential morbidity of intervention.

AB OBJECTIVE: Down-regulation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) results in the formation of tumors both in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known about the effect of Smad3 on adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (ACTH-PAs). Our objective was to study the expression and effect of Smad3 in ACTHPAs and its possible mechanisms.
   METHODS: Smad3, COOH-terminally phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (pSmad3), and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 proteins (Smad2) were detected in samples from 5 normal anterior pituitaries and 18 ACTH-PAs by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. Then, Smad3 expression was upregulated by Smad3-CMV plasmid or down-regulated by small interfering RNA in ACTH tumor cells (AtT-20) in vitro. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, ACTH level, and pSmad3, B-cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (BCL-2), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) protein expression in the AtT-20 cells were measured to investigate the antitumor effects of Smad3.
   RESULTS: Reduced expression of Smad3 and pSmad3 but unchanged Smad2 levels were found in ACTH-PAs compared with normal pituitaries. In vitro, the overexpression of Smad3 inhibited cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and decreased ACTH secretion; in contrast, Smad3 knockdown increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis but had no significant effect on ACTH secretion. At the same time, overexpression of Smad3 increased pSmad3 but inhibited BCL-2 and POMC protein expression. On the contrary, underexpression of Smad3 inhibited pSmad3 but promoted BCL-2 and POMC protein expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Smad3 is underexpressed in ACTH- PAs-Reversing the expression of Smad3 in AtT-20 cells could suppress cell growth, promote tumor apoptosis, and decrease ACTH secretion. Tumor suppression was possibly mediated by the promotion of pSmad3 and the reduction of BCL-2 and POMC expression.

AB Sequencing thousands of human genomes has enabled breakthroughs in many areas, among them precision medicine, the study of rare diseases, and forensics. However, mass collection of such sensitive data entails enormous risks if not protected to the highest standards. In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information. Such a classification allows the fine-grained and automated adjustment of protective measures to mitigate the possible consequences of exposure, in particular when relying on public clouds. We present the first filter that can be indistinctly applied to reads of any length, i.e., making it usable with any recent or future sequencing technologies. The filter is accurate, in the sense that it detects all known sensitive nucleotides except those located in highly variable regions (less than 10 nucleotides remain undetected per genome instead of 100,000 in previous works). It has far less false positives than previously known methods (10% instead of 60%) and can detect sensitive nucleotides despite sequencing errors (86% detected instead of 56% with 2% of mutations). Finally, practical experiments demonstrate high performance, both in terms of throughput and memory consumption.

DE Data analytics; Time-event dependency; Scientific experiment
AB Purpose: This paper reports on a generic framework to provide clinicians with the ability to conduct complex analyses on elaborate research topics using cascaded queries to resolve internal time-event dependencies in the research questions, as an extension to the proposed Clinical Data Analytics Language (CliniDAL).
   Methods: A cascaded query model is proposed to resolve internal time-event dependencies in the queries which can have up to five levels of criteria starting with a query to define subjects to be admitted into a study, followed by a query to define the time span of the experiment. Three more cascaded queries can be required to define control groups, control variables and output variables which all together simulate a real scientific experiment. According to the complexity of the research questions, the cascaded query model has the flexibility of merging some lower level queries for simple research questions or adding a nested query to each level to compose more complex queries. Three different scenarios (one of them contains two studies) are described and used for evaluation of the proposed solution.
   Results: CliniDAL's complex analyses solution enables answering complex queries with time-event dependencies at most in a few hours which manually would take many days.
   Conclusion: An evaluation of results of the research studies based on the comparison between CliniDAL and SQL solutions reveals high usability and efficiency of CliniDAL's solution.

AB Objective: Homeless patients face a variety of obstacles in pursuit of basic social services. Acknowledging this, the Social Security Administration directs employees to prioritize homeless patients and handle their disability claims with special care. However, under existing manual processes for identification of homelessness, many homeless patients never receive the special service to which they are entitled. In this paper, we explore address validation and automatic annotation of electronic health records to improve identification of homeless patients.
   Materials and Methods: We developed a sample of claims containing medical records at the moment of arrival in a single office. Using address validation software, we reconciled patient addresses with public directories of homeless shelters, veterans' hospitals and clinics, and correctional facilities. Other tools annotated electronic health records. We trained random forests to identify homeless patients and validated each model with 10-fold cross validation.
   Results: For our finished model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.942. The random forest improved sensitivity from 0.067 to 0.879 but decreased positive predictive value to 0.382.
   Discussion: Presumed false positive classifications bore many characteristics of homelessness. Organizations could use these methods to prompt early collection of information necessary to avoid labor-intensive attempts to reestablish contact with homeless individuals. Annually, such methods could benefit tens of thousands of patients who are homeless, destitute, and in urgent need of assistance.
   Conclusion: We were able to identify many more homeless patients through a combination of automatic address validation and natural language processing of unstructured electronic health records.

AB Healthcare provides many services such as diagnosing, treatment, prevention of diseases, illnesses, injuries, and other physical and mental disorders. Large-scale distributed data processing applications in healthcare as a basic concept operates on large amounts of data. Therefore, big data application functions are the main part of healthcare operations, but there was not any comprehensive and systematic survey about studying and evaluating the important techniques in this field. Therefore, this paper aims at providing the comprehensive, detailed, and systematic study of the state-of-the-art mechanisms in the big data related to healthcare applications in five categories, including machine learning, cloud-based, heuristic-based, agent-based, and hybrid mechanisms. Also, this paper displayed a systematic literature review (SLR) of the big data applications in the healthcare literature up to the end of 2016. Initially, 205 papers were identified, but a paper selection process reduced the number of papers to 29 important studies.

DE Electronic medical record; De-deduplication; Natural language processing
AB Background: Big clinical note datasets found in electronic health records (EHR) present substantial opportunities to train accurate statistical models that identify patterns in patient diagnosis and outcomes. However, near-to-exact duplication in note texts is a common issue in many clinical note datasets. We aimed to use a scalable algorithm to de-duplicate notes and further characterize the sources of duplication.
   Methods: We use an approximation algorithm to minimize pairwise comparisons consisting of three phases: (1) Minhashing with Locality Sensitive Hashing; (2) a clustering method using tree-structured disjoint sets; and (3) classification of near-duplicates (exact copies, common machine output notes, or similar notes) via pairwise comparison of notes in each cluster. We use the Jaccard Similarity (JS) to measure similarity between two documents. We analyzed two big clinical note datasets: our institutional dataset and MIMIC-III.
   Results: There were 1,528,940 notes analyzed from our institution. The de-duplication algorithm completed in 36.3 h. When the JS threshold was set at 0.7, the total number of clusters was 82,371 (total notes = 304,418). Among all JS thresholds, no clusters contained pairs of notes that were incorrectly clustered. When the JS threshold was set at 0.9 or 1.0, the de-duplication algorithm captured 100% of all random pairs with their JS at least as high as the set thresholds from the validation set. Similar performance was noted when analyzing the MIMIC-III dataset.
   Conclusions: We showed that among the EHR from our institution and from the publicly-available MIMIC-III dataset, there were a significant number of near-to-exact duplicated notes.

AB Automatically monitoring and supporting healthy lifestyle is a recent research trend, fostered by the availability of low-cost monitoring devices, and it can significantly contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases deriving from incorrect diet and lack of physical activity. In this paper, we present a general purpose architecture for persuasion scenarios and behavioral change. The architecture is designed to be easily portable across languages and domains and has been implemented and evaluated in a specific system for Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) called PerKApp. PerKApp provides a fully fledged platform supporting the remote monitoring of workers lifestyle by providing real-time feedback through persuasive context-based messages when necessary.

ID SNOMED-CT; TEXT
AB Text categorization has been used extensively in recent years to classify plain-text clinical reports. This study employs text categorization techniques for the classification of open narrative forensic autopsy reports. One of the key steps in text classification is document representation. In document representation, a clinical report is transformed into a format that is suitable for classification. The traditional document representation technique for text categorization is the bag-of-words (BoW) technique. In this study, the traditional BoW technique is ineffective in classifying forensic autopsy reports because it merely extracts frequent but discriminative features from clinical reports. Moreover, this technique fails to capture word inversion, as well as word-level synonymy and polysemy, when classifying autopsy reports. Hence, the BoW technique suffers from low accuracy and low robustness unless it is improved with contextual and application-specific information. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of the BoW technique, this research aims to develop an effective conceptual graph-based document representation (CGDR) technique to classify 1500 forensic autopsy reports from four (4) manners of death (MoD) and sixteen (16) causes of death (CoD). Term-based and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) based conceptual features were extracted and represented through graphs. These features were then used to train a two-level text classifier. The first level classifier was responsible for predicting MoD. In addition, the second level classifier was responsible for predicting CoD using the proposed conceptual graph-based document representation technique. To demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique, its results were compared with those of six (6) state-of-the-art document representation techniques. Lastly, this study compared the effects of one-level classification and two-level classification on the experimental results. The experimental results indicated that the CGDR technique achieved 12% to 15% improvement in accuracy compared with fully automated document representation baseline techniques. Moreover, two-level classification obtained better results compared with one-level classification. The promising results of the proposed conceptual graph-based document representation technique suggest that pathologists can adopt the proposed system as their basis for second opinion, thereby supporting them in effectively determining CoD.

AB Introduction: An approach to building a hybrid simulation of patient flow is introduced with a combination of data-driven methods for automation of model identification. The approach is described with a conceptual framework and basic methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation of the proposed approach for simulation of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed and used in an experimental study.
   Methods: A combination of data, text, process mining techniques, and machine learning approaches for the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event simulation (DES) and queueing theory for the simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enabled identification of several classes of clinical pathways (CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic simulation of the patient flow. The developed solution was implemented using Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others).
   Results: The proposed approach enables more a realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a group of related departments. An experimental study shows an improved simulation of patient length of stay for ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in Almazov National Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
   Conclusion: The proposed approach, methods, and solutions provide a conceptual, methodological, and programming framework for the implementation of a simulation of complex and diverse scenarios within a flow of patients for different purposes: decision making, training, management optimization, and others.

AB Gene expression profiling techniques measure the transcriptional dynamics of thousands of genes in parallel manners. The available high-throughput transcriptomic datasets provide unprecedented opportunities of detecting biomarkers or signatures of complex diseases such as diabetes. In this work, we propose a computational method based on differential entropy to identify diabetic pathway biomarkers in rats from gene expression profiling data. We first collect the knowledgebase-documented pathways and map them with the corresponding gene expressions in control and disease samples, respectively. The pathway entropies are defined to evaluate their dysfunction-related activities and implications during the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. We rank these pathways via their differential status of entropy dynamics in the time series. The pathway biomarkers are then screened out by their classification ability of distinguishing diabetes from controls. The comparative studies with the other alternative methods demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our proposed strategy of biomarker identification. The classification performances on independent datasets further validate the diagnosis applicability of these identified pathway biomarkers. The functional enrichment analyses of these pathway biomarkers also indicate the pathogenesis of diabetes.

AB Background: Current Chinese medicine has an urgent demand for convenient medical services. When facing a large number of patients, understanding patients' questions automatically and precisely is useful. Different from the high professional medical text, patients' questions contain only a small amount of descriptions regarding the symptoms, and the questions are slightly professional and colloquial.
   Object: The aim of this paper is to implement a department classification system for patient questions. Patients' questions will be classified into 11 departments, such as surgery and others.
   Methods: This paper presents a morpheme growth model that enhances the memories of key elements in questions, and later extracts the "label-indicators" and germinates the expansion vectors around them. Finally, the model inputs the expansion vectors into a neural network to assign department labels for patients' questions.
   Results: All compared methods are validated by experiments on three datasets that are composed of real patient questions. The proposed method has some ability to improve the performance of the classification.
   Conclusions: The proposed method is effective for the departments classification of patients questions and serves as a useful system for the automatic understanding of patient questions.

AB Interactions between microRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases can yield important information for uncovering novel prognostic markers. Since experimental determination of disease-miRNA associations is time-consuming and costly, attention has been given to designing efficient and robust computational techniques for identifying undiscovered interactions. In this study, we present a label propagation model with linear neighborhood similarity, called LPLNS, to predict unobserved miRNA-disease associations. Additionally, a preprocessing step is performed to derive new interaction likelihood profiles that will contribute to the prediction since new miRNAs and diseases lack known associations. Our results demonstrate that the LPLNS model based on the known disease miRNA associations could achieve impressive performance with an AUC of 0.9034. Furthermore, we observed that the LPLNS model based on new interaction likelihood profiles could improve the performance to an AUC of 0.9127. This was better than other comparable methods. In addition, case studies also demonstrated our method's outstanding performance for inferring undiscovered interactions between miRNAs and diseases, especially for novel diseases.

AB Objective: An electronic medication reconciliation tool was previously developed by another research team to aid provider-patient communication for medication reconciliation. To evaluate the usability of this tool, we integrated artificial safety probes into standard usability methods. The objective of this article is to describe this method of using safety probes, which enabled us to evaluate how well the tool supports users' detection of medication discrepancies.
   Materials and methods: We completed a mixed-method usability evaluation in a simulated setting with 30 participants: 20 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 10 patients. We used factual scenarios but embedded three artificial safety probes: (1) a missing medication (i.e., omission); (2) an extraneous medication (i.e., commission); and (3) an inaccurate dose (i.e., dose discrepancy). We measured users' detection of each probe to estimate the probability that a HCP or patient would detect these discrepancies. Additionally, we recorded participants' detection of naturally occurring discrepancies.
   Results: Each safety probe was detected by <= 50% of HCPs. Patients' detection rates were generally higher. Estimates indicate that a HCP and patient, together, would detect 44.8% of these medication discrepancies. Additionally, HCPs and patients detected 25 and 45 naturally-occurring discrepancies, respectively.
   Discussion: Overall, detection of medication discrepancies was low. Findings indicate that more advanced interface designs are warranted. Future research is needed on how technologies can be designed to better aid HCPs' and patients' detection of medication discrepancies.
   Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to evaluate the usability of a collaborative medication reconciliation tool and assess HCPs' and patients' detection of medication discrepancies. Results demonstrate that embedded safety probes can enhance standard usability methods by measuring additional, clinically-focused usability outcomes. The novel safety probes we used may serve as an initial, standard set for future medication reconciliation research. More prevalent use of safety probes could strengthen usability research for a variety of health information technologies.

TI Exploiting semantic patterns over biomedical knowledge graphs for

DE Information extraction; Relation prediction; Semantic graph patterns
ID DISCOVERY; KERNEL
AB Background: Identifying new potential treatment options for medical conditions that cause human disease burden is a central task of biomedical research. Since all candidate drugs cannot be tested with animal and clinical trials, in vitro approaches are first attempted to identify promising candidates. Likewise, identifying different causal relations between biomedical entities is also critical to understand biomedical processes. Generally, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning are used to predict specific relations between any given pair of entities using the distant supervision approach.
   Objective: To build high accuracy supervised predictive models to predict previously unknown treatment and causative relations between biomedical entities based only on semantic graph pattern features extracted from biomedical knowledge graphs.
   Methods: We used 7000 treats and 2918 causes hand-curated relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus to train and test our models. Our graph pattern features are extracted from simple paths connecting biomedical entities in the SemMedDB graph (based on the well-known SemMedDB database made available by the U.S. National Library of Medicine). Using these graph patterns connecting biomedical entities as features of logistic regression and decision tree models, we computed mean performance measures (precision, recall, F-score) over 100 distinct 80-20% train-test splits of the datasets. For all experiments, we used a positive:negative class imbalance of 1:10 in the test set to model relatively more realistic scenarios.
   Results: Our models predict treats and causes relations with high F-scores of 99% and 90% respectively. Logistic regression model coefficients also help us identify highly discriminative patterns that have an intuitive interpretation. We are also able to predict some new plausible relations based on false positives that our models scored highly based on our collaborations with two physician co-authors. Finally, our decision tree models are able to retrieve over 50% of treatment relations from a recently created external dataset.
   Conclusions: We employed semantic graph patterns connecting pairs of candidate biomedical entities in a knowledge graph as features to predict treatment/causative relations between them. We provide what we believe is the first evidence in direct prediction of biomedical relations based on graph features. Our work complements lexical pattern based approaches in that the graph patterns can be used as additional features for weakly supervised relation prediction.

AB At approximately 18.0 ka, pluvial Lake Bonneville reached its maximum level. At its northeastern extent it was impounded by alluvium of the Marsh Creek Fan, which breached at some point north of Red Rock Pass (Idaho), leading to one of the largest floods on Earth. About 5320 km(3) of water was discharged into the Snake River drainage and ultimately into the Columbia River. We use a OD model and a 2D non-linear depth-averaged hydrodynamic model to aid understanding of outflow dynamics, specifically evaluating controls on the amount of water exiting the Lake Bonneville basin exerted by the Red Rock Pass outlet lithology and geometry as well as those imposed by the internal lake geometry of the Bonneville basin. These models are based on field evidence of prominent lake levels, hypsometry and terrain elevations corrected for post-flood isostatic deformation of the lake basin, as well as reconstructions of the topography at the outlet for both the initial and final stages of the flood. Internal flow dynamics in the northern Lake Bonneville basin during the flood were affected by the narrow passages separating the Cache Valley from the main body of Lake Bonneville. This constriction imposed a water level drop of up to 2.7 m at the time of peak-flow conditions and likely reduced the peak discharge at the lake outlet by about 6%. The modeled peak outlet flow is 0.85.10(6) m(3) s(-1). Energy balance calculations give an estimate for the erodibility coefficient for the alluvial Marsh Creek divide of similar to 0.005 m y(-1) Pa-1.5, at least two orders of magnitude greater than for the underlying bedrock at the outlet. Computing quasi steady-state water flows, water elevations, water currents and shear stresses as a function of the water-level drop in the lake and for the sequential stages of erosion in the outlet gives estimates of the incision rates and an estimate of the outflow hydrograph during the Bonneville Flood: About 18 days would have been required for the outflow to grow from 10% to 100% of its peak value. At the time of peak flow, about 10% of the lake volume would have already exited; eroding about 1 km(3) of alluvium from the outlet, and the lake level would have dropped by about 10.6 m.

AB Many rivers in the Pacific Northwest region of North America are anthropogenically manipulated via dam operations, leading to system-wide impacts on hydrodynamic conditions and aquatic communities. Understanding how darn operations alter abiotic and biotic variables is important for designing management actions. For example, in the Klamath River, dam outflows could be manipulated to alter water age and temperature to reduce risk of parasite infections in salmon by diluting or altering viability of parasite spores. However, sensitivity of water age and temperature to the riverine conditions such as bathymetry can affect outcomes from dam operations. To examine this issue in detail, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of water age and temperature to a comprehensive set of hydraulics and meteorological parameters in the Klamath River, California, where management of salmonid disease is a high priority. We applied an analysis technique, which combined Latin-hypercube and one-at-a-time sampling methods, and included simulation runs with the hydrodynamic numerical model of the Lower Klamath. We found that flow rate and bottom roughness were the two most important parameters that influence water age. Water temperature was more sensitive to inflow temperature, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, flow rate, and wet bulb temperature respectively. Our results are relevant for managers because they provide a framework for predicting how water within 'high infection risk' sections of the river will respond to dam water (low infection risk) input. Moreover, these data will be useful for prioritizing the use of water age (dilution) versus temperature (spore viability) under certain contexts when considering flow manipulation as a method to reduce risk of infection and disease in Klamath River salmon.

AB In the present study, the moisture distribution on the wetting front during drainage and imbibition in a 2D sand chamber is studied thoroughly. Based on the high-resolution data measured by light transmission method, the moisture distribution is observed and then analyzed quantitatively. During drainage and imbibition, different moisture distributions are observed: (a) during drainage, moisture contents fluctuate in a larger range and fingers can be seen on the wetting front; (b) while during imbibition, moisture contents fluctuate in a smaller range and the wetting front is more regular. The Hurst coefficients are successful in capturing different characteristics of the moisture distribution between drainage and imbibition. During imbibition, the Hurst coefficients are around 0.2 on the wetting front; while during drainage, the Hurst coefficients are around 0.5. As the porosity changes from 0.336 to 0.383, the moisture distribution in the sand chamber does not display obvious change. While as the imbibition rate increases from 5 ml/min to 400 ml/min, the moisture distribution on the wetting front becomes more uniform.

AB Valid and dependable water demand prediction is a major element of the effective and sustainable expansion of municipal water infrastructures. This study provides a novel approach to quantifying water demand through the assessment of climatic factors, using a combination of a pretreatment signal technique, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm and an artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was adopted to decompose and reconstruct water consumption in relation to six weather variables, to create a seasonal and stochastic time series. The results revealed that SSA is a powerful technique, capable of decomposing the original time series into many independent components including trend, oscillatory behaviours and noise. In addition, the PSO-ANN algorithm was shown to be a reliable prediction model, outperforming the hybrid Backtracking Search Algorithm BSA-ANN in terms of fitness function (RMSE). The findings of this study also support the view that water demand is driven by climatological variables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable streamflow forecasts can be highly valuable for water resources planning and management. In this study, we combined a hidden Markov model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for probabilistic monthly streamflow forecasting. The HMM is initialized using a kernelized K-medoids clustering method, and the Baum-Welch algorithm is then executed to learn the model parameters. GMR derives a conditional probability distribution for the predictand given covariate information, including the antecedent flow at a local station and two surrounding stations. The performance of HMM-GMR was verified based on the mean square error and continuous ranked probability score skill scores. The reliability of the forecasts was assessed by examining the uniformity of the probability integral transform values. The results show that HMM-GMR obtained reasonably high skill scores and the uncertainty spread was appropriate. Different HMM states were assumed to be different climate conditions, which would lead to different types of observed values. We demonstrated that the HMM-GMR approach can handle multimodal and heteroscedastic data.

AB High spatial variability of arsenic (As) concentration in geogenic As-contaminated groundwater has been commonly observed worldwide, but the underlying reasons remain not well understood. Selecting a sulfate-containing, As-affected aquifer at the Datong Basin, northern China as the study area and combining hydrogeochemical investigation and sediment extraction with reactive transport modeling, this work elucidated the roles of Fe-S-As interactions in regulating the vertical variation of As concentration in the groundwater. Dissolved As concentration varied between 0.05 and 18 mot/I, but generally increased in the depth of 20-25 m and then decreased in 25-30 m. The high-As groundwater contained low Fe(II) (<0.007 mmol/L) and up to 15 mu mol/L sulfide, in contrary to the S/SE Asian deltas/floodplains where high Fe(II) and As jointly occur in the groundwater devoid of sulfate reduction. The reductive dissolution of As bearing Fe(III) oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter with an estimated maximum rate of 0.22 mmol C/L/yr, mainly accounted for the depth-dependent increase of As concentration in the upper part of the shallow aquifer (<25 m deep). However, the decreasing reactivity of Fe(III) oxides together with the increase of pH over depth rendered the majority of electrons being transferred to sulfate reduction. The Fe(II) sulfides formed as a consequence not only helped to restrict the build-up of Fe(II) in the groundwater but also probably co-precipitated As to prompt As decrease in the depth of 25-30 m. Arsenite adsorbed on remaining Fe(III) oxides and newly-formed Fe(II) sulfides is another important pool of As in the aquifer, which varies in response to the extents of Fe(III)-oxide and sulfate reduction and consequently alters As distribution coefficient between the solid and the aqueous phases. This study highlights the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of Fe, S and As for As mobilization and reveals how it regulates As partitioning between groundwater and sediments.

AB Influence diagnostics aim to identify a small number of influential data points that have a disproportionate impact on the model parameters and/or predictions. The key issues with current influence diagnostic techniques are that the regression-theory approaches do not provide hydrologically relevant influence metrics, while the case-deletion approaches are computationally expensive to calculate. The main objective of this study is to introduce a new two-stage hybrid framework that overcomes these challenges, by delivering hydrologically relevant influence metrics in a computationally efficient manner. Stage one uses computationally efficient regression-theory influence diagnostics to identify the most influential points based on Cook's distance. Stage two then uses case-deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the influence of points using hydrologically relevant metrics. To illustrate the application of the hybrid framework, we conducted three experiments on 11 hydro-climatologically diverse Australian catchments using the GR4J hydrological model. The first experiment investigated how many data points from stage one need to be retained in order to reliably identify those points that have the hightest influence on hydrologically relevant metrics. We found that a choice of 30-50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study (30 points identified the most influential data 98% of the time and reduced the required recalibrations by 99% for a 10 year calibration period). The second experiment found little evidence of a change in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1, 2, 5 to 10 years. Even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high (>30% influence on maximum predicted flows). The third experiment compared the standard least squares (SLS) objective function with the weighted least squares (WLS) objective function on a 10 year calibration period. In two out of three flow metrics there was evidence that SLS, with the assumption of homoscedastic residual error, identified data points with higher influence (largest changes of 40%, 10%, and 44% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively) than WLS, with the assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors (largest changes of 26%, 6%, and 6% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively). The hybrid framework complements existing model diagnostic tools and can be applied to a wide range of hydrological modelling scenarios. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium. Moreover, valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats. Therefore, the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system. A critical issue is the freshwater-brine mixing zone, which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine.
   The complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three-dimensional (3D) approach to assess the mixing zone geometry. In this study, a 3D map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented, using the Salar de Atacama as an example. This mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three-dimensional numerical models, provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads. After this correction, the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water (brine) heads.
   The different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3D mapping have been interpreted using a two-dimensional (2D) flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross-section of the mixing zone. The result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3D mapping and lower than in previous models. To explain this geometry, the 2D model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry. The higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is, the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become. This occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity, thus reducing the freshwater head. The presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems, such as alluvial fans or karstifled evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats, is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface.

AB Groundwater quality in many regions with intense agriculture has deteriorated due to the leaching of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants. Modified agricultural practices can reduce the input of nitrate to groundwater bodies, but it is crucial to determine the time span over which these measures become effective at reducing nitrate levels in pumping wells. Such estimates can be obtained from hydrogeological modeling or lumped-parameter models (LPM) in combination with environmental tracer data. Two challenges in such tracer-based estimates are (i) accounting for the different modes of transport in the unsaturated zone (USZ), and (ii) assessing uncertainties. Here we extend a recently published Bayesian inference scheme for simple LPMs to include an explicit USZ model and apply it to the Dfinnerngau aquifer, Switzerland. Compared to a previous estimate of travel times in the aquifer based on a 2D hydrogeological model, our approach provides a more accurate assessment of the dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer. We find that including tracer measurements (H-3/He-3, Kr-85, Ar-39, He-4) reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series at wells are not available or short, but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available. Additionally, the combination of tracer data with nitrate time series allows for a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Accurate estimation of sediment concentration is essential to establish physically-based erosion models. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of flow discharge (Q), slope gradient (S), flow velocity (V), shear stress (tau), stream power (omega) and unit stream power (U) on sediment concentration. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a 10 x 0.1 m rill flume under four flow discharges (2, 4, 8 and 16 L min(-1)), and five slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees). The results showed that the measured sediment concentration varied from 87.08 to 620.80 kg m(-3) with a mean value of 343.13 kg m(-3). Sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient, with R-2 = 0.975 and NSE = 0.945. The sediment concentration was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow discharge. The sediment concentration was well predicted by unit stream power (R-2 = 0.937, NSE = 0.865), whereas less satisfactorily by flow velocity (R-2 = 0.470, NSE = 0.539) and stream power (R-2 = 0.773, NSE = 0.732). In addition, using the equations to simulate the measured sediment concentration of other studies, the result further indicated that slope gradient, flow discharge and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration. In general, slope gradient, flow discharge and unit stream power seem to be the preferred predictors for estimating sediment concentration.

AB The hydrological community often turns to widely available spatial datasets such as the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) to characterize the spatial variability of soil properties. When used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models, this has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized or incomplete soil data. Within agriculture, soil data has been left relatively coarse when compared to numerous other data sources measured. This is because localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense, thus a need exists in better connecting spatial datasets with ground observations. Given that hydrogeophysics is data-dense, rapid, non-invasive, and relatively easy to adopt, it is a promising technique to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets. In this work, we utilize two common near surface geophysical methods, cosmic-ray neutron probe and electromagnetic induction, to identify temporally stable spatial patterns of measured geophysical properties in three 65 ha agricultural fields in western Nebraska. This is achieved by repeat geophysical observations of the same study area across a range of wet to dry field conditions in order to evaluate with an empirical orthogonal function. Shallow cores were then extracted within each identified zone and water retention functions were generated in the laboratory. Using EOF patterns as a covariate, we quantify the predictive skill of estimating soil hydraulic properties in areas without measurement using a bootstrap validation analysis. Results indicate that sampling locations informed via repeat hydrogeophysical surveys, required only five cores to reduce the cross-validation root mean squared error by an average of 64% as compared to soil parameters predicted by a commonly used benchmark, SSURGO and ROSETTA. The reduction to five strategically located samples within the 65 ha fields reduces sampling efforts by up to similar to 90% as compared to the common practice of soil grid sampling every 1 ha.

AB A number of physical or data-driven models have been proposed to evaluate stream water temperatures based on hydrological and meteorological observations. However, physical models require a large amount of information that is frequently unavailable, while data-based models ignore the physical processes. Recently the air2stream model has been proposed as an intermediate alternative that is based on physical heat budget processes, but it is so simplified that the model may be applied like data-driven ones. However, the price for simplicity is the need to calibrate eight parameters that, although have some physical meaning, cannot be measured or evaluated a priori. As a result, applicability and performance of the air2stream model for a particular stream relies on the efficiency of the calibration method. The original air2stream model uses an inefficient 20-year old approach called Particle Swarm Optimization with inertia weight.
   This study aims at finding an effective and robust calibration method for the air2stream model. Twelve different optimization algorithms are examined on six different streams from northern USA (states of Washington, Oregon and New York), Poland and Switzerland, located in both high mountains, hilly and lowland areas. It is found that the performance of the air2stream model depends significantly on the calibration method. Two algorithms lead to the best results for each considered stream. The air2stream model, calibrated with the chosen optimization methods, performs favorably against classical streamwater temperature models. The MATLAB code of the air2stream model and the chosen calibration procedure (CoBiDE) are available as Supplementary Material on the Journal of Hydrology web page.

AB This paper is devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of solute dispersion in heterogeneous porous media. Dispersion in heterogenous porous media has been reported to be scale-dependent, a likely indication that the proposed dispersion models are incompletely formulated. A high quality experimental data set of breakthrough curves in periodic model heterogeneous porous media is presented. In contrast with most previously published experiments, the present experiments involve numerous replicates. This allows the statistical variability of experimental data to be accounted for. Several models are benchmarked against the data set: the Fickian-based advection-dispersion, mobile immobile, multirate, multiple region advection dispersion models, and a newly proposed transport model based on pure advection. A salient property of the latter model is that its solutions exhibit a ballistic behaviour for small times, while tending to the Fickian behaviour for large time scales. Model performance is assessed using a novel objective function accounting for the statistical variability of the experimental data set, while putting equal emphasis on both small and large time scale behaviours. Besides being as accurate as the other models, the new purely advective model has the advantages that (i) it does not exhibit the undesirable effects associated with the usual Fickian operator (namely the infinite solute front propagation speed), and (ii) it allows dispersive transport to be simulated on every heterogeneity scale using scale-independent parameters.

AB Irrigation efficiency plays an important role in agricultural productivity; it affects farm-scale water demand, and the partitioning of irrigation losses into evaporative and non-evaporative components. This partitioning determines return flow generation and thus affects water availability. Over the last two decades, hydrologic and agricultural research communities have significantly improved our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water availability and food productivity. However, the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly on the partitioning between evaporative and non-evaporative losses, have received little attention. In this study, we incorporated a process-based irrigation module into a coupled hydrologic/agricultural modeling framework (VIC-CropSyst). To understand how climate change may impact irrigation losses, we applied VIC-CropSyst over the Yakima River basin, an important agricultural region in Washington State, U.S. We compared the historical period of 1980-2010 to an ensemble of ten projections of climate for two future periods: 2030-2060 and 2060-2090. Results averaged over the watershed showed that a 9% increase in evaporative losses will be compensated by a reduction of non-evaporative losses. Therefore, overall changes in future efficiency are negligible (-0.4%) while the Evaporative Loss Ratio (ELR) (defined as the ratio of evaporative to non-evaporative irrigation losses) is enhanced by 10%. This higher ELR is associated with a reduction in return flows, thus negatively impacting downstream water availability. Results also indicate that the impact of climate change on irrigation losses depend on irrigation type and climate scenarios. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the Mise-a-la-Masse (MALM) technique associated with saline tracer tests for the characterization of groundwater flow direction and velocity. The experimental site is located in the upper part of the Alento River alluvial plain (Campania Region, Southern Italy). In this paper we present the hydrogeological setting, the experimental setup and the relevant field results. Subsequently, we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3D resistivity model of the test area, coupled with a model describing the Advection - Dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection. In particular, we calculate a series of 3D forward solutions starting from a reference model, all derived from electrical tomography results, but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions. Each electrical resistivity 3D model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for MALM surveys. Finally, the synthetic MALM voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the MALM dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics. The results demonstrate that the information content of the MALM data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties. This work shows how a combination of three-dimensional time-lapse modeling of flow, tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of MALM measurements during a saline tracer test. This approach can thus revive the use of MALM as a practical, low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over recent decades, regions of West and Central Africa have experienced different and significant changes in climatic patterns, which have significantly impacted hydrological regimes. Such impacts, however, are not fully understood at the regional scale, largely because of scarce hydroclimatic data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to (a) assemble a new, robust, reconstructed streamflow dataset of 152 gauging stations; (b) quantify changes in streamflow over 1950-2005 period, using these newly reconstructed datasets; (c) significantly reveal trends and variability in streamflow over West and Central Africa based on new reconstructions; and (d) assess the robustness of this dataset by comparing the results with those identified in key climatic drivers (e.g. precipitation and temperature) over the region. Gap filling methods applied to monthly time series (1950-2005) yielded robust results (median Kling-Gupta Efficiency > 0.75). The study underlines a good agreement between precipitation and streamflow trends and reveals contrasts between western Africa (negative trends) and Central Africa (positive trends) in the 1950s and 1960s. Homogenous dry conditions of the 1970s and 1980s, characterized by reduced significant negative trends resulting from quasi-decadal modulations of the trend, are replaced by wetter conditions in the recent period (1993-2005). The effect of this rainfall recovery (which extends to West and Central Africa) on increased river flows are further amplified by land use change in some Sahelian basins. This is partially offset, however, by higher potential evapotranspiration rates over parts of Niger and Nigeria. Crucially, the new reconstructed streamflow datasets presented here will be available for both the scientific community and water resource managers.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is of great importance due to its key role in water resource management. Surface energy modeling tools such as Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) can estimate the amount of evapotranspiration for every pixel of the satellite images. The main objective of this research is evaporation investigation from the freshwater bodies using SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS. For this purpose, the Amirkabir dam reservoir and its nearby agricultural lands in a semi-arid climate were selected and studied from 2011 to 2017 as the study area. The implementations of this study were accomplished on 16 satellite images of Landsat TM5 and OLI. Then, SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS were implemented on the selected images. Moreover, the corresponding pan evaporate measurements on the reservoir bank were considered as the ground truth data. Regarding to the results, SEBAL is not a reliable method to evaluate freshwater evaporation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.36 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.1 mm. On the other hand, METRIC with RMSE and R-2 of 0,57 and 2.02 mm and SEBS with RMSE and R-2 of 0.93 and 0.62 demonstrated a relatively good performance.

AB Limestone aquifers are of great interest as a drinking water resource in many countries. They often have a complex crushed and fractured geology, which makes the analysis and description of flow and transport processes in such aquifers a challenging task. In this study, the solute transport behavior including fracture-matrix interaction in hydrogeological units of a limestone aquifer in eastern Denmark was characterized by designing, conducting and interpreting six depth-specific tracer tests involving natural- and forced-gradient conditions with multiple tracers representing different diffusion properties. To determine flow parameters, the tracer tests were complemented by a comprehensive set of depth-specific borehole and hydraulic tests.
   Based on the tests, a new and stronger conceptual understanding was developed for the different aquifer units. The investigated limestone aquifer is composed of a glacially crushed unit and two fractured units, with calcarenitic and bryozoan limestone of similar hydraulic properties. Hydraulic tests revealed that the crushed unit has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the fractured limestone units, likely due to the crushed conditions with small limestone clusters and small-aperture fractures potentially filled with fine material.
   In the fractured limestone units, a distinct preferential flow and primary transport along major horizontal fractures was inferred from the tracer tests under forced-gradient conditions. The dominant horizontal fractures were identified on impeller flow logs and appear connected between wells, having an extent of up to several hundred meters. Connectivity between the aquifer units was investigated with a long-term pumping test and tracer tests, revealing restricted vertical flow and transport. A very pronounced hydraulic conductivity contrast between major fractures and matrix could also be inferred from the borehole and hydraulic tests, which is consistent with the findings from the tracer tests. The difference in the matrix diffusion behavior of the simultaneously injected tracers and a long tailing in the breakthrough curves revealed that matrix diffusion has a strong influence on the solute transport in the fractured limestone.

AB Stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of water can help our understanding of origin, mixing and migration of groundwater. In the formation with low permeability, it provides information about migration mechanism of ion such as diffusion and/or advection. Thus it has been realized as very important information to understand the migration of water and ions in it. However, in formation with low permeability it is difficult to obtain the ground water sample as liquid and water in pores needs to be extracted to estimate it. Compressing rock is the most common and widely used method of extracting water in pores. However, changes in delta H-2 and delta O-18 may take place during compression because changes in ion concentration have been reported in previous studies.
   In this study, two natural rocks were compressed, and the changes in the delta H-2 and delta O-18 with compression pressure were investigated. Mechanisms for the changes in water isotopes observed during the compression were then discussed. In addition, delta H-2 and delta O-18 of water in pores were also evaluated by direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry (DVE-LS) and delta H-2 and delta O-18 were compared with those obtained by compression. delta H-2 was found to change during the compression and a part of this change was found to be explained by the effect of water from closed pores extracted by compression. In addition, water isotopes in both open and closed pores were estimated by combining the results of 2 kinds of compression experiments. Water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by DVE-IS indicating compression could show the mixed information of water from open and closed pores, while DVE-LS could show the information only for open pores. Thus, the comparison of water isotopes obtained by compression and DVE-LS could provide the information about water isotopes in closed and open pores.

AB Headwater catchments provide substantial streamflow to rivers even during long periods of drought. Documenting the mean transit times (MTT) of stream water in headwater catchments and therefore the retention capacities of these catchments is crucial for water management. This study uses time series of H-3 activities in combination with major ion concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radon activities (Rn-222) in the Lyrebird Creek catchment in Victoria, Australia to provide a unique insight into the mean transit time distributions and flow systems of this small temperate headwater catchment. At all streamflows, the stream has H-3 activities (< 2.4 TU) that are significantly below those of rainfall (similar to 3.2 TU), implying that most of the water in the stream is derived from stores with long transit times. If the water in the catchment can be represented by a single store with a continuum of ages, mean transit times of the stream water range from similar to 6 up to 40 years, which indicates the large retention potential for this catchment. Alternatively, variations of H-3 activities, stable isotopes and major ions can be explained by mixing between of young recent recharge and older water stored in the catchment. While surface runoff is negligible, the variation in stable isotope ratios, major ion concentrations and radon activities during most of the year is minimal (+/- 12%) and only occurs during major storm events. This suggests that different subsurface water stores are activated during the storm events and that these cease to provide water to the stream within a few days or weeks after storm events. The stores comprise micro and macropore flow in the soils and saprolite as well as the boundary between the saprolite and the fractured bed rock. Hydrograph separations from three major storm events using Tritium, electrical conductivity and selected major ions as well a delta O-18 suggest a minimum of 50% baseflow at most flow conditions.
   We demonstrate that headwater catchments can have a significant storage capacity and that the relationship between long-water stores and fast storm event subsurface flow is complex. The study also illustrates that using H-3 to determine mean transit times is probably only valid for baseflow conditions where the catchment can be represented as a single store.
   The results of this study reinforce the need to protect headwater catchments from contamination and extreme land use changes.

AB Snow is an important component of the hydrological cycle. As a major part of the cryosphere, snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource. In the context of climate change, the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets. Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations. However, the uncertainties caused by systematic errors, scale gaps, and complicated snow physics, among other factors, limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies. In this paper, an overview of the advantages, limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented, and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated. The possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground-based observations is discussed. As a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), web-based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal, correction, validation, forcing and assimilation. Finally, this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research. This framework highlights the cross-scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models.

AB A modified Green-and-Ampt model is formulated to quantify infiltration on sloping terrain underlain by homogeneous soil wetted by surficial water application. This paper's theory for quantifying infiltration relies on the mathematical statement of the coupled partial differential equations (pdes) governing infiltration and runoff. These pdes are solved by employing an explicit finite-difference numerical method that yields the infiltration, the infiltration rate, the depth to the wetting front, the rate of runoff, and the depth of runoff everywhere on the slope during external wetting. Data inputs consist of a water application rate or the rainfall hyetograph of a storm of arbitrary duration, soil hydraulic characteristics and antecedent moisture, and the slope's hydraulic and geometric characteristics. The presented theory predicts the effect an advancing wetting front has on slope stability with respect to translational sliding. This paper's theory also develops the 1D pde governing suspended sediment transport and slope degradation caused by runoff influenced by infiltration. Three examples illustrate the application of the developed theory to calculate infiltration and runoff on a slope and their role on the stability of cohesive and cohesionless soils forming sloping terrain.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays an important role in stream ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on the factors influencing the HZ in the steady state. However, the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the HZ can become transient during a storm. This study investigates the impacts of different rainfall patterns (varying in intensity and duration) on the HZ under transient conditions. A two-dimensional numerical model of a 10-m long and 2-m deep domain is developed, in which the streambed consists of a series of dunes. Brinkman-Darcy and Navier-Stokes equations are respectively solved for groundwater and surface water, and velocity and pressure are coupled at the interface (i.e., the streambed surface). To compare the results under different transient conditions, this study proposes two indicators, i.e., the influential time (IT, the time required for the HZ to return to its initial state once it starts to change) and the influential depth (ID, the maximum increment in the HZ depth). To detect the extent to which the HZ undergoes significant spatial changes, moving split-window and inflection point tests are conducted. The results indicate that rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall duration (RD) both display logarithmic relationships with the IT and ID with high coefficients of determination, but only between certain lower and upper thresholds of the RI and RD. Moreover, the distributions of the IT and ID as a function of the RI and RD are mapped using the surface spline and kriging interpolation methods to facilitate future prediction of the IT and ID. In addition, it is observed that the IT has a linear negative correlation with the groundwater response while the ID is not affected by different groundwater responses. All of the derived relationships can be used to predict the impacts of a future rainfall event on the HZ.

AB Effective modelling and prediction of smaller time step rainfall is reported to be very difficult owing to its highly erratic nature. Accurate forecast of daily rainfall for longer duration (multi time step) may be exceptionally helpful in the efficient planning and management of water resources systems. Identification of inherent patterns in a rainfall time series is also important for an effective water resources planning and management system. In the present study, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is utilized to forecast the daily rainfall time series pertaining to Koyna watershed in Maharashtra, India, for 365 days after extracting various components of the rainfall time series such as trend, periodic component, noise and cyclic component. In order to forecast the time series for longer time step (365 days-one window length), the signal and noise components of the time series are forecasted separately and then added together. The results of the study show that the method of SSA could extract the various components of the time series effectively and could also forecast the daily rainfall time series for longer duration such as one year in a single run with reasonable accuracy.

AB Newly available, more detailed and accurate elevation data sets, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) generated on the basis of imagery from terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can be used to improve flood-model input data and consequently increase the accuracy of the flood modelling results. This paper presents the first application of the MBlend merging method and assesses the impact of combining different DEMs on flood modelling results. It was demonstrated that different raster merging methods can have different and substantial impacts on these results. In addition to the influence associated with the method used to merge the original DEMs, the magnitude of the impact also depends on (i) the systematic horizontal and vertical differences of the DEMs, and (ii) the orientation between the DEM boundary and the terrain slope. The greater water depth and flow velocity differences between the flood modelling results obtained using the reference DEM and the merged DEMs ranged from -9.845 to 0.002 m, and from 0.003 to 0.024 m s(-1) respectively; these differences can have a significant impact on flood hazard estimates. In most of the cases investigated in this study, the differences from the reference DEM results were smaller for the MBlend method than for the results of the two conventional methods. This study highlighted the importance of DEM merging when conducting flood modelling and provided hints on the best DEM merging methods to use.

AB Accurate models of soil moisture are vital for solving core problems in meteorology, hydrology, agriculture and ecology. The capacity for soil moisture modelling is growing rapidly with the development of high-resolution, continent-scale gridded weather and soil data together with advances in modelling methods. In particular, the GlobalSoilMap.net initiative represents next-generation, depth-specific gridded soil products that may substantially increase soil moisture modelling capacity. Here we present an implementation of Campbell's infiltration and redistribution model within the NicheMapR microclimate modelling package for the R environment, and use it to assess the predictive power provided by the GlobalSoilMap.net product Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA, similar to 100 m) as well as the coarser resolution global product SoilGrids (SG, similar to 250 m). Predictions were tested in detail against 3 years of root-zone (3-75 cm) soil moisture observation data from 35 monitoring sites within the OzNet project in Australia, with additional tests of the finalised modelling approach against cosmic-ray neutron (CosmOz, 0-50 cm, 9 sites from 2011 to 2017) and satellite (ASCAT, 0-2 cm, continent-wide from 2007 to 2009) observations. The model was forced by daily 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) gridded meteorological data. The NicheMapR system predicted soil moisture to within experimental error for all data sets. Using the SLGA or the SG soil database, the OzNet soil moisture could be predicted with a root mean square error (rinse) of similar to 0.075 m(3) m(-3) and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.65 consistently through the soil profile without any parameter tuning. Soil moisture predictions based on the SLGA and SG datasets were approximate to 17% closer to the observations than when using a chloropleth-derived soil data set (Digital Atlas of Australian Soils), with the greatest improvements occurring for deeper layers. The CosmOz observations were predicted with similar accuracy (r = 0.76 and rise of similar to.085 m(3) m(-3)). Comparisons at the continental scale to 0-2 cm satellite data (ASCAT) showed that the SLGA/SG datasets increased model fit over simulations using the DAAS soil properties (r similar to 0.63 & rinse 15% vs. r 0.48 & rise 18%, respectively). Overall, our results demonstrate the advantages of using GlobalSoilMap.net products in combination with gridded weather data for modelling soil moisture at fine spatial and temporal resolution at the continental scale.

AB Streamflow is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle in the regional and global scale and the main source of fresh water supply. It is highly associated with natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Therefore, accurate streamflow forecasting is essential. Forecasting streamflow in general and monthly streamflow in particular is a complex process that cannot be handled by data-driven models (DDMs) only and requires pre-processing. Wavelet transformation is a pre-processing technique; however, application of continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) produces many scales that cause deterioration in the performance of any DDM because of the high number of redundant variables. This study proposes multigene genetic programming (MGGP) as a selection tool. After the CWT analysis, it selects important scales to be imposed into the artificial neural network (ANN). A basin located in the southeast of Turkey is selected as case study to prove the forecasting ability of the proposed model. One month ahead downstream flow is used as output, and downstream flow, upstream, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration with associated lags are used as inputs. Before modeling, wavelet coherence transformation (WCT) analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between variables in the time-frequency domain. Several combinations were developed to investigate the effect of the variables on streamflow forecasting. The results indicated a high localized correlation between the streamflow and other variables, especially the upstream. In the models of the standalone layout where the data were entered to ANN and MGGP without CWT, the performance is found poor. In the best-scale layout, where the best scale of the CWT identified as the highest correlated scale is chosen and enters to ANN and MGGP, the performance increased slightly. Using the proposed model, the performance improved dramatically particularly in forecasting the peak values because of the inclusion of several scales in which seasonality and irregularity can be captured. Using hydrological and meteorological variables also improved the ability to forecast the streamflow.

AB The hydrological regime of a lake is largely dependent on its bathymetry. A dramatic water level reduction has occurred in Poyang Lake in recent years, coinciding with significant bed erosion. Few studies have focused on the influence of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in such a complex river-lake floodplain system. This study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes (1998-2010) on the water level spatiotemporal distribution in Poyang Lake, based on a dry year (2006), a wet year (2010) and an average year (2000-2010). The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study: (1) The bed erosion of the northern outlet channel averaged 3 m, resulting in a decrease in the water level by 1.2-2 m in the northern channels (the most significantly influenced areas) and approximately 0.3 m in the central lake areas during low-level periods. The water levels below 16 m and 14 m were significantly affected during the rising period and recession period, respectively. The water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels. (2) The water surface profiles adjusted, and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased by 0.5-3.1 cm/d at the lake outlet. The bathymetric influence extended across the entire lake due to the emptying effect, resulting in a change in the water level distribution. The average annual outflow increased by 6.8%. (3) The bathymetric changes contributed approximately 14.4% to the extreme low water level in autumn 2006 and enhanced the drought in the dry season. This study quantified the impact of the bathymetric changes on the lake water levels, thereby providing a better understanding of the potential effects of continued sand mining operations and providing scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of Poyang Lake. Moreover, this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes.

AB Freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities. However, the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale. This study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities, considering various sites from around the world. The groundwater conditions in twenty-seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored. The investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels, and offshore salinity knowledge, in combination with analytical modelling, to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites. Seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater-saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling. We consider both present-day and pre-development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater. Conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability. The results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre-development and present-day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre-development data are available. Estimates of the associated steady-state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines. Both present-day and pre-development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist. This suggests that paleo-freshwater and/or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent. Present-day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion (SWI) will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty-seven sites, while passive SWI is expected onshore in an additional ten regions. Albeit the number of field sites is limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage, it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use. Thus, offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal water balances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input, rather than as a new potential freshwater resource.

AB Among different reference evapotranspiration (ETo) modeling approaches, mass transfer-based methods have been less studied. These approaches utilize temperature and wind speed records. On the other hand, the empirical equations proposed in this context generally produce weak simulations, except when a local calibration is used for improving their performance. This might be a crucial drawback for those equations in case of local data scarcity for calibration procedure. So, application of heuristic methods can be considered as a substitute for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer-based approaches. However, given that the wind speed records have usually higher variation magnitudes than the other meteorological parameters, application of a wavelet transform for coupling with heuristic models would be necessary. In the present paper, a coupled wavelet -random forest (WRF) methodology was proposed for the first time to improve the performance accuracy of the mass transfer-based ETo estimation approaches using cross-validation data management scenarios in both local and cross-station scales. The obtained results revealed that the new coupled WRF model (with the minimum scatter index values of 0.150 and 0.192 for local and external applications, respectively) improved the performance accuracy of the single RF models as well as the empirical equations to great extent.

AB Fractured crystalline aquifers of mountain watersheds may host a significant portion of the world's freshwater supply. To effectively utilize water resources in these environments, it is important to understand the hydraulic properties, groundwater storage, and flow processes in crystalline aquifers and field-derived insights are critically needed. Based on borehole hydraulic characterization and monitoring data, this study inferred hydraulic properties and groundwater flow of a crystalline fractured aquifer in Laramie Range, Wyoming. At three open holes completed in a fractured granite aquifer, both slug tests and FLUTe liner profiling were performed to obtain estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-h). Televiewer (i.e., optical and acoustic) and flowmeter logs were then jointly interpreted to identify the number of flowing fractures and fracture zones. Based on these data, hydraulic apertures were obtained for each borehole. Average groundwater velocity was then computed using K-h, aperture, and water level monitoring data. Finally, based on all available data, including cores, borehole logs, LIDAR topography, and a seismic P-wave velocity model, a three dimensional geological model of the site was built. In this fractured aquifer, (1) borehole K-h, varies over similar to 4 orders of magnitude (10(-8)-10(-5) m/s). K-h is consistently higher near the top of the bedrock that is interpreted as the weathering front. Using a cutoff K-h of 10(-10)m/s, the hydraulically significant zone extends to similar to 40-53 m depth. (2) FLUTe-estimated hydraulic apertures of fractures vary over 1 order of magnitude, and at each borehole, the average hydraulic aperture by FLUTe is very close to that obtained from slug tests. Thus, slug test can be used to provide a reliable estimate of the average fracture hydraulic aperture. (3) Estimated average effective fracture porosity is 4.0 x 10(-4), therefore this fractured aquifer can host significant quantity of water. (4) Natural groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0.4 to 81.0 m/day, implying rapid pathways of fracture flow. (5) The average ambient water table position follows the boundary between saprolite and fractured bedrock. Groundwater flow at the site appears topography driven.

AB Climate change will affect precipitation and flood regimes. It is anticipated that the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) and Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) will be modified in a changing climate. This paper aims to quantify and analyze climate change influences on PMP and PMF in three watersheds with different climatic conditions across the province of Quebec, Canada. Output data from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) was used to estimate PMP and Probable Maximum Snow Accumulation (PMSA) in future climate projections, which was then used to force the SWAT hydrological model to estimate PMF. PMP and PMF values were estimated for two time horizons each spanning 30 years: 1961-1990 (recent past) and 2041-2070 (future). PMP and PMF were separately analyzed for two seasons: summer-fall and spring. Results show that PMF in the watershed located in southern Quebec would remain unchanged in the future horizon, but the trend for the watersheds located in the northeastern and northern areas of the province is an increase of up to 11%.

AB The stable isotope composition of precipitation records processes taking place within the hydrological cycle. Potentially, moisture sources are important controls on the stable isotope composition of precipitation, but studies focused on this topic are still scarce. We studied the moisture sources contributing to precipitation at Postojna (Slovenia) from 2009 to 2013. Back trajectory analyses were computed for the days with precipitation at Postojna. The moisture uptake locations were identified along these trajectories using standard hydro meteorological formulation. The moisture uptake locations were integrated in eight source regions to facilitate its comparison to the monthly oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18 values) of precipitation. Nearly half of the precipitation originated from continental sources (recycled moisture), and > 40% was from central and western Mediterranean. Results show that moisture sources do not have a significant impact on the oxygen isotope composition at this site. We suggest that the large proportion of recycled moisture originated from transpiration rather than evaporation, which produced water vapour with less negative delta O-18 values. Thus the difference between the oceanic and local vapour source was reduced, which prevented the distinction of the moisture sources based on their oxygen isotope signature. Nevertheless, delta O-18 values of precipitation are partially controlled by climate parameters, which is of major importance for paleoclimate studies. We found that the main climate control on Postojna delta O-18 values of precipitation is the surface temperature. Amount effect was not recorded at this site, and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not impact the delta O-18 values of precipitation. The Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) was correlated to oxygen stable isotope composition, although this atmospheric pattern was not a control. Instead we found that the link to delta O-18 values results from synoptic scenarios affecting WeMO index as well as temperature. Therefore, interpretation of delta O-18 values of precipitation in terms of climate is limited to surface temperature, although at least half of the variability observed still depends on unknown controls of the hydrological cycle.

AB Stream and groundwater interactions play an essential role in regulating flow, temperature, and water quality for stream ecosystems. Temperature gradients have been used to quantify vertical water movement in the streambed since the 1960s, but advancements in thermal methods are still possible. Seepage runs are a method commonly used to quantify exchange rates through a series of streamflow measurements but can be labor and time intensive. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal equilibrium method as a technique for quantifying groundwater flux using monitored stream water temperature at a single point and readily available hydrological and atmospheric data. Our primary assumption was that stream water temperature at the monitored point was at thermal equilibrium with the combination of all heat transfer processes, including mixing with groundwater. By expanding the monitored stream point into a hypothetical, horizontal one-dimensional thermal modeling domain, we were able to simulate the thermal equilibrium achieved with known atmospheric variables at the point and quantify unknown groundwater flux by calibrating the model to the resulting temperature signature. Stream water temperatures were monitored at single points at nine streams in the Ozark Highland ecoregion and five reaches of the Kiamichi River to estimate groundwater fluxes using the thermal equilibrium method. When validated by comparison with seepage runs performed at the same time and reach, estimates from the two methods agreed with each other with an R-2 of 0.94, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.08 (m/d) and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.93. In conclusion, the thermal equilibrium method was a suitable technique for quantifying groundwater flux with minimal cost and simple field installation given that suitable atmospheric and hydrological data were readily available.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission (SWOT), scheduled for launch in 2021, will deliver two-dimensional observations of water surface heights for lakes, rivers wider than 100 m and oceans. Even though the scientific literature has highlighted several fields of application for the expected products, detailed simulations of the SWOT radar performance for a realistic river scenario have not been presented in the literature. Understanding the error of the most fundamental "raw" SWOT hydrology product is important in order to have a greater awareness about strengths and limits of the forthcoming satellite observations. This study focuses on a reach (similar to 140 km in length) of the middle-lower portion of the Po River, in Northern Italy, and, to date, represents one of the few real-case analyses of the spatial patterns in water surface elevation accuracy expected from SWOT. The river stretch is characterized by a main channel varying from 100 to 500 m in width and a large floodplain (up to 5 km) delimited by a system of major embankments. The simulation of the water surface along the Po River for different flow conditions (high, low and mean annual flows) is performed with inputs from a quasi-2D model implemented using detailed topographic and bathymetric information (LiDAR, 2 m resolution). By employing a simulator that mimics many SWOT satellite sensor characteristics and generates proxies of the remotely sensed hydrometric data, this study characterizes the spatial observations potentially provided by SWOT. We evaluate SWOT performance under different hydraulic conditions and assess possible effects of river embankments, river width, river topography and distance from the satellite ground track. Despite analyzing errors from the raw radar pixel cloud, which receives minimal processing, the present study highlights the promising potential of this Ka-band interferometer for measuring water surface elevations, with mean elevation errors of 0.1 cm and 21 cm for high and low flows, respectively. Results of the study characterize the expected performance of the upcoming SWOT mission and provide additional insights into potential applications of SWOT observations.

AB Sediment connectivity has been shown in recent years to explain how the watershed configuration controls sediment transport. However, we find no studies develop a watershed erosion modeling framework based on sediment connectivity, and few, if any, studies have quantified sediment connectivity for gently rolling systems. We develop a new predictive sediment connectivity model that relies on the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply, detachment, transport, and buffers to sediment transport, which is integrated in a watershed erosion model framework. The model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across a watershed using field reconnaissance results, a high-resolution digital elevation models, a hydrologic model, and shear-based erosion formulae. Model results validate the capability of the model to predict erosion pathways causing sediment connectivity. More notably, disconnectivity dominates the gently rolling watershed across all morphologic levels of the uplands, including, microtopography from low energy undulating surfaces across the landscape, swales and gullies only active in the highest events, karst sinkholes that disconnect drainage areas, and flood plains that de-couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor. Results show that sediment connectivity is predicted for about 2% or more the watershed's area 37 days of the year, with the remaining days showing very little or no connectivity. Only 12.8 +/- 0.7% of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the study year. Results also highlight the importance of urban/suburban sediment pathways in gently rolling watersheds, and dynamic and longitudinal distributions of sediment connectivity might be further investigated in future work. We suggest the method herein provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria and has the potential to reduce computational costs in watershed erosion modeling.

AB The scientific explanation of speleothem delta O-18 in Chinese monsoon region is a greatly debated issue. Modern cave monitoring combined with instrument observation maybe is an essential solution to deal with this issue. During the period from 2011 to 2016, we monitored local precipitation, soil water in three soil profiles, and six drip water sites in Yangkou Cave, which is located in Chongqing City, Southwest China. This article presents measurements about delta O-18, SD and Mg/Ca ratios of drip water and compared these geochemical proxies with contemporaneous atmospheric circulations. The main conclusions are: (1) As water migrates from precipitation to soil water to cave drip water, the amplitudes of seasonal variations in SD and delta O-18 decreased gradually. Due to the existence of complex hydrogeological conditions, the range of variation and the seasonal characteristics of SD and delta O-18 differ among the drip sites where samples were collected, but the interannual variability is nearly the same. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios are mainly regulated by changes in hydrological conditions in the epikarst zone, with higher values during winter months than that during summer months. (2) When an El Nino event occurs, the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is migrated westward, and the production of near source water vapor from the western Pacific and the South China Sea increases, leading to higher delta O-18 values in the precipitation and the cave drip water. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios were significantly lower with increased summer precipitation. On the other hand, during La Nina events, the WPSH is migrated eastward, and inputs of water vapor that has traveled greater distances (from the Indian Ocean) become comparatively important, resulting in lower delta O-18 values in the precipitation and the cave drip water. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios were higher with decreased summer precipitation. In summary, the interannual variability of delta O-18 in the drip waters of Yangkou Cave reflects changes in water vapor sources caused by atmospheric circulation patterns. Mg/Ca ratios respond to changes of precipitation and CO2 in soil and can be used to reconstruct abnormal drought or flood events.

AB Predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, boundary conditions, and human activities; also, nonlinear interactions occur among these factors. Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000-2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000-2011) and validation set (2012-2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R-2 scores (0.789-0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R-2 scores (0.004-0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model's architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R-2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R-2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model's architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.

AB Spectral induced polarization (SIP) is considered as a promising tool in environmental investigations. However, few works have done regarding the electrical signature of oil contamination of clayey soils upon induced polarization. Laboratory column experiments plus one sandbox experiment are conducted in this study to investigate the performances of the SIP method in oil-contaminated soils. First, a total of 12 soils are investigated to reveal the influences of water and soil properties on the saturation dependence of the complex conductivity below 100 Hz. Results show that the magnitude of the complex conductivity consistently decreases with decreasing water saturation for all soils samples. The saturation n and quadrature conductivity p exponents tend to increase slightly with increasing water salinity when using a linear conductivity model. The saturation exponent increases marginally with the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the specific surface area (S-sp) while the quadrature conductivity exponent exhibits a relatively stronger dependence on both CEC and S-sp. For the low CEC soil samples (normally <= 10 meq/100 g), the quadrature conductivity exponent p correlates well with the saturation exponent n using the relationship p = n- 1. SIP method is further applied in a sandbox experiment to estimate the saturation distribution and total volume of the oil. Results demonstrate that the SIP method has a great potential for mapping the organic contaminant plume and quantifying the oil volume.

AB Current physically based erosion models do not carefully consider the dynamic variations of soil properties during rainfall and are unable to simulate saline-sodic soil slope erosion processes. The aim of this work was to build upon a complete model framework, SSEM, to simulate runoff and erosion processes for saline-sodic soils by coupling dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks and soil erodibility K-tau. Sixty rainfall simulation rainfall experiments (2 soil textures x 5 sodicity levels x 2 slope gradients x 3 duplicates) provided data for model calibration and validation. SSEM worked very well for simulating the runoff and erosion processes of saline-sodic silty clay. The runoff and erosion processes of saline-sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non-saline soils or soils with higher clay contents; thus, SSEM did not perform very well for some validation events. We further examined the model performances of four concepts: Dynamic Ks and K-tau (Case 1, SSEM), Dynamic Ks and Constant K-tau (Case 2), Constant Ks and Dynamic K-tau (Case 3) and Constant Ks and Constant K-tau (Case 4). The results demonstrated that the model, which considers dynamic variations in soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility, can provide more reasonable runoff and erosion prediction results for saline-sodic soils.

AB Chronic groundwater decline is a concern in many of the world's major agricultural areas. However, a general lack of accurate long-term in situ measurement of groundwater depth and analysis of trends prevents understanding of the dynamics of these systems at landscape scales. This is particularly worrying in the context of future climate uncertainties. This study examines long-term groundwater responses to climate variability in a major agricultural production landscape in southern Queensland, Australia. Based on records for 381 groundwater bores, we used a modified Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Sen's slope estimator to determine groundwater trends across a 26-year period (1989-2015) and in distinct wet and dry climatic phases. Comparison of trends between climatic phases showed groundwater level recovery during wet phases was insufficient to offset the decline in groundwater level from the previous dry phase. Across the entire 26-year sampling period, groundwater bore levels (all bores) showed an overall significant declining trend (p < 0.05) of an average 0.06 m year(-1). Fifty-one bores (20%) exhibited significant declining groundwater levels (p < 0.05), 25 bores (10%) exhibited significant rising groundwater levels (p < 0.05), and 175 bores (70%) exhibited no significant change in groundwater levels (p > 0.05). Spatially, both declining and rising bores were highly clustered. We conclude that over 1989-2015 there is a significant net decline in groundwater levels driven by a smaller subset of highly responsive bores in high irrigation areas within the catchment. Despite a number of targeted policy interventions, chronic groundwater decline remains evident in the catchment. We argue that this is likely to continue and to occur more widely under potential climate change and that policy makers, groundwater users and managers need to engage in planning to ensure the sustainability of this vital resource.

AB A methodology based on general hydraulic relations for rivers has been developed to estimate the discharge (flow rate) of rivers using satellite remote sensing observations. The estimates of discharge, flow depth, and flow velocity are derived from remotely observed water surface area, water surface slope, and water surface height, and demonstrated for two reaches of the Yukon River in Alaska, at Eagle (reach length 34.7 km) and near Stevens Village (reach length 38.3 km). The method is based on fundamental equations of hydraulic flow resistance in rivers, including the Manning equation and the Prandtl-von Karman universal velocity distribution equation. The method employs some new hydraulic relations to help define flow resistance and height of the zero flow boundary in the channel. Estimates are made both with and without calibration. The water surface area of the river reach is measured by using a provisional version of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat based product named Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The water surface height and slope measurements require a self-consistent datum, and are derived from observations from the Jason-2 satellite altimeter mission. At both reach locations, the Jason-2 radar altimeter non-winter heights consistently tracked the stage recorded at USGS streamgages with a standard deviation of differences (error) during the non-winter periods of less than 7%. Part of the error may be due to differences in the gage and altimeter crossing locations with respect to the range of stage change and the response to changes in discharge at the upstream and downstream locations. For the non winter periods, the radar derived slope estimates (mean = 0.0003) were constant over the mission lifetime, and in agreement with previously measured USGS water surface slopes and slopes determined from USGS topographic maps. The accuracy of the mean of the uncalibrated daily estimates of discharge varied between reaches, ranging from 13% near Stevens Village (N = 90) to 21% at Eagle (N = 246) based on the absolute error, and 5% to 6% based on the error of the log of the estimates. Calibrating to the mean of USGS daily discharge estimates from the streamflow rating for the same period of record at each streamgage resulted in mean absolute errors ranging from 1% to 2%, and log errors ranging from 1% or less. The error pattern of the estimates shows that without calibration, even though the mean is well simulated, the high and low end values over the range of estimates may have significant bias.

AB Uncertainties about the age of base-flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems where subsurface pathways, and the ongoing release of pollutants that accumulated in the subsurface during past decades, dominate the water quality signal. Numerical groundwater models may be used to estimate groundwater return times and base-flow ages and thus predict the time required for stakeholders to see the results of improved agricultural management practices. However, the uncertainty inherent in the relationship between (i) the observations of atmospherically-derived tracers that are required to calibrate such models and (ii) the predictions of system age that the observations inform have not been investigated. For example, few if any studies have assessed the uncertainty of numerically-simulated system ages or evaluated the uncertainty reductions that may result from the expense of collecting additional subsurface tracer data. In this study we combine numerical flow and transport modeling of atmospherically-derived tracers with prediction uncertainty methods to accomplish four objectives. First, we show the relative importance of head, discharge, and tracer information for characterizing response times in a uniquely data rich catchment that includes 266 age-tracer measurements (SF6, CFCs, and H-3) in addition to long term monitoring of water levels and stream discharge. Second, we calculate uncertainty intervals for model-simulated base-flow ages using both linear and non-linear methods, and find that the prediction sensitivity vector used by linear first order second-moment methods results in much larger uncertainties than non-linear Monte Carlo methods operating on the same parameter uncertainty. Third, by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system, we show that data-worth calculations and monitoring network design are sensitive to variations in the amount of water leaving the system via stream discharge and irrigation withdrawals. Finally, we demonstrate a novel model-averaged computation of potential data worth that can account for these uncertainties in model structure. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The LOMOS-mini is a new experimental system monitoring transient water and heat fluxes in the hyporheic zone at a sub-daily resolution. Given the coupling of high-frequency hydraulic head gradient and temperature measurements, its innovation when compared to currently available monitoring systems is to operate under transient conditions and to allow the quantification of coupled water and heat exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution, such as the rainfall event time scale. The LOMOS-mini is low-cost, easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy of several months in the field. Its robust implementation protocol makes it suitable for a wide variety of geological environments, from soft loamy, sandy, clayey streambeds to compact colluvial environments. Hydraulic head gradients are measured using the pressure sensor technology presented in Greswell et al. (2009). The sensibility of pressure estimates to ambient temperature is demonstrated; the measurement error is evaluated to decrease by up to one order of magnitude when accounting for temperature in the calibration relationship. Coupled with a physically-based hydrothermal model, the LOMOS-mini provides transient estimates of vertically distributed Darcy fluxes, conductive and advective heat fluxes. The methodology is illustrated on a colluvial streambed case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is predicted to lead to an increased frequency of high intensity rainfall events. The impact on groundwater resources, particularly in areas of fractured bedrock aquifer systems, requires knowledge of how recharge is affected. In this study, the response of a fractured bedrock aquifer to heavy rainfall events is characterized. The study area is the Gulf Islands, a temperate region in British Columbia, Canada. Of the 14 provincial observation wells with hourly groundwater level data, only three showed pronounced responses to heavy rain events and were analyzed in detail. A detailed analysis at one well suggests rises in groundwater level were better correlated to all rain events than exclusively heavy rain during summer. The strength of the correlation decreased as the rainfall intensity increased. Solution of the Green-Ampt equation for rainfall events of varying magnitude indicated that an increase in rainfall intensity leads to more surface ponding and overland flow. Thus, the occurrence of more frequent heavy rain events in the future may result in lower net recharge. Thermal infrared images in seepage areas and the delta O-18 and delta H-2 composition for precipitation and seepage suggest rapid seepage responses to heavy rain events and rapid seepage dissipation rates. The overall rapid response of the fractured bedrock was advantageous for studying the response of the system to heavy rain events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demand on groundwater resources motivates understanding of the controls on recharge dynamics so model predictions under current and future climate may improve. Here we address questions about the nonlinear behavior of flux variability in the vadose zone that may explain previously reported teleconnections between global-scale climate variability and fluctuations in groundwater levels. We use hundreds of HYDRUS-1D simulations in a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous United States (U.S). Although the models were parameterized based on U.S. aquifers, findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3.65 and 730 mm yr(-1). We find that mean infiltration flux, period of time varying infiltration, and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth. The resulting framework explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability dampen with depth in the vadose zone, resulting in steady-state recharge, while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth, resulting in transient recharge. We find that transient recharge in response to the climate variability patterns could be detected at the depths of water levels in most U.S. aquifers. Our findings indicate that the damping behavior of transient infiltration fluxes is linear across soil layers for a range of texture combinations. The implications are that relatively simple, homogeneous models of the vadose zone may provide reasonable estimates of the damping depth of climate-varying transient recharge in some complex, layered vadose zone profiles.

AB Groundwater recharge (GR) controls vegetation, geomorphology, groundwater, wetlands and surface flow, and ultimately, the ecology and economics of semi-arid regions. Therefore, it is critical to assess hydroclimate model scenarios and the uncertainty in future GR to force regional groundwater models. We use basic statistics of downscaled Global Circulation Model (GCM)-projected cumulative potential GR (GR(p)) for selecting representative projections. Cumulative GR(p) is the net recharge (difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) rates) over the projection period. The approach is illustrated with an example in the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), the largest dune region in the Western Hemisphere, where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow.
   Changes in decadal-average GR(p) at 1/8 (-12-km) scale were estimated from spatially downscaled, bias-corrected temperature and P output from 16 commonly used GCMs for years 2010 to 2099. These changes accounted for three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and projections were subsequently used as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface hydrology model. For each of the 48 GCM/VIC hydroclimate projections, cumulative GR(p) was calculated and averaged over the study area. Three projections (those with cumulative average GR(p) nearest the median and 1 standard deviation) were selected as representing Median, Wet and Dry conditions. These projections allow for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models, using readily available downscaled GCM-projected climate changes, thereby optimizing modeling efforts. Future GR(p) was calculated for the NSH using the selected GR projections by adjusting the 2000-2009 baseline GR(p) estimates at 1-km scale. The latter was inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model, with ET based on remote sensing (MODIS) temperature data, and matching regional baseflows.
   In the NSH by 2099, the Median projection indicates an increase in GR(p) of 3 mm/yr (+5%) relative to the 2000-2009 baseline of 52.6 mm/yr. The Wet projection has an average increase of 22 mm/yr (+42%), and the Dry projection shows an average decrease of 15 mm/yr (-29%), relative to the baseline. Effects of projection period duration and time-step averaging on selection of GR projections with this approach are discussed. The new detailed GR(p) projections clarify varying trends of past large-scale analyses of the Northern High Plains region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the NSH hydrologic system. This approach can be extended to other arid-to-humid regions with available GCM hydro climate projections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Skull base meningoencephaloceles are a rare condition, frequently secondary to traumatic or iatrogenic causes. Cerebrofacial arteriovenous metameric syndrome (CAMS) is characterized by the presence of retinal, facial, and cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with metameric distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case associating these 2 conditions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman previously diagnosed with CAMS type 2 presented with a long history of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a right-sided facial and orbital AVM extending posteriorly along the optic tract into the suprasellar cistern, and a right-sided meningoencephalocele protruding into the olfactory recess and ethmoid sinus. An extended endoscopic endonasal approach was performed to resect the meningoencephalocele and to repair the CSF leak without complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report the unusual association between the development of a meningoencephalocele and a metameric syndrome, and comment on clinical implications in the management of this patient.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pipeline embolization device (PED; ev3, Irvine, California, USA) has been used to divert flow away from an aneurysm sac. The risk of complications may increase for flow diversion with giant aneurysms because these cases may require multiple overlapping PEDs, which makes the technique highly complex.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rescue technical strategy for lost access during multiple overlapping PED placement for a giant, fusiform cavernous aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: By using the collateral circulation as an alternative rescue route, intraprocedural loss of distal access may be salvaged.

AB BACKGROUND: The percutaneous endoscopic technique through an interlaminar approach is a commonly used minimally invasive procedure in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, even lumbar spinal stenosis. This report describes complete decompression with the percutaneous endoscopic technique for patients with thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We performed surgical decompression in of 2 patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by OLF using percutaneous endoscopic surgery through an interlaminar approach. After surgery, the patients described significant improvement in their preoperative neurologic symptoms. Postoperative thoracic computed tomography showed that the ossification of ligaments was completely removed.
   CONCLUSION: We applied the percutaneous endoscopic technique for the treatment of thoracic OLF accomplished direct decompression of the ossified ligaments with minimal trauma and instability. This technique could be used as an alternative choice. However, the fused types should be performed prudently because of the difficulties of the operation.

AB BACKGROUND: Giant invasive spinal schwannomas (GISSs) comprise a rare, specific subtype of schwannomas that extend > 2 spinal levels, erode vertebral bodies, and invade extraspinal tissues. Optimal surgical management of resulting spinal instability has yet to be determined, and overall there is limited published literature on GISS. We report an innovative method used to treat a rare case of lumbosacral GISS using a triangular frame reconstruction to reconnect the spinal column to the pelvis after tumor debulking. This method of using femur allograft in lieu of metal rods can promote stronger bony fusion of the construct.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 19-year-old woman presented with worsening lower back pain, which was due to a giant invasive spinal schwannoma that invaded the L4-S1 vertebral bodies and extended intrathecally from T10-S2, compromising the stability of her spine. The primary resection of the tumor was completed in 3 stages and was followed by a multilevel fusion involving a triangular construct made of femur allograft to reconnect the unstable spinal column with the pelvis. Maximal resection of the tumor was achieved with early rehabilitation. Pseudoarthrosis occurred, which was successfully fused after revision with the addition of an implanted bone stimulator. Seven years later, she remains in stable neurological condition.
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of femur allograft in triangular frame constructs for lumbosacral GISS to foster more stable, physiologic spinopelvic fusion.

AB BACKGROUND: Xanthomatous pituitary diseases rarely occur in childhood. We report a rare pediatric case of a xanthogranuloma that developed in the sellar region, resulting in a visual disturbance that was treated successfully with endoscopic endonasal surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 13-year-old boy came to us with a headache and visual disturbance that occurred 1 month prior. Clinical examination findings showed that he was alert with signs of bitemporal hemianopsia. An endocrinologic examination showed partial hypopituitarism, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass in the sellar turcica compressing the optic apparatus. Endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed to decompress the optic apparatus, and the mass was removed. Histopathologic analysis of the tumor demonstrated granulomatous tissue with cholesterol clefts, foamy macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells, with no epithelial component. The diagnosis was xanthogranuloma of the sellar region. The patient gradually recovered from the visual disturbance and was free from any neurologic signs or symptoms 6 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Xanthogranuloma, although rare, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of a sellar or suprasellar lesion, even in children.

TI Strictly Limited Orbital Pain as Sentinel Headache of Subarachnoid
   Hemorrhage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Migraine; Orbital pain; Sentinel headache; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID WARNING LEAK; ANEURYSM; RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: The headache preceding an intracranial aneurysm rupture is called a sentinel headache (SH), and it is characterized by a sudden, intense, and persistent headache. As subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often develops within several weeks of SH, its rapid diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman with migraine in her medical history visited the outpatient clinic due to left orbital pain. There was no neurologic deficit. Although magnetic resonance imaging examination found no SAH, a left internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery bifurcation aneurysm was detected by magnetic resonance angiography. Ten days after the onset of orbital pain, the patient consulted our hospital for a second opinion. We scheduled an elective clipping because the irregular shape of the aneurysm had a high risk of rupture. On the day before surgery, the aneurysm ruptured and led to SAH. Clipping was performed immediately. The patient was discharged with no neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSION: Clinicians must take into consideration that unilateral orbital pain, though atypical, may be a symptom of SH.

TI Pathogenesis of Idiopathic Ventral Herniation of Spinal Cord:
   Neuropathologic Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Herniation; Histopathology; Hypothesis; Spinal cord
ID BROWN-SEQUARD-SYNDROME
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic ventral herniation of the spinal cord is rarely seen as a cause of gradually increasing neurologic deficit. Its cause has never been clarified. It could be the result of a developmental disorder at 30- to 60-day gestational age. Neuropathologic analysis of herniated spinal cord tissue could probably support this hypothesis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a patient suffering from idiopathic ventral herniation of the spinal cord, a biopsy was performed in order to reduce the space-occupying effect. The biopsy was taken while intraoperative neuromonitoring was used. The patient recovered uneventfully without any additional deficit. Tissue analysis included histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular examination (methylation profiling). The tissue did not appear as a normally functioning spinal cord; instead, a non-neoplastic glio-(neuronal) proliferation was found.
   CONCLUSION: These findings support a developmental disorder as a cause for idiopathic ventral spinal cord herniation.

TI Repeated Spontaneous Intracranial Epidural Hemorrhage After Hysterical
   Crying
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hyperventilation; Intracranial hypotension; Spontaneous EDH
ID EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous epidural hemorrhage (EDH) is a rare occurrence that may be caused by vascular anomalies, infections, coagulopathies, or tumors. Spontaneous EDH occurring in patients without specific underlying disease has been reported only as intraspinal lesion but has never been demonstrated in the intracranial area. This study presents a 19-year-old patient with repeated spontaneous intracranial EDH caused twice by hysterical crying.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient had spontaneous left frontal EDH after hysterical crying. Two years later, she had a similar episode after crying and a new spontaneous right frontal EDH was revealed. There was no obvious risk factor revealed by laboratory and radiologic survey. We postulated that hyperventilation during crying resulted in a sudden decrease in intracranial pressure. The intracranial hypotension induced detachment of the dura from the skull and spontaneous EDH occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Crying or hyperventilation may trigger spontaneous EDH and should be suspected when there are signs of persisting headache and increased intracranial pressure. The prognosis is excellent if early diagnosis and surgical decompression are achieved.

AB BACKGROUND: The polymalformative syndromes and craniofacial anomalies association is a well-known phenomenon in patients with Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Apert, or Muenke disease. Recently, other less frequent pathologies, such as Alagille syndrome, have shown an association with alterations in the development of cranial sutures, resulting in serious cosmetic defects and neurologic disorders.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an exceptional case of a 30-month-old girl, a nephroblastoma survivor diagnosed with Alagille syndrome, who was referred to our department with progressive anterior plagiocephaly and premature left coronal suture closure associated with a large compensating right bossing. Despite the patient's age, we offered aggressive surgical treatment performing a new forehead harvested from the skull vertex with orbital rim reconstruction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Alagille syndrome is a complex multisystem pathology with a poor craniosynostosis association and only 3 cases have been described in the literature.

   MANAGEMENT; TUMORS; EDEMA; PET
AB BACKGROUND: Transient focal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities after status epilepticus (SE) are rarely seen in patients with benign brain tumors, and the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We report a rare case of cerebral cavernous malformation with transient focal MRI abnormalities around the tumor and accumulation of 11C-methionine on positron emission tomography (PET) after SE. These findings mimicked those of a glioma because the MRI and methionine PET findings were similar. We also speculate about the cause of this phenomenon in relation to pathologic findings of this case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man suffered from SE. MRI demonstrated a focal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense area. 11C-methionine PET showed high accumulation of methionine in the same lesion. The initial diagnosis was low-grade glioma. However, these MRI abnormalities were transient and completely resolved. The patient underwent surgical removal of the tumor, and the histologic diagnosis was typical cavernous malformation. Pathologic findings of the gyrus around the tumor revealed mild gliosis with proliferating astrocytes but no evidence of glioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that transient focal MRI abnormalities after SE may indicate reversible cortical brain edema. Accumulation of 11C-methionine on PET could occur in the corresponding lesion even if no malignant tumor is present. Because distinguishing transient MRI abnormalities after SE from a glioma is difficult, repeated imaging studies should be performed in patients with brain tumor-related seizures.

AB BACKGROUND: Paragangliomas are generally benign, slow-growing tumors. However, approximately 10%-20% are malignant, characterized by distant metastasis. Recently, a germ line mutation in succinate dehydrogenase B subunit (SDHB) has been shown to be associated with malignant behavior in paraganglioma. Here we present a case of SDHB-negative malignant paraganglioma of the jugular foramen with a pseudohypoxic microenvironment and unique imaging features on [F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([F-18]-FDG PET), and discuss the significance of SDHB immunohistochemistry and the potential of [F-18]-FDG PET for clinical management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman was diagnosed with jugular foramen paraganglioma. Initial surgical resection was performed; however, follow-up [F-18]-FDG PET indicated multiple uptake regions throughout the body. Biopsies for multiple recurrent lesions revealed consistent pathological features, suggesting distant metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a lack of SDHB immunostaining in all specimens. Pseudohypoxic markers, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and downstream glycolysis enzymes, were strongly expressed. [F-18]-FDG PET demonstrated increased uptake in the lesions, and the patient died 3 years after initial metastasis.
   CONCLUSION: In patients with head and neck paraganglioma without SDHB expression, close follow-up should be considered because of the risk for metastasis. In such cases, [F-18]-FDG PET might be useful for detecting metastasis due to atypical accumulation from pseudohypoxia-induced glycolysis.

ID GLIONEURONAL TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) was recently added to the World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. DLGNT is a rare entity that occurs more commonly in pediatric patients, but occasional cases have been reported in adults. This tumor has been recognized as a distinct pathologic entity; however, its biologic behavior remains unclear. It is considered an indolent neoplasm, although considerable morbidity has been reported. For this reason, further characterization and collection of evidence are crucial.
   METHODS: In this article, we reported a case of a 36-year-old woman with a DLGNT characterized by rapid, aggressive behavior. We also performed a review of the literature for reported cases of low-grade and high-grade forms involving adults and children.
   RESULTS: DLGNTs should no longer be considered only as low-grade tumors affecting pediatric patients. The spectrum of presentations also includes aggressive tumors affecting adults. CONCLUSIONS: Further clinical and pathologic data supported by cytogenetic and molecular investigations are mandatory to better characterize DLGNTs.

DT Article
DE Agenesis of the inferior vena cava; Collateral venous circulation;
   Spinal epidural venous plexus
ID THROMBOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Congenital agenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) can lead to the development of a prominent venous collateral system within and around the spine due to the development of venous collaterals. In such patients, surgery can carry a risk of catastrophic bleeding or decompensation of a delicate venous drainage pattern during spinal manipulation or even epidural exploration.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man with a congenital agenesis of the IVC presented with signs and symptoms of an L5 radiculopathy. A computed tomography scan of the lumbar spine showed the characteristic finding of fenestrated or "holey" pedicles within the lumbar spine, due to chronic venous engorgement within the pedicles.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the characteristic sign of "holey" pedicles on radiographic imaging in a patient with an underdeveloped IVC. This finding may be useful for the detection of abnormal spinal venous anatomy. In such patients, spinal surgery may carry greater risks and requires special consideration.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 55-year-old Hispanic man who underwent a Chiari decompression surgery, which was complicated with hydrocephalus. Despite a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, he continued to have headaches and was soon found to have several skull base subarachnoid lesions, which were later diagnosed as the sequelae of an active neurocysticercosis infection.
   CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of overlapping symptoms between diseases in a short temporal context.

TI Acute Monocular Blindness Due to Orbital Compartment Syndrome Following
   Pterional Craniotomy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

   craniotomy
ID ANEURYSM SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: We present a case of orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) leading to monocular irreversible blindness following a pterional craniotomy for clipping of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. OCS is an uncommon but vision-threatening entity requiring urgent decompression to reduce the risk of permanent visual loss. Iatrogenic orbital roof defects are a common finding following pterional craniotomies. However, complications related to these defects are rarely reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old female who underwent an anterior communicating artery clipping via a pterional approach 4 days before developed proptosis, ocular movement paresis, and irreversible visual impairment following an orthopedic surgery. Computed tomography images revealed an intraorbital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, which was evacuated via an acute recraniotomy. The next day, proptosis and intraorbital CSF collection on computed tomography images reoccurred and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon evacuated the collection via a blepharoplasty incision and blunt dissection. In addition, the patient was treated with acetazolamide and an external lumbar CSF drainage during 12 days. Hereafter, the CSF collection did not reoccur. Unfortunately, monocular blindness was persistent. We hypothesize the CSF collection occurred due to the combination of a postoperative orbital roof defect and a temporarily increased intracranial pressure during the orthopedic surgery.
   CONCLUSION: We plead for more awareness of this severe complication after pterional surgeries and emphasize the importance of 1) strict ophthalmologic examination after pterional craniotomies in case of intracranial pressure increasing events, 2) immediate consultation of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, and 3) consideration of CSF-draining interventions since symptoms are severely invalidating and irreversible within a couple of hours.

   NEVI; ONE IDENTICAL TWIN; LEPTOMENINGEAL MELANOMA; FOLLOW-UP
AB BACKGROUND: To explore the clinical characteristics of neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) in adult patients to help improve diagnosis and treatment of this disease, we present a rare case of an adult patient suffering from NCM with malignant melanoma, as well as a review of the relevant Chinese and English literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient reported here plus the patients identified in our literature review total 30 adults with NCM (20 males [66.7%] and 10 females [33.3%]), age 19e65 years (average, 27.9 years). These include 24 cases of malignant melanoma (80.0%), 3 cases of melanocytoma (10.0%), 2 cases of diffuse melanocytosis (6.7%), and 1 case of unknown pathology (3.3%). Satellite nevi were reported in 25 cases (83.3%) and in 5 cases their presence was unknown (16.7%). Intracranial lesions were present in 28 cases (93.3%), and intraspinal lesions were present in 2 cases (6.7%). There are 4 cases of combined hydrocephalus (13.3%), and 2 cases of combined DandyeWalker deformity (6.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: NCM is a rare disease, especially in adults. With the onset of symptoms, the diagnosis is generally confirmed. In children with congenital giant nevus, regular periodic surveys of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) with magnetic resonance imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed to diagnose NCM. Active treatment should be undertaken to improve the prognosis.

   EFFICACY; REDUCE
AB BACKGROUND: External ventricular drains (EVDs) are a serious source of morbidity and mortality. Data for interventions proven to reduce risk of infections are lacking. Single-center studies are limited in studying procedures that mitigate infection, but bundled protocols have demonstrated utility. A collaborative EVD registry was designed to facilitate local quality improvement projects to be implemented at any location using standardized data collection instruments through resident collaboration to reduce and study EVD infection and prevention.
   METHODS: A bundled protocol and comprehensive implementation program were developed as a quality improvement project to reduce ventriculostomy-associated infections. Standardized data collection forms were created for multi-institutional participation in an EVD registry. Retrospective and prospective patient data were documented in an electronic procedural registry, which was designed to capture variation among multiple institutions.
   RESULTS: Two infections were found in 1924 EVD-days before protocol implementation; no infections were found in 700 EVD-days after protocol implementation. Baseline epidemiology of EVDs was calculated in preparation for comparison. A resident-driven EVD consortium, now with 5 other member institutions, was founded to collect data for an EVD registry fed by individual site quality improvement initiatives.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ventriculostomy-associated infection rate at the University of Minnesota is low compared with the literature. Rationally bundled protocols have mounting evidence but do not allow for identifying effective individual components. Through the registry described here, others can join the EVD consortium to contribute data to facilitate comparative effectiveness research with minimal investment.

   FEATURES; CSF HYPOVOLEMIA; DRAINAGE; HERNIATION; SURGERY; STEM
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hypotension from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypovolemia resulting in cerebral herniation is a rare but known complication that can occur after neurosurgical procedures, usually encountered in correlation with perioperative placement of a lumbar subarachnoid drain. Decrease in CSF volume resulting in loss of buoyancy results in downward herniation of the brain without contributing mass effect, causing a phenomenon known as brain sag. Unreported previously is brain sag occurring without concomitant occult CSF leak or lumbar drainage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This case report describes a patient who underwent bilateral craniotomies for subacute on chronic subdural hematoma with successful decompression but experienced acute neurologic deterioration secondary to brain sag. Despite an initial improvement in neurologic function, he subsequently experienced progressive neurologic deterioration with evidence of cerebral herniation on neuroimaging, without evidence of continued mass effect on the brain parenchyma. After a diagnosis of brain sag was determined based on imaging criteria, the patient was placed in a flat position, which resulted in rapid improvement in his neurologic function without any further intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case is unique in comparison with previous reports of intracranial hypotension after craniotomy in that the symptoms were completely reversed with positioning alone, without any evidence of active or occult CSF drainage. This report emphasizes that the diagnosis of brain sag should be taken into consideration when there is an unknown reason for neurologic decline after craniotomy, particularly bilateral craniotomies, if the imaging indicates herniation with imaging findings consistent with intracranial hypotension, without evidence of overlying mass effect.

   TRANSPOSITION; COMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Aberrant medial retropharyngeal prevertebral course of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) is extremely uncommon. In oropharyngeal surgeries, like transoral odontoidectomy (TOO), this unrecognized aberrant retropharyngeal course of ICAs can result in devastating complications secondary to inadvertent injury of ICAs. We describe this aberrant course of ICAs in a patient with a craniovertebral junction (CVJ) anomaly with a dysmorphic C1 lateral mass on one side and discuss in detail various management issues in this complex case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old patient presented with neck pain, paresthesia in all 4 limbs, and quadriparesis. Computed tomography (CT) of the CVJ revealed os odontoideum, basilar invagination, atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD), severe malalignment of the C1-C2 facets, and an unusually thin (dysmorphic) left C1 lateral mass. Computed tomographic angiography revealed an aberrant medial retropharyngeal course of the bilateral cervical ICAs with near midline location at the level of C1 and C2. Transoral odontoidectomy (TOO) was not considered safe in view of potential injury to medially located ICAs. Normal spinal alignment with reduction of BI and AAD was achieved by C1-C2 joint distraction with placement of a spacer only in the right C1-C2 joint space followed by occipitocervical fusion. The patient experienced complete recovery after surgery with improvement of power in all 4 limbs to 5/5.
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification of this rare aberrant prevertebral course of ICAs in a patient with a CVJ anomaly is critical because it precludes TOO as a treatment option. Correction of BI and AAD is possible even with a unilateral C1-C2 joint spacer when placement of a joint spacer on the other side is not technically feasible.

DE Bone tumor; Cervical fixation; Cervical spine; Periosteal chondroma
ID JUXTACORTICAL CHONDROMA; ENCHONDROMA; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Chondroma is a rare benign cartilaginous tumor that originates in chondrocytes and is commonly seen in the long bones; however, it infrequently occurs in the cervical spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We report 2 patients with cervical periosteal chondroma that originated in the C2 vertebral body and C1 lamina as extramedullary tumors. The first patient was a 28-year-old man who presented with right upper extremity weakness and numbness. Cervical radiography revealed a bony tumor with evidence of severe spinal cord compression. The second patient was a 26-year-old woman with left occipital neuralgia. Cervical radiography demonstrated a bony tumor arising from the left C1 lateral mass that compressed the C2 nerve root. Both patients underwent surgical removal of the bony tumors, which were diagnosed as periosteal chondroma.
   CONCLUSIONS: The authors herein summarized 16 previous reports of cervical chondroma and compared the clinical courses and treatments. Recommended treatment included maximal surgical resection, especially when significant compression of the cervical cord and signal abnormality within the cord was observed. Annual postoperative follow-up is mandatory to ensure proper neurologic improvement.

We depict herein the imaging features of a patient who presented with a spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhage, in whom radiologic studies demonstrated a pontine telangiectasia, a brainstem/cerebellar developmental venous anomaly, and a cerebellar proliferative angiopathy. This unique, not previously reported combination of lesions shows that the spectrum of mixed vascular malformations continues to expand. A pathophysiologic mechanism related to the angiogenesis seen in these malformations is also hypothesized.

ID ISCHEMIC-STROKE; THROMBECTOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: We describe the technique for surgical "transaneurysmal" embolectomy in a patient with sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and multiple cerebral aneurysms who manifested large-vessel occlusion during coil embolization.
   METHODS: An 84-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) - posterior communicating artery and bilateral middle cerebral artery aneurysms (MCAs) was admitted to our institution. We performed clipping to the left ICA and MCAs; however, we could not find the rupture point of both aneurysms. We chose to treat 2 aneurysms on the other side by coil embolization. After complete coil embolization of a right ICA aneurysm, angiograms showed occlusion of the right MCA just proximal to an MCA aneurysm. Considering the risk of bleeding of an untreated MCA distal to the occlusion by endovascular thrombectomy, we performed open transaneurysmal embolectomy at the occlusion site and surgical clipping of the MCA. After cutting the aneurysmal wall, we inserted a suction tube into the cut surface of the aneurysm. The clot was gradually and completely pulled through the cut surface of the aneurysm. Finally, the aneurysm was completely clipped with titanium clips to preserve the M1 and M2 branches.
   DISCUSSION: Different from usual surgical thrombectomy, suturing the vessel wall is not required for trans-aneurysmal embolectomy and the area of brain ischemia is confined. Aneurysms with the fragile wall may rupture during clearance of tissue on the aneurysmal surface, and suction may increase vessel damage.
   CONCLUSION: Transaneurysmal thrombectomy may be useful and safe for large-vessel occlusion just distal to cerebral aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive transportal resection of deep intracranial lesions has become a widely accepted surgical technique. Many disposable, mountable port systems are available in the market for this purpose, like the ViewSite Brain Access System. The objective of this study was to find a cost-effective substitute for these systems.
   METHODS: Deep-seated brain lesions were treated with a port system made from disposable syringes. The syringe port could be inserted through minicraniotomies placed and planned with navigation. All deep-seated lesions like ventricular tumours, colloid cysts, deep-seated gliomas, and basal ganglia hemorrhages were treated with this syringe port system and evaluated for safety, operative site hematomas, and blood loss.
   RESULTS: 62 patients were operated on during the study period from January 2015 to July 2017, using this innovative syringe port system for deep-seated lesions of the brain. No operative site hematoma or contusions were seen along the port entry site and tract.
   CONCLUSIONS: Syringe port is a cost-effective and safe alternative to the costly disposable brain port systems, especially for neurosurgical setups in developing countries for minimally invasive transportal resection of deep brain lesions.

AB Louis Victor Leborgne was a patient of Paul Broca. "Monsieur Leborgne," as Broca would call him, was also known around in the hospital by the nickname "Tan." His neurologic condition left him with difficulty in speaking, and he could only speak the word "Tan." Leborgne spent nearly half of his entire life in the hospital. He was initially admitted into the psychiatry division of the hospital and was later transferred under the care of Broca toward the end of his life. The story of the Leborgne sits in the crossroads of human thoughts that led to the discovery of cerebral localization. It is the objective of this study to describe the circumstances associated with this patient, which led the great thinkers of that time to discover the language localization in the cerebral cortex. Leborgne's condition was the cornerstone in the evolution of this discovery. More than 150 years have passed since the death of Leborgne, yet Leborgne's brain continues to attract researchers investigating the mysteries of human speech.

TI Plateletpheresis: Nonoperative Management of Symptomatic Carotid
   Thrombosis in a Patient with Reactive Thrombocytosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute ischemic stroke; Carotid thrombus; Plateletpheresis;
   Thrombocytosis
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
AB BACKGROUND: The most common pathology associated with an intraluminal carotid thrombus is underlying atherosclerosis. In rare cases, it may be associated with thrombocytosis. Currently there are no clear recommendations for the treatment of ischemic stroke associated with thrombocytosis. Our present case illustrates the use of plateletpheresis for the acute management of thrombocytosis complicated by an internal carotid artery thrombus resulting in a right middle cerebral artery stroke.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old female who presented with symptoms of acute, transient left hemiparesis and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 1. Initial head computed tomography (CT) scan was non-revealing. Laboratory results revealed a mild hypochromic anemia and a platelet count of 1014 x 10(3)/mL. The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy due to the time window. Soon after admission, she experienced acute worsening of symptoms, with an NIHSS score of 18. CT angiography of the head and neck showed acute ischemic infarction involving the right middle cerebral artery territory with a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus within the right carotid bulb. Aspirin 325 mg and intravenous heparin infusion were initiated. After a thorough workup, reactive thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed. Plateletpheresis was started, and after 1 cycle the platelet count stabilized at 400 x 10(3)/mL. Complete thrombus resolution was confirmed on follow-up CT angiography on day 10 after admission without the need for surgical revascularization.
   CONCLUSIONS: The role for plateletpheresis in treating secondary thrombocytosis is not well established. In cases with extreme thrombocytosis, immediate surgical thrombectomy may be contraindicated owing to a high risk of rethrombosis. Urgent cytoreduction with correction of the putative mechanism for thrombocytosis should be undertaken to provide optimal management.

AB BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe method that has been applied for many years in medical treatment-resistant depression treatment. In this case report, contrast extravasation due to deterioration of the blood-brain barrier after ECT mimicking subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is discussed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old male patient who underwent ECT presented with sulcal hyperintensities suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence of MRI obtained after ECT. How-ever, there was no evidence to suggest SAH on nonenhanced brain computed tomography.
   CONCLUSION: It should be kept in mind that patients may have contrast extravasation due to deterioration of the blood-brain barrier after ECT, and other alternative methods should be used for the diagnosis of SAH in these patients, not MRI.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of vertebral artery (VA)-thrombosed giant aneurysms requires achieving both obliteration of the parent artery to prevent bleeding and dome thrombectomy to relieve the brain stem from mass effect. To secure both proximal and distal control of complex VA aneurysms, the contralateral approach to the aneurysm might be a useful alternative, as previously described. We successfully treated a case of VA-thrombosed giant aneurysm in a new, original way by combining craniotomy (ipsilateral and contralateral) and the endovascular technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old man presented with a thrombosed giant aneurysm of the right VA compressing the brain stem. Treatment consisted of endo-vascular proximal ligation of the VA followed by 2-staged craniotomy for complete trapping of the aneurysm and intra-aneurysmal thrombectomy. The VA distal to the aneurysm was obliterated via contralateral craniotomy as only that provided adequate working space. Finally, intra-aneurysmal partial thrombectomy was performed through an ipsilateral craniotomy, which also made possible the obliteration of the eventually dangerous remaining vasa vasorum and additional proximal ligation of the VA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on pathologic and surgical anatomical characteristics, a combination of an endovascular procedure with 2-staged craniotomy for complete trapping, thrombectomy, and vasa vasorum obliteration could be considered a feasible way to treat VA-thrombosed giant aneurysms located ventral to the brain stem and have their distal neck portions/patent vessel beyond the midline toward the contralateral side.

ID VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS; VENOUS ANOMALIES; CLASSIFICATION; LYMPHANGIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Orbital lymphaticovenous malformations (LVMs) are congenital vascular lesions that are typically infiltrative in nature. There have been reports of orbital LVMs extending intracranially through orbital fissures, but there have been no reports of intradural extension.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the first case of orbital LVM extending intradurally through a bony defect in the medial orbital roof. A modified orbitozygomatic approach was used to successfully obliterate this lesion. Neurosurgical and ophthalmologic collaboration was used in the surgical management of this case.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach when managing infiltrative orbital LVMs, as both ophthalmologic and neurosurgical expertise were critical in the success of the surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an unusual variant of fibrosarcoma that was previously considered to be a low-grade tumor with an indolent course. To our knowledge, the spine is a rare primary site for SEF, with only a few cases reported to date.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of SEF occurring in the cervico-thoracic spine of a 64-year-old man with complaints of neck pain and right hand tingling for 6 months before clinical presentation. Imaging revealed a large mass that extended from C5 to T1 in the right posterior paraspinal soft tissues, with involvement of the posterior elements from C6 to T1 and infiltration of the T1 vertebral body. We performed an en bloc spondylectomy and gross total resection of the tumor. Pathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics confirmed the diagnosis of SEF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the anatomic nature of the cervicothoracic spine and critical neurovascular structures that the tumor involves, a true en bloc resection might not be possible, but an oncologically sound excision is ideal.

ID FORAMEN MAGNUM MENINGIOMAS; OF-THE-LITERATURE; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION;
   COUGH SYNCOPE; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; TUMORS
AB OBJECTIVE: To our knowledge, there have not been any reported cases of a meningioma of the craniocervical region presenting solely with syncope as its initial symptom. Only 1 case of meningioma presenting with syncope has been published, but it was associated with hydrocephalus. We report 2 cases of syncope caused by a craniocervical junction meningioma, with syncope being the sole presenting symptom and without hydrocephalus. We discuss the possible pathophysiology, as well as the clinical relevance of this type of presentation.
   METHODS: We reviewed the charts, operative details, and imagery of 2 cases of meningioma in the region of the craniocervical junction, with syncope as their sole presenting feature. We also reviewed the literature.
   RESULTS: In 1 case the syncope occurred spontaneously. In the other, it occurred during a Valsalva maneuver. Both meningiomas were surgically removed via a retromastoid approach. There was no recurrence of syncope following surgery. Following a literature review, we found 1 case of posterior fossa meningioma presenting with syncope, but hydrocephalus was also present.
   CONCLUSION: Syncope can be the sole manifestation of a meningioma of the craniocervical junction. Such syncopes are a consequence of transient dysfunction of the autonomous pathways in the medulla and/or of the medulla's output. In the absence of other causes of syncope, a meningioma in this region, even in the absence of hydrocephalus, should not be considered as fortuitous, but rather as the actual cause of syncope. Recognizing this possibility offers the potential for proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the syncope.

   Vagal nerve stimulator; Vagus nerve stimulation
ID EPILEPSY; COMPLICATION; CHILD
AB BACKGROUND: Vagal nerve stimulation is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Complications and failure of the device can result from lead fracture, device malfunction, disconnection, or battery displacement and can result in a variety of symptoms. We present an interesting case of stimulator malfunction with increased impedance change seen only with a change in head position.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 25-year-old male with a vagal nerve stimulator (VNs) placed for medically refractory epilepsy who presented with neck pain and an electrical pulling sensation in his neck whenever he turned his head to the right. Initial interrogation of the VNs showed normal impedance. Subsequent interrogation with the patient's head turned found increased impedance only when the head was turned to the right. The patient had successful removal and replacement of the device with resolution of his preoperative complaints. Partial lead fracture was seen at explant.
   CONCLUSION: VNs malfunction can present in atypical ways. Positional maneuvers may help with its timely diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis is an uncommon subtype of cerebrovascular accident. The appropriate time interval between decompressive craniectomy and the onset of anticoagulation in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis is a controversial topic among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and intensivists.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a brief clinical case report of a female patient who underwent decompressive craniectomy. Cerebral venous thrombosis was subsequently diagnosed, and anticoagulation was initiated 24 hours postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early onset of anticoagulation is important for a favorable outcome. Clinical decision making should rely on the following: 1) postoperative imaging studies with no evidence of increase in hematoma, 2) intracranial pressure monitoring for patients on mechanical ventilation, and 3) protocols for immediate suspension of anticoagulants and use of antagonistic drugs in case of an increase in a pre-existing intracranial hemorrhage.
