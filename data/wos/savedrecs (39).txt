AB Hydrogen is considered as one of the best alternatives for fossil fuels, especially when it is produced using renewable energy resources. In this paper, dish collector is used to provide the required energy of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) to produce hydrogen. Since dish collectors operate at high temperature, they would be an ideal match for high temperature electrolyzers. These electrolyzer cells need both thermal and electrical energy to produce hydrogen. A compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is used to produce electricity. To reduce its fuel consumption, it is combined with a dish collector. Another dish collector is also used to produce thermal energy. To analyze the system, both thermodynamic and economic analyses are conducted. The results showed that the system could produce 41.48 kg/day hydrogen. It is shown that efficiency of the power cycle and the electrolyzer cell is equal to 72.69% and 61.70%, respectively and levelized cost of hydrogen is 9.1203 $/kg(H2). To study the effect of key parameters on the system performance, sensitivity analysis is performed. It was concluded that maximum and minimum pressure of air cavern in the CAES system have the highest effect on the levelized cost of hydrogen. Also higher operating temperature of the electrolyzer cell benefits the system both thermodynamically and economically.

AB In the present study, the extraction of polyester like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from enzymes extracted sludge was investigated by varying extraction time and chloroform - sodium hypochlorite dosage. Maximum of 874 mg/g of PHAs was achieved at an optimum extraction time of 120 min and chloroform - sodium hypochlorite dosage of 30% v/v. The characteristics of derived PHAs were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. Then, the effect of derived PHAs dosage on biomethane production from pulp and paper mill secondary clarifier (PPSC) sludge was studied. Higher amount of biomethane production was observed to be 174 L/(kg VS) at 35 mg of PHAs dosage when compared to other dosage. To further enhance biomethane production, disperser pretreatment method was carried out by optimization of specific energy. At optimum specific energy of 8547 kJ/kg TS, the maximum solubilization rate and suspended solids (SS) reduction were found respectively to be 19% and 15.8%. Then, biomethane assay was conducted on disperser pretreated sludge, disperser pretreated sludge with optimized PHAs dosage (35 mg) and control sludge. Among these, disperser mediated PHAs method exhibited maximal biomethane production and was observed to be 267 L/(kg VS). Hence, PHAs based sludge treatment method can be implemented in sludge management studies by retrieval of value added product and PHAs canbe used to enhance biomethane production sustainably.

AB Wind power forecasting is becoming an increasingly significant part in the operation and programming of electric force and power systems. However, highly precise wind power forecasting is still a difficult and challenging issue owing to the randomisation and transience of the wind series. In this paper, a novel Meta-learning strategy is proposed for adaptively combining heterogeneous forecasting models that were selected from a constructed candidate model bank. This study first implements the Box-Cox transformation to the wind speed and wind power sequence. Subsequently, the wind power as well as wind speed, which are decomposed by adopting the wind direction, are regarded as the inputs of the individual models. They are used to train a base-level forecasting learner to model the forecasting values of the wind power series. Finally, models with poor performances are dynamically trimmed and combining the remaining individual models are combined by adopting the random forest algorithm for the subsequent deterministic and probabilistic forecasting task. The wind power data from a wind farm located in northwestern of China are adopted to illustrate the forecasting effectiveness of the developed approach. The simulation in three experiments demonstrated the following: (a) the proposed Meta-learning based model is suitable for providing accurate wind power forecasting; (b) the proposed Meta-learning based hybrid model exhibits a more competitive forecasting performance than the individual models by extract advantage of each models; (c) the proposed model not only improves the accuracy of the deterministic forecasts but also provides more probabilistic information for wind power forecasting.

AB Supercritical CO2 (sCO(2)) power system has been investigated by many scholars due to its attractive advantages of higher efficiency, compact system structure and eco-friendly working fluid. In this paper, some preliminary conceptual exploration about performance improvement on sCO(2) power system by integrating with two types of absorption power generation (APG) systems are conducted. Parameter analysis, genetic algorithm (GA) optimization and exergy analysis are carried out quantitatively for the proposed combined sCO(2)/APG systems based on the self-built simulation platform from the viewpoints of thermodynamics and economics. Parameter analysis results reveal that there exist optimal compressor pressure ratio to maximize the thermal efficiency or minimize the total product unit cost. Higher turbine inlet temperature and lower absorber temperature could contribute to the overall system performance. In addition, compared with the stand-alone sCO(2 )system, improvements of 5.98% and 5.07% in thermodynamics as well as promotion of 4.24% and 2.19% in economics can be obtained for sCO(2)/LiBr-H2O system and sCO(2)/ammonia water system, respectively. Furthermore, exergy analyses show that the main exergy destructions occur in the reactor and the cooler and the proposed combined sCO(2)/APG system could effectively reduce around half of the exergy destruction within the cooler of the stand-alone sCO(2) system.

AB Upgrading of crude glycerol to high value-added chemical products is an attractive process in biomass conversion and biorefinery industry. In this work, production of triacetin (TAG) from direct conversion of glycerol with acetic acid over SO3H-glycerol-carbon catalyst assisted with ultrasound was investigated for the first time. The catalyst was synthesized from glycerol via in-situ carbonization and sulfonation. The significant factors for TAG production obtained from 2(k) factorial design were in the order of reaction temperature > ultrasonic power > reaction time. The TAG selectivity (100%) was successfully achieved in mild conditions. Kinetic studies indicated that ultrasound-assisted acetylation reaction followed first-order reaction while an activation energy of 51.08 kJ/mol was obtained. For comparison between as-synthesized catalyst with various commercial solid acid catalysts, the glycerol conversion turnover rate toward TAG was considerably highest on SO3H-glycerol-carbon with the rates exhibited in the order of SO3 H-glycerol-carbon > Amberlyst-35 > H-USY > SiO2-Tosic acid > Al2O3. The SO3H-glycerol-carbon also exhibited excellent reusability for 10 consecutive cycles without any decreasing in glycerol conversion and TAG selectivity after regeneration process was carried out. The obtained results indicated that the contribution of catalyst acidity with ultrasonic power was responsible for determining TAG selectivity.

AB The objective of this work is the investigation of a polygeneration system which is driven by solar energy and a biomass boiler. Parabolic trough solar collectors coupled to a storage tank are used in order to produce useful heat at high-temperature levels (similar to 350 degrees C). The system includes an organic Rankine cycle and a vapor compression cycle in order for electricity and cooling to be produced respectively. Moreover, useful heat is produced at two temperatures levels (50 degrees C and 150 degrees C) and so there are totally four useful energy outputs. The system is optimized in steady-state conditions and then the most suitable design is investigated in dynamic conditions for all the year period. According to the final results, the yearly energetic efficiency of the system is 51.26% while the yearly exergetic efficiency is 21.77%. The net present value is found 165.6 k(sic), the payback period 5.13 years, the internal rate of return 21.26%, while the yearly CO2 avoidance to 125 tn. Finally, the results of this work indicate that the suggested configuration can provide various useful outputs with high efficiency and the total investment is characterized as viable due to the suitable financial index values.

AB This paper proposes a new novel battery cooling system for hydrogen fueled HEVs that achieves more efficient cooling and driving, which increases vehicle driving range and enhances vehicle safety by maintaining the batteries at optimum operating conditions. The proposed system offers a novel use of the vehicle fuel and a novel cooling plate design. The cooling plate design is optimized in terms of battery's temperature uniformity and battery's maximum temperature. The optimum performance of the design is then investigated through a 600 s high intensity discharging and charging cycle of 4C. The results show that when hydrogen is at a temperature of 10 degrees C and has an inlet velocity of 0.01 m/s, the maximum temperature is maintained at lower than 30.5 degrees C. The lowest difference through the battery obtained by the proposed system is less than 7 degrees C. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the performance of liquid, air and evaporative cooling based systems. The comparison shows that the proposed system is able to perform better than liquid, air and evaporative cooling based cooling systems. The performance of the proposed cooling system demonstrates the advantage of integrating the hybrid vehicle fuel system with the battery cooling system.

AB Pyrolysis of waste polymers looks an attractive way for their recycling as valuable hydrocarbons are produced that can be utilized as cleaner energy carriers or petrochemical feedstock. The lumping approach is often used to study the reaction kinetics of such complex systems as the high number of individual chemical species formed during pyrolysis and the several reactions that take place between them make the detailed kinetic modeling of the process often not feasible. Here we propose a two-step identification strategy, which requires no a priori knowledge regarding fast and slow reactions or the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, to determine the kinetic parameters of pyrolysis and estimate product composition with the required precision using the discrete lumping method. Pyrolysis of a shredded real waste HDPE/PP/LDPE mixture was carried out previously in a laboratory scale two-stage reactor operated in batch mode. The process was investigated at different temperatures; both thermal and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were studied, the latter on different types of zeolite-based catalysts. Our results indicate that with the suggested lumped model and kinetic identification strategy not only the experimental results can be reproduced but also the essential behavior of different catalysts can be explained. Furthermore, the two stages of the pyrolysis process have also been able to be differentiated. It can be stated that with the proper selection of pseudocomponents, the lumping approach is appropriate for catalyst evaluation and comparison as well, leading to a better understanding of the previous experimental results and the overall pyrolysis process. Hence, the results might also be used during process design or scale-up.

AB This study proposes an optimization method for the supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycle in a 1000 MW single-reheat S-CO2 coal-fired power plant based on the second law of thermodynamics. The effects of parameters and configurations on S-CO2 cycle efficiencies and component irreversibility are studied. The analysis reveals that variations in parameters and configurations have more remarkable effects on the irreversibility of heat exchangers, particularly on the high-temperature recuperator (HTR) and cooler (COL), than on that of turbo machines. The results show that the optimum parameter of turbines provides a higher expansion ratio for the low-pressure turbine (LPT) than for the high-pressure turbine (HPT). The effects of split ratio to economizer (ECO) have contradicting results on cycle thermal and exergy efficiencies given that the irreversibility of HTR decreases with the increase in the split ratio to ECO. The minimum cycle pressure drastically affects the irreversible interaction between HTR and COL because of the nonlinear characteristics of CO2 near its critical point. Double compression and the Case 2 of the ECO configuration is more reasonable for S-CO2 power plants. The main differences between the S-CO2 and traditional steam power plant are that exergy loss ratio of fuel combustion and exergy efficiency of the water wall, screen heaters, primary heaters are noticeably higher in the S-CO2 boiler than those in the traditional steam boiler. The overall exergy efficiency of the innovative single-reheat 1000 MW S-CO2 coal-fired power plant is 45.4%, which is approximately 3.5% higher than that of the traditional ultra-supercritical steam plant.

AB In this paper, a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system has been designed under an electric charge supply strategy for a residential complex in Iran.
   The aim of this research is energy, exergy and economic analyses of the CCHP system with using different prime mover arrangements and presenting appropriate condition of its operation according to these viewpoints.
   For this purpose, three types of gas engine, diesel engine, and gas turbine as prime movers have been presented and analyzed separately and simultaneously at six different scenarios and the appropriate scenario has been proposed for the CCHP system. In addition, the performance of system has been estimated at various part load conditions. The system is modeled and simulated using thermodynamic and economic relationships by using a computer code in the MATLAB software. The results show that the CCHP system under the electricity supply strategy with the simultaneous combination of two prime movers has significant advantages over one of them.
   The CCHP efficiency with two prime movers increases up to 10% compared to that of a single prime mover as well as the exergy efficiency. Additionally, scenario 4 by combining the gas engine and diesel engine is selected as the best scenario. It has 87% energy efficiency, 62.8% exergy efficiency, and operating cost reduction of about 80%. Also, the payback period is 6.3 years by taking interest rate into account and 1.36 years regardless of it.

AB Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) that are used as biodiesel can be synthesized in supercritical methylating agents such as supercritical methanol. While the synthesis can be conducted both non-catalytically and catalytically, the synthesis in the presence of oxides is significantly faster. In this study, FAMEs were synthesized by transesterification of a non-edible oil (Mahua, Madhuca indica) in supercritical methanol with a wide variety of oxides. The reaction was extensively studied with eleven different oxides, synthesized using the solution combustion method, as catalysts. In addition, the best two catalysts, namely MgO and Mn3O4, were synthesized using four different fuels in the combustion synthesis. The catalytic effect of all these oxides was investigated and conversions ranging from 5% to 100% were obtained over the investigated range of temperature from 503 K to 583 K, and with reaction time varying between 2 min and 80 min. Among all the catalysts, MgO synthesized with ascorbic acid as the fuel for the solution combustion gave the best results. Therefore, this catalyst was chosen and the influence of operating temperature for the transesterification reaction (503-583 K) on the rate of the reaction was studied. A pseudo first order kinetic model was obtained based on the proposed Eley-Rideal reaction mechanism and, the rate constants were obtained. The rate constants varied between 1.61 x 10(-3) s(-1) to 4.93 x 10(-3) s(-1) with an activation energy of 36 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 9.33 s(-1). The rate constant obtained for the non-catalytic supercritical transesterification with oxide as catalyst was significantly higher than the rate constant of 9.9 x 10(-5) s(-1) obtained for the non-catalytic reaction at 523 K. The activation energy for the catalyzed reaction (36 kJ/mol) was notably lower than the activation energy (75 kJ/mol) for the uncatalyzed reaction indicating the efficacy of the catalyst.

AB Wind energy is widely exploited as a promising renewable energy source worldwide. In this article, an optimization method for the control and operation of the offshore wind farm as an integrated system considering its operational, economic and environmental impacts is proposed. The state of the offshore wind farm development, and the challenges faced by the offshore wind farms, including the challenges of economic costs, operational reliability, and environmental impacts are reviewed and summarized. A systematic methodology is proposed to optimize the costs of an offshore wind farm system based on a framework that extends from the supervisory level dispatch strategies to individual pitch control for load reduction and fatigue mitigation. This holistic approach is able to improve the efficiency and economic performance of a wind farm through overall system optimization, while explicitly operating each wind turbine using a formally designed control framework leading to an extension of their service lifespan. This work provides thorough introduction and innovative solutions for many economic and environmental issues in offshore wind farm development and has strong application potential.

AB The concept of co-power generation from the excess heat is a rapidly developing technology due to different material innovations in the field of Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs). The photovoltaic (PV) module subjected to solar irradiation utilizes photon energy but also absorbs the heat energy. The module heat is utilized to generate power by the co-generation devices such as TEG. In this paper, theoretical analysis of hybrid PV-TEG system is analyzed using different analytical methods. The performance of PV-TEG system is estimated using mathematical models of PV and TEG using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. In this work, a novel non-concentrated flat plate PV-TEG configuration is proposed by using the multi crystalline PV connected in rear side with the Bismuth Telluride TEG. The proposed configuration results in production of 5% additional energy with an increase in overall efficiency of 6% at STC conditions. The TEG in the configuration provides cooling for the PV system and also contributes energy of 1-3% of PV rating. The efficiency of proposed PV-TEG configuration is compared with that of standalone PV by making changes in irradiation and ambient temperature.

AB District Heating (DH) systems will play an important role in future sustainable energy systems. Existing networks can be optimized by lowering primary return temperatures in order to improve the use of geothermal resources. This can be done by installing triple-pipe systems. This paper defines the concept of triple-pipe configurations as it is understood in France. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of those configurations for optimizing geothermal DH system efficiency. A dynamic thermal-hydraulic model was developed using the programming language Modelica. A generic case study is modeled considering the extension of an existing network. It is shown that triple-pipe configurations offer lower return temperatures and gas consumption, while increasing of the renewable energy share in the network energy mix.

AB At the early stage of photovoltaic plants feasibility study, the assessment of the power production and the technology performances is a necessity. To do so, engineers usually use software's and prediction models. Plenty of models are available in the literature, nevertheless, the selection of the most suitable one to be use in a specific climate is a hard task since no study deals with the inter-comparison of the existing PV production models. In this paper, the output of 12 -from the most used- PV production models were evaluated, and their accuracy has been assessed versus one-year of ground measurements from a PV module at different time resolutions. Results show that the models developed by Twidell, Yamawaki and Nishioka -or M1, M2 and M3 as sited in the manuscriptare the most adequate to simulate the PV performances under semi-arid and hot climatic conditions, with an hourly nRMSE of 7.07% during spring, 4.23% during summer, 7.56% in autumn and 10.11% in winter. Furthermore, and based on site measurements, Mid-south of Morocco can be considered as a very good location for PV plants with a PR higher than 80% and an average efficiency of 16%.

AB The different fuel injection time, fuel injection pressure, fuel types were investigated to achieve low temperature premixed combustion in four-cylinder light-duty diesel engine using a common rail injection system. The two blending proportions of black soldier fly biodiesel (BD) at 10% and 20% BD-diesel blends were compared with pure diesel fuel in the present study. The combustion, performance, and emission of black soldier fly biodiesel were explored and compared with the conventional diesel combustion. Experimental outcomes showed that under low load, early and late injection time can attain low temperature premixed combustion that resulted in prolonged ignition delay and increased heat release rate. It has been observed that equivalent fuel consumption rate of black soldier fly biodiesel was driven higher (245-260 g/kWh) by increasing fuel injection time and fuel injection pressure but lower than pure diesel fuel (255-270 g/kWh). Moreover, an oxide of nitrogen emission rises with early fuel injection time (100-1200 ppm) compared to late fuel injection time (200-300 ppm), whereas the pure diesel fuel has lower emission 900 ppm at early fuel injection time but the rate was similar at late fuel injection time (200 ppm), whereas the early and late fuel injection time can reduce the smoke emission 0.021/m than diesel fuel which has smoke emission 0.041/m and 0.08 early and late fuel injection time respectively. The low blending ratio 10% BD recorded the reduction in the oxide of nitrogen emission (50%) than 20% BD and similar effects was observed for equivalent fuel consumption. The heat release rate was found to be high in higher fuel injection pressure due to the increase in the proportion of premixed combustion. Furthermore, the oxide of nitrogen emission was increased with the rise of fuel injection pressure, but smoke emission reduced during the process.

AB This work aimed to numerically study the effect of hydrogen injection strategy on mixture formation and combustion process in a port injection (PI) rotary engine fueled with natural gas/hydrogen blends. The two main considered factors were hydrogen injection timing (IT) and hydrogen injection duration (ID). Simulation results indicated that for mixture formation, in terms of hydrogen IT, hydrogen IT of 390 degrees CA (BTDC) is a watershed. When the hydrogen IT is before 390 degrees CA (BTDC), the changes in hydrogen IT have little effect on the hydrogen distribution at ignition timing. Hydrogen distribution is uniform across the whole combustion chamber. However, when the hydrogen IT is after 390 degrees CA (BTDC), with the retarded hydrogen IT, there is obvious increase in hydrogen stratification phenomenon, and more hydrogen distributes in the middle and back of combustion chamber at ignition timing. In terms of hydrogen ID, at the fixed hydrogen IT of 360 degrees CA (BTDC), with the extended hydrogen ID, more hydrogen distributes in the back of trailing spark plug (TSP). For combustion process, to obtain a higher overall combustion rate for the PI rotary engine, the hydrogen injection strategy should make more hydrogen located at the front of TSP at ignition timing. In engineering applications, for higher peak cylinder pressure to be obtained, the continued optimization of hydrogen IT should be selected between 390 degrees CA (BTDC) and 330 degrees CA (BTDC). Under the hydrogen IT range of 390 degrees CA (BTDC) to 330 degrees CA (BTDC), the continued optimization of hydrogen ID should select between 8 degrees CA and 24 degrees CA.

AB Forest wood biomass can be a sustainable and cost-effective feedstock for the biorefinery industries, but the rigid and compact structure of plant cell is a major barrier for production of clean energy and biochemical. In this case, the MIBK/H2O pretreatment with biphasic system was applied to treat Eucalyptus and then systematically evaluated pretreatment conditions (e.g., MIBK/H2O ratio, reaction temperature and time, NaCl concentration, and HCl dosage) on the effect of furfural yield. The resulting solid fraction obtained from the optimum pretreatment condition for furfural yield was to produce fermentable glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis. Study on enzymatic hydrolysis of the raw material and resulting solid fraction obtained by single aqueous system was also contrastively investigated. The furfural yield was 65.9% and the recovery of residue was 46.9% under an optimal reaction condition (V-MIBK:V-H2O = 5:5, 150 degrees C, 60 min, 0.3 M HCI). Meanwhile, the yield of glucose of cellulose was improved after the pretreatments with different systems and a maximum value was up to 60.2% by the MIBK/H2O pretreatment. The effective fermentable glucose production was mainly affected by the significant removal of hemicelluloses, change of CrI, and destruction of surface morphology of Eucalyptus. The MIBK/H2O pretreatment can be considered as a potential approach for efficient conversion of Eucalyptus to clean energy and biochemicals.

AB In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. (NC) and palm kernel shell (PKS) was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to synergistically produce aromatic hydrocarbons, followed by characterization using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activities of various catalysts were also examined, and the effects of the NC-to-PKS mass ratio, reaction temperature and catalyst type on the aromatics yield and selectivity were assessed. The relative content of aromatics from the sole pyrolysis of NC and PKS were 11.79 and 2.96 area%, respectively; while a value of 30.39 area% was obtained from co-pyrolysis of NC/PKS at 600 degrees C and an NC-to-PKS mass ratio of 1:1, suggesting a synergistic effect for aromatics production during the co-pyrolysis. The synergistic production of aromatics was attributed to the substitution reactions of free radicals with phenols in the primary bio-oil from the co-pyrolysis. Cu/HZSM-5 was found to be a promising catalyst for aromatics production, a result that is attributed to its channel structure and surface acidity, the introduction of Cu can effectively reduce the amounts of surface strong acid sites. The addition of Cu/HZSM-5 to the co-pyrolysis of NC/PKS significantly improved the relative content of aromatics, resulting in a 42.65 area% yield.

AB The application of phase change materials (PCMs) in the building envelope can improve the thermal performance and the indoor thermal comfort conditions because they allow the proper storage or release of energy. In this work, three different solar assisted heat pump underfloor heating systems with and without the use of phase change material are designed, simulated and evaluated energetically for a building of 100 m(2) floor area. Different kinds of solar collectors (flat plate, photovoltaic, thermal photovoltaic) are coupled to a storage tank which feeds a heat pump for space heating purposes. The PCM is used on the underfloor heating system in order to increase the storage capacity and to avoid the operation of the heat pump during the peak electricity demand period. Furthermore, this work presents and compares the coefficient of performance, the electricity consumption, the solar coverage and the indoor temperature distribution of a building in Athens (Greece), with and without a PCM layer on the floor. More specifically, the PCM is placed on the underfloor heating system and different cases are examined by changing the collecting area, the collector type and the thickness of the insulation layer in the floor. The results prove that the use of the PCM layer on the underfloor heating system reduces the heating load by about 40%. The electricity consumption can be reduced between 42% and 67% using the solar-driven systems. It is also found that the system with the thermal PV consumes the lowest grid electricity. Moreover, the lowest simple payback period is found to be 9.61 years for the system with flat plate collectors without PCM. The simulation is conducted with TRNSYS for all the winter period.

AB The increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy sources provides the impetus for the development of alternative fuels. Recent development of fuel-flexible gas turbine technologies enables the use of alternative non fossil fuels that could play key roles in contributing to the global efforts in meeting emissions targets. This review highlights the current state-of-the-art production and properties of alternative fuels such as straight vegetable oil (SVO), biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuel. This is followed by the evaluation of combustion performances in gas turbines. All of the alternative liquid biofuels have shown their potentials in reducing regulated emissions such as NOx, CO and soot under favourable operating conditions. Both HVO and FT fuels show comparable performance as that of jet fuel and can be used in aviation gas turbines, although the present day high production cost restricts the large-scale adoption, limiting its utility. They also have considerably higher cetane number than the rest, making it easier for the fuel to ignite. As for stationary power generation gas turbines that need not carry payloads, the other four alternative biofuels of biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil and SVO are possible candidates despite the physics-chemical properties variations when compared to fossil fuels. Amongst them, the use of SVO and bio-oil in gas turbines would require the parallel development of fuel supply systems and atomisation technologies to improve the combustion of the fuels. In all, the alternative liquid fuels reviewed provides realistic opportunities for cleaner and more sustainable operation of aviation and power generation gas turbines. Profound understanding on the fundamental combustion characteristics of the fuels are essential to expedite their mass adoption in gas turbine applications.

AB Sulfur-iodine thermochemical water splitting cycle is a promising and carbon dioxide-free method for hydrogen production. Among the reactions in this cycle, hydrogen iodide catalytic decomposition is the rate-determining step. In this study, catalytic reactivity test combined with characterizations of nitrogen physisorption, X-Ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy provide evidences that hydrofluoric acid modified semi-coke is a promising catalyst candidate for hydrogen iodide decomposition because of its high active and low cost. The raw semi-coke enhanced the hydrogen iodide conversion rate. After modification of hydrofluoric acid, the catalytic activity of semi-coke increased largely. Semi-coke modified by 40 wt% hydrofluoric acid showed better performance than commercial activated carbon catalyst. Combine the characterization results and catalytic reactivity, the graphitic edge carbon atoms in semi-coke are the active sites for hydrogen iodide decomposition. This finding pointed out the direction of carbon material catalyst design for hydrogen iodide decomposition.

AB The aim of this paper is to compare an optimal and a sub-optimal strategy for the Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems based on Maximum Power Point tracking algorithms (with global feature or not) with the basic energy management strategy, namely the static Feed-Forward strategy considered as reference. The fuel economy is used as the unique performance indicator. The gaps in fuel economy for two Real-Time Optimization strategies based on Global Extremum Seeking algorithm and Perturb & Observe algorithm are compared to highlight the advantages of the global optimization strategies. Up to 5 L fuel economy was obtained for optimal strategies compared to sub-optimal ones. Also, the gaps in fuel economy are estimated for the proposed strategies using two levels of the FC current slope. The results of this study obtained for constant load are validated on a variable and unknown profile of the load power as well.

AB Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based systems are being extensively investigated for heat-to-electric power conversion from various sources, such as biomass, waste heat recovery, concentrated solar thermal and geothermal. The ORC technology has a promising future as it helps to meet energy requirements, arguably with a minimal environmental impact. This work summarizes the current state-of-the-art of actual i.e., experimental ORC system performance, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the most significant, relevant and up-to-date experimental data published in scientific literature. A survey of more than 200 scientific works is scrutinized according to specific selection criteria and data is extracted to develop a database containing thermodynamic cycle information along with component-level performance information. Performance trends are discussed and addressed as functions of first principles. One of the least surprising results indicate that the performance follows economies of scale. More revealing is the fact that the Organic Rankine Cycle conversion efficiency (mechanical to electrical) was around 70%. Furthermore, it becomes clear that there is a large gap between research and development for source and sink temperature differences above 150 degrees C. In general, the overall heat to electrical power conversion efficiency was around 44% of the Carnot cycle efficiency of the cycle. A host of other relevant thermodynamic parameters are cross-compared, as well as compared to theoretical results, allowing a level of practical ORC system design target homologation to be achieved which is useful for the engineer as well as the scientist in the design of ORC components, systems as well as advanced cycles.

AB Power estimation is the most important task in the performance assessment of wave energy converters (WEC). Depending on the type of WEC, power take-off (PTO) system, and available instrumentation, different approaches are usually applied to assess power from experimental tests. Since neither for tests execution nor for the analyses exist standard methodologies, the estimated power can significantly differ among the approaches, thus, introducing inaccuracies in the assessment of the WEC's performance. This study analyzed an extensive set of experimental results of a WEC and applied different power estimation approaches to compare and validate the obtained results. The strengths and weaknesses of those methodologies were analyzed and discussed. The major outcomes were: (a) PTO damping characterization based on bench tests can lead to unrealistic values of the WEC's absorbed power; (b) the hybrid (experimental plus numerical) approach provide more reliable results than the traditional ones; (c) the kinetic energy harvester approach underestimates power but can be useful for preliminary qualitative performance assessments; (d) the new proposed gross efficiency index allows the definition of upper boundaries for wave power conversion as well as the identification of the wave conditions for which WEC performance can be improved.

AB Solar energy system is compatible with the ever-rising demands to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Here, a concentrating solar power system integrating photovoltaics and a solar-syngas-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell is proposed. The concentrated sunlight is first absorbed by a spectrum selective nanofluid. The ultraviolet and infrared solar spectrum bands of the concentrated sunlight are absorbed and converted into solar syngas through a thermochemical reaction. The upgraded solar syngas is converted into electricity through solid oxide fuel cell. The visible and near-infrared sunlight band un-absorbed by nanofluid is transmitted and directly converted into electricity through concentrator photovoltaics. In contrast to individual concentrator photovoltaics, this solar hybrid system can convert the ultraviolet and infrared solar spectrum bands to solar syngas instead of waste heat. The nanofluid has the function of adjusting the output electricity share between the solid oxide fuel cell and the concentrator photovoltaics. The simulation method of this type of solar hybrid system is described. The conversion performance of the full spectrum solar energy converted into electricity is analysed for a typical system. In particular, the complementary feature of the spectrum response is disclosed for the selected nanofluid. The solar-to-electricity efficiency would be expected to be approximately 31.5% at a direct normal irradiation of 900 W/m(2). An optimal particle size and volume fraction of the nanofluid are provided. The results may provide a possibility of a new pathway to the high-efficiency of full solar spectrum utilization.

AB This research presents a combination of thereto-economic analysis and multi-objective optimization of a 10 kW single-effect ammonia-water solar absorption cooling system. A thermodynamic model is derived, and energy-exergy analyses are conducted. Also, the effects of various solar collector types including a flat plate, evacuated tube, compound parabolic, and parabolic trough collectors on the system performance are examined at different ambient temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that by increasing heat source temperature, the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency of the system reach their highest values, while they occur in lower heat source temperature as the ambient temperature is decreased. The exergy efficiency is also found to decrease with the increment of evaporator, absorber, and condenser absorber temperatures. Furthermore, for determining the optimum operating conditions, a multi-objective optimization is performed by using an efficient particle swarm optimization technique with five objective functions. The corresponding results reveal that the solar absorption cooling system with evacuated tube collectors is the most economical solution with a total cost of 7.2 k(sic) and 24 m(2) collector area. It is found that the parabolic trough collector system has the highest solar exergy efficiency of 0.046, which occurs at the high ambient temperature and low evaporator temperature. This system also has higher solar performance coefficient up to 0.447 indicating its great efficiency.

AB Methanol is an important platform chemical. The conversion of natural gas is the most widely used technology to produce methanol. With the development of chemical industry, the situation of energy shortage has become very serious. The exploration and adoption of renewable energy is an alternative way to solve the crisis of energy shortage. Wind energy is one of the most prominent energy source among all renewable energy sources in the Chinese energy markets. In this paper, wind energy integrated with natural-gas-to-methanol (WGTM) process is proposed. Performance analysis including carbon efficiency, energy efficiency, production cost, carbon reduction benefit, and impact of carbon tax is conducted. Based on the comparison results of NGTM (natural-gas-to-methanol) and WGTM (wind energy integrated with natural-gas-to-methanol), it can be concluded that the proposed system may be ready for industrialization at the near future. The wind energy integration provides a promising way to reduce carbon dioxide emission. The WGTM can be a flexible way to slow down the GHG effect.

AB This study aims to critically evaluate whether the implementation of selected green supply chain management (GSCM) practices will drive and empower sustainability among IS014001-certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Besides this, the significance and strength of the relationships between GSCM practices and sustainability performance were also investigated and subsequently ranked using a two-stage PLSANN approach. Primary data was collected from 178 large 15014001-certified Malaysian manufacturers through self-administered survey questionnaires. PLS-SEM using SmartPLS 3.0 and artificial neural network analysis (ANN) served as statistical analysis tools. This study draws out the prominence of GSCM practices as strategies to achieve sustainability performance. However, the relationship between supplier selection and supplier evaluation with sustainability performance is surprisingly insignificant. Furthermore, cooperation with customers is found to be significantly but negatively related to sustainability performance. Nevertheless, this contributes new knowledge to the literature with sensible justifications being offered accordingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review presents an in-depth study of the literature on segmentation methods applied in dental imaging. Several works on dental image segmentation were studied and categorized according to the type of method (region-based, threshold-based, cluster-based, boundary-based or watershed-based), type of X-ray images analyzed (intra-oral or extra-oral), and characteristics of the data set used to evaluate the methods in each state-of-the-art work. We found that the literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%). 80% of the reviewed articles have used intra-oral X-ray images in their experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which also show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. To fill a scientific gap in the field, a novel data set based on extra-oral X-ray images, presenting high variability and with a large number of images, is introduced here. A statistical comparison of the results of 10 pixel-wise image segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1500 images is also carried out, providing a comprehensive source of performance assessment. Discussion on limitations of the benchmarked methods, as well as future perspectives on exploiting learning-based segmentation methods to improve performance, is also addressed. Finally, we present a preliminary application of the MASK recurrent convolutional neural network to demonstrate the power of a deep learning method to segment images from our data set.

AB Epilepsy is a life-threatening and challenging neurological disorder, which is affecting a large number of people all over the world. For its detection, encephalography (EEG) is a commonly used clinical approach, but manual inspection of EEG brain signals is a time-consuming and laborious process, which puts a heavy burden on neurologists and affects their performance. Several automatic systems have been proposed using traditional approaches to assist neurologists, which perform well in detecting binary epilepsy scenarios e.g. normal vs. ictal, but their performance degrades in classifying ternary case e.g. ictal vs. normal vs. inter-ictal. To overcome this problem, we propose a system that is an ensemble of pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional neural network (P-1D-CNN) models. Though a CNN model learns the internal structure of data and outperforms hand-engineered techniques, the main issue is the large number of learnable parameters, whose learning requires a huge volume of data. To overcome this issue, P-1D CNN works on the concept of refinement approach and it involves 61% fewer parameters compared to standard CNN models and as such it has better generalization. Further to overcome the limitations of the small amount of data, we propose two augmentation schemes. We tested the system on the University of Bonn dataset, a benchmark dataset; in almost all the cases concerning epilepsy detection, it gives an accuracy of 99.1 0.9% and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. In addition, while enjoying the strength of a CNN model, P-1D-CNN model requires 61% less memory space and its detection time is very short (< 0.000481 s), as such it is suitable for real-time clinical setting. It will ease the burden of neurologists and will assist the patients in alerting them before the seizure occurs. The proposed P-1D CNN model is not only suitable for epilepsy detection, but it can be adopted in developing robust expert systems for other similar disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An efficient design of optical networks is a complex challenge that requires knowledge of the desired performance trends. Such knowledge would have a potential impact on an expert system to this end, for instance, would help identify reliable topological parameters to characterize the desired behavior of the network. Feature selection from information theory is widely explored in many areas of expert and intelligent systems, and it is a suitable technique to choose such parameters. In optical networks, many signals are carried along the same fiber, each one with its wavelength. A possible desired performance is the minimal usage of different wavelengths, which can be influenced by many topological parameters established in the network design. However, it is difficult to determine the dependence between topological parameters and the number of wavelengths, because this latter addresses an NP-hard problem. We perform a comprehensive literature review to find topological metrics that are easier to compute and apply feature selection using a new mutual information estimator. Based on coincidence detection, this estimator is lightweight and easy-to-use and allows measuring the relevance between discrete and continuous features, without discretization nor estimating probability density functions. For this purpose, tests are performed using 315 topological parameters from graph theory and complex networks, in 15 real-world optical networks and 2.2 million random topologies that mimic real-world ones. The topological parameters are ranked based on its mutual information values, obtaining a set of the most influential for explaining the wavelength requirements. Among these parameters, as a result, the method highlights the ones derived from the edge betweenness. Moreover, some parameters proposed by the literature do not perform as expected. The results of this study can serve as a basis for new expert systems to design and expansion of optical networks, driven by the most relevant topological parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a newly developed metaheuristic inspired by hunting mechanism of grey wolves. The paramount challenge in GWO is that it is prone to stagnation in local optima. This paper proposes a cellular grey wolf optimizer with a topological structure (CGWO). The proposed CGWO has two characteristics. Firstly, each wolf has its own topological neighbors, and interactions among wolves are restricted to their neighbors, which favors exploitation of CGWO. Secondly, information diffusion mechanism by overlap among neighbors can allow to maintain the population diversity for longer, usually contributing to exploration. Empirical studies are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with different metaheuristics such as success-history based adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction (LSHADE), teaching-learning based optimization algorithm (TLBO), effective butterfly optimizer with covariance matrix adapted retreat phase (EBOwithCMAR), novel dynamic harmony search (NDHS), bat-inspired algorithm (BA), comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (CLPSO), evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (EAD), ring topology PSO (RPSO), crowding-based differential evolution (CDE), neighborhood based crowding differential evolution (NCDE), locally informed particle swarm (LIPS), some improved variants of GWO and GWO. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the other algorithms on most benchmarks and engineering problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Best Worst Method (BWM) has recently been proposed as a method for Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Studies show that BWM compared with other methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), leads to lower inconsistency of the results while reducing the number of required pairwise comparisons. MCDM methods such as BWM require accurate information. However, it often happens in practice that a level of uncertainty accompanies the information. The main aim of this paper is to address this problem and provide an integration of BWM and Z-numbers, namely ZBWM. Providing BWM with Z numbers enables the BWM method to handle the uncertainty of information of a multi-criteria decision. Additionally, the capabilities of the proposed method in the process of utilizing the linguistic information dealing with big data are highlighted. The proposed method is examined to address a supplier development problem. By experimental results, we show that ZBWM results lower inconsistency when compared with BWM. A Z-number contains subjectivity in its fuzzy part, which can be addressed in future applications of ZBWM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Structured population in evolutionary algorithms is a vital strategy to control diversity during the search. One of the most popular structured population strategies is the island model in which the population is divided into several sub-populations (islands). The EA normally search for each island independently. After a number of predefined iterations, a migration process is activated to exchange specific migrants between islands. Recently, bat-inspired algorithm has been proposed as a population-based algorithm to mimic the echolocation system involved in micro-bat. The main drawback of bat-inspired algorithm is its inability to preserve the diversity during the search and thus the prematurity can take place. In this paper, the strategy of island model is adapted for bat-inspired algorithm to empower its capability in controlling its diversity concepts. The proposed island bat-inspired algorithm is evaluated using 25 IEEE-CEC2005 benchmark functions with different size and complexity. The sensitivity analysis for the main parameters of island bat-inspired algorithm is well-studied to show their effect on the convergence properties. For comparative evaluation, island bat-inspired algorithm is compared with 17 competitive methods and shows very successful outcomes. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied for three real-world cases of economic load dispatch problem where the results obtained prove considerable efficiency in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, a hybrid model using modular neural networks and fuzzy logic was designed to provide the hypertension risk diagnosis of a person. This model considers age, risk factors and behavior of the blood pressure in a period of 24 h, using as a basis the Framingham Heart Study.
   Records of blood pressure are collected with the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), a device which takes readings for a period of time of 24 h. A modular neural network was designed, with three modules, of which the first and second modules correspond to the systolic and diastolic pressures and the last one to the heart rate. Each module is trained with the data obtained by the ABPM of different patients, this in order that the neural network learns the different behaviors that the blood pressure may have. Also, different architectures and learning methods are considered to obtain the best possible architecture. In addition, two fuzzy inference systems (FISs) for classification purpose are proposed, the first one for the heart rate level and the second one for the night profile of the patient. These were tested with different types of membership functions and then selecting the FIS that obtained the best results. Furthermore, a third FIS as a blood pressure classifier is also used.
   The different proposed methodologies were tested, in the case of the modular neural network to find the architecture that produces better results and in the fuzzy inference systems to find which membership functions were the ideal ones for the case study, in this way obtaining overall good results. For the case of the modular neural network, the learning accuracy in the first module is 98%, in the second module is 97.62% and the third module is 97.83% respectively. For the night profile, the fuzzy system is compared to a traditional system of production rules, and it is noted that the first one gives all correct outputs and the second one just gives 53% of the outputs, this is due to the uncertainty handling that fuzzy systems can provide, which the traditional system cannot because its rules are very strict.
   Hybrid intelligent systems for the solution of this kind of complex problems have excellent performance, due to the good learning in each module of the neural network and the classification uncertainty that is well managed by the fuzzy systems, obtaining with this a hybrid combination for achieving good results.

AB Due to pervasive deployment of electricity-propelled water-pumps, water distribution systems (WDSs) are energy-intensive technologies which are largely operated and controlled by engineers based on their judgments and discretions. Hence energy efficiency in the water sector is a serious concern. To this end, this study is dedicated to the optimal operation of the WDS which is articulated as minimization of the pumps' energy consumption while maintaining flow, pressure, and tank water levels at a minimum level, also known as pump scheduling problem (PSP). This problem is proved to be NP-hard (i.e. a difficult problem computationally). We therefore develop a hybrid methodology incorporating machine-learning techniques as well as optimization methods to address real-life and large-sized WDSs. Other main contributions of this research are (i) in addition to fixed-speed pumps, the variable-speed pumps are optimally controlled, (ii) and operational rules such as water allocation rules can also be explicitly considered in the methodology. This methodology is tested using a large dataset in which the results are found to be highly promising. This methodology has been coded as a user-friendly software composed of MS-Excel (as a user interface), MS-Access (a database), MATLAB (for machine-learning), GAMS (with CPLEX solver for solving optimization problem) and EPANET (to solve hydraulic models).

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In machine learning field, Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (GSSL) has recently attracted much attention and many researchers have proposed a number of different methods. GSSL generally constructs a k nearest neighbors graph to explore manifold structure which may improve learning performance of GSSL. If one uses an inappropriate graph to learn a semi-supervised classifier, the performance of the classifier may be worse than that of supervised learning (SL) only trained by labeled samples. Hence, it is worthy to design a safe version to broaden the application area of GSSL. In this paper, we introduce a Safety-aware GSSL (SaGSSL) method which can adaptively select the good graphs and learn a safe semi-supervised classifier simultaneously. The basic assumption is that a graph has a high quality if the sample margin obtained by GSSL with the graph is larger than that obtained by SL. By identifying the high-quality graphs and setting the corresponding weights large, the predictions of our algorithm will approach to those of GSSL with the graphs. Meanwhile, the weights of the low-quality graphs should be small and the predictions of our algorithm will be close to those of SL. Hence the degeneration probability will be reduced and our algorithm is expected to realize the goal of safe exploitation of different graphs. Experimental results on several datasets show that our algorithm can simultaneously implement the graph selection and safely exploit the unlabeled samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study evaluated the inhibitory effects of chitosan-based coatings on endogenous enzyme activities, proteolytic degradation and texture softening of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) fillets stored at 4 degrees C for 15 days. In general, the inhibitory effects of chitosan coating were worse than that of chitosan composite coatings, which significantly inhibited cathepsin B, B + L and calpain activities of fillets, with the most reductions of 58%, 65% and 41%, respectively when compared to the corresponding values of control fillets. Besides, the treatments also retarded the proteolytic degradation through quantifiable indicators including salt-soluble proteins (SSP), TCA-soluble peptides and SDS-PAGE pattern. After storage of 15 days, the shear forces of coated fillets were 28-53% higher than that of control samples. These results indicated that chitosan composite coating combined with glycerol monolaurate and clove essential oil improved the quality of refrigerated grass carp fillets by alleviating endogenous enzyme induced proteolysis and softening.

AB A novel approach for rapid identification of three foodborne pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Shigella sonnei in foods by solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was established. After cultivation 24, 18 and 20 h for Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Shigella sonnei, respectively, the microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) were extracted with a SPME device equipped with divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coated fibers. The DB-1701P column was applied for separation of MVOCs. A total of 17, 13 and 14 volatile organic compounds were identified as characteristic MVOCs of Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Shigella sonnei, respectively. Similarity of the MVOC chromatographic fingerprints for the bacteria were calculated and compared, and the results showed that the established method is stable, reproducible, accurate and has the potential to identify the three bacteria in food samples.

AB Subcritical water extraction (SWE), an environment-friendly technique, was applied to extract polyphenolics from sorghum bran. Extraction temperatures (degrees C), time (min), and solid-liquid ratio (mL/g) were investigated and optimized by Box-Behnken design. The optimized conditions for SWE was 144.5 degrees C of temperature, 21 min of time, and 35 mL/g of solid-liquid ratio, with a polyphenolics yield of 47.253 +/- 0.375 mg GAE/g dw, which was in good agree with the predicted value. Comparing with hot water extraction (HWE), SWE resulted in a higher yield of polyphenolics, higher radical scavenging activities, and more efficient antiproliferative activity. Furthermore, major polyphenolic compositions of the extracts were identified and quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Taxifolin, taxifolin hexoside, oligomeric procyanidins, and epicatechin were the most abundant polyphenolic compounds in the extracts. Taken together, SWE can be used as a effective extraction method for polyphenolics from sorghum bran, which could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants.

AB Antioxidant and cytocompatible chemically modified polysaccharides and their hydrogels were obtained by a biomimetic approach. For this purpose, carboxymethylpullulan grafted with ferulic acid (CMP-FA) was firstly synthesized with different substitution degrees (DSFA). Their hydrogels were secondly obtained by enzymatic cross-linking with laccase. Hydrogel swelling has been found dependent on both DSFA and media ionic strength. The CMP-FA antioxidant properties were evaluated by the DPPH method and ABTS assays. The DPPH radical scavenging effect was high for CMP-FA solutions (80% after 30 min) and lower for the corresponding hydrogels (70% after 7 h). The antibacterial properties of ferulic acid and CMP-FA derivatives were tested against Staphylococcus aureus but the minimal inhibitory concentration of CMP-FA was not reached in the range of concentrations studied. Finally the CMP-FA derivatives showed no cytotoxicity towards mouse fibroblast cells.

AB Immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) are most frequently used for on-site rapid screening of clenbuterol. To improve sensitivity, a novel probe with bacteria as signal carriers was developed. Bacteria can load a great deal of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on their surface, meaning much fewer antibodies are needed to produce clearly visible results, although low concentrations of antibody could also trigger fierce competition between free analyte and the immobilized antigen. Thus, a limited number of antibodies was key to significantly improved sensitivity. Analytical conditions, including bacterial species, coupling method, and concentration, were optimized. The visual detection limit (VDL) for clenbuterol was 0.1 ng/mL, a 20-fold improvement in sensitivity compared with traditional strips. This work has opened up a new route for signal amplification and improved performance of ICAs. Furthermore, inactivated bacteria could also be environment-friendly and robust signal carriers for other biosensors.

AB In this study the antioxidant effect of Cannabis sativa L. seeds and sprouts (3 and 5 days of germination) was evaluated. Total polyphenols, flavonoids and flavonols content, when expressed on dry weight basis, were highest in sprouts; ORAC and DPPH (in vitro assays), CAA-RBC (cellular antioxidant activity in red blood cells) and hemolysis test (ex vivo assays) evidenced a good antioxidant activity higher in sprouts than in seeds. Untargeted analysis by high resolution mass spectrometry in negative ion mode allowed the identification of main polyphenols (caffeoyltyramine, cannabisin A, B, C) in seeds and of omega-6 (linoleic acid) in sprouts. Antimutagenic effect of seeds and sprouts extracts evidenced a significant decrease of mutagenesis induced by hydrogen peroxide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 strain. In conclusion our results show that C. sativa seeds and sprouts exert beneficial effects on yeast and human cells and should be further investigated as a potential functional food.

AB A novel fluorescent probe 3'-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-spiro [isobenzofuran-1,9'-xanthene]-6'-yl-2,4-dini-trobenzenesulfonate (probe 1) was designed and synthesized as a visual sensor for the detection of cysteine levels in milk and water samples. The addition of cysteine to the solution of probe 1 resulted in an increase in fluorescence intensity and color change, from light yellow to yellow-green. The distinct color response indicated that probe 1 could be used as a visual sensor for cysteine. Cysteine can be detected quantitatively at concentrations between 0 and 400 mu M and the detection limit of the fluorescence response to the probe was 6.5 mu M. This suggests that probe 1 could be used as a signaling tool to determine the cysteine levels in samples, such as milk and water.

AB Triterpene glycosides namely momordicoside K and momordicoside L causes bitterness in bitter-gourd thereby reducing its consumer acceptance. Reducing bitterness of the juice by addition of beta-cyclodextrin (0.25-2%) was attempted and its effect on sensory quality, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity and antidiabetic potential was evaluated. Juice with 1.5% beta-cyclodextrin demonstrated highest score (7.7 +/- 0.3) for sensory acceptability compared to the control (3.8 +/- 0.7). A significantly (p < 0.05) higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity was observed. A marginal (10%) but significant (p < 0.05) reduction in alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity without affecting a-amylase activity was noted. Results from NMR, ROESY and FTIR studies indicated formation of an inclusion complex by interaction of hydrophobic triterpenoidal region of momordicosides with beta-cyclodextrin.

AB An analytical method for the non-target screening of macrolides and metabolites in bass (Lateolabrax) was developed using an automated on-line extraction procedure followed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC Q-Orbitrap). The estimated performance characteristics were satisfied, complying with the requirements of the guidelines specified in European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limit ranged from 0.12 mu g kg(-1) to 3.61 mu g kg(-1), and detection capability ranged between 0.20 mu g kg(-1) and 6.02 mu g kg(-1). Precision in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) was under 14% for all compounds, and the extraction recoveries ranged from 81% to 107%. Finally, the method was applied to ten different commercially important bass species and confirmed the presence of ten macrolides and metabolites. Five non-target compounds of robenidine, lincomycin hydrochloride, thiacloprid, fenbendazole, and thiabendazole were elucidated in the untargeted screening.

AB Color additives are used widely by the food industry to confer a desirable appearance. Some of the most used colorants (Tartrazine (E102), Sunset Yellow (E110), Red Allure (E129) and Blue Brilliant (E133)) were determined in this study using microemulsion electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEEKC). Regression coefficients were greater than 0.9981; intra-and inter-day precisions, in terms of percentage RSD, were less than 7.01% and 8.55%, respectively; recoveries were between 90 and 100% in most cases. LODs and LOQs ranged from 0.24 to 1.21 mg L-1 and from 0.80 to 4.03 mg L-1, respectively. Moreover, MEEKC consumed less solvent than HPLC, making the analysis more environmentally friendly. The proposed method is suitable for the determination of colorants in a wide variety of foods. Results showed that consumers should be aware of colorants to avoid consumption exceeding recommended amounts.

AB A method for simultaneously separating six arsenic (As) species was established by ultrasound-assisted extraction-anion exchange chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Six As species could be well separated within 15 min when 0.3M acetic acid and 25mM NH4H2PO4 were used as the extraction solvent and mobile phase, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection and recovery of As species and the relative standard deviation were in the ranges of 0.31-0.59 mu g/L, 94.30-102.75%, and 1.63-3.72%, respectively. Furthermore, the established method was successfully applied to fresh Shiitake (Lentinus edodes) mushrooms and processed products. The inorganic As contents of all samples ranged from 0.204 to 0.500 mg/kg, half of samples (> 0.400 mg/kg) were close to the maximum contaminant level allowed by the Chinese (0.5 mg/kg). The health risk index estimation results indicated that no particular risk of As exposure to Chinese consumers existed in L. edodes.

AB The antifungal effect of chitosan edible coatings (ChEC) functionalized with cinnamon essential oil and aqueous extract of Roselle calyces on Colletotrichum fragariae growth and physical-chemical, physiological and nutraceutical features of strawberries at 5 and 20 degrees C were evaluated. ChEC was characterized with respect to its water vapor permeability (WVP) and mechanical properties. Results indicated that C. fragariae grew from the third day in strawberries stored at 20 degrees C, whilst at 5 degrees C disease symptoms were observed after 10 days in fruit inoculated and treated with ChEC after 24 h. The weight loss was reduced 15 times and firmness was higher by 33% in fruit treated with ChEC and stored at 5 degrees C. The antioxidant capacity of strawberries increased at the end of the storage only in control group. In conclusion, ChEC can be an effective technology for preserving quality strawberries for 17 days at 5 degrees C.

AB Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with 5% (w/v) carrot-enriched olive oil and stabilized with Tween 80 (TW), phosphatidylcholine (PC), citrus pectin (CP) or a combination of these emulsifiers. Additionally, the methylesterification degree (DM) of citrus pectin was modified, resulting in three different studied pectin structures: CP82, CP38 and CP10. All initial emulsions presented small initial oil droplet sizes and were submitted to an in vitro simulated gastric and small intestinal phase. The latter was executed in a kinetic way to determine the time dependency of the lipolysis reaction, micelle formation and carotenoid bioaccessibility. The results showed that the pectin DM mainly influenced the reaction rate constants, while the emulsifier (combination) determined the extent of lipolysis and carotenoid bioaccessibility. Moreover, a direct relation was observed between the lipolysis reaction and bioaccessibility extent. The presented study showed that targeted emulsion design can be used to tailor lipid digestion kinetics.

AB This study was intended to evaluate the quality parameters of 58 Apis mellifera honey samples, from different regions in the Sultanate of Oman. Physicochemical analyses were carried out and examined according to the Gulf Standardization Organization (GSO).
   The results revealed that 64.4% of the samples were failing to meet the GSO standards due to acidity, hydroxyl methyl furfural (HMF), diastase, sucrose, and glucose & fructose. Acidity and HMF were above the limits in 30% and 29% of the failed samples respectively, where diastase and total glucose & fructose were below the limits in 25% and 5% respectively. Sucrose was above the limits in 11% of the failed samples.
   The unconformity of the analyzed honey samples to GSO standards could be due to stage of harvesting, process and storage conditions. Therefore, it's important to reconsider the whole process of honey production in Oman in order to improve the technology and honey quality.

AB A theoretical evaluation of the antioxidant property of a natural food colorant Peonidin has been performed. The most suitable mechanism for explaining the radical scavenging capacity of Peonidin is the Hydrogen Atom Transfer and the most active site for radical formation is position 3 and is confirmed through Mulliken charge analysis, pKa value evaluation, Bond Dissociation Energy values, and Natural Bond Orbital analysis. Position 3 and 5 in Peonidin exists in blood as deprotonated as their pKa values are lower than the pH of blood. Peonidin is highly reactive than Quercetin and less stable than flavan-3-ols due to the small band gap. Global descriptor analysis shows that PN prefers to accept electrons than to donate. The effect of number of -OH groups and the nature of substituents are well explained through this work.

AB Vaccinium bracteatum leaves (VBTL) are traditionally used in China to dye rice grains, which assume a deep blue color, named 'Wu mi'. Information on the mechanism of pigment formation is limited. In this study, CIELAB color space parameters were used to represent the color of 'Wu mi'. Precursor compounds of pigments formed during the dyeing process were identified by UPLC Q-TOF MS analysis. The changes in co-factors for pigment formation in VBTL were measured at different growth stages. The L* and b* values of dyed rice increased as the leaves aged, whereas a* values showed irregular changes. Six compounds were tentatively identified as pigment precursors by UPLC Q-TOF MS analysis. The pH and beta-glucosidase activity at different growth stages of VBTL were indicated to be crucial co-factors for pigment formation. A tentative hypothesis is presented that iridoid glycosides are hydrolyzed by acids and beta-glucosidases to form a dialdehyde structure that binds covalently with amino residues of lysine side chains in rice protein molecules.

AB An efficient method was applied for extraction of caffeine in food samples. Three-dimensional graphene-Fe3O4 (3D-G-Fe3O4) nanoparticles was successfully synthesized and used as adsorbent in magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) step. The properties of synthesized adsorbent were characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. The influence of main parameters of extraction procedure such as ultrasound parameter, amount of nanoparticles, pH, salt concentration and desorption condition were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the figure of merit results showed excellent linear dynamic range (LDR) of 0.5-500 mu g mL(-1), with determination coefficient (R-2) higher than 0.996 and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 mu g mL(-1). Intra-and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 5.9 and 7.1%, respectively. The method was successfully applied for determination of caffeine in different food samples.

AB Carotenoids, especially beta-cryptoxanthin, exert multiple biological activities in the organism. Various processing techniques can improve carotenoid bioavailability in relation to the food matrix. The study objective was to compare the bioavailability of carotenoids from orange juice (OJ) with that from a beverage obtained by alcoholic fermentation of orange juice (FOB). Seven volunteers were recruited for a randomized, controlled, and crossover study. Post-intake plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured by HPLC in the subjects at 0-8 h after their consumption of OJ or FOB. beta-Cryptoxanthin and lutein absorption was significantly higher from FOB than from OJ, but no significant difference in zeaxanthin absorption was found. The mean baseline-corrected area under the concentration curve (AUC(0-8) (h)) for beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin was 24.6-, 1.3- and 4.65-fold larger, respectively, after FOB versus OJ consumption. This fermented orange beverage could be an abundant source of bioavailable carotenoids, and its regular consumption may exert healthy effects.

AB The effects of hot-air drying (AD), freeze drying (FD) and Refractance Window drying (RWD) on the retention of anthocyanins, phenolics, flavonoids, vitamin C and B, and antioxidant capacity (ORAC) in blueberries, tart cherries, strawberries, and cranberries, as well as organic acids and proanthocyanins in cranberries and chlorogenic acid and catchins in blueberries were evaluated. Changes in color, glass transition, specific heat, and surface morphology of the dried fruits were also evaluated. The quality retention in the dried fruits was found to be product and drying method specific. The FD products exhibited a better retention of vitamin C, ORAC, anthocyanins, and phenolics than the AD and RWD fruits. The RWD produced samples with a less effective ORAC, anthocyanins, and phenolics retention, but a higher total vitamin B retention compared to the FD products. The AD-dried fruits displayed significantly lesser quality retention in most of the quality indexes measured in the study.

AB Lupine is widely used as an ingredient in diverse food products, but it is also a source of allergens. This work aimed at proposing a method to detect/quantify lupine as an allergen in processed foods based on a normalised real-time PCR assay targeting the Lup a 4 allergen-encoding gene of Lupinus albus. Sensitivities down to 0.0005%, 0.01% and 0.05% (w/w) of lupine in rice flour, wheat flour and bread, respectively, and 1 pg of L. albus DNA were obtained, with adequate real-time PCR performance parameters using the Delta Ct method. Both food matrix and processing affected negatively the quantitative performance of the assay. The method was successfully validated with blind samples and applied to processed foods. Lupine was estimated between 4.12 and 22.9% in foods, with some results suggesting the common practice of precautionary labelling. In this work, useful and effective tools were proposed for the detection/quantification of lupine in food products.

The outline of the CAMD almost overlaps with that of the Central Asian orogenic belt (CAOB), which is located between the East Europe, Siberia, Tarim and North China cratons. The CAMD comprises sparsely exposed tectonic slices of Precambrian high-grade metamorphic basement rocks that are sandwiched between Phanerozoic accretionary complexes and arc rocks. According to geological, metallogenic, geochronological and tectonic setting characteristics, the CAMD comprises three metallogenic provinces: (1) the Kazakhstan Cu-Au-Mo, (2) the Mongolia Cu-Au and (3) the Northeast China Mo-Cu metallogenic provinces. Early Paleozoic (similar to 490 to 440 Ma) and Late Paleozoic (similar to 330 to 295 Ma) large scale porphyry-type mineralization in the Kazakhstan metallogenic province is intimately associated with the evolution of the Central Tianshan-Yili-Northern Tianshan-Kokchetav-Chingiz Paleozoic arc system which was terminated by the late Permian closure of the western segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. In contrast, the similar to 370 Ma and similar to 240 Ma porphyry-type mineralization of the Mongolia metallogenic province is related to the Tuva Mongolia arc collage system that was formed during the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Paleozoic and the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean in the early Mesozoic. Furthermore, the Northeast China metallogenic province was affected by three distinct geodynamic processes that were associated with the Paleo-Asian, Mongol-Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific Oceans during the Paleozoic (> 250 Ma), the early Mesozoic (> 200 Ma) and the late Mesozoic (200-90 Ma), respectively. Except for the Early Paleozoic Cu mineralization at Duobaoshan (similar to 480 Ma) and Bainaimiao (440 Ma), the porphyry-type mineralization of this metallogenic province is predominantly characterized by widespread Mesozoic Mo mineralization.
   In general, porphyry-type deposits of the CAMD have geological, structural, metallogenic, alteration and fluid characteristics, which are consistent either with those related to the oceanic subductional arc settings of the Circum-Pacific metallogenic domain or with those of the continental collisional environment in the Tethyan metallogenic domain. The involvement of highly oxidized intermediate to felsic magmas is fundamental for the formation of porphyry deposits. Even though the prevalent MASH and slab melting models can be employed to interpret the genesis of some porphyry Cu deposits in the CAMD, a here newly suggested model, which is based on 'pre-enriched mafic lower crust and the subduction of a relictic mid-oceanic ridge', is thought to explain the large scale copper mineralization in the Balkhash-West Junggar metallogenic belt of the Kazakhstan metallogenic province. Nevertheless, most of the porphyritic suites associated with the Mo deposits in the Northeast China metallogenic province have relatively depleted mantle-like neodymium and hafnium isotopic compositions, suggesting that the ore-forming granitic magma may have predominantly been derived from juvenile lower crust. Upwelling of asthenosphere may have triggered the melting of the lower crust during post-collisional extension subsequent to the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Triassic, the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific ocean in the Jurassic and the thinning of the lithosphere caused by rollback of the Paleo-Pacific plate in the Cretaceous. Ancient crustal components were only locally found to have been involved in the magma source of several medium-large Mo deposits.

AB Two types of Jurassic intrusive rocks have been recognized in the Daheishan ore district, northeastern China, according to new SIMS zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock major and trace element abundances, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions. The first type is represented by biotite granite and monzogranite, with zircon U-Pb dating yielding ages from 182 to 175 Ma. These rocks are high-K calc-alkaline series, and span from metaluminous to weakly peraluminous. They exhibit enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs), with significant negative Eu anomalies, low (La/Yb)(N) and Sr/Y ratios. They have low (Sr-87/Sr-86); ratios of 0.70202-0.70474, positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values of 1.7-2.3, and Nd model ages (T-DM2) of 826-771 Ma as well as ((206)pb/(204)pb)(i) values of 18.400-18.494. These arc-like geochemical characteristics suggest that the Early Jurassic intrusions were formed by the partial melting of a mixture of dominated juvenile component and pre-existing crust in a subduction zone setting. The second type is represented by diorite and granodiorite, with zircon U-Pb ages of 172-170 Ma. These Middle Jurassic intrusive rocks are high-K calc-alkaline and mainly metaluminous, with high Mg-# (> 29) and elevated (La/Yb)(N) and Sr/Y ratios. They display similar whole-rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions ((Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) = 0.70432-0.70480, epsilon(Nd)(t) = 1.7-2.3, (Pb-206/Pb-204)(i) = 18.3016-18.4531) to the Early Jurassic granites. Their adakitic geochemical compositions suggest that they formed at pressures greater than 15 kbar by the partial melting of thickened lower crust with a juvenile component. We further propose that the tectonic setting of the Zhangguangcai Range in the Early Jurassic might be a back-arc related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate, and that subduction stopped temporarily in the Middle Jurassic due to the presence of over-thickened continental crust. The prolonged Jurassic adakitic magmatism and concomitant fluid activities may have played important roles in the formation of the porphyry Mo deposits in the Daheishan ore district.

TI Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic magmatic records from the Chalukou

AB To constrain the pre-mineralization tectonic evolutionary history and the nature of the magma source of the Chalukou Mo deposit, which is located on the western margin of the Xing'an block, we recognized and studied period of Neoproterozoic magmatism and a suite of Early Paleozoic volcanic rocks in this ore district. The magmatic zircons of quartz chlorite schist collected from the Wolegen Group yielded a concordant Pb-206/U-238 age of 685.1 +/- 4.5 Ma (MSWD = 0.21), and they show very high epsilon Hf(t) values (+ 15.5 to + 17.3) and young HI modal ages (573-664 Ma) close to the formation age, indicating that the protolith was generated during the Neoproterozoic, and was most likely derived from a depleted mantle region. This Neoproterozoic magmatism might represent an important crustal growth event within the Xing'an Block. The host wallrocks in the Chalukou deposit mainly consist of rhyolite, dacite, andesite and volcanic tuff which have undergone slight deformation and metamorphism. The results of zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating indicated that they were generated during 472-475 Ma. The results of whole-rock geochemical analysis indicate that they have arc-affinity featuref. characterized by LREE enrichment with moderate to strong fractionation between LREE and HREE (Law Yb-N = 7.7-13.6), intense negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.36-0.71), pronounced positive Ba, Th, U, Pb and Le anomalies and negative Nb-Ta, P and Ti anomalies. Hf isotopes show various epsilon Hf (t) values ranging from -2.0 tc +5.9 and slightly old two-stage model ages ranging from 1070 Ma to 1573 Ma. Combined with discrimination diagrams, these data indicate that they were derived from the partial melting of a slightly older lower crust with the addition of a juvenile crust component in an active continental margin setting related to the subduction ol the Paleo-Asian Ocean between the Xing'an and Songliao blocks. The existence of Neoproterozoic magmatic activity and Mesoproterozoic lower crustal materials obtained from the Hf model ages of the Paleozoic volcanic rocks in the Chalukou ore district demonstrated that Precambrian basement exists in the Xing'an Block, but it: distribution area may be limited. As the largest porphyry Mo deposit in China, the ore-forming materials might have multiple sources, considering the long-term and multiple magmatic events that occurred under different tectonic settings in the ore district. The previous modification and refertilization of the lower crust and/or lithospheric mantle by the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean might be important in the generation of the fertile lower crust, which is the direct source of the ore-related porphyries.

AB The East Xing'an-Mongolian Orogenic Belt (EXOB) in China hosts numerous porphyry Mo deposits that are associated with calc-alkaline granitic intrusions. Here we report the trace-element compositions of zircon grains from 11 intrusions collected from 8 porphyry Mo deposits in the EXOB: the superlarge-sized Daheishan and Luming deposits; the large-sized Aolunhua deposit; the medium-sized Kulitu and Yangchang deposits; and the small-sized Erbadi, Hashitu, and Longtoushan deposits. The results show a positive correlation between the Mo tonnage of each deposit and the zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio of the ore-related intrusions. In addition, the Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio of zircon in ore-related intrusions is much higher than that of the associated barren rocks. The Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios of 300, 200 and 100 of zircon seem to separate the intrusions into superlarge-sized, large-sized, medium-sized and small-sized porphyry Mo deposits, respectively. Oxygen fugacity values of Delta FMQ +2 of ore-related intrusions discriminate the medium-sized to superlarge-sized Mo deposits from the small-sized deposits. The relationship between the scale of mineralization and oxygen fugacity suggests that the oxidation condition of the source magma played a critical role in the development of large-sized and superlarge-sized Mo porphyry systems in the EXOB. The zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios of ore-related intrusions of the EXOB are similar to those of porphyry Cu deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and the Yulong copper belt, but much lower than those of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposit in Chile.

AB The Lesser Xing'an Range-Zhangguangcai Range metallogenic belt, located at the eastern segment of the Centra Asian metallogenic domain, hosts two giant Mo porphyry deposits, the Early Jurassic Luming deposit and the Middle Jurassic Daheishan deposit. In this study, the He-Ar and S isotopic compositions of sulfides from differen, hydrothermal stages of the Daheishan and Luming deposits were determined. Fluid inclusions hosted in pyrite: shown that He-3/He-4 ratios of the Luming and Daheishan deposit range from 0.02 to 0.32 Ra, and 0.7 to 2.5 Ra respectively. Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios of the Luming and Daheishan deposit range from 313.3 to 535.1, and 309.9 tc 360.6, respectively. He and Ar isotopic compositions suggest that the ore-forming fluids of the turning deposi are mainly crustal-derived fluids, with near atmospheric Ar and crustal He values. Mantle-derived fluids are z minor component. In contrast, the ore-forming fluids of the Daheishan deposit are a mixture between a crust derived fluid and a mantle-derived fluid. The 834S values of the sulfide samples from the Luming deposi (4.98-7.14%o) and the Daheishan deposit (1.83-2.88960) indicate that the sulfur in the ore-forming fluids wa: primarily derived from granitic magma. The isotopic compositions across the stages within one deposit have nc variability. The similar He-Ar and S isotopic compositions of the sulfides from the different Mo-bearing by drothermal stages of these two giant Mo deposits indicate that the overprinting of the multiple stages of Mo bearing hydrothermal fluids may be a key factor in the formation of giant porphyry Mo deposits. Meanwhile, the westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate might have played an important role for the formation of the giant Mo deposits in the Lesser Xing'an Range-Zhangguangcai Range metallogenic belt.

Five molybdenite samples define a Re-Os isochron age of 194.0 +/- 2.0 Ma, suggesting that mineralization was associated with emplacement of the Beishan monzogranitic pluton. Monzogranite samples are classified as high-K calc-alkaline and are relatively enriched in light rare earth elements, depleted in heavy rare earth elements, Nb, Ba, P, Sr, Ti, and Zr, and yield negative Eu anomalies. These characteristics are interpreted to record fractional crystallization of the parental magmas. Zircon (epsilon Hf)(t) values for Beishan monzogranite samples range from + 8.2 to + 15.9, and two-stage model ages (T-DM2) range from 217 to 711 Ma, indicating that the parental magma was produced during partial melting of juvenile lower crust. Combined with previous studies, our data suggest that the Dongfengbeishan porphyry Mo deposit was associated with westward subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate in the Early Jurassic.

AB The the Donggebi porphyry Mo deposit in the eastern section of the Eastern Tianshan Orogenic Belt in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt contains Mo metal reserves of 0.5 Mt. The deposit is hosted in Early Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks, namely; metasandstone, meta-sandy mudstone. Multiple hydrothermal activities have resulted in propylitic, phyllic, and argillic alteration in this deposit. Four stages (I-IV) of hydrothermal activity are identified. Stage I is represented by a mineral assemblage of K-feldspar, quartz and wolframite. Stage II consists of quartz + magnetite +pyrite chalcopyrite veinlets/veins with phyllic halos. Stage III consists of quartz + molybdenite + pyrite galena sphalerite chalcopyrite veins that are commonly related to phyllic alteration in the altered rocks. Stage IV has an assemblage of calcite + gypsum. Molybdenite mainly occurs in Stages III. Re-Os dating results for molybdenite samples from these two stages yielded an isochron age of 234.2 +/- 1.6 Ma (2o, MSWD = 0.25, n = 8). Porphyritic granites have a SIMS U-Pb zircon age of 236 Ma and it was probably related to the Triassic felsic magmatism in this area. Values of delta S-34 of sulfides range from 1.5%0 to 3.8%o, with an average value of 2.81 2.24%o (n = 22), reflecting a deep sulfur source. Most molybdenite samples have high delta S-34 values (>= 3.36%0) relative to other sulfide minerals (i.e., pyrite and chalcopyrite) of Stages I to III (delta S-34 = 1.5-3.8%o, n = 18). Based on the geological history and spatial-temporal distribution of the granitoids, it is proposed that the Mo deposits in the eastern part of the East Tianshan Orogenic Belt formed in a post-collision extensional setting in the Early Mesozoic.

AB The Zhengguang Au-Zn deposit is a large epithermal deposit adjacent to the Tangshan and the Duobaoshan porphyry Cu deposits in the Duobaoshan ore field, NE China. The host rocks mainly consist of andesite, andesitic tuff, and volcanic breccia. There are also many diorite dikes and subvolcanic rocks, including dacite porphyry and andesite porphyry. This contribution presents the zircon U-Pb ages, whole rock elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions and zircon in situ Hf isotopic data for volcanic and subvolcanic rocks at Zhengguang. The dating results show that there are at least three episodes of magmatic events in the Zhengguang area: first, the extrusion of main host andesite of the Duobaoshan Formation ( > 490 Ma); second, the emplacement of copious andesitic dikes (490-470 Ma); and finally, early Silurian intermediate magmatic activity (440-436 Ma). The dacite porphyry emplaced at 480 Ma has relatively high Si02 (63.5-64.7 wt%) and Sr (250-324 ppm) content, low Yb (0.59-0.67 ppm) and Y (5.65-6.63 ppm) content, and low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7026-0.7031), suggesting an adakitic affinity. Given the positive eNd(t) values ( + 6.1 to + 7.1), eHf(t) values ( + 7.5 to + 13.5), high Mg# values (61-62), slightly high content of Cr (87.7-92.6 ppm), and Ni (37.6-46.9 ppm), we propose that the porphyry was derived from partial melting of subducted slabs of the Paleo-Asian oceanic plate with input from the mantle wedge during the ascent. The intermediate rocks can be divided into low Mg-andesitic rocks (LMAR, Mg# 33-54, Cr 14-144 ppm, and Ni 4-39 ppm) that originated from partial melting of the juvenile lower crust underplated by the mantle wedge -derived magma and high Mg-andesitic rocks (HMAR, Mg# 58-76, Cr 217-774 ppm, and Ni 81-419 ppm) derived from the partial melting of the slab fluid-metasomatic mantle wedge. The statistics of TOMS of zircon Hf suggest that certain amounts of Neoproterozoic (particularly 800-600 Ma) continental crust growth were involved in the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), as evidenced in the Zhengguang area. Based on the geological relationship and mineralization style, we suggest that the Zhengguang deposit is an intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposit formed at ca. 480 Ma in a continental arc setting. Our work shows that Zhengguang is the oldest epithermal deposit in the CAOB and the oldest intermediate sulfidation (IS) epithermal deposit in the world. The identification of these characteristics is important for better understanding epithermal deposits in China and will add new insights about prospecting IS deposits in similar tectonic settings, especially in the CAOB.

AB The Duobaoshan porphyry Cu deposit (2.37 Mt Cu @ 0.47%; 73.4 tons Au @ 0.144 g/t and 80,000 tons Mo @ 0.016%) is located in the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Mineralization mainly occurs in the granodiorite and Ordovician volcanic rocks, and SIMS zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the ore-forming granodiorite porphyry emplaced at around 477 Ma. In addition, whole-rock major and trace element compositions show that the granodiorite porphyry belongs to a high-K to medium-K calc-alkaline series and has an affinity of adakitic rocks with high Sr, and low Y and Yb. Granodiorite porphyry samples are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), and are depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE). Their geochemical natures show a high Ni content (average 45.5 ppm) and Mg-# value (average 46). The granodiorite porphyry shows very low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (from 0.70279 to 0.70414) and low 8180 (mean = +5.38%o), very high epsilon(Nd)(t) values (mean = + 4.7) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values (mean = + 12.11), and very young two-stage Hf and Nd model ages (average 765 Ma and 827 Ma, respectively). Given that the ore-related intrusions are coeval with the high-Mg diorites and and esites in the region, it is proposed that both the ore-related granodiorite porphyry and granodiorite were derived from melting of a thickened juvenile mafic lower crust, which was induced by underplating of melts from a depleted mantle wedge above a subduction zone. A certain proportion of slab melts may also have been involved in the magmas that produced ore-related intrusions.

AB The Bilihe gold deposit in Inner Mongolia is situated in the Central Asian Metallogenic Domain. Its major ore body II is a porphyry-type body, spatially and temporally associated with granodiorite porphyry and granite aplite. In this study, the timing of gold mineralization is precisely constrained by using the zircon U-Pb dating for pre-mineralization intrusions and the molybdenite Re-Os dating for later molybdenite veins. Furthermore, zircon lif-O isotope analyses have also been carried out to decipher the nature of primary magma. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that the granodiorite porphyry and the granite aplite were emplaced at 269 +/- 2 Ma and 270 +/- 2 Ma, respectively, indicating the gold mineralization occurring no earlier than 269 Ma. Meanwhile, molybdenite veins are developed within the fractures and commonly cut across the auriferous veins. Thus, combined with a molybdenite Re-Os isochron age of 268 +/- 1 Ma, the gold mineralization in the Bilihe deposit can be precisely restricted to ca. 269 Ma. Zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values are mostly positive (1.6-11.3), along with high 5180 values of 6.20-7.63%o, suggesting a mixed source between mantle materials and ancient continental crust (such as the Bainaimiao Group) for the Bilihe magma. It is also supported by the presence of the captured detrital zircons in these intrusions. Given a universally metallogenic environment for porphyry gold deposits, a thicken crustal setting related to the collisional intermission of the Paleo-Asian Ocean is favored to interpret the formation setting of the Bilihe deposit.

   METHOD; DIFFUSION; SCHEMES
AB Partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces appear in many applications throughout the natural and applied sciences. The classical closest point method (Ruuth and Merriman (2008) [17]) is an embedding method for solving PDEs on surfaces using standard finite difference schemes. In this paper, we formulate an explicit closest point method using finite difference schemes derived from radial basis functions (RBF-FD). Unlike the orthogonal gradients method (Piret (2012) [22]), our proposed method uses RBF centers on regular grid nodes. This formulation not only reduces the computational cost but also avoids the ill-conditioning from point clustering on the surface and is more natural to couple with a grid based manifold evolution algorithm (Leung and Zhao (2009) [26]). When compared to the standard finite difference discretization of the closest point method, the proposed method requires a smaller computational domain surrounding the surface, resulting in a decrease in the number of sampling points on the surface. In addition, higher-order schemes can easily be constructed by increasing the number of points in the RBF-FD stencil. Applications to a variety of examples are provided to illustrate the numerical convergence of the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose and validate a novel extension of Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods to meshes featuring curved elements. HHO methods are based on discrete unknowns that are broken polynomials on the mesh and its skeleton. We propose here the use of physical frame polynomials over mesh elements and reference frame polynomials over mesh faces. With this choice, the degree of face unknowns must be suitably selected in order to recover on curved meshes the same convergence rates as on straight meshes. We provide an estimate of the optimal face polynomial degree depending on the element polynomial degree and on the so-called effective mapping order. The estimate is numerically validated through specifically crafted numerical tests. All test cases are conducted considering two- and three-dimensional pure diffusion problems, and include comparisons with discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. The extension to agglomerated meshes with curved boundaries is also considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Water withdrawn from lakes is one of pathways to support economic development in China. Yet lake water withdrawals, especially through unauthorized behaviors, have not been accurately quantified. Here we proposed a coupled simulation-optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from Lake Dianchi (the sixth largest freshwater lake in China) and assessed their impacts on lake hydrology. Together the results of systematic observations, on-site surveys, and local statistics reveal that lake water withdrawals played a non negligible role in lake water budget, accounting for 19.6% of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999-2011. Most water withdrawal events occurred from April to October when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened. Lake water withdrawals reshuffled water budget components of the lake itself, leading to a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly-polluted return flows, which might further intensify local lake eutrophication and downstream water scarcity. In the light of the importance for sustainable water management, we suggest that a new and expanding monitoring network across China's lakes to understand the process of lake water withdrawals would be beneficial to meet water demands without compromising lake ecosystems.

AB Understanding the metal dynamics in natural waters is critical to assessing the process and flow pathways that deliver these constituents to the stream network. Metal dynamics can be addressed by an analysis of concentration-discharge relationship across a large spectrum of hydrological conditions. However, metal-discharge responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events. In this study, a detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops exhibited by metal concentration-discharge relationship was undertaken to assess the Al, Fe, Mn and Cu dynamics and factors controlling changes in metal concentrations in a small scale rural catchment. Metal (sediment-associated and dissolved) concentrations were measured at high temporal resolution during storm events in a small rural headwater catchment in Galicia (NW Spain). Hysteresis analysis indicated a contrasting concentration-discharge dynamic for sediment-associated and dissolved metals, highlighting a strong decoupling between the two due to their different sources or delivery pathways. For sediment associated metals, clockwise hysteresis (56%) was the predominant pattern, highlighting the rapid sediment associated metal mobilisation via surface runoff from sources located near the stream channel. In contrast, dissolved metal showed predominantly anticlockwise hysteresis (58% of storm events), emphasising the role of subsurface flow and soil leaching processes. The different flushing mechanisms between sediment-associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export.

AB Water-oriented forest management is an urgent need in semiarid catchments. In the case of low-biomass forests and shrublands, the magnitude, efficiency and temporal duration of thinning effects on rainfall partitioning needs further attention. This work studies the effects of juvenile thinning and shrub clearing on stemflow (Stf), throughfall (Thr) and interception (It) in two low-biomass forests (CAL: post-fire Aleppo pine saplings with 74% of basal area, BA, removed; and HU: evergreen oak coppice with 41% of BA removed), as well as the relative contribution of the event meteorology. The effects are compared with a control plot during the first 3-4 years. Stf rate (%) decreased with density and, on a tree scale, it was enhanced by the treatment only in the bigger oaks. Event Thr increased from 55 to 81% and from 68 to 86% of gross rainfall (Pg) for CAL and HU respectively after thinning, resulting in about 15% less intercepted Pg. High evaporative conditions and an open (ventilated) forest structure led to high It rates in the controls when comparing with other studies, thus making the treatments more efficient in net precipitation (Pn) gain (Pg intercepted decreased 17% or 2.3% per unit of LAI or BA removed respectively). In general, depths (mm) were mostly explained (> 75%) by the rainfall characteristics of the event (e.g. amount, duration, intensity), with a limited contribution from forest structure (e.g. cover, LAI) and event meteorology (e.g. temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit). On the contrary, when expressed as rates (% of Pg), forest structure and event-meteorology gained importance (explaining 25-65%), especially in the drier site (CAL). In this site, the low gain in Pn (similar to 25 mm per year on average) was offset with no temporal dampening during the span of this study, as observed in the wetter site (HU), where plant growth tended to mitigate the effect of the treatment by the end of the study. The results presented here make a contribution to a better understanding of the effects of water-oriented forest management in low-biomass semiarid forests.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought could be increasing with global warming. When drought occurs, the runoff generation process and the precipitation-runoff relationship might change. In this study, the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years was systematically investigated in the largest freshwater lake basin of China, namely, the Poyang Lake Basin. The results showed that the precipitation-runoff relationship changed significantly (p < 0.05) in drought years. The annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24.1% compared with that in non-drought years. The decreased magnitude of runoff coefficient had a significant positive relationship (p < 0.01) with the drought severity, i.e., the standardized precipitation index of the year. Two hydrological models calibrated by the objective function Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency significantly overestimated runoff in drought years. Three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations significantly improved the accuracy of runoff simulation in drought years. Therefore, we recommend that the selected objective functions for runoff simulation in drought years should be sensitive to low flow simulations. Otherwise, the water resources availability will be overestimated in drought years.

AB Understanding the combined and separate effects of climate and land use change on the water cycle is necessary to mitigate negative impacts. However, existing methodologies typically divide data into discrete (before and after) periods, implicitly representing climate and land use as step changes when in reality these changes are often gradual. Here, we introduce a new regression-based methodological framework designed to separate climate and land use effects on any hydrological flux of interest continuously through time, and estimate uncertainty in the contribution of these two drivers. We present two applications in the Yahara River Watershed (Wisconsin, USA) demonstrating how our approach can be used to understand synergistic or antagonistic relationships between land use and climate in either the past or the future: (1) historical streamflow, baseflow, and quickflow in an urbanizing subwatershed; and (2) simulated future evapotranspiration, drainage, and direct runoff from a suite of contrasting climate and land use scenarios for the entire watershed. In the historical analysis, we show that 60% of recent streamflow changes can be attributed to climate, with approximately equal contributions from quickflow and baseflow. However, our continuous method reveals that baseflow is significantly increasing through time, primarily due to land use change and potentially influenced by long-term increases in groundwater storage. In the simulation of future changes, we show that all components of the future water balance will respond more strongly to changes in climate than land use, with the largest potential land use effects on drainage. These results indicate that diverse land use change trajectories may counteract each other while the effects of climate are more homogeneous at watershed scales. Therefore, management opportunities to counteract climate change effects will likely be more effective at smaller spatial scales, where land use trajectories are unidirectional.

AB While remotely-sensed data reveal enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate, how such vegetation dynamics could alter regional hydrology is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how changes in leaf area index (LAI) and climatic variability alter long-term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and soil moisture (SM) over the conterminous United States (CONUS) during the period 1983-2009 by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with transient remotely-sensed LAI inputs. Factor-controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long-term trends and inter-annual fluctuations of water fluxes, other factors (temperature, LAI, and atmospheric CO2) make significant contributions to long-term trends, particularly over specific regions. Changes in LAI result in minor overall contributions to the inter -annual variability of ET, R, and SM over the CONUS as a whole; however, they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions, such as the Midwest. Furthermore, changing LAI is the second most important factor in controlling variability in ET and SM, particularly over the cool season. Anomalies of LAI during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases result in no significant correlations with anomalies in R and SM, but result in positive correlations with ET, indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales.

AB Changing climate, especially extreme weather event, is exerting considerable impacts on the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in forests worldwide. A deep understanding of climate change terrestrial feedbacks is essential to predict future regional/global carbon and water budgets, which can be used to develop potential strategies for forest management. In this study, totally 11 years of eddy covariance tower measurements of CO2 and H2O fluxes, as well as the relevant environmental variables were analyzed to reveal the effects of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology, carbon sequestration and ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) dynamics in a humid temperate deciduous forest. Warmer spring temperatures altered the phenological phases with the green-up date advanced approximately 3.5 days per degrees C, and the extended growing season of about 3 days per degrees C, reaching the peak in 2012. Because of spring temperature anomaly, the shift from carbon source to sink occurred nearly 40 days earlier than usual. But the abnormal carbon dynamics happened during the peak growth period. Correlation analyses indicated that the amount of precipitation dominantly controlled the capacity of forest carbon sequestration (NEP) in this area. Therefore, the subsequent water scarcity owing to the extremely dry summer together with heatwave severely decreased the forest NEP by about 64.1%. Further analyses implied that the sharp reduction in gross primary production (GPP) rather than ecosystem respiration (Re) resulted to the decrease in NEP. Both GPP and evatranspiration (ET) were larger during the springtime in 2012 than those at adjacent years. But severe summer drought reduced the ecosystem WUE and yielded the lowest GPP and ET. Further work must focus on improving the recognition of forest feedback to climate systems.

AB Flood modelling in data-sparse regions have been always limited to empirical, statistical or geomorphic approaches that are suitable to produce regional hazard maps. Such coarse resolution maps are not adapted for basin-scale applications, small to medium sized basins (< 1000 km(2)), especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels of a particular event is required and hence cannot replace the hydrological/hydraulic modelling. The latter is a challenging task in data-sparse regions characterized by floods of typical duration times of a few hours which offer little opportunity for real-time recording by traditional rain-gauge networks, remote sensing or satellite imaging. Such data sparseness is not always compatible with the resolution, in both space and time, of the hydrological and hydraulic models. We propose a framework for flood modelling using sparse data from a coupled hydrological-hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post-event measurements in space. The approach is applied to the Awali river basin (301 km(2)), in Lebanon, particularly to simulate the investigated early January 2013 extreme flood event, which is considered one of the largest events in the last three decades. The hydrological model was calibrated and evaluated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow parameter ranges and uncertainty was performed with Monte Carlo simulations for these parameter ranges. The hydraulic model, based on a fine resolution DEM, was simulated using hydrological outflows and validated with 27 post-event measurements in space of high water marks. The resulting outflow values were satisfactory, and uncertainty was reduced when compared with arbitrarily wide parameter ranges. The hydrological model performance was highly variable but for the hydraulic model, 93% of the observed water levels fall within the simulated uncertainty bounds with an RMSE error of 0.26 m. The proposed framework allows mapping the possible inundation and can be compared to other approaches dealing with model complexity and associated performances.

AB Understanding the velocity distribution of shallow water flow along hill-slope is of great significance in soil erosion studies. This study proposes a method to estimate the steady flow velocity and the distance when water flow reaches stability, using hill-slope flow velocity distribution data along a simulated rill measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method. Laboratory experiments were performed using a flume of 12 m long, 0.1 m wide and 0.3 m height under five slope gradients (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25) and four flow discharges (2, 4, 8 and 16 L min(-1)). The electrolyte tracer pulse method was employed to measure the flow velocities at locations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 m from the inlet of the flowing water. The flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method served as a control. The results showed that the flow velocities measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method initially accelerated and then reached a steady value. An equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of the measurement distance was established. The flow velocities calculated by the equation agreed well with those measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method. The determination (R-2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) were greater than 0.800, except for a few cases. In addition, the equation established in this study was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies. The steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under different slope gradients and flow discharges were determined by this equation. When the differences between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity were very small, that is, 5% and 10%, the steady distances ranged from 2.239 m to 4.772 m and from 2.843 m to 6.059 m, respectively. By comparing the steady flow velocities with the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method, the results indicated that the steady flow velocities were 0.702-0.735 times that of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges. A linear function existed between the two, and the regressed parameter k (i.e., 0.718) could be used as the correction factor between the two. In general, the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of the steady flow velocity.

AB Predicting the evolution of concentration distribution of environmental transport in wetland flows has a broad range of applications in ecological engineering practice. By extending a previous study, the spatial concentration distribution of solute transport due to an instantaneous environmental emission in a wetland channel with rectangular cross-section is presented in this work by means of Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique. To account for the effect of high order moment, skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution is analyzed. Two important parameters, i.e., aspect ratio (depth to width) and damping factor, on the dispersion process are discussed. Four studied cases illustrated that the transverse concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time and the aspect ratio can affect the transverse concentration distribution greatly. The cross-sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetrical in the initial stage and shows an asymptotic Gaussian distribution at large time. The dispersion process in a thick (width equals depth) wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin wetland channel. The spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral-sidewall-effect on a large time scale for environmental transport in a thin wetland channel.

AB Sustainable water resources management in arid and semi-arid areas needs robust models, which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling. This issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation. For this purpose, this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model, namely the logistic model tree (LMT) and compares it with state-of-the-art models such as the support vector machine and C4.5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater springs. A spring location dataset consisting of 359 springs was provided by field surveys and national reports and from which three different sample data sets (S1-S3) were randomly prepared (70% for training and 30% for validation). Additionally, 16 spring-related factors were analyzed using regression logistic analysis to find which factors play a significant role in spring occurrence. Twelve significant geo-environmental and morphometric factors were identified and applied in all models. The accuracy of models was evaluated by three different threshold-dependent and -Independent methods including efficiency (E), true skill statistic (TSS), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) methods. Results showed that the LMT model had the highest accuracy performance for all three validation datasets (E-mean = 0.860, TSSmean = 0.718, AUC-ROCmean = 0.904); although a slight sensitivity to change in input data was sometimes observed for this model. Furthermore, the findings showed that relative slope position (RSP) was the most important factor followed by distance from faults and lithology.

AB The permeability of deep-seated reservoirs and aquifers usually changes with formation pressure; however, the widely used analytical method assumes constant permeability, resulting in significant errors in flow rate prediction. This work extended the conventional analytical method to consider the effect of stress-sensitive permeability. The proposed analytical method was validated by comparing analytical flow-rate solutions for vertical wells with numerical flow-rate solutions. The production rates of a multi-stage fractured horizontal (MSFH) well with and without the effect of stress-sensitive permeability were obtained. A field case of an MSFH well was used to test the applicability of the proposed analytical method. It was found that the stress-sensitive effect negatively affected production rates of the MSFH well for the whole flow period, increasing with increasing drawdown pressure and permeability modulus. The proposed method is appropriate for various well types and reservoir scenarios. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method can be employed to obtain more accurate production rates with little increase in the computational time.

AB The Cevennes-Vivarais (France) is a region prone to heavy precipitation events and flash floods occurring mainly during the autumn season. Due to this vulnerability, it is a well instrumented region to monitor rainfall (4 weather radars of the French ARAMIS radar network, 200 hourly raingauges) and river discharge (45 stations). A multiscale radar-raingauge rainfall re-analysis from 10 to 300 km(2) and 1 h time step has been established for the period 2007-2014 by using the kriging with external drift (KED) technique. In the present work, a quantification of the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties in distributed rainfall-runoff simulations is presented for 10 km(2)-1 h model resolution. For this purpose the following methodology is implemented: (1) Development of a distributed hydrological model based on the Curve Number and the Unit Hydrograph concepts for the Ardeche and Gardon catchments; (2) Generation of an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields based on the KED error standard deviations and the space-time structure of the residuals to the drift. (3) Generation of so-called behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological model based on generalized sensitive analysis (GSA) and the use of discharge observations; (4) Implementation of the hydrological model for gauged and ungauged catchments with the radar-raingauge rainfall ensembles and the various parameter sets. Uncertainties in rainfall and runoff simulations are then quantified in terms of coefficient of variation. The main findings reveal that (i) the precipitation uncertainty is dampened in the hydrological simulation, especially as long as the size of the watershed increases; in the considered context, the model uncertainty dominates the precipitation uncertainty and it is shown to be independent on catchment size.

AB Whether the spatial variation and influence of rock fragment contents (RFCs) on soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs) should be jointly considered in the soil water simulation have been less investigated in previous studies. In this study, we tested whether considering these factors were necessary in the soil water simulation on a representative stony-soil hillslope located in Taihu Lake Basin, China. Five schemes of SHPs in HYDRUS-3D model were established. They were (i) MultiRFHet: spatially varied SHPs extracted from Dumer's multimodal retention function based on the observed soil water retention data; (ii) RosHom: spatially uniformed SHPs derived from ROSETTA; (iii) RosHet: spatially varied SHPs derived from ROSETTA; (iv) RosFtFCHom: spatially uniformed SHPs derived from ROSETTA and adjusted by RFCs; (v) RosRFCHet: spatially varied SHPs derived from ROSETTA and adjusted by RFCs. Results indicated when the spatial variation and influence of RFCs on SHPs were both considered (MultiRFHet and RosRFCHet), acceptable accuracies (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency or NSE 0.58 for MultiRFHet and > 0.17 for RosRFCHet) were achieved in simulating the soil water storage (SWS) variation. Since the MultiRFHet required the calibration by the observed soil water retention data, RosRFCHet was a good alternative in the simulation. On the contrary, the SHPs acquired without considering neither the RFCs nor the spatial variation yielded unacceptable simulation results (NSE general < 0). This demonstrated that spatial variation and influence of RFCs on SHPs should be included in the SWS simulation on this stony-soil hillslope, although it had limited effect in subsurface flow simulation.

AB Studying the spatial and temporal variations of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values (delta D and delta O-18, respectively) in precipitation and groundwater in catchments with different land cover is of great significance to understanding the hydrologic cycles within the catchments. This study is focused on three karst catchments, Banzhai, Chenqi and Dengzhanhe, in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, a region with a subtropical humid monsoon climate. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in the SD and delta O-18 of precipitation and groundwater in these areas from September 2007 to September 2009. Local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) for the study areas and their relationships with groundwater were established. The seasonal variations of 8121 and delta O-18 for both precipitation and groundwater were similar, being depleted in the heavier isotopomer in the rainy season and enriched in the heavier isotopomer in the dry season. The similarity of patterns between groundwater and precipitation indicates short groundwater residence times in the three catchments, typical of karst terrains. The isotopic values of the Banzhai catchment, which is covered by a thin soil layer beneath virgin forest floor, had the largest variation among the three catchments. The isotopic compositions of the Banzhai catchment groundwater were close to those of precipitation in the rainy season and responded rapidly to it, indicating that precipitation quickly recharges groundwater in this area. In comparison, in the Chenqi and Dengzhanhe catchments, the thicker soil layers and large numbers of paddy fields and dry lands in the catchments resulted in more intense evaporation, and therefore relatively higher isotopic values in the infiltration water. Consequently, the isotopic values of spring water in these two areas were higher and varied to a lesser extent in the rainy season than those of precipitation. The Rayleigh fractionation model based on the correlation between the deuterium excess (d) and evaporation was employed in this study. The model calculation results showed that the catchment evaporation was more intense in Dengzhanhe than in Chenqi, with 14 +/- 1% and 6 +/- 4% of the water evaporated in Dengzhanhe and Chenqi, respectively. The higher percentage of evaporation in Dengzhanhe was mainly due to the larger percentage of paddy fields in the catchment. In contrast, the effects of evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces on groundwater in the virgin forest-covered Banzhai catchment were extremely weak. Based on the isotopic and high-resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data, the transpiration rates were estimated to be 78% for Banzhai, 10 +/- 4% for Chenqi, and 24 +/- 1% for Dengzhanhe, and the differences among these values are mainly attributed to differences in vegetation types in those areas. These results show that the variation in stable isotopes in groundwater can be used as a key index in evaluating the effects of different land cover changes and environmental changes on the water cycle in a catchment.

AB Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable. Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular. However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable populations, which can be combined to achieve an Integrated Economic Vulnerability Index (IEVI). The methodology deployed here was conducted in Castilla y Leon (northwest Spain; 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis. Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the IEVI. Tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the IEVI, whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that IEVI scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.

AB The one-dimensional advective-dispersive-reactive transport equation has been widely applied to describe the transportation process of landfill leachate through liners or anti-seepage curtains. However, most existing methods solving this problem are limited to simple initial conditions. In order to eliminate these limitations, homotopy analysis method (HAM) is implemented to solve the contaminant transport model in this paper. Applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator, zero order deformation equation is developed to solve contaminant transport problems numerically, with smooth initial conditions and variable source concentration being considered. HAM has been applied to simulate different contamination transport problems in one-dimensional space reported in literature. Good agreement between HAM solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered, demonstrating the feasibility of HAM to solve the contaminant transport model with more general, smooth initial conditions.

AB The evolution of the channel thalweg and pool-riffle sequences is a critical feature of morphological adjustments in fluvial systems and might have important effects on aquatic habitat quality, channel stability and navigation. Based on the 220 cross-sectional profiles from 2002 to 2016, residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were used to quantitatively analyse the vertical variations and longitudinal distribution of the pool-riffle sequences and channel thalweg in the Yichang-Chenglingji Reach (YCR) of the Middle Yangtze River, which consists of the Yizhi-Zhijiang, Shashi-Gongan and Shishou-Jianli sub-reaches. The results showed that the dramatic reduction in the sediment loads following the construction of the Three Gorges Darn (TGD) has caused significant adjustments in the size, morphological diversity and spatial distribution of pool-riffle structures in the YCR. The average depth of the pools in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach and the Shishou-Jianli Reach overall exhibited a nonlinear growth trend, with the average residual depth increasing by 1.4 m and 1.9 m, respectively. However, the average residual depth in the Shashi-Gongan Reach showed a decreasing trend, with a reduction of approximately 1.2 m. The longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches contracted to different degrees, and the specific percentage of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles (total riffle length/total sub-reach length) decreased by 8%, 9.6% and 5.9% in the three sub-reaches from upstream to the downstream. In addition, the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the Shashi-Gongan Reach and Shishou-Jianli Reach weakened after the construction of the TGD, while the bed topography in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach became more complex and diverse. Moreover, the pool-riffle structures in the YCR were rearranged and distributed regularly following the initiation of the TGD operation, although the variation characteristics of the average pool spacing in the three sub-reaches were quite different. Quantitative relationship between the average residual depth and the previous four-year hydrological condition was proposed for the three sub-reaches based on the Delayed Response Model (DRM) and verified using the measurements from 2013 to 2016.

AB This study presents an investigation of probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables (including precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) and the potential links to large-scale atmospheric circulation over Baden-Wurttemberg, Southwest Germany. First, the joint dependence between seasonal streamflow and hydroclimatic variables was established by using copulas. On the basis of the joint dependence structure, we estimated the probabilities of hydrological droughts and prolonged high-streamflow events conditioned upon two different scenarios (high and low) of hydroclimatic variables for various seasons over the study area. The results indicate that both precipitation and soil moisture are positively related to the streamflow variation in Baden-Wiirttemberg for each season and strongly impact the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high-streamflow events. Temperature tends to have less impact on the streamflow variation, and an inverse connection between streamflow and temperature is found in spring and summer. Then, the connections between streamflow variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation in summer and winter were explored by using composite analysis. Although the atmospheric circulation patterns vary in each season, it can be found that in summer high streamflow anomalies over Baden-Wiirttemberg are related to a cyclonic activity over central Europe while low streamflow anomalies are linked to anticyclonic patterns over western Ireland. The high streamflow anomalies in winter are strongly impacted by the westerlies that play an important role in favoring warm and moist airstreams from the Atlantic Ocean towards the study area, while an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies. The presented probabilistic methodology could also be applied in other regions worldwide.

AB Water saving irrigation systems (e.g. drip and sprinkler) conserve water but they can reduce potential groundwater recharge (PGR) over traditional systems (e.g. furrow) and may impair sustainability, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This study used a hybrid (experimental and numerical) approach to determine the effects of different irrigation systems on the dynamics of PGR in a semi-arid region. A 210-cm tall, 300-cm long and 150-cm wide soil column was prepared to simulate the soil environment of the Karaj region in Iran. A range of soil and environmental properties were monitored during a winter wheat cropping season (similar to 140 days) under different irrigation systems (treatments). Soil water content and drainage were measured under each irrigation system and these were used to a) calculate different components of water balance and b) model long-term soil water flow dynamics using HYDRUS-1D. About 14.83, 0.14 and 0.80% of the applied water (as irrigation and precipitation) under furrow, drip and sprinkler systems, respectively, were drained below 200 cm and this was estimated as the PGR. Annual PGR under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19-228 mm, with an average of 111.3 mm. However, mean annual PGR under the sprinkler (4.1 mm) and drip (0.7 mm) was an order of magnitude lower than furrow irrigation. Deep drainage leading to PGR under the water saving methods was observed only after a very large rainfall event. The absence of large rainfall events between irrigations reduced PGR under water-saving irrigation systems in the arid and semi-arid region. The simulated model was further used to estimate the total amount of PGR over a 20-year period of wheat cultivation. Furrow irrigation estimated much higher amounts of PGR (222.7 cm) over drip and sprinkler systems; this raised questions about the sustainability of water-saving irrigation methods in the study area. As groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these areas, the recharge capacity of the adopted methods is critical to ensure the future availability and use of groundwater in the Karaj region of Iran as well as similar arid and semi-arid regions elsewhere.

AB Short-term power generation operation is an important content in the hydropower station management. Because of the limitation of forecast accuracy, there is error between the forecasted runoff process and actual runoff process. When the hydropower station operation is near the water level boundaries, such as normal water level or dead water level, this error is likely to bring the risk of water abandoning or output shortage. In order to precisely evaluate the near-boundary operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error, a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model was proposed in this paper by taking the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable. The coupling of hydrological forecasting error and the short-term operation risk of hydropower station based on credibility theory was realized, and the solving process of the model based on fuzzy simulation technology was provided in detail. Different near-boundary operation risks of hydropower station can be analyzed and evaluated by the simulation with different water level combinations in this model. The high-risk area and suggested operation area of Jinxi hydropower station in different near-boundary operation situations were clearly identified in the case study. The intuitive results of this model can provide a strong technical support for the decision-making of the dispatchers when making the power generation plans in the actual production, so that to avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station, and effectively improve the efficiency of water resources utilization.

AB The large heterogeneity in soil surface conditions makes it impracticable to obtain reliable estimates of soil hydraulic parameters for areas larger than few squared kilometers. However, identifying these parameters on a global scale is essential for many hydrological and climatic applications. In this study, a new approach named Drainage from Drydown (DfD) is proposed to estimate the coefficients of drainage using soil moisture observations. DfD firstly selects multiple drydown events when surface runoff and evapotranspiration rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate. Secondly, by inverting the soil water balance equation, the drainage coefficients are obtained. Synthetic experiments are carried out in order to tune the overall procedure. DfD is then tested with in situ observations at 8 different sites worldwide characterized by different climates and soil types. The reliability of the DfD is evaluated by using the DfD drainage coefficients in a physically based soil water balance model (SWB) for simulating soil moisture and a rainfall estimation model (SM2RAIN). The results indicate that the climate and the soil conditions exert an important role in the occurrence and magnitude of drainage rate. DID is found capable of correctly identify periods in which drainage rate is the dominant process. Drainage coefficients obtained from DfD are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties based on the soil texture and land cover at each site. By using DfD drainage coefficients to estimate rainfall and soil moisture via SM2RAIN and SWB, promising results are obtained with median correlation of 0.83 and 0.91 between estimated and in situ data. However, in sites characterized by high rate of evapotranspiration ( > 700 mm/year) and low permeable soil (e.g., clay) the DfD performance is reduced. Overall, DM demonstrates the ability to decouple drainage and evapotranspiration processes and to estimate the drainage coefficients from in situ observations.

AB The Artificial Intelligence (AI) models i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) were used to statistically downscale and project rainfall data from CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for Tabriz and Ardabil synoptic stations in north west Iran. Since one of the important issues in statistical downscaling of GCMs is to select dominant variables among plenty of large-scale climate data (predictors), a predictors screening framework, which integrates Wavelet-Entropy (WE) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was developed in this study to statistically downscale mean monthly rainfall values. The advantage of proposed method is to reduce the noise and dimensionality of data as well as selecting reliable inputs of downscaling model for future rainfall projection. To this end, five GCMs (i.e., Can-ESM2, BNU-ESM, CSIRO-ACCESS1, GFDL-ESM2G and INM-CM4) were employed. ANN, LSSVM and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were trained to capture relationship between the predictors and the stations' observed rainfall values (predictand). Then, ensemble techniques were applied on the outputs of the downscaling models. The calibration, validation and projection of the proposed downscaling models were performed over the periods; Jan. 1951 to Dec. 1991, Jan. 1992 to Dec. 2005 and Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2100, respectively. The projection of rainfall for near and distant future (i.e., 2017-2050 and 2050-2100) by the proposed multi-GCM ensemble framework yielded to rainfall alteration pattern; 40-41% and 35-42% decrease at Tabriz station and 6-12% and 5-13% increase at Ardabil station under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively.

AB Turbulent bursting plays a crucial role in sediment resuspension and transportation in many shallow lakes. This study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension in regions with and without intense wind waves in Lake Taihu. Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS) were used to measure field data sets including flow velocities and intense wind waves respectively. The results showed that the intermittent bursting events contributed significantly to the processes of momentum and sediment exchanges. Turbulent bursting effectively controlled the three patterns of sediment suspension during the 512 s observation period. In the windy region, the bursting motions, i.e. "ejection" and "sweep" events mainly accounted for the Reynolds stress generation and made major contribution to sediment resuspension. While in the current-dominant region, turbulent mixing from inward and outward interactions overwhelmed other processes. The vertical sediment fluxes reduced by an order of magnitude due to the less effect of wind waves and the lack of upwelling currents. It is therefore important to study turbulent coherent structures and sediment resuspension to understand the spatio-temporal and frequency characteristics of bursting events.

AB The most distinguished characteristic of pervious concrete is its connected porosity that allows water to percolate. And the permeable capacity will decrease rapidly once the pervious concrete is clogged by the sediments. Despite the relationship between permeability and clogging is extensively researched, there is limited information about pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements. The aim of this paper is using the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method (CFD-DEM) model to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development taking into account of the porosity of pervious pavements, sediments size distribution, the horizontal runoff velocity, and the seepage velocity. Pore clogging is determined by the DA/D, ratio the equivalent diameter of aggregate particles (191) to equivalent diameter of sediments (D,). A fitted curve is utilized to depict the tendency of clogging. Sediments secondary movement is revealed. Results show that the well-graded sands is able to percolate into the depth of 30 mm in pervious pavements; coarse sands will settle on the shallow surface within depth of 20 mm in pervious pavements; and fine sands will percolate into the depth of 60-100 mm in pervious pavements. As the increase of porosity, horizontal runoff velocity, and seepage velocity, the sediments will transport into pervious pavements deeply. The cycle simulation of raining and draining shows it has limited influence to clogging.

AB The Songhua River Basin (SRB) plays a vital role in supplying water resources to northeast China. This river has a substantial effect on agricultural grain producing region. Therefore, the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of multiple hydrological models driven by bias corrected precipitation estimates from a group of General Circulation Models (GCMs). The variations in discharge obtained from multiple hydrological models were also analyzed. For this purpose, bias correction methods for GCMs and five hydrological models, lumped rainfall runoff (Nedbor Afstromnings Model (NAM), GRJ4), semi-distributed (the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP), HBV), and the distributed (Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) were used in the SRB. Before applying the bias correction method, raw GCMs were also plotted against observational data. The results revealed that none of GCM performed well against observational data. The results also showed that quantile mapping method corrects the biases of GCMs better than daily and monthly scale factors. Distributed and semi distributed hydrological models performed better than lumped rainfall runoff models in the selected study area of SRB. By forcing hydrological models with bias corrected precipitation data, the differences in the simulated discharge by SWAT, HBV, NAM, GR4J and WEAP were -3%, -2%, -4%, -7 and + 3, respectively, when compared with observed discharge. The results also show that the overall performance of SWAT, HBV, NAM, and WEAP was better than GRJ4. The results also suggest that the application of multiple hydrological models is necessary to make improvements in the planning and management of agricultural and water resources in the SRB region.

AB Multiple uncertainty sources directly cause inaccurate simulations for water related processes in complicated integrated models, as such models include many interactive modules. A majority of existing studies focus on the uncertainties of parameter and model structure, and their effects on the model performance for a single process (e.g., hydrological cycle or water quality). However, comprehensive uncertainties of different modules and their propagations are poorly understood, particularly for the integrated water system model. This study proposes a framework of uncertainty and its propagation estimation for integrated water system model (HEQM) by coupling the Bootstrap resampling method and SCE-UA auto-calibration technique. Parameter and structure uncertainties of both hydrological cycle and water quality modules are estimated, including final distributions of parameters and simulation uncertainty intervals. Additionally, the effect of uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters is investigated. Results show that: (1) HEQM simulates daily hydrograph very well with the coefficient of efficiency of 0.81, and also simulates the daily concentrations of ammonia nitrogen satisfactorily with the coefficient of efficiency of 0.50 by auto-calibration in the case study area; (2) The final ranges of all interested hydrological parameters are reduced obviously, and all the parameter distributions are well-defined and show skew. The uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation at the 95% confidence level bracket 18.7% of all the runoff observations due to uncertainties of parameter, and 86.0% due to both parameter and module structure, respectively; (3) The uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters changes the optimal values of 37.5% of interested water quality parameters, but does not obviously change the water quality simulations which match well with the prior simulations throughout the period and bracket only 1.7% of observations at the 95% confidence level. Due to the further introduction of module structure uncertainties, 94.8% of observations are bracketed, only except the extreme high and low water quality concentrations; (4) The uncertainty of water quality parameters contributes 12.1% of total water quality simulations at the 95% confidence level. The figure increases to 21.0% and 92.0% if the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters, structure uncertainties of water quality module are considered, respectively. Therefore, although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation contribute a certain proportion of the whole simulation uncertainties, the module structure itself is the primary uncertainty source for the integrated water system model (HEQM), particular for the water quality modules.

AB Flow in a karst system in Lebanon (Important water supply source; Assal Spring; discharge 0.2-2.5 m(3)/s yearly volume of 22-30 Mm(3)), which is dominated by snow and semi-arid conditions, was simulated using an integrated numerical model (Mike She, 2016). The calibrated model (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.77) is based on high resolution input data (2014-2017) and detailed catchment characterization. A sensitivity analysis of individual climatic parameters shows that spring hydrograph characteristics are most sensitive to temperature.
   A forward simulation using the IPS_cm5 model with the RCP6.0 scenario for future climate change (Global Climate Models GCM; daily downscaled bias and altitude corrected time series for Lebanon 2020-2099) unravel that precipitation, recharge, and discharge have moderate to highly significant decreasing trends with time over the 21st century. Moreover, recession flowrates are expected to drop drastically starting in the year 2070 to 11/s with shortage periods reaching up to six months. The latter is due to a temperature rise of + 1.5-2.5 degrees C and subsequent shrinking of snow cover by almost 100% (e.g., 2073-2074). Furthermore, this is accompanied by a decline in annual spring volume by 73% with respect to the current status, with real evapotranspiration consisting of up to 50% from total water budget (currently around 12-17% in 2014-2017). Moreover, decreasing snow accumulation and a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways will lead to peak spring discharges. This study allows decision makers to implement best informed practices for future water resources management especially for karst systems under semi-arid conditions in the regions.

AB Understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, multi environmental tracers (hydrochemical parameters, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive Rn-222) were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers (Tiangeli River and Nomhon River) in the Nomhon area, southeast of the arid Qaidam Basin, northwest China. Here we observed that the Rn-222 concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater > spring > river in this area. Along the Tiangeli River, the Rn-222 concentrations of groundwater, springs and river water were about 12,120-17,407, 3013-15,819 and 809-8205 Bq/m(3), respectively. This river was characterized by the high Rn-222 concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge. Along the Nomhon river, Rn-222 concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772-60,369 and 14-519 Bq/m(3), respectively. An average background of the Rn-222 concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 Bq/m(3). A high Rn-222 concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream, with a peak value of 519 Bq/m(3) and a distance about 10 km, indicating that groundwater discharged to the Nomhon River in the alluvial plain. A Rn-222 mass-balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river, showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0.37 m(3)/s in the midstream of Nomhon River during the sampling period. The stable isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) and hydrochemical characteristics (hydrochemical type, TDS and EC) showed corresponding changes along these two rivers, which also provided evidences for the groundwater-surface water interactions in the Nomhon area.

AB During flood control reservoir operation, uncertainties occur in flood forecasting, hydrograph shape, streamflow simulation, reservoir storage, water level, and discharge outflow. It is therefore important to analyze flood control risk due to these uncertainties. This study proposes a stochastic simulation method, comprising a copula based simulation method accounting for flood forecasting uncertainty, a copula-based single site daily stream flow simulation method for uncertainty in flood hydrograph, and the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method for uncertainty in storage, water level, and outflow discharge. Using the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) as a case study, the flood control risk, defined by traditional statistical and entropy methods, was calculated and compared. The proposed method satisfactorily preserved the statistical characteristics of the original streamflow series. Results from the TGR case study showed that the entropy method was effective for assessing flood risk due to different uncertainties. Thus, this study provides gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during flood control reservoir operation.

AB Reservoirs and dams are vital human-built infrastructures that play essential roles in flood control, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, navigation, and other functions. The realization of those functions requires efficient reservoir operation, and the effective controls on the outflow from a reservoir or dam. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of streamflow forecasts, reservoir operation planning and scheduling approaches. In this study, three AI models, namely, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) technique, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed to simulate reservoir operation at monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, using approximately 30 years of historical reservoir operation records. This study aims to summarize the influence of the parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to reservoir operation simulation. The results show the following: (1) for the BP neural network and LSTM model, the effects of the number of maximum iterations on model performance should be prioritized; for the SVR model, the simulation performance is directly related to the selection of the kernel function, and sigmoid and RBF kernel functions should be prioritized; (2) the BP neural network and SVR are suitable for the model to learn the operation rules of a reservoir from a small amount of data; and (3) the LSTM model is able to effectively reduce the time consumption and memory storage required by other AI models, and demonstrate good capability in simulating low-flow conditions and the outflow curve for the peak operation period.

DE Groundwater; Drought; Conjunctive use; Irrigation; Resiliency

AB The Rincon Valley in arid, south-central New Mexico, is especially impacted by reduced surface water supply because the contribution of groundwater is limited by aquifer constraints. Consecutive surface water allotment shortages in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) have reduced recharge. The effects are compounded by farmers continuing to extract groundwater to meet crop requirements. Conjunctive use assumes aquifer resilience (i.e., ability to absorb pumping stress), but not necessarily in drought. This study further develops the water table fluctuation method by analyzing data from the EBID's groundwater monitoring program to reveal conjunctive use controls over the spatial and interannual variability of net storage changes from 2009 to 2016 in the Valley and introduces the term groundwater-surface water ratio of application (GSRA), that has potential for characterizing system resilience in conjunctive use settings. Regression modeling shows that variation in the annual EBID surface water allotment correlates strongly with year-end water table elevations, even more strongly than total annual groundwater extractions for irrigation, suggesting that variable surface water allotments are a primary driver of this system. Dewatering of the aquifer as of 2011 significantly altered the system hydrology such that from 2011 to 2016, net change in storage correlates strongly with the annual surface water allotment, corresponding to large river losses for the same period, but resulting in net gains in storage from 2014 to 2016. Rapid storage loss and rebound in this constrained aquifer system allowed quantification of aquifer resilience, enabling the development of a GSRA as a potential planning metric.

AB This study compares the precipitation trend from the gridded rain gauge data collected by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Multisatellite High Resolution Precipitation Products (HRPPs) including Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) version 7, Climate Prediction Center Morphing (CMORPH) version 1.0, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1 for the river basins of India. The IMD and HRPPs are of the same spatial resolution (0.25 x 0.25) and extend from 1998 to 2015. The gridded precipitation datasets are compared for 25 river basins of India. TRMM, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP datasets accuracy for the river basins are assessed by comparison with IMD using root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) methods. The Mann Kendall (MK) and modified Mann Kendall (MMK) tests are applied for analyzing the data trend, and the change is detected by Sen's Slope using all datasets for annual and seasonal time periods. Variation in precipitation is high ( > 20%) in the northern part of India in all datasets. All these basins located at the elevations above 2000 m. The annual and monsoon trend pattern for TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP matched with IMD data in the north, northwest, and central part in 1-2, 22-25, and parts of 3, 12, and 21 river basins (1998-2015). The calculated results implied that the TMPA precipitation product (in terms of accuracy) and PERSIANN (in terms of annual and monsoon trend) show a better agreement with IMD and they can be used in climate studies and hydrological simulation in locations/river basins where the number of rain gauges is not adequate to quantify the spatial variability of precipitation.

AB Physically-based models are important tools for evaluating the hydraulic behaviour of urban drainage systems and, more specifically, assessing flood risk. While it is well known that such models should be calibrated and validated with monitoring data, overland runoff information is seldom available for this purpose. This study investigates the potential of using surveillance camera footage to measure surface flow velocity thanks to an LSPIV-based method called Surface Structure Image Velocimetry (SSIV). Seven real-scale experiments conducted in a specialized flood training facility were used to test the SSIV method under varied and challenging conditions. SSIV performance was evaluated by benchmarking bulk (mean) velocity against that measured by a conventional sensor array. In the best conditions tested, SSW and conventional flow sensors differed by only 1.7% (0.1% standard deviation). While the method proved sensitive to light conditions, our results suggest that infrared lighting could be used to increase measurement consistency. Our study concludes that for measuring overland flow velocity in urban areas, surveillance and traffic cameras can be considered as a low-maintenance and easy-to-install alternative to conventional sensor systems.

AB The aqueous geochemistry of the St. Peter Sandstone, a major aquifer in the Illinois Basin, an intracratonic sedimentary basin, is extremely complex. There are multiple sources of water, including in situ remnant brines, leakage from overlying and underlying units, and recharge during both the Pleistocene and Holocene Epochs. In our study region, recharge to the St. Peter Sandstone has come from multiple locations, and structural features, primarily the LaSalle Anticlinal Belt but also possibly the Sandwich Fault Zone, are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow. In the northern part of the study region, Holocene recharge has displaced most of the Pleistocene recharge, but in the rest of the study region considerable amounts of Pleistocene recharge still exist. The ion chemistry in the St. Peter Sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of Pleistocene recharge and in situ brines, and the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry is leakage of fluids from overlying formations via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances. The water chemistry in the Western Region of our study area is clearly different from the Central and Eastern regions, having a more pronounced signature of Pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge. The large concentrations of SO42- and relatively high delta S-34 values in the Western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and/or gypsum, possibly from Mississippian evaporite deposits in Iowa.

AB The need for a method of estimating streamflow with both high-quality and high spatial resolution, particularly for ungauged sites, is critical under current circumstances: intensifying competition over water resources and limited streamgages. A source of accurate and timely computations of streamflow, particularly at high spatial resolutions, has been the National Hydrograph Dataset (NHD), a comprehensive geographic information system (GIS) dataset of vector-based surface water features such as streams, lakes, and streamgages in fine detail. Utilizing the NHD with streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey and usage records of local water utilities, this paper proposes a simple streamflow estimation method that computes streamflow at any point on river reaches of the NHD with valid hydrograph data and tests the method in a local 613 square mile watershed. The method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of peak or bottom-base flows from upstream to downstream hydrographs leads to retracing upstream lateral inflows that have eventually arrived at a user selected site between the upstream and downstream gauge stations of the hydrographs at any given time in a common period of record between the two hydrographs. Subsequently, the lateral inflows are added up to become the streamflow for a given site at a given time. NHD river networks and ArcGIS tools identify the locations of lateral inflows and the necessary parameters of the method. This paper assesses the results of the method by comparing them to measured streamflows through recommended evaluation statistics and visual inspection. The method has yielded promising results, including values of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency within 0.83 and 0.99 for daily streamflow estimates over seven years. It also credibly reconstructs missing daily streamflow over a considerable number of years.

AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of crystalline Fe81%-A119% and amorphous Fe72%-A114%-B14% ribbons obtained by the melt spinning technique are studied. A different grain size in each surface of the crystalline ribbon has been found. This is caused by the temperature gradient originated by the manufacturing process. The micro-hardness and the Young's modulus were evaluated by instrumented micro-indentation (P-h curves) and conventional tensile test. The results show different Vicker's hardness on each surface for each of the ribbons, being these values greater in the amorphous ribbon than in the crystalline one. The values of the Young's modulus are 133 +/- 11 GPa and 210 +/- 20 GPa for the crystalline and amorphous ribbon respectively which are in good agreement with the theoretical values obtained by the mix rule. The surface fracture shows a brittle-like aspect with presence of cleavage in the Fe81%-A119% ribbon and small localized ductile behavior before reaching the fracture. In the other hand, in the Fe72%-A114%-1314% ribbon, the surface fracture characteristics reveal a fragile fracture and the presence of chevron marks. There is a concordance between the mechanical behavior and the micro-mechanism responsible for the fracture.

AB F and Cl atoms are always brought by the process of wet etching for fused silica devices, which dramatically influence the performance of the devices. The adsorption characteristics of F and Cl atoms with two main fused silica surface defects (E', NBOHC) were investigated on the basis of first-principle methods. Through the comparison of absorption capacity of different surface defects, we found that E' has larger capability to adsorb halogen atoms than NBOHC, and F atom is easier to be trapped by surface defects than Cl atom. Furthermore, the electronic structure and the bonding nature for surface defects are also studied and the calculations show that the introduction of F and Cl atoms will lead to the disappearing of defect states in band gap. And this adsorption process of F and CI atoms on fused silica surface can be considered to chemical adsorption.

AB Different concentrations of Y2O3 doped MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system glasses were prepared by melting method. The effects of Y2O3 content on the physical properties, crystallizability, and the resultant microstructures of the glass samples were investigated. With the increase of Y2O3 content, the glass transition temperature, dilatometric softening temperature and micro hardness all increased. Low concentrations of Y2O3 (0-1.0 mol%) favored the formation of quartz solid solution at 840 degrees C for 1.5 h, and phase transformation from beta- to alpha-quartz solid solution happened after heat treatment at 1000 degrees C with subsequent cooling process. While high concentration of Y2O3 (1.5 mol%) inhibited the crystallization process, and quartz solid solution formed at a high temperature 940 degrees C. The phase transformation from beta-to alpha-quartz solid solution happened after heat treatment at 1060 degrees C with subsequent cooling process. Average crystal sizes were increased significantly with the crystallization temperature increasing from 940 degrees C to 1120 degrees C. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass treated at 1120 degrees C decreased obviously around temperature similar to 300 degrees C, which indicated that the phase transformation from alpha- to beta-quartz solid solution happened in the heating process.

The fraction (N-4) of four coordinated boron atoms of both series decreases with increasing Sb2O3 content. The density decreases in the first series, whereas it increases in the second one. The contribution to N-4 from PbO and Sb2O3 in each series could be separated. Sb2O3 contributes negatively to N-4 in the second series, which is attributed to association of Sb2O3 and PbO forming Pb2Sb2O7 phase. Calculated densities agree well with the experimental data of the first series. Calculated densities could be obtained from the concentration of various structural units in glasses, as predicted from N-4 data. Glasses in the second series have strong tendency to crystallization when heat treated. This tendency is not observed in the first series. These effects are explained by considering the abundance of B2O3 in glass.

AB Mitochondria are central organelles for energy supply of cells and play an important role in maintenance of ionic balance. Consequently mitochondria are highly sensitive to any kind of stress to which they mainly response by disturbance of respiration, ROS production and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Many of the physiological and molecular stress reactions of mitochondria are well known, yet there is a lack of information on corresponding stress induced structural changes. 3-D visualization of high-pressure frozen cells by FIB-SEM tomography and TEM tomography as used for the present investigation provide an excellent tool for studying structure related mitochondrial stress reactions. In the present study it is shown that mitochondria in the unicellular fresh-water algal model system Micrasterias as well as in the closely related aquatic higher plant Lemma fuse to local networks as a consequence of exposure to ionic stress induced by addition of KCl, NaCl and CoCl2. In dependence on concentration and duration of the treatment, fusion of mitochondria occurs either by formation of protuberances arising from the outer mitochondrial membrane, or by direct contact of the surface of elongated mitochondria. As our results show that respiration is maintained in both model systems during ionic stress and mitochondrial fusion, as well as formation of protuberances are reversible, we assume that mitochondrial fusion is a ubiquitous process that may help the cells to cope with stress. This may occur by interconnecting the respiratory chains of the individual mitochondria and by enhancing the buffer capacity against stress induced ionic imbalance.

AB The genetically-controlled formation of complex-shaped inorganic materials by living organisms is an intriguing phenomenon. It illustrates our incomplete understanding of biological morphogenesis and demonstrates the feasibility of ecologically benign routes for materials technology. Amorphous SiO2 (silica) is taxonomically the most widespread biomineral, with diatoms, a large group of single-celled microalgae, being the most prolific producers. Silica is the main component of diatom cell walls, which exhibit species-specific patterns of pores that are hierarchically arranged and endow the material with advantageous properties. Despite recent advances in characterizing diatom biomolecules involved in biosilica morphogenesis, the mechanism of this process has remained controversial. Here we describe the in vitro synthesis of diatom-like, porous silica patterns using organic components that were isolated from biosilica of the diatom Cyclotella cryptica. The synthesis relies on the synergism of soluble biomolecules (long-chain polyamines and proteins) with an insoluble nanopatterned organic matrix. Biochemical dissection of the process revealed that the long-chain polyamines rather than the proteins are essential for efficient in vitro synthesis of the hierarchically porous silica patterns. Our results support the organic matrix hypothesis for morphogenesis of diatom biosilica and introduce organic matrices from diatoms as a new tool for the synthesis of meso- to microporous inorganic materials.

AB Micro-laminated TiC/Ti composite was fabricated by an in-situ method that evolves hot-pressing sintering Ti and graphite foils. The microstructure and mechanical properties of micro-laminated TiC/Ti composite were investigated in present work. It was observed that the TiC ceramic layers and the Ti layers were alternately distributed after sintering. The micro-laminated TiC/Ti composite exhibited flexural strength of 690 +/- 30 MPa and fracture toughness of 24.78 +/- 0.71 MPa*m(1/2) which are much higher than those of traditional TiC ceramics and cermets. The improved fracture toughness attributes to ductile Ti layers, multiple-layers structure and strong interfaces bonding between Ti and in-situ formed TiC layers. In addition, the method used in this study was much simpler and more cost-effective than traditional powder sintering method for fabricating micro-laminated composite, therefore, is promising for real application.

ID STATE ASYMMETRIC SUPERCAPACITORS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE
AB 3D N-doped carbon nanowires (NCWs) supported Fe2O3 nanocubes as anode materials in supercapacitors were successfully synthesized from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on flexible carbon fibers (CFs). Originating from the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and NCWs, this anode exhibited high specific capacitance of 12.4 mF cm (1)/39.6 mF cm (3) at a scan rate of 10 mV s (1) with excellent flexible property. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on our Fe2O3/NCWs/CFs anode demonstrated an extended operating voltage window of 2 V and improved linear specific capacitance of 6.1 mF cm (1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s (1). This asymmetric supercapacitor also obtained good flexibility and long-term stability with an energy density of 2.7 mWh cm (3). The high supercapacitor performance is attributed to the 3D N-doped carbon nanowires which bring higher conductivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influences of interface effects on ferroelectric properties and resistance switching behaviors of the superlattice films were investigated. There was a weak interface effect in the superlattice films, which was caused by the misfit dislocation generated at the interfaces between Ni-a and Ni-b. The results indicate that the superlattice films show superior ferroelectric properties and good resistance switching behaviors, which is caused by the interface effect. Those superlattice films may have potential applications in multifunctional devices due to their excellent electric properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Wear and tribology
AB Ga-based liquid metal may be a novel coolant and lubricant for the steels at high temperature and extreme pressure in the nuclear reactor. It is recently reported that the formation of FeGa3 film may be responsible for the good lubricity of liquid metal, but no proof can clarify this point and its wear behavior is unclear. Therefore, an in-situ FeGa3 film was prepared through the hot-reaction between liquid Ga63In22Sn13 (65% Ga, 22% In, 13% Sn by mass) and T91 steel at 600 degrees C in this paper. The results indicate that FeGa 3 film forms and bonds strongly to the steel surface. It has good mechanical and tribological properties at room temperature, but increases the wear at 600 degrees C. The finding provides the technical support for the safety service of the steels in the liquid-metal environment and is also a new strategy for protecting the steel. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to take the advantages of micro/nano-topography and benefits of boron (B), B-containing micro/nano-structured TiO2/bioceramics coatings were developed on titanium (Ti) substrates for enhanced osteogenesis. The micro-arc oxidation was employed to fabricate a micro-topographical TiO2 layer (referred as Micro-Ti). Then, the second layer of nano-rods was prepared on Micro-Ti surface via hydrothermal treatment (referred as Hier-Ti). These nano-rods transformed to nano-particles after a post heat treatment (referred as Hier-HT-Ti). The adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of SaOS-2 cells were inhibited on Hier-Ti, but promoted on Hier-HT-Ti. The results indicate that the development of B-containing micro/nano-topographical coatings on Ti substrates could lead to enhanced osteogenesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silicoaluminophosphate-11 (SAPO-11) crystals were synthesized in different media - water and ethanol - by the two-stage hydrothermal method using ultrasonic pretreatment of precursor mixture. Changing of the synthesis medium from water to ethanol leads to transformation of SAPO-11 morphology: from pseudo-spherical aggregative crystals to novel screw-like morphology. SAPO-11 crystals, synthesized in ethanol medium (Et-SAPO-11), have remarkable textural properties: the greater values of BET surface area and micropore/mesopores volume, compared with crystals, obtained in the water medium (W-SAPO-11). Besides, the acidity of Et-SAPO-11 is lower than that of W-SAPO-11 due to hindered incorporation of silicon into aluminophosphate lattice in ethanol medium. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transparent conductive CuAlO2 thin films prepared using atmospheric pressure plasma annealing are reported. The sol-gel-derived thin films on the quartz substrate were annealed using atmospheric pressure plasma of N-2-10%O-2 at 700-800 degrees C for 10 min. The CuAlO2 phase was obtained at 750 degrees C. The binding energies of the Cu-2p(3/2) and the Al-2p(3/2) of the thin films were centered at 932.6 +/- 0.2 eV and 73.3 +/- 0.2 eV, revealing the valence state of Cu+ and Al3+m, respectively. The direct and indirect optical bandgaps of the CuAlO2 thin films were 3.58 eV and 1.81 eV, respectively. Additionally, the CuAlO2 thin films had the conductivity of (1.42 +/- 0.1) x 10(3) S/cm with the carrier concentration of (1.32 +/- 0.13) x 10(14) cm(3). Therefore, atmospheric pressure plasma annealing provides a feasible method for preparing CulO(2) thin films. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel omniphobic nanofiber membrane for membrane distillation (MD) was successfully fabricated by one-step electrospinning of PVDF-HFP and fluorinated-decyl polyhedraloligomeric silsesquioxane (F-POSS) colloidal suspension solution. The fabricated F-POSS/PVDF-HFP membrane possessed uniform fiber structures and had extreme high F-POSS concentration on the surface. This F-POSS based membrane exhibited excellent omniphobicity, as indicated by its wetting resistance to different low surface tension liquids, including ethanol with a contact angle of 128.2 degrees. Membrane distillation (MD) experiments showed that the water flux and water quality were stably maintained in highly saline feed solutions containing low surface tension substances, which successfully demonstrated its potential application for desalination of challenging industrial wastewater.

AB Ordered bimodal mesoporous carbon nanowires (OMCWs) is prepared from dual templates that were fabricated by filling silica nanospheres in the channels of porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. The prepared OMCWs material exhibits a large surface area (876.7 m(2) g(-1)), ordered large mesoporous (30 nm) nanostructure and small mesopores on the large mesopore walls. Pt nanoparticles are deposited on OMCWs to form Pt/OMCWs electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In Pt/OMCWs, Pt nanoparticles (similar to 1.8 nm) are uniformly located on the OMCWs. The Pt/OMCWs catalyst possesses larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (93.3 m(2) g(-1)), higher activity for MOR and better durability compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The good electrochemical performance of Pt/OMCWs is ascribed to the unique bimodal mesoporous structure that could facilitate the rapid mass transfer and enhanced the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and the one-dimensional structure that could enhance the electron transport.

AB Using the solid-state reaction route, a new low-firing microwave dielectric ceramic LiYGeO4 was prepared, and the phase evolution, thermal stability, and dielectric properties were characterized. A single orthorhombic phase LiYGeO4 formed in the sintering temperature range of 920-960 degrees C decomposed into Y2GeO5,GeO2, and Li2O when the sintering temperature exceeded 960 degrees C. LiYGeO4 densified at 940 degrees C/6 h possessed a relative permittivity 9.41, a quality factor 18,860 GHz (at 12.8 GHz), and a temperature coefficient of resonant frequency -27.7 ppm/degrees C. The negative tau(f) value was compensated by compositing with CaTiO3, and 0.97LiYGeO(4)-0.03CaTiO(3) ceramic exhibited a near-zero tau(f) of -1.37 ppm/degrees C along with a permittivity of 9.83 and a quality factor of 12,940 GHz (at 13.2 GHz). All merits make LiYGeO4 a promising candidate for high-frequency communication application, and low-temperature co-fired ceramics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High strength and transparent nanocomposite hydrogels (AD gels) were prepared by photo-initiated free radical copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) and N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) in the colloidal solutions of alumina nanoparticles (Al2O3 NPs). The obtained hydrogels displayed well-defined porous structures and outstanding mechanical properties with tensile and compressive strength up to 1.88 MPa and 28 MPa, respectively. The FT-IR spectra indicate that there exist strong chelation reactions between Al2O3 NPs and polymer matrix, which are responsible for the formation of AD gels and their excellent mechanical performance. Moreover, AD gels with low swelling ratios could be prepared by choosing appropriate monomer ratios, endowing the hydrogels with considerable mechanical strength even at swollen state.

AB Novel gellan gum incorporated TiO2 nanotubes (GG+TiO2-NT) film was successfully fabricated using solvent casting method for skin tissue engineering. The physicochemical properties of the film was investigated by FTIR, XRD and SEM. FTIR studies show the existence of interactions between TiO2 nanotubes and GG polymer matrix. XRD analysis revealed that the film was in amorphous state and the presence of TiO2 nanotubes on the surface of film was proved by SEM images. Cell proliferation studies demonstrated that, no sign of toxicity and the number of cells were found to be increased, thus exhibiting an ideal characteristic in skin tissue engineering applications.

AB In this work, nanocomposites of carbon allotropes with TiO2 have been used as photoanodes to improve the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene materials have been mixed with TiO2 paste to form nanocomposites. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has been used to confirm the dispersion of MWCNTs and graphene materials in TiO2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic, current-voltage characteristics and incident photon-to-current efficiency have been carried to characterize DSSCs. Results demonstrate that nanocomposite photoanodes enhance the power-conversion-efficiency of DSSCs. However, results also show that graphene/TiO2 based DSSC exhibits PCE of 5.25%, which is about 14% higher than MWCNTs/TiO2 based solar cell (4.20%). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phase pure iron pyrite (FeS2) nanosphere morphology was synthesized by a solvothermal route an alternative to colloidal synthesis by utilizing an ethylene glycol and benzylamine as a solvent and structure directing ligand at 160 degrees C for 12 h in Teflon lined autoclave. The as obtained nanospheres were in average similar to 50 nm diameter with a smooth surface and well mono-disperse as observed by the FESEM images. The XRD analysis shows a typical iron pyrite crystal phase with 20 position at 28.23 degrees, 32.76 degrees, 36.84 degrees, 40.48 degrees, 47.32 degrees and 56.01 degrees without any impurity peaks. The Raman spectra further confirmed the phase pure pyrite structure. The UV-Vis and PL spectra shows excellent solar absorbance with a band gaps of 1.35 eV close to the direct band gap (1.38 eV) of pyrite materials, however the photoluminescence spectra shows a band gap of 1.39 eV close to the direct band gap. The obtained nanosphere morphology was highly promising as an excellent solar absorber material for the photovoltaic application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we developed a novel and facile electrodeposition method for Mn2+ doped superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Mn-SPIONs) in both bare and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) capped forms (i.e. bare Mn-SPIONs and PVP capped Mn-SPIONs). The magnetite crystal structure, uniform spherical particle morphologies, nanometer size, Mn2+ cations incorporation and PVP surface coat were confirmed through XRD, IR, FE-SEM, DLS and DSC-TGA techniques. The superparamagnetic behavior of both Mn-SPIONs and PVP-Mn-SPIONs samples were indicated by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) data. Based on the obtained results, it was stated that the developed electrochemical route can be considered as a facile platform for preparation of novel biocompatible metal ion doped iron oxides for possible biomedical applications.

The influence of the enantiomeric excess (ee) on the structural relaxation kinetics is highlighted through standard differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fast scanning calorimetry (FSC) investigations. This original work evidences that even if the enthalpy loss to reach equilibrium remains globally the same whatever the ee, the structural relaxation kinetics are clearly slowed down when ee is increased.

AB This paper investigates the microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrTiHfV0.5Nb0.5Ox (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) alloys. The ZrTiHfNb0.5Ta0.5 alloy has single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase structure. No oxide phases are detected and the diffraction peak (1 1 0) shifts to the left apparently when oxygen is added. Only one set of diffraction spots is observed in the patterns of selected area electron diffraction. The above results confirm that oxygen atoms dissolve into the lattice of ZrTiHfNb0.5Ta0.5 alloy. The increase in oxygen content is accompanied by an interstitial strengthening effect at both room temperature and high temperature, but a decrease in compressive ductility. This new method to enhance the mechanical properties of refractory high-entropy alloys is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed to modify graphene nanosheets with molecular-sized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-GNSs) in this work. Influences of the surface modification on microstructure and dispersibility of GNSs, as well as their performance as anticorrosion pigments, have been investigated. The experimental results show that the morphology of PDMS-GNSs is similar to that of GNSs, the thickness of PDMS-GNSs increases 0.23 nm as compared to GNSs, and PDMS-GNSs exhibit a significantly enhanced dispersibility in common paint solvents and ability to reinforce the anticorrosion performance of epoxy coating. This method has wide application prospects in anticorrosion field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) particles were synthesized via a simple and versatile solvothermal route. The material was employed as a catalyst for the degradation of tartrazine dye from aqueous solution through the solar photo-Fenton process, reaching 95% of dye degradation at 50 min of reaction time. Powders containing a mesoporous structure with high surface area and total pore volume were obtained. The catalyst showed high chemical stability and degradation efficiency of tartrazine dye after five recycles. Therefore, CFTS shows intrinsic characteristics for potential application as a solar photo-Fenton catalyst in the tartrazine degradation from aqueous solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lithium sulfur batteries have been considered as one of the most promising electrochemical power sources due to its extremely high energy density and high theoretical specific capacity. However, poor cycling life due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides hinders its practical application. In this paper, C-60 nanorods are prepared by a facile, scalable and repeatable antisolvent induced precipitation method at an ambient temperature and used as a novel interlayer material for lithium-sulfur batteries. It was proved that C-60 nanorods could efficiently inhibit the diffusion of lithium polysulfides via both physical adsorption and strong chemical bonding. Lithium-sulfur batteries with C-60 interlayer delivered a capacity of 725 mAh g (1) and a capacity retention of 154.5% after 500 cycles at 4800 mAg (1) with a coulombic efficiency around 100%.

AB In this work, carbon-coated Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl layered double hydroxide hierarchical nanostructures (Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl-LDH@C) in situ grown on Ni foam are synthesized by integrating an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique with a simple hydrothermal treatment. Such a unique hierarchical structure provides areal capacitance as high as 14.0 F cm(-2) at 5 mA cm(-2) with excellent rate capability (8.09 F cm(-2) at 50 mA cm(-2)), and maintains 87.2% of the initial capacitance even after 2000 cycles. These excellent electrochemical performances demonstrate that the binder-free Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl-LDH@C as battery-like electrode has great competitiveness for supercapacitors in future energy storage applications.

AB A facile and cost effective way has been developed to fabricate a unique structure of Ni3S2 and CoS (CNS) composite. CNS composite are synthesized on the surface of nickel foam (NF) using a hydrothermal process. NF acts as both a substrate and Ni source for composite. CNS are directly applied as the electrode for supercapacitors. XRD results indicate the presence of Ni3S2, CoS, and Ni phases in the sample. SEM results show that the CNS consist of interweaved nanoplates with average diameter of 15 mu m and a thickness of 250 nm. Electrochemical measurements indicate the CNS have the specific capacitance of 4.73 F cm(-2) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). When the current density increases from 1 mA cm(-2) to 20 mA cm(-2) , 63.4% capacitance is retained. Thus, the facile, low-cost and novel synthesis method and outstanding performance make the CNS an ideal electrode material for the electrochemical energy storage devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Melt-diffusion and vapor-phase infusion is widely used to introduce sulfur into the pores of carbon matrix to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, it is limited performance enhancement due to low sulfur content and unavoidable land on the outer surface of host material. Herein, we introduce an effective and facile strategy to prepare an urchin-like S@N-doped carbon composite by in situ oxidizing the N-carbon coated metal sulfide precursor. The prepared urchin-like S@N-doped carbon particle cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries exhibits a high initial capacity of 820 mAh(-1) and excellent cycling performance of 760 mAh(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C with a high mass sulfur loading (78.9 wt%, 3.5 mAh cm(2)). This work provides an efficient route to prepare sulfur/porous carbons for energy storage application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical porous ZnO/Fe3O4 composites were fabricated through a facile surfactant-free method. The as-prepared samples were characterized using different instrumental techniques. The X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray results showed that the as-prepared samples were two-phase photocatalysts consisted of ZnO and Fe3O4 . The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy result indicated that the addition of Fe3O4 modified the optical properties of the photocatalysts. Under visible light irradiation, the ZnO/Fe(3)O(4 )exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance for phenol degradation and Escherichia coli inactivation compared to ZnO. The photocatalytic enhancement of ZnO/Fe3O4 was attributed to the effective electron-hole pairs separation as verified by the photoluminescence spectra. The ZnO/Fe3O4 also exhibited magnetic properties, which can easily be recovered using an external magnet along with good reusability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid energy storage devices have been studied with combining the high energy of lithium ion batteries and high power and long life of supercapacitor in a single system. We successfully fabricated hybrid supercapacitors using granule Li4Ti5O12/activated carbon anode and activated carbon cathode for high electrochemical performances. The hybrid supercapacitors deliver a high capacity (63 F g (1)) as well as a superior rate capability (81.9% retention from 0.5 to 5 A g (1)) and a cycling stability (92.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 3 A g (1)). This is related to a small internal resistance value. Therefore, hybrid supercapacitors based on LTO/AC and AC electrodes are a promising and innovative solution for high performance hybrid supercapacitor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, hollow chitin microspheres with hierarchically porous structure were prepared for the first time through freeze-drying with alkali/urea mixture as solvent and liquid nitrogen as coagulant. The hollow structure can be facilely tuned by the concentration of chitin, freeze-drying temperature and prefreeze temperature. Higher concentration of chitin and pre-freeze temperature resulted in a thicker wall of the microspheres. This simple and template-free method can be easily extended to fabricate other hollow polysaccharide microspheres with hierarchically porous structure. The prepared chitin microspheres with excellent biological features may have potential applications in environmental treatment and biomedicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon coated Fe3Se4 (Fe3Se4/C) composites are synthesized on a large scale by facile solid-state reaction between the commercial FeC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O and selenium powders using citric acid as carbon source. The Fe3Se4/C composites with porous structures are composed of aligned carbon coated nanorods. As anode material, the Fe3Se4/C composites show higher reversible discharge specific capacity and cycling stability than unmodified Fe3Se4, performing 711.1 mAh g (1) and 551 mAh g (1) for first and second discharge capacities at 0.1 A g (1), and delivering a reversible capacity of 434.4 mAh g (1) at 1 Ag (1) with a capacity retention of 98.3% after 100 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties could be ascribed to the introduction of coated carbon, enhancing structure stability during cycling and improving the electrical conductivity.

AB Half-Heusler (HH) materials have been actively explored for thermoelectric (TE) based power generation applications in the mid-temperature regime. In the current work, we demonstrate the defect engineering in non-stoichiometric HH alloys to realize a state-of-the-art ZT 1 at 873 K for both n-type Zr0.5Hf0.5Ni1-xSn and p-type Zr0.5Hf0.5Co1+xSb0.8Sn0.2 (x = 0.04) compositions. This enhanced ZT leads to high conversion efficiency of -9% with a high output power density similar to 9 Wcm(2) in both the synthesized n and p-type HH alloys, estimated using cumulative temperature dependence model. A time efficient fabrication route of HH device thermo-elements with Ti electrical contacts, employing spark plasma sintering process, is also demonstrated in the optimized defect engineered HH compositions. A low specific contact resistivity of <10 m Omega.cm(2) in both n-type and p-type HH/Ti thermo-elements was realized, which suggests exciting opportunities and possibilities for achieving highly efficient TE based power generation.

ID ZIRCONIUM CARBIDES
AB ZrC0.6 with ordered carbon vacancies was irradiated with a 4 MeV Au ion beam at room temperature at fluences of 2 x 10(16) ions/cm(2), corresponding to 130 displacements per atom (dpa). Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were performed to investigate the microstructure evolution of ZrC0.6 under ion irradiation. The lattice parameter did not clearly increase (lattice expansion of 0.013%) for irradiated ZrC0.6, which indicated that the inherent carbon vacancies acted as sinks for the interstitial atoms generated by irradiation. The peaks of Zr2C-ordered phase in GIXRD patterns and reflections of ordered Zr2C in microdiffraction patterns of the damaged layer disappeared, which indicated that superstructure modulation of the ordered carbon vacancies for Zr2C was destroyed under Au ion irradiation, and demonstrated that introducing vacancy defects in ZrC enhanced the tolerance of radiation damage.

AB Structural and electronic properties of graphdiyne/MoS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure under external electric field are investigated by first-principle calculations for the first time. The direct bandgap of graphdiyne/MoS2 heterostructure can be significantly modulated by the electric field, and a transition from semiconductor to metal is observed. It is demonstrated that the graphdiyne/MoS2 bilayer transfers from type-I to type-II heterostructure under a certain electric field, leading to the spatial separation of the lowest energy electron-hole pairs, which is beneficial to photodetection and solar energy conversion. The calculation results pave the way for applications of graphdiyne/MoS2 heterostructure in future micro-/nano- electronics and photoelectronics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Freestanding membrane built from interwoven carbon fibers with encapsulated liquid gallium (Ga) nanodroplets has been demonstrated via the ultrasonic cell disrupting and electrospinning approaches along with a subsequent annealing process. Employing this membrane as a freestanding anode for lithium storage, the severe volume changes of Ga can be effectively accommodated due to the unique encapsulated 3D network structure. As a result, the membrane exhibits superior electrochemical performance, including high reversible capacity (450 mAh g(-1)), enhanced cycling stability (247 mAh g(-1) at 0.65 A g(-1 )over 250 cycles), as well as good rate performance (200 mAh g(-1 )at 2 A g(-1)).

We have developed Sn-1.0Ag-xCe solder alloys consisting of a range of cerium contents from 0 to 0.5 wt% in the production of the refinement and continuation of the precipitates, as well as the reduction in grain size of the alloy microstructures. An increase of cerium addition supported on corrosion resistance exhibited relatively improved pitting potential, film and charge transfer resistances which particularly promoted the formation of passive film, resulting in an improvement of pitting resistance.

AB A simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize silver-doped zirconia-reduced graphite oxide (Ag-ZrO2/r-GO) composite coating on CoCrMo, an alloy commonly used in artificial hip joints. The Ag-ZrO2/r-GO coating is mainly intended to extend the service life of artificial hip joints via a rational coating design, which consists of three components, namely, a ceramic component ZrO2, a friction reducing component r-GO, and an antibacterial agent Ag. After hydrothermal treatment in Zr(SO4)(2) center dot 4H(2)O solution containing GO at 200 degrees C for 24 h, ZrO2/r-GO coating of about 12.5 mu m thick was formed on CoCrMo substrate. Ag was incorporated subsequently by soaking in AgNO3 solution and calcination was carried out to improve the adhesion of the coating on CoCrMo substrate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOW-TEMPERATURE; NANOSILVER PASTE
AB It is significant to attach power devices on low-cost copper (Cu) substrates by pressureless silver-sintering in air. The Cu surface in direct-bond-copper (DBC) substrates could have a wide range of surface roughness due to the various processing techniques. It is crucial to find out how the surface roughness influences the bonding strength of the sintered-silver (Ag) die-attachment. In this study, we did die-attach on Cu substrates with surface roughness R-a = 0.15-8.41 mu m and R-z = 1.22-50.97 mu m by pressureless sintering of nanosilver paste in air. When the surface roughness (R-a of 0.65 mu m) is slightly larger than the silver nanoparticles (diameter of 0.6 mu m), the high shear strength in excess of 50 MPa was achieved, likely due to both strong metallic bonds and mechanical interlock. This work could help to prepare DBC substrates with optimized surface roughness to accommodate the viscosity, the particle size, and the sintering shrinkage of the silver paste for well using the sintered-Ag die-attach technology.

AB ZnO nanorods and nanosheets were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route, and their gas sensing properties were tested to figure out the effect of surface morphologies on gas sensing performance. It was surprisely found that the ZnO nanorods exhibit quicker response and recovery speed towards ethanol, which may be ascribed to the better conductivity and lower potential barrier, whereas the nanosheets display larger ethanol gas response owing to its higher specific surface area.

AB Whisker presence in a ceramic matrix could increase mechanical strength and reduce thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering. Therefore it is a potential reinforcement in TBCs, However, due to difficult handling and lack of homogenous distribution, their usage is limited. In this study, semi-flowing granules of alumina whiskers were prepared by spray dryer suitable for plasma spraying method. Suspensions of alumina whiskers and nanoparticles were prepared; rheological properties of the slurries were studied using spin rheometer, zeta-sizer and observing the sedimentation height. Two different slurries were prepared; the first one comprises alumina whiskers and the second one comprise 70% wt alumina whiskers-30% wt alumina nanoparticles as filler. Both slurries were prepared with the same condition of pH, solid content and binder then granulated using a spray dryer. Morphology of the obtained granules was analyzed by FE-SEM and OM, also flow properties were investigated. The results showed that the granules from both slurries were hollow with semi-spherical morphology. However, the powder contained alumina nanoparticles had a thicker shell and smoother surface, because nanoparticles have been filled the gaps between whiskers; therefore it has the better flowability.

AB A simple and effective route was employed to fabricate cadmium titanate nanofibers (CdTiO3 NFs) immobilized into the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets using electrospinning and calcination processes. Here, graphene oxide (GO) served as a supporting material for the deposition of CdTiO3 precursor along with the scarifying polymer nanofibers and upon the thermal treatment, it led to the formation of CdTiO3 NFs immobilized reduced graphene oxide (CdTiO3/RGO) composite. The as-synthesized CdTiO3/RGO composite was used for photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB) from the aqueous solution and revealed a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic activity as compared to the pristine CdTiO3 NFs.

AB Lu2SiO5:Ce is a famous scintillator with excellent performance in particular high density, high light yield, and fast decay. Oxygen vacancies are demonstrated to degrade the scintillation properties. Li doping for low concentrations is experimentally found to suppress the oxygen vacancies, which is, however, contradictory to the theoretical results. We therefore investigate the effect of Li doping in different concentrations on the oxygen vacancies in Lu2SiO5:Ce phosphors using thermoluminescence and first-principles calculations. The crystallinity is not affected by Li doping. Importantly, the oxygen vacancies are created by nearby substitutional Li at the Lu site, whereas they are suppressed by the interstitial Li, providing better understanding of the oxygen vacancies in Lu2SiO5:Ce.

AB The application of heparin as anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and growth factor regulating agent is currently limited by its narrow therapeutic window. Here, we describe the use of chemically crosslinked gelatin hydrogels as delivery platform to achieve the control of heparin release over time. Different hydrogel formulations and two strategies for heparin loading were tested. The synergic electrostatic interactions between heparin and gelatin hydrogels resulted in a sustained release until 60 h, demonstrated by toluidine blue tests. Platelets adhesion was significantly reduced in heparin-loaded hydrogels, thus proving good heparin bioactivity after processing. Our heparin-loaded hydrogels represent a possible valid option to develop coating for catheters and cardiovascular devices, or skin dressings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generally, TiO2 aerogel prepared by the sol-gel technique is amorphous and it exhibits special catalytic property only in the crystalline state after calcination at high temperature, but the calcination will significantly decrease aerogel's specific surface area. Thus the aim of this study is to prepare co-existing crystalline phase Sn-TiO2 aerogel without annealing. It was synthesized by ultrasonic-assisted sol-gel method using stannous chloride as dopant. Results indicated that the uncalcined Sn-TiO2 aerogel composed by amorphous and anatase phase (denoted as co-existing phases) has a specific surface area of 172.4 m(2)/g. Optimal degradation efficiency of 96% for tetracycline hydrochloride was achieved within 30 min of UV irradiation using the co-existing phases Sn-TiO2 aerogel, due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic activity.

AB Ni1-xCox (0 <= x <= 1) nanotubes with outer diameters of 180-210 nm were quickly fabricated by a facile template-assisted chemical deposition method. Their microstructures, magnetic properties and catalytic activities for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol were studied. The results showed that the as-obtained boron-doped transition-metals had uniform size, noncrystalline structure and typical hollow tube-like morphologies. The content of Ni and Co in the nanotubes can be easily adjusted by changing the Ni2+/Co2+ ratios in the solution used for the co-deposition process. Except for the similar coercive force (H-c), their saturation magnetization (M-s) and remanent magnetization (Mr) increased with the increase of Co content. In addition, all of the metal nanotubes presented good catalytic performances for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The catalytic efficiencies gradually became better in the order of Ni, NiCo, NiCo2 and Co. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved.

AB In this work, two TiNiV alloys with nominal compositions of Ti46Ni44V10 and Ti37Ni38V25 were prepared by casting. Thin wires were acquired by cold drawing. The microstructure, transformation characteristics and mechanical properties of the wires were investigated. The microstructure analysis showed that beta-V phase was stretched into nanowires after drawing. The results suggested that the R -> B19' transformation increases with increasing annealing temperature. The tension test showed that after 400 degrees C annealing, the two alloys exhibited superior superelastic. Both of the alloys exhibit high transformation critical stress and large hysteresis. The Ti46Ni44V10 alloy exhibited critical transformation stress of about 575 MPa and reversible strain of about 7% in 8% superelastic cycle. The Ti37Ni38V25 alloy exhibits critical transformation stress of about 1100 MPa and reversible strain of about 6% when annealed at 400 degrees C. Ti37Ni38V25 alloy exhibited high absorbed energy of about 54 MJ/m(3)in 8% superelastic cycle, which is about 3 times higher than that in the NiTi alloy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe3O4 nanowires/graphene aerogel composite is prepared for the first time via a simple two-step method, including a hydrothermal and self-assembly water-bath L-ascorbic acid reduction process. Structural and morphological characterizations confirm that the ultralong Fe3O4 nanowires are embedded into the networks of graphene nanosheets. When exploited as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, Fe3O4 nanowires/graphene aerogel composite exhibits good rate capability (557 mAh g(-1) at a current density 2000 mA g(-1)) and excellent cycling performance (900 mAh g(-1 )at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles) together with good rate performance.

AB In this paper, CdMoO4 photocatalyst with enhanced sunlight-driven photocatalytic performance was prepared by a microwave hydrothermal method with the assistance of sodium dodecylbenzenseulfonate (SDBS). The photocatalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-EmmettTellermethod method (BET), surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts were evaluated by the decay of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation. The results demonstrate that adding SDBS into the reaction system increases the specific surface area, enhances the photo-induced charge separation rate of CdMoO4 and the formation of center dot O-2(-). The photocatalytic activity of SDBS-CdMoO4 is higher than that of the reference CdMoO4 , originating from the efficient separation of photo-induced charge pairs and increased specific surface area.

AB Textured TiB2-(Ti,Zr)B-2 composites were prepared by gel-casting in 6 T and subsequent pressureless sintering without the magnetic field. These results showed that c-axis of TiB2 and ZrB2 grains were oriented to parallel to the direction of the magnetic field in textured green bodies. Separately, the higher c-axis orientation was obtained for TiB2 and the lower c-axis orientation was obtained for ZrB2. After sintering, ZrB2 phases disappeared and new (Ti,Zr)B-2 solid solutions appeared by the reaction of ZrB2 and TiB2. The degree of texture of TiB2 increased compared with that in green body. (Ti,Zr)B-2 solid solutions also showed high c-axis orientation. With the increase of sintering temperatures from 1800 degrees C to 1950 degrees C, the degree of texture of TiB2 slightly decreased from 0.95 to 0.92 and the degree of texture of (Ti,Zr)B-2 showed the big decreasing from 0.80 to 0.62.

AB Cu2SnS3(CTS) films were deposited on the Mo-coated glass substrates by a facile solution method with a post-sulfurization technique and the CTS-based solar cells were also fabricated successfully. The influencing mechanisms of the sulfurization temperature on the CTS absorber were investigated systematically. It is found that the CTS absorber with high crystallinity and no impurity was obtained at the temperature of 540 degrees C confirmed by XRD and Raman analysis. Moreover, significant improvement of microstructure was achieved by increasing the temperature to 540 degrees C but voids appeared at higher temperature of 570 degrees C. The Monoclinic CTS thin films sulfurized at 540 degrees C were used to fabricate CTS solar cell with Mo/CTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Ag structure, exhibiting efficiency of 3.05%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Glasses from different types of tungsten mine tailings were obtained and studied to determine their ability to be used as raw materials of commercial glass. Tailings of granitic composition from Barruecopardo, of calc-silicate wastes from Morille, and of schists and quartz from Panasqueira, were used as raw materials. The addition of CaCO3 and NaCO3 was necessary for the manufacture of the glass. Samples were characterised by XRF, XRD, HSM and DTA-TG. Furthermore, the expansion coefficient, Vickers microhardness and leaching properties were measured. The results show that all the tungsten mine tailings used were suitable for the manufacture of commercial glass, with the addition of calcium and soda. The calc-silicate tailing needs less additive content to produce a glass. Also, they present lower workability temperatures and higher durability. Glasses obtained from all the tested tailings retain the potentially toxic elements in their structure and prevents the environmental pollution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The poly (vinylidene fluoride)/polyester (PVDF/PET) separator for lithium ion battery was successfully prepared using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) technique for the first time. PET was used to enhance thermostability and regulate the micro-structure of separator. The results indicated that although solid-liquid phase separation occurred for PVDF/PET/diluent dope, the introduction of PET is in favor of forming network structure, which can be attributed to the change of compatibility and confined crystallization of PVDF. Compared with the pristine separator, the blend separator exhibited a better thermostability, higher capacity (151.5 mAh g(-1) vs 133.7 mAh g(-1) for initial discharge capacity) and decomposition voltage (4.7 V vs 4.5 V). The investigations suggested that the prepared PVDF/PET separator is a good candidate for lithium ion battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile one-step synthesis of MoS2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites by in situ thermal polycondensation was reported. The MoS2/g-C3N4 exhibited looser, thinner and bimodal mesoporous features. The MoS2 species were uniform and compact on the surface of g-C3N4 to obtain a robust heterojunction. Benefiting from the structure merits, the MoS2/g-C3N4 exhibited superior visible-light induced activity and good cycle stability for photodegradation of rhodamine B. The enhancement of visible-light absorption and the suppression of recombination of photogenerated carriers were responsible for highly enhanced activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB UV-shielding TiO2 coatings for the protection of the UV-degradable transparent plastic polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were prepared by atmospheric-pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (AP-PECVD). The structure and morphology of AP-PECVD-derived TiO2 films and TiO2-coated PMMA were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, and water contact angle measurements, and their optical properties were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. The results showed that AP-PECVD-derived TiO2 had an amorphous structure, and a TiO2 layer with a compact columnar structure without any visible cracks was successfully formed on PMMA without damaging the structure of the polymer. The film deposited on PMMA exhibited excellent UV-shielding performance with 99% absorption of UV light in the wavelength range of 200-280 nm and with visible light transmittance above 90%.

AB Yb3+/Mn4+ co-doped La2ZnTiO6 (brief as LZT:Yb3+/Mn4+) phosphors with xYb(3+) (x = 0-0.12) and yMn(4+) (y = 0-0.01) doping concentrations have been synthesized via a sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence spectra were employed to characterize the properties of final products. The LZT:Yb3+/Mn4+ material can efficiently convert the short-wavelength sunlight in wide spectral ranges (250-600 nm) into near-infrared emission around 990 nm which matches the higher photosensitivity region of Si-based solar cells. A dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role for the energy transfer process from Mn4+ to Yb3+ ions, which has been verified by Dexter's theory. Under the 390 nm excitation, the energy transfer efficiency is 38.6% in the La1.9ZnTi0.998O6:0.1Yb(3+)/0.002Mn(4+) co-doped sample. Due to the effective absorption of Mn4+ in the visible region and charge transfer transitions (O-2(-)-> Yb-3(+) and O2- -> Mn4+) in the UV region for LZT and the efficient energy transfer to Yb3+, this material can be developed as spectral convertors to improve silicon solar cell photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

AB A new near-infrared-responsive photocatalyst of NaYF4:Yb,Tm@Cu2O have been successfully synthesized by a simple method. Methylene blue as a model pollutant was used to study the photocatalytic activity of NaYF4:Yb,Tm@Cu2O composites, and the energy transfer process between NaYF4:Yb, Tm and Cu2O and the origin of the degradation of pollutants were investigated. It was found that the energy transfer route between NaYF4:Yb, Tm and Cu2O is an important factor for the overall photocatalytic activity. This study suggests a promising system to apply upconversion materials for utilizing the near-infrared light to irradiate Cu2O-based photocatalysts.

AB Transmittance on TlGaxIn1-xS2 mixed crystals (0 <= x <= 1) was carried out in the 2.35-2.75 eV photon energy range at T = 10 K. Band gap energies of crystals were obtained utilizing the derivative spectra of transmittance and photon energy dependence of absorption coefficient. The dependence of direct band gap energy on composition at T = 10 K revealed that as gallium composition is elevated in the mixed crystals, the direct band gap energy increases from 2.56 to 2.67 eV.
   Photoluminescence spectra of TlGaxIn1-xS2 crystals were studied in the photon energy region of 2.30-2.95 eV at T = 10 K. The observed bands were attributed to transitions of electrons from shallow donor levels to valence band. The shift of PL bands to higher energies with increasing gallium content was revealed. Furthermore, composition ratio of crystals was determined from energy dispersive spectroscopy experiments.

AB [Tb(TMA):RE3+] MOFs (MOF: Metal Organic Framework; TMA: trimesic acid or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, RE3+: Eu and Sm) with tunable color were synthesized by aqueous coprecipitation method. Using a chemical artifice, lanthanide cationic radius contraction, it was possible to obtain only anhydrous MOFs, a very important characteristic in luminescent compounds. TMA(3-) anions triplet states present higher energy levels compared to the main emitting states of Eu3+ (D-5(0)), Tb3+ (D-5(4)) and Sm3+ ((4)G(5/2)), supplying an efficient antenna effect. Based on the spectroscopic investigation, i.e. excitation/emission spectra and lifetimes of the excited states, the material shows a high quantum efficiency (eta = 83-86%) due to the very efficient energy transfer process TMA -> Tb -> Eu, combined to the presence of this high energy absorption ligand and the absence of water molecules.

AB Structural, morphological and spectroscopic characterization of the Eu3+-doped Y-2(MoO4)(3) red phosphor incorporated with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) synthesized via Pechini's method is reported in the present study. In order to evaluate the Au NPs and Eu3+ ions influence on the molybdate structure, the Y-2(MoO4)(3), Y-2(MoO4)(3):Eu3+, Y-2(MoO4)(3)/Au and Y-2(MoO4)(3):Eu3+/Au samples were produced and fully investigated. All samples obtained at relatively low temperature, i.e., 650 degrees C, show molybdate as the unique phase with high crystallinity assisted by both Eu3+ ions and Au NPs. Water molecules detected in the molybdate structure probably are distorting MoO4, YO6 and EuO6 polyhedra similarly to the Au NPs incorporated in the same lattice. These Au NPs are spherical-shaped with a diameter near to 46 nm and they are located on the molybdate particle surface. The Eu3+-doped phosphors, with or without the presence of Au NPs, exhibit intense red luminescence characteristic of the Eu3+ ion inserted in low-symmetry sites. However, the Au NPs increase the radiative emission rate and absolute quantum yield of the Eu3+ D-s(o) emitter state due to the excitation field enhancement caused by the local surface plasmon resonance absorption effect of gold nanoparticles, which was confirmed by diffuse reflectance measurements. Finally, the Eu3+ quantum efficiency enhancement to 92% played by the gold nanoparticles and the high red color purity qualify the obtained phosphor for photonic applications.

AB Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films were deposited at room temperature (RT) using reactive magnetron co-sputtering of two metallic Zn and Al targets in the presence of oxygen. The structural, optical and electrical properties of the AZO thin films were tailored by varying the Al content through changing Al sputtering power from 0 to 30 W. The AZO thin films deposited at the optimal deposition conditions with Al power of 26-28 W exhibited high transparency in the visible range, shorter plasma wavelength, lower electrical resistivity, lower transmittance and higher reflectance in the near IR range. The results domenstrate that the Al-doping content is strongly correlated to the band gap, electrical and near infrared optical properties using various characterization techniques. Tailoring the infrared optical properties of AZO films can be achieved and applied for desired optical coating applications.

AB Cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG: Ce) is used to convert blue light which is emitted from InGaN-based LED chip for white light. In this study, the phosphor paste was prepared using monodispersed spherical YAG: Ce phosphor synthesized by co-precipitation based on one-pot synthesis. Also, orange-red emitting Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ (SSN: Eu) phosphor was added to confirm the change in optical characteristics. Alpha terpineol was used as a paste solvent because it enabled easy screen-printing. Phosphor paste films for optoelectronic devices were prepared by coating on a glass substrate using a doctor blade method. We compared the conversion efficacy, color rendering index (CRI), and correlated color temperature (CCT) of YAG: Ce which is added to various amounts of SSN: Eu. We measured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to confirm the difference of porosity between, depending on binder addition.

AB We report the synthesis and luminescence properties of new layered mixed-anion compounds, Sr2ScCuSeO3 and Sr3Sc2Cu2Se2O5. Sr2ScCuSeO3 and Sr3Sc2Cu2Se2O5 were synthesized by solid-state reaction and were investigated using x-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance, and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Both compounds have very similar properties except for their optical band gaps and emission peak energies. At room temperature, Sr2ScCuSeO3 and Sr3Sc2Cu2Se2O5 exhibit optical band gaps energies of 2.9-3.0 eV. The excitonic luminescence with very fast emissions of similar to 30 ps were observed in both compounds even at room temperature. This feature of the compounds makes them suitable for fast scintillator applications. Our results suggest that the luminescence properties such as emission peak energies and lifetimes of these layered mixed-anion compounds can be controlled by changing their structure and composition.

Atomic force microscopy using three-dimensional imaging and numerical analyses showed that the IB irradiation reduced the surface roughness. Through the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it was revealed that the modification of the chemical composition due to the IB irradiation affected the state of the LC alignment. Increased polarizability of the surface and oxygen vacancies induced strong van der Waals forces between the In:ZnO film surface and the LC molecules, thereby subsequently achieving uniform and homogeneous LC alignment. The electro-optical (EO) characteristics of a twisted-nematic cell made with IB-irradiated In:ZnO film at an IB irradiation energy of 2200 eV, with which outstanding EO performance was observed. Therefore, using the solution-derived In:ZnO film with the IB irradiation as an alignment shows remarkable potential for use in LC device.

AB The present report demonstrates the efficacy of Raman mapping over X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in structural characterization of nanocrystalline Silicon (nc-Si) films having spatial heterogeneity in crystallinity and structure. The Si films were deposited via pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) technique at room temperature and elevated substrate temperature (T-s) of 400 degrees C and 700 degrees C, under vacuum (similar to 10-6 mbar). XRD showed that all films were polycrystalline while SE studies showed that only at 700 degrees C, the film was nanocrystalline in nature otherwise largely amorphous at lower T-s. This discrepancy in results is well explained by Raman maps which confirmed the presence of micron sized structures composed of nc-Si embedded in otherwise uniform matrix comprised of amorphous Silicon (a-Si) for films fabricated at room temperature and 400 degrees C whereas at 700 degrees C the uniform background matrix is dominated by nc-Si. The real and imaginary parts of pseudo dielectric function (epsilon(1),epsilon(2)) versus energy spectra obtained for films grown at RT, 400 degrees C, and 700 degrees C were modeled and fitted to substrate/film/top SiO2 layered structure. The simulated (epsilon(1),epsilon(2)) patterns are in excellent agreement with the recorded spectra. From the SE studies the band gap and thickness of the films were estimated. Band gap energy was found to vary from 1.35 to 1.30 eV approximately with increasing T-s from room temperature to 400 degrees C, then gradually increases to 1.55 eV at 700 degrees C. The variation of other optical constants of the films as a function of T-s also reflects the structural transition from amorphous-like to nanocrystalline-like with increasing T-s.

AB In this paper, Er-doped carbon quantum dots (Er-CQDs) is first incorporated into CdS quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) for broadening light absorption range and accelerating electron transport. Er-CQDs are prepared by hydrothermal method forming Er-CQDs/TiO2 film. The CdS quantum dots (QDs) are deposited on Er-CQDs/TiO2 film by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, constituting CdS/Er-CQDs/TiO2 photoanode. The structural and optical properties of the CQDs and CdS/Er-CQDs/TiO2 photoanode are characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis, FL and PL techniques. The composition and morphology are confirmed by XRD, EDX, SEM and TEM techniques. The optical properties of the influence of Er-CQDs on photovoltaic performance of CdS QDSSCs is studied by electrochemical methods. The experiment data show that the photovoltaic performance of CdS/Er-CQDs/TiO2 working electrode can greatly be enhanced compared that of CdS/TiO2. In comparison, the PCE increases from 0.34% of CdS/TiO2 device to 0.43% of CdS/CQDs/TiO2 device, whose escalating rate is 26.45%. Furthermore, the PCE increases from 0.34% of CdS/TiO2 device to 0.59% of CdS/Er-CQDs/TiO2 device, whose escalating rate reaches 73.53%.

AB Chalcogenide glasses (GhGs) are quoted as a key material for the development of infrared technologies due to its unique optical properties. The right choice of processing technique is crucial to reach progress in this field, especially when achieving the nanoscale, to further comprise new functionalities to ChGs. Herein, we demonstrated the sub-wavelength self-organization of ChG with hierarchical nano/micro control by using ultrafast laser processing, representing an important step towards the fabrication of photonic devices of tailored architectures. Particularly, those findings are demonstrated through laser induced forward transfer with femtosecond pulses applied to As2S3 thin films, which enabled the controlled deposition of nanostructures within a micrometric region (with resolution on the order of 3 mu m). The self-organized patterns exhibits periodicity with subwavelength dimensions on the order of lambda/4, with lambda similar to 800 nm. In the best of our knowledge, the investigation addressed herein correspond to the first demonstration of self- organization of ChG using direct laser writing, extending the applicability of the method for materials nanostructuring.

AB Novel Eu3+ doped Ba2Gd5B5O17 phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reaction technique. The phase identification and photoluminescence properties were investigated through XRD, FE-SEM, photoluminescence (PL), decay curves and temperature dependent PL spectral measurements. The XRD studies confirm the formation of single phase Ba2Gd15B5O17 phosphors and the addition of Eu3+ ions does not modify host lattice crystal structure. From FE-SEM analysis, it is noticed that prepared phosphors are comprise of micro-particles with an average particle size about 5.2 mu m. Under the excitation of 396 nm, as-prepared Ba2Gd5-xEuxB5O17 phosphors exhibited intense red emission and their PL intensity was increased with the increase of Eu3+ content up to x = 0.5, beyond that it was decreased for higher Eu3+ ion concentration due to concentration quenching effect. In the present work, non-radiative energy transfer was responsible for concentration quenching and the critical distance of energy transfer was found to be 11.3 (.)angstrom. Further, the PL spectra were characterized through CIE 1931 diagram to explore the dominant emission color. Furthermore, the R/O ratio, color purity, internal quantum efficiency and activation energy for thermal quenching effect were calculated for studied Ba2Gd4.5Eu0.5B5O17 phosphor. The obtained results were compared with the previously reported literature and discussed in detail.

AB Praseodymium doped terbium aluminum garnet (Pr:TAG) magneto-optical ceramics with different doping concentrations were fabricated by vacuum pre-sintering and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-treatment from the co-precipitated Pr:TAG nanopowders. It is found that all the as-synthesized powders exhibit a pure TAG phase and show good dispersity. The in-line transmittance of Pr:TAG ceramics fabricated by pre-sintering at 1700 degrees C for 20 h and HIP post-treating at 1700 degrees C for 3 h decreases from 80.6% to 76.3% at 1064 nm with the Pr3+ doping concentration increasing from 0 at% to 2.0 at%. The Verdet constant of the 2.0 at% Pr:TAG ceramics at 633 nm is -189.8 rad T-1 m(-1), which is 42% larger than that of the commercial TGG single crystals (-134 rad T-1 m(-1)). The superior characteristics of the Pr:TAG ceramics indicate that they have great potential to meet the increasing requirements for magneto-optical devices used in the visible and near-infrared wavelength.

AB Chemical sensing in living systems demands optical sensors that are bright, stable, and sensitive to the rapid dynamics of chemical signaling. Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) efficiently convert near infrared (NIR) light to higher energy emission and allow biological systems to be imaged with no measurable background or photobleaching, and with reduced scatter for subsurface experiments. Despite their advantages as imaging probes, UCNPs have little innate chemical sensing ability and require pairing with organic fluorophores to act as biosensors, although the design of stable UCNP-fluorophore hybrids with efficient upconverted energy transfer (UET) has remained a challenge. Here, we report Yb3+ - and Er3+-doped UCNP-fluorophore conjugates with UET efficiencies up to 88%, and photostabilities 100-fold greater by UET excitation than those of the free fluorophores under direct excitation. Despite adding distance between Er3+ donors and organic acceptors, thin inert shells significantly enhance overall emission without compromising UET efficiency. This can be explained by the large increase in quantum yield of Er3+ donors at the core/shell interface and the large number of fluorophore acceptors at the surface. Sensors excited by UET show increases in photostability well beyond those reported for other methods for increasing the longevity of organic fluorophores, and those covalently attached to UCNP surface polymers show greater chemical stability than those directly coordinated to the nanocrystal surface. By conjugating other fluorescent chemosensors to UCNPs, these hybrids may be extended to a series of NIR-responsive biosensors for quantifying the dynamic chemical populations critical for cell signaling.

The structure and morphology of the sample were examined using XRD and SEM techniques, respectively. Fully dense MgO ceramics with nearly no pores and a grain size above 30 pm were obtained with a reality density of 99.8%. The highest transmittance of the ceramic sample was close to 75% in the broad range from 400 to 1100 nm. Dielectric constant was calculated based on experimental data. The Verdet constant in VIS-IR spectrum was determined. The magnesium oxide transparent ceramics can be considered a promising material for visible and infrared windows.

AB The main losses in solar cells result from the incomplete utilization of the solar spectrum. Via the addition of an upconverting layer to the rear side of a solar cell, the otherwise-unused sub-bandgap photons can be utilized. In this paper, we demonstrate an efficiency enhancement of a silicon solar cell under real sunlight due to upconversion of sub-bandgap photons. Sunlight was concentrated geometrically with a lens with a factor of up to 50 suns onto upconverter silicon solar cell devices. The upconverter solar cell devices (UCSCDs) were also measured indoors using a solar simulator. To correct for differences in the spectral distribution between real sunlight and the solar simulator a spectral mismatch correction is required and is especially important to properly predict the performance when a non-linear response (e.g. upconversion) is involved. By applying a spectral mismatch correction, good agreement between the solar simulator measurements and the outdoor measurements using real sunlight was achieved. The method was tested on two different upconverter powders, beta-NaYF4: 25% Er3+ and Gd2O2S: 10% Er3+, which were both embedded in a polymer. We determined additional photocurrents due to upconversion of 9.4 mA/cm(2) with beta-NaYF4 and 8.2 mA/cm(2) with Gd2O2S under 94-suns concentration. Our results show i) the applicability of measurements using standard solar cell characterization equipment for predicting the performance of non-linear solar devices, and ii) underline the importance of applying proper mismatch corrections for accurate prediction of the performance of such non-linear devices.

AB In order to study the structure and analyze the performance, a series of BaWO4 with different Sm3+ -doped concentration crystal particles were synthesized successfully via a low temperature molten salt method in LiNO3-KNO3 molten salt systems. For structural characterization, the phase and morphology of as-prepared powders were detected by XRD and SEM. It was clear that octahedron-type particles confirmed the scheelite-type tetragonal structure with space group I4(1)/a. The effect of different contents of Sm3+ on the BaWO4 crystal structure was studied by Rietveld refinement techniques and the change of the optical band gap. As for the luminescent properties, the Sm3+ doped phosphors under 403 nm (H-6(5/2)-F-4(7/2)) excitation, exhibited characteristic luminescent of (4)G(5)(/2)-H-6(5/2), H-6(7/2), H-6(9/2) transition of the Sm3+ ion. It was found that the optimal concentration involved in luminescence was about 3mol%. The critical distance between the Sm3+ ions was 1.852 nm. The mainly dominant mechanism of concentration quenching and corresponding CIE color coordinate were elaborated in details. These results indicated as-prepared phosphors could be suitable as single-doped yellow light emitters with only single-phased for solid state lighting applications.

AB Vertically well-aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs) with good crystallization quality and obvious UV photo-luminescence (PL) characteristics were grown by hydrothermal method and Ar plasma etching. Schottky diodes were made by evaporating Pt dots on these ZnO NRs. The effects of Ar plasma etching on the PL and Schottky properties of the prepared ZnO NRs were investigated. Compared with the as-grown ZnO NRs, the UV and visible peak area ratio in the PL spectra increased from 3.8 to 840 with decreased reverse current from 10(-3) A to 10(-6) A, and increased current on/off ratio of the ZnO NRs Schottky diode from 1 to 102 after 60-min Ar plasma etching. The results suggest that the low-energy Ar plasma etching is an effective method to promote the performance of the Pt/ZnO NRs diode by improving the crystallization quality of the ZnO NRs.

AB We have developed the Ba2SiO4: Eu2+-Er3+ persistent phosphor. The vacuum referred binding energy (VRBE) diagram of the Ba2SiO4 host with the 4f ground states of divalent and trivalent lanthanide ions in the host band gap was constructed from the obtained spectroscopic data and the Dorenbos's procedure. From the constructed diagram, the VRBE values of the conduction band (CB) bottom and valence band (VB) top were estimated to be -0.66 and -8.27 eV, respectively. From the energy gap between the CB bottom and 4f ground states of divalent lanthanide ions, we selected the Er3+ ion as an efficient co-dopant because the trap depth was estimated to be 0.64 eV, suitable for improving the persistent luminescence duration. The Eu2+-Er3+-codoped sample showed persistent luminescence intensity of over 0.32 mcd/m(2) for 7 h duration. The initial persistent luminance intensity of the Eu2+-2%Er3+-codoped sample was found to be 250 times stronger than that of the only Eu2+-doped sample.

AB Tamoxifen is the most common antiestrogen used in the chronic treatment of breast cancer. In these cells, it mainly binds to intracellular receptors (estrogen receptor alpha, ER alpha) and antagonizes the binding of its cognate ligand, 17 beta-estradiol, thereby preventing uncontrolled hormone-dependent cellular proliferation and growth. In the last decade, in our laboratories we have developed and characterized different tamoxifen derivatives, including a novel fluorescent tamoxifen conjugate: FLTX1. FLTX1 is formed by the covalent binding of tamoxifen to a common fluorescent biomarker NBD. This new prodrug was originally designed as a fluorescent biomarker to localize intracellular targets, which not only keeps the pharmacological activity of tamoxifen but also adds a luminescent functionality. Strikingly, the quantum efficiency of FLTX1 is so high that laser emission has been obtained as an emerging property. In this review, we will show its laser properties under three different configurations. First, as amplified spontaneous emission or mirrorless laser; second, through the evanescent field of WGMs of a ring resonator around an optical fiber; and finally as random laser in uterine tissues impregnated with the prodrug.
   Further, we observed another emergent property for FLTX1: this molecule, but not tamoxifen alone or NBD, was able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon irradiation. This property is extremely interesting as FLTX1 might be used for photodynamic therapy. Under this paradigm, FLTX1 would act as a sensitizer in ER alpha-overexpressing cells (which feature the most prevalent form of hormone-dependent breast cancer), causing cell death in ER alpha + cells but reducing damage to other non-cancer (healthy) cells or surrounding tissues. We show here time resolved fluorescence results that suggest molecular aggregations, which could explain the subsequent generation of ROS. This is an original cancer therapy strategy that combines the pharmacological properties of a new tamoxifen derivative and its laser dye features with a highly selective photodynamic therapy.

AB Metamaterial absorbers, due to their potential applications in the field of photonics, are vastly studied in the last decade. Herein, we present a novel design of a resonant metamaterial absorber in the terahertz (THz) region based on numerical simulations. This perfect THz absorber, due to its symmetry, is highly independent on the polarization state of an incident plane wave. Moreover, the absorber is insensitive to a wide range of incident angle from 0 to 70 degrees. The absorbance approaches unity at a resonance frequency of 3.74 THz. The absorber shows remarkable results even at the two extreme incident angles, e.g. a minimum absorbance value of similar to 80% was recorded at an incident angle of 70 degrees. With this promising performance, the proposed THz absorber can serve as a possible sensing device for transparent analytes adsorbed on it. For this structure, aluminum and TiO2 are used. Both materials are commonly available for manufacturing photonic devices.

AB We study the origin of fast-response photocurrent in ZnO system grown by dc-unbalanced magnetron sputtering. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements show that ZnO thin film is sensitive to UV-visible wavelength and the response time is about 5 ms. This typical sensitivity is related to the contribution of native point defects in electrical transport, as indicated by a space-charge-limited current regime. I-V curves in vacuum, Ar, and O-2 environments reveal that oxygen vacancies (V-o) play an important role in adsorption and desorption processes. Using absorption and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy, the presence of V-o is confirmed and dominates even at low temperature. The strong contribution of V-o promotes low excitonic absorption, resulting in low photocurrent and fast-response detector. We propose that fast-response ZnO photodetector is not only originated from Schottky barrier but also from V-o-related defect states. This result is important to improve the functionalities of ZnO for optoelectronic applications.

AB Novel glasses and glass ceramics with compositions corresponding to stoichiometric lithium and barium disilicates and doped with different combinations of Ce3+, Eu2+'(3+), Tb3+, and Dy3+ have been fabricated and studied as prospective light converters for white high-power light emitting diodes and laser diodes. Spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and structural analysis have been employed. The emission spectra and CIE color coordinates of these materials evidence their good prospective as phosphors for white light sources. Structural analysis proves a high level of crystallization of the ceramics fabricated by annealing the glasses, while spectroscopic study revealed the influence of crystallization on the emission properties of this system. The results show a high potential of these materials be exploited as temperature-resistant phosphors in high-power white light emitting diodes.

AB Superposition model (SPM) analysis is employed for determination of the crystal field parameters (CFPs) for Co2+ ions doped into PbMoO4 crystal. SPM calculations utilize structural data to model parameters spectroscopically measured for the dopant ions. The CFPs predicted by SPM assuming axial site symmetry serve as input for the CFA/MSH package, which incorporates the CF analysis (CFA) and the microscopic spin Hamiltonian (MSH) modules. This approach enables modeling of the optical energy levels as well as the axial SH parameters: zero-field splitting parameter (ZFSP) D and g(i) factors: g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to). The theoretical SH parameters are matched with the ones deduced from experimental electron magnetic resonance (EMR; EPR) data for Co2+(3d(7)) ion using projection of g(i) for the effective spin (S) over tilde = 3/2 onto g(i) for the fictitious spin S' = 1/2. Various structural models are considered to predict the CFPs and thus ZFSPs. The local distortion polar angles Delta theta in the vicinity Co2+ ions in PbMoO4 are obtained for tetrahedral (Mo6+) and dodecahedral (Pb2+) sites for two possible structural configurations, thus confirming the structural distortions induced by Co2+ doping. This enables discerning between Co2+ ions located at the Pb2+ sites and those at the Mo6+ sites. The experimental data available for one type of the two observed Co2+ complexes in PbMoO4 are reanalyzed.

AB Good quality single crystals of 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine 4-nitrophenol (AMP4N) were successfully grown by slow evaporation solution technique (SEST) at room temperature using methanol as solvent. The grown crystal was subjected to single crystal XRD (SXRD) and its structure was solved by the direct method using SHELXS program and refined using SHELXL program. The Hirshfeld surfaces analysis was carried out to define theoretically electron density boundary surfaces between the molecules in a grown crystal, which are useful to analyze and view the intermolecular interactions. The powder XRD (PXRD) was carried out to identify the crystalline planes and its strain was also calculated by the Williamson-Hall equation. C-13 and H-1 NMR were recorded to interpret the environment of the molecular structure of the AMP4N crystal. Functional groups of AMP4N crystal were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis. The optical quality of the grown crystal was analyzed by UV-Vis NIR spectral analysis. The grown crystal has good optical transparency in the range 410-1100 nm. The thermal behaviour of the crystal has been investigated by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Chemical etching study was carried out and the etch pit density (EPD) was calculated. The laser damage threshold (LDT) was measured under single-shot mode using an Nd: YAG laser at 532 nm. The third-order nonlinear optical properties such as refractive index (n(2)), absorption coefficient (beta) and susceptibility (chi((3))) were studied using the Z-scan technique at 532 nm with a continuous wave (CW) solid-state laser.

AB Methylammonium lead halide perovskites have received substantial attention in the research photovoltaic communities, because of excellent optoelectronic properties, including long electron-hole diffusion distance, large absorption coefficients in the UV-Vis spectral region, low-cost, solution-based processing and low binding energy of exciton. However, the crystal defects of perovskite films such as pinholes, defect and grain boundaries lead to carrier capture, trapping and scattering, so that reduce carrier mobility in the channel, which has become the bottleneck of high device performance and limited the application in photo detection. Here we report a simple and straightforward strategy based on a multi-step annealing process, which can effectively improves the coverage, smoothness, uniformity and crystallinity by restraining defects of pinhole formation. The field-effect mobilities of perovskite photodetector treated by one-step (OS) direct annealing method at room temperature shows mobility as 0.256 (0.129) cm(2)V( -l)s(-1) for holes (electrons), which increase to 2.32 (1.18) cm(2)V (-1)s( -1) for that treated by muti-step (MS) annealing method. The latter exhibits high figure of merit as detectivity of 8.94 x 10(11) Jones, a responsivity of 32 A/W and a short response time of 42 mu s. Moreover, it shows better stability with polymethylmethacrylate film covered, which can maintain 90% of initial performance for 10 days in ambient air. These findings demonstrate that MS annealing methods is simple yet effective and feasible to prepared high-efficient perovskite based photo detectors.

AB The evolution of research on luminescent phosphors led to research on materials doped with rare earth ions (RE3+), not only because of their photoluminescent properties, but also for their potential applications in photonics. The search for new photoluminescent materials has led to an investigation of the photoluminescence of RE3+ present in an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) matrix. This oxide has a transparent window on the short ultraviolet to near infrared, excellent mechanical properties and good chemical stability. Within this context, this work aims to obtain Al2O3: Er3+/Yb3+. The preparation of Al2O3:Er3+/Yb(3+ )involved two synthesis processes. For the co-precipitation process, rings of aluminum cans were used as precursors, and for the sol-gel process, the precursor used was tri-sec-butoxide aluminum. From the XRD results, high heat-treatment temperatures were observed to favor the formation of the alpha-Al2O3 phase and low temperatures were observed to favor the formation the gamma-Al2O3 phase. The analysis of the photoluminescence emission spectra when excited at 980 nm, showed the up-conversion phenomenon with an emission in the visible region. The emission spectra also showed emission between 1400 and 1650 nm, with a maximum at about 1530 nm. The materials exhibit efficient energy absorption in the infrared region, with light emission in the visible region. Furthermore, the spectra show an intense emission in the infrared region assigned to the I-4(13/2 )-> I-4(15/2) transition of Er3+, demonstrating excellent potential to be used in optical amplifier device at the third telecommunications window.

AB The confluence of technological advances in optics and the need of a deeper understanding of cellular processes have boosted the development of diverse optical microrheometric techniques. These experimental methods have allowed a better understanding of not only the viscoelastic behaviour of cells, but also different intracellular processes. In this work, the fundamentals of the most commonly used optical microrheometric techniques and their more relevant applications in the biological field are expounded for a non-specialist public. In particular, the promising and emerging use of upconverting luminescent particles as probes in this field is highlighted, as they could be the cornerstone of the development of new methods or the improvement of already existing microrheometric techniques.

AB We propose a hybrid photonic structure to realize guided-wave second harmonic generation (SHG) from near-infrared (NIR at 1064 nm) to visible (green light at 532 nm) wavelength with nearly single-mode output. The periodically arrayed tracks have been produced in KTiOPO4 nonlinear crystal by femtosecond laser writing, which enable efficient light field confinement with cladding-like refractive index distributions. Particularly, the track-cladding surrounded central region is free of any tracks, which serves as waveguiding cores. With designed core diameters, the structures could enable single-mode propagation at selected wavelength regime on purpose. In this work, the hybrid structure contains a larger-input core section and a connected smaller-output core section, which in principle supports nearly single mode for either fundamental pump beam or second harmonic beam in the input and output channel, respectively. Based on this hybrid structure we implement nearly single-mode SHG at 532 nm, and comparable normalized conversion efficiency (1.1%/W/cm) in the continuous-wave (CW) regime is obtained with respect to that (1.2%/W/cm) of multimode SHG from a single large-core channel structure. This work paves the way to realize mode profile controlling for selected wavelength by using laser-written arrayed tracks.

AB Hierarchical microstructures of ZnAl2O4:Ho3+ (0.25-5 mol %) nanophosphors (NPs) were synthesized via solvothermal route using Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as a bio-surfactant. The effect of EGCG concentration on the morphology was studied in detail. The Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies confirm the cubic phase of the samples. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra exhibit peaks at similar to 540, 553 and 666 nm were due to transitions F-5(4)-> I-5(8), S-5(2) -> I-5(8) and F-5(5) -> I-5(8) of Ho3+ ions, respectively. Thermoluminescence (TL) properties of ZnAl2O4: Ho3+ (0.25-5 mol %) NPs were studied after exposure of Co-60 gamma-rays at a warming rate of 6 degrees Cs-1. The TL intensity was found to increase with gamma-dose. The kinetic parameters have been determined using Chen's method from the deconvoluted glow curve. The CIE Chromaticity co-ordinates of all the prepared phosphors were located in the blue region. The above results clearly evident that the optimized Ho3+ activated ZnAl2O4 NPs was a promising single phased phosphor for WLED's and dosimetry applications.

AB A novel design of circular hybrid photonic crystal fiber (CH-PCF) with high nonlinearity and high numerical aperture (NA) is introduced in this paper. The numerical simulation results are obtained by using finite element method (FEM) and selecting finer mesh. Some fundamental optical parameters such as nonlinearity, effective area, scattering loss, power fraction and NA for the two orthogonal polarized modes are rigorously evaluated. Significant improvement of PCFs in terms of the non-linearity and NA are demonstrated by carefully investigating of the geometrical parameters of structure. The reported design undoubtedly confirms high nonlinearity of 128873.1183 W(-1 )km(-1) for x-polarization and 152134.1052 W(-1 )km(-1) for y-polarization respectively at the optical wavelength of 0.5 mu m Simultaneously, outmost NA of 0.57 and 0.59 are found at optical wavelength lambda = 2.5 mu m. So, the obtained outcomes make the proposed PCF a prominent candidate in super continuum generation as well as all optical signal processing applications.

AB Pyrazolines are reported with a broad range of bioactivities, excellent fluorescence properties and easy synthesis. But unfortunately, there is no or, very limited information available about their pH sensor application. Additionally, there is a little information about "off-on-off" type of pH sensors in literature. To fulfill the gap in literature and try to find out new possible "off-on-off" pH sensor, in this study it was planned to investigate the changes in the photo-physical properties of four pyrazolines D1-D4, 4-(5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(4-substitutedphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzene sulfonamide, in water and different pH (2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12) in which on phenyl was H (D1), F (D2), Cl (D3) and Br (D4). The compound Dl exhibited excellent fluorescence properties and high fluorescence quantum yields in water. When the compounds D2-D4 which have electron-withdrawing substituents F, Cl and Br in D2-D4, respectively, were considered, it was observed that fluorescence quenching occurred in the molecules in question due to increased intersystem crossing probability while D1 did not show fluorescence quenching. However, the photo-physical properties of the compounds D1-D4 displayed important changes as a function of pH. It follows from these important changes that the compounds D1-D4 have "off-on-off" type of fluorescent pH sensor properties based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). These results indicated that these pyrazoline derivatives would be able to act as an efficient "off-on-off" fluorescent pH sensor in biological, environmental and medical etc. areas.

AB A new and optically good transparent Brucinium Chlorate di-hydrate (BCDH) single crystal was grown from aqueous solution by the slow evaporation technique at a pH of 5 with dimension 11 x 4 x 2 mm(3) over a period of 40-45 days. It belongs to the monoclinic crystal system with non-centrosymmetric space group C2 which is identified by single crystal XRD analysis. Percentage of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are confirmed by chemical CHN analysis. The development faces were identified by morphological studies. The BCDH crystal possesses 78% transmittance which is confirmed by UV-Visible analysis. The presences of various functional groups were confirmed by vibrational analysis. Piezoelectric charge co-efficient (d(33)) of BCDH crystal was found to be 4 p C/N. The frequency doubling ability of title compound was analyzed using Kurtz and Perry powder method and its output were compared with standard materials. The LDT value of the BCDH crystal was found to be 3.51 GW/cm(2). The electron excitation and life time measurements of the molecules in grown BCDH crystal was studied by Fluorescence spectral analysis. The stability and various decomposition stages of BCDH crystal were scrutinized by different thermal analysis.

AB In this paper, we present a graphene-based plasmonic electro-optical multi-logic gate (MLG) operating at THz frequency. The designed MLG supports AND, XNOR, and NOR logic gates in a graphene-dielectric-metal structure, simultaneously. The propagation length of the surface plasmons (SPs), stimulated by a 27.35 THz incident TM wave, is about 62 times larger in ON state compared to OFF state. Simulation results by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method show the minimum extinction ratio (ER) of 29.41, 97.38, and 29.40 dB for AND, XNOR, and NOR logic gates, respectively. Also, the minimum modulation depth (MD) is obtained 99.99% for XNOR and 99.88% for AND and NOR logic gates. The proposed MLG provides a high extinction ratio and ultra-compact logical block for using in digital processing circuits and THz applications.

These two complementary experimental approaches are based on different calibration routes with a nanocomposite model and fused-silica as a reference material for THG, and pNa molecules for THS. Similar and consistent absolute values of <chi((3))(NPS)> (above 10(-18) m(2)/V-2) are derived and discussed according to the particular orientation averaging procedure that holds for each experimental configuration for a 1064 nm excitation wavelength.

AB This work is devoted to the development of new types of advanced composite scintillators based on the single crystalline films (SCFs) of Lu3Al5O12(LuAG) garnet, doped with Pr3+ and Sc3+ ions, and substrate from single crystals (SCs) of Ce3+ doped LuAG using the technology of liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). We show the possibility of the simultaneous registration of alpha-particles and gamma-quanta by means of separation of the decay kinetics of SCF and crystal parts of such composite scintillators. Namely, the significant differences in the pulse height spectra and the scintillation decay kinetics of LuAG:Pr SCF/LuAG:Ce SC and LuAG:Sc SCF/LuAG:Ce SC composite scintillators under excitation by a-particles of Am-241 (5.5 MeV) source and gamma-quanta of Cs-137 (662 keV) source are observed. For these reasons, such types of composite scintillators can be applied for separation of the signals coming from their film and crystal parts at the registration of the mixed radiation fluxes of a-particles and gamma-quanta.

AB A series of Mn4+-doped multi-component garnet ceramics comprising Sn4+ ions at octahedral sites, namely Ca3SnScGaSi2O12, Ca2YSnMgAlSi2O12, Ca2YSnGaGa2SiO12 and Ca2YSn2Ga3O12, were synthesized and investigated as red emitting phosphors for warm white pc-LEDs. It turned out that all synthesized phosphors exhibit rather poor thermal stability of the Mn4+ luminescence which is almost completely quenched at room temperature. The low thermal quenching temperature of Me + luminescence for these phosphors is related to the low energy of the Mn4+ T-4(2) and O2-- Mn4+ charge transfer states which can serve as quenchers for Mn4+ luminescence. It is proposed that a higher thermal stability of Mn4+ luminescence can be expected for compounds in which Mn4+ ions substitute for host cations having a lower charge and/or smaller size than Mn4+.

AB The fluorescence lifetime of the Mn4+ 2Eg ->(4)A(2g) transition in commercial Mg28Ge7.55O32F15.04 (MFG) and K2SiF6 (KSF) phosphors are measured in the temperature region of 13-600 K. In MFG, the observed decrease in the lifetime with increasing temperature is correlated with increasing probability of phonon induced transitions (vibronic emission) without any contribution of nonradiative transitions. In KSF, the decrease in lifetime in the temperature region of 13-500 K is associated with an increase in the vibronic transition probability. Above 500 K, the rapid decrease in the lifetime is correlated with the onset of non-radiative relaxation. The differences between the thermal quenching behavior of Mn4+ luminescence in the two phosphors in explained with respect to the energy position of the T-4(2g) state.

AB The morphological, structural and optical properties of a new chiral imine, namely (S)-(+)-[(1-phenyl)-N-(1-benzo [b]tiofen 2-yl)methylidene]ethylamine (Bt), are reported. Photoluminescence showed a band of intense green emission located at similar to 525 nm. The absorbance spectra displayed bands associated with pi ->pi* and n ->pi* electronic transitions. The band gap was quantified by two electronic transitions at similar to 3.5 and similar to 4.7 eV, confirming those observed by absorbance. XRD studies showed a monoclinic phase. Additionally, by using Time Depending-Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT), the electronic and optical properties were examined.

AB We report an experimental investigation of the photoluminescence (PL) activities detected in as-drawn and gamma-ray irradiated samples of a microstructured optical fiber elaborated with a silica-based core doped with Bismuth ions. The presence of several visible emission bands is revealed and characterized under 325 nm laser excitation. In both samples, four narrow emission bands are studied and analyzed. They are similarly bleached by a long UV laser exposure times. In addition, time-resolved luminescence data show that all these bands possess a similar lifetime of similar to 4 mu s Data analysis indicated that the energy levels scheme of the point defects responsible for these bands consists of: one above 5eV, one at similar to 3.6 eV, and at least one in the range 2.6 similar to 2.8 eV and of the ground one. As a consequence, even if the exact structural model cannot yet be fully identified, we suggest that the bands originate from color centers related to the Bismuth ions.

AB In this paper we report the study of down-shifting silica-zirconia glass and glass-ceramic films doped by Tb3+ ions and Ag nanoaggregates, which combine the typical spectral properties of the rare-earth-ions with the broadband sensitizing effect of the metal nanostructures. Na-Tb co-doped silica-zirconia samples were obtained by a modified sol-gel route. Dip-coating deposition followed by annealing for solvent evaporation and matrix densification were repeated several times, obtaining a homogeneous crack-free film. A final treatment at 700 degrees C or 1000 degrees C was performed to control the nanoscale structural properties of the samples, resulting respectively in a glass (G) or a glass-ceramic (GC), where tetragonal zirconia nanocrystals are surrounded by an amorphous silica matrix. Ag introduction was then achieved by ion-exchange in a molten salt bath, followed by annealing in air to control the migration and aggregation of the metal ions. The comparison of the structural, compositional and optical properties are presented for G and GC samples, providing evidence of highly efficient photo-luminescence enhancement in both systems, slightly better in G than in GC samples, with a remarkable increase of the green Tb3+ PL emission at 330 nm excitation: 12 times for G and 8 times for GC samples. Furthermore, after Ag-exchange, the shape of Tb3+ excitation resembles the one of Ag ions/nanoaggregates, with a broad significant absorption in the whole UV-blue spectral region. This broadband enhanced downshifting could find potential applications in lighting devices and in PV solar cells.

AB The efficiency of silicon based solar cell has increased only by 1% in past 15 years where as in 6 years the efficiency of Perovskite solar cell has got the pace and increased up to similar to 22%. Photovoltaic performance of lead free PerovskiteBiFeO(3) with graphene electrode and Ti/Ni/Cd doped BiFeO3 with graphene electrode has been compared in this work. The open circuit voltages of pure BFO, Ti doped BFO, Ni doped BFO, and Cd doped BFO are 0.49 V, 0.77 V, 0.56 V, 0.49 V respectively, and short circuit current densities are 273.44 mu A/cm(2), 7519 mu A/cm(2), 4217 mu A/cm(2), 285.61 mu A/cm(2) respectively. Comparative study of thin film formation through different methodologies like dipping, spray and spin are also analysed and observed, that 'Ti' doped BFO along with formation of layer by spinning process exerts significant improved performance of 3.043% of efficiency, however the model of this solar cell is observed 9.06% of efficiency by simulation.

AB A single-component white-emitting phosphor Sr9La(PO4)(5)(SiO4)F-2:Dy3+ pumped for n-UV-light emitting diodes was firstly presented by solid state method and the crystal structures, luminescence properties, especially the concentration quenching behaviors were discussed in detail. Accordingly, the quantum efficiencies as well as lifetime studies of Dy3+ in CLPGF phosphor were also carried out. The results revealed that the Sr9La(PO4)(5)(SiO4)F-2:Dy3+ phosphor could be efficiently excited in a broad wavelength ranging near ultraviolet (n-UV) regions, which matched perfectly with n-UV white light emitting diodes (w-LEDs) chips. Under the excitation at 349 nm, the phosphor exhibited three prominent emission peaks in the visible wavelength region located at 483, 578 and 670 nm, which is ascribed to the (4)F9/2(-) H-6(15/2), E-4(9)/2- H-6(13/2) and F-4(9)/2- H-6(11)/2 transitions of Dy3+, respectively. It was also proved that the dipole-dipole interactions results in the concentration quenching in Structure and luminescence properties of Sr9La(PO4)(5)(SiO4)F-2:Dy3+ single-component white-emitting phosphor for n-UV w-LEDs phosphors. Fascinatingly, when the temperature turned up to 150 degrees C, the emission intensity at 483 and 578 nm was 83.4 and 89.1% of the initial value at room temperature. Additional, the corresponding activation energy Delta E was determined to be 0.16999 and 0.17451 eV, which indicated the excellent thermal stability of the samples. All these findings demonstrated that as-prepared phosphors could act as a high-performance candidate for the application.

AB We have studied the structural and photophysical characteristics of a series of 1,8-naphthyridine-BF2 compounds in detail. The purpose of quantum-chemical calculations is to study the effect of electron-withdrawing (electron-donating) substituents and core-frame conjugation on the optical properties. The solvent effects are researched in toluene, CH2Cl2, THF, acetone, CH3CN and CH3OH solutions, respectively, by polarizable continuum model (PCM). The results show that the HOMO, LUMO, energy gaps, IP and EA of BF2 core compounds 1-3 containing 1,8-naphthyridine change regularly due to the different degrees of conjugation framework. However, the influence of the substituent changes on these molecules is not significant. The results also show that the maximum absorption wavelengths of the complexes exhibit blue shift as the polarity of the solvent increases from toluene to CH3OH. In addition, the absorption wavelengths of the studied molecules are red-shifted to some extent due to the increased conjugation in the central framework. All calculations reveal that the naphthyridine-BF2 compounds are expected to be a useful luminescent material for OLEDs.

AB Highly transparent MgAlON ceramics were fabricated by pressureless presintering and hot isostatic pressing. The deformation, hardness and fracture toughness of MgAlON transparent ceramics have been studied by nanoindentation technique. The indentation tests were performed with applied loads of 2-400 mN to investigate the variation in mechanical behaviors. It was found that the plastic deformation component dominated MgAlON ceramics at the applied loads from 2 mN to 200 mN. The resistance to plastic deformation decreased when the applied load increased. However, the micro-cracks induced by nanoindentation have been observed at the load above 200 mN. In addition, the true hardness (similar to 13.5 GPa) was determined based on the proportional sample resistance (PSR). Furthermore, the fracture toughness (2.2-2.7 MPa m(1/2)) was evaluated using Laugier's equation. This study lends credible the realization of mechanical properties of the MgAlON transparent ceramics in the design and practical applications.

AB The nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of native defect-rich ZnO single crystals were studied in details within the excitation of the continuous wave (CW) and pulsed laser radiation at 532 nm (2.33 eV). Analysis of the experimental data of optical elastic scattering, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), near infrared-visible-ultraviolet (NIR-Vis-UV) spectra recorded in reflection and absorption modes, and data of photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy confirmed the contribution of both intrinsic defects and their clusters, being determined before by neutron diffraction and XRD analysis. It was shown that the high sensitivity of the NLO diagnostics via self-action of a laser beam is due to the resonant excitation of the deep defects states at wavelength 532 nm. It was also demonstrated the correlation of the real and imaginary parts of the cubic NLO susceptibility with PL and FTIR spectroscopies data dealing with the defect bands manifestation, while the elastic optical scattering and Vis-NIR spectroscopy data - with the intrinsic defect content. High photoinduced polarizabilities of the excited states provide application of the refractive NLO response and the optical elastic scattering indicatrices analysis as an express nondestructive technique to reveal the deep defects content in the bulk ZnO.

AB Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) is an interesting absorber material for thin film solar cells. However, one of the key challenges for the kesterite-based solar cells is to improve the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) deficit, which is resultant of recombination at the interface of buffer/absorber. In this work, Cd-free n-type buffer layers with two different Mg-doped ZnO layers (Mg0.26Zn0.74O, Mg0.30Zn0.70O) have been examined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The most important electronic properties which are essential for the band offset study, ie. fermi level location, valence and conduction band offsets at the interface in the CZTSSe substrate, have been determined. The conduction band offset values for Mg0.26Zn0.74O, Mg0.30Zn0.70O buffer layers has been calculated experimentally. We have also established the correlation between device parameters and performances for dual ion beam sputtered ZnO buffer/CZTSSe-based heterojunction solar cells as a function of conduction band offset and the energy distribution of interface defects, to gain deeper understanding about the V-oc-deficit behavior from a high recombination rate at the buffer/kesterite interface using simulation study. From the simulation study, the values of the solar cell efficiency with Mg0.26Zn0.74O, Mg0.30Zn0.70O buffer layers are 10.18 and 10.25%, respectively, which are higher in comparison to those obtained by using conventional CdS buffer layer.

AB As a vital catecholamine neurotransmitter released by the brain in human central nervous system, dopamine (DA) plays an important role in a wide range of physiological functions and the mechanism of actions in human body, and its accurate detection is required in medicine. The present study reports a novel, simple and cost-effective nano-biosensor based on a thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) for the sensitive detection of DA in alkaline media. The assembled QDs-based biosensor showed a linear working range of 0.5-10 mu M and a detection limit of 0.35 mu M. The highest recovery of 97% was obtained by using the prepared biosensor for the detection of DA in human blood plasma samples. Additionally, the biosensor exhibited high selectivity toward DA without the interfering effects of biomolecules including some amino acids and chlorides. The concept of TGA-capped CdTe QDs will open up a new insight into the determination of DA in biological fluids where DA is at low levels.

AB We report a simple method for preparing flexible polymer film containing carbon quantum dots/N-doped ZnO (CQD/N-ZnO) nanoparticles, as UV shielding material. The polymer film showed an enhanced UV shielding capability with increasing of CQD/N-ZnO nanoparticles. The maximum of 47% of UV shielding capability was achieved with 1 wt.% of CQD/N-ZnO nanoparticles and two-order enhancement was achieved by controlling film thickness to 250 mu m. It was found that CQDs plays important role to promote compatibility of hydrophilic ZnO into hydrophobic polymer matrix without disturbing the transparency of the film. An excellent UV shielding capability of 85% and 92% was witnessed in 250 mu m thick polymer film under a UV lamp and direct daylight, respectively.

AB Optical thermometry based on the adjacent thermally coupled levels of rare earth ions has been widely studied in the high temperature range, and shows unobvious effect at low temperature range. In this work, we propose a new method to achieve optical thermometry in 10(similar to)300 K range through manipulating the energy transfer from WO66- to Ho3+. A comprehensive five-level rate-equation model is developed to establish the relation between lifetime ratios and temperature. It is found that the lifetime ratios of 540 nm (Ho3+) and 471 nm (WO66-) emissions are dependent on the phonon energy of Y2WO6 host and temperature. The values of sensor sensitivity reach the maximum 2.1% K-1 at 211 K in 30%Ho3+ doped Y2WO6, which is higher than the maximum of the reported phosphors at low temperature. It overcomes the shortcoming of unobvious thermal population of thermally coupled levels in low temperature range through traditional Boltzmann distributing method.

AB Curcumin based fluorescent NLOphore was synthesized. Solvent polarizability (SP) was found to be responsible for the solvatochromic nature of dye as confirmed from the multilinear regression analysis. DFT computations using global hybrid (B3LYP and BHHLYP) and range-separated hybrid (CAM-B3LYP) functionals with the basis set 6-31 + G(d,p) were performed to determine the linear as well as NLO properties. NLO response was measured using Z scan technique. The computed NLO values (beta o = 426.64 x 10(-30)esu) were found to be superior to that of urea (beta o = 0.371 x 10(-30)esu). The value of nonlinear absorption coefficient (beta) and third-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi)(3) were found to be 2.19 x 10(-12)(m/W) and is 2.09 x 10(-13)(e.s.u) respectively. The result of present work might be useful for the designing of curcumin based NLOphores for industrial applications.

AB Effect of magnetic field on the absorptive optical nonlinearity in ion beam sputtered as-deposited and annealed NiO thin films have been studied and the magnetic field dependent nonlinear absorption coefficients are obtained. As-deposited NiO thin film is more sensitive to magnetic field due to higher percentage of oxygen vacancies and shows gradual variation as well as sign reversal of nonlinear absorption coefficients with increase in applied magnetic field. In annealed film, we found increase in nonlinear absorption coefficient with increasing magnetic field.

AB The value-capture problem for innovators in the digital economy involves some different challenges from those in the industrial economy. It inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future R&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary.
   The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. If a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R&D efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation.

AB For firms at the center of platform-based ecosystems, Teece (2018) argues that dynamic capabilities can enable the firms to create and capture value by building ecosystems and designing appropriate business models. In line with the original Profiting From Innovation (PFI) framework, Teece (2018) also argues that complementary asset providers may be able to capture substantial value. Here we provide a theoretical analysis that explains the ways in which dynamic capabilities underpin not only value creation but also value capture by platform leaders. We propose that three types of dynamic capabilities at a minimum are critical for platform leaders: innovation capabilities, environmental scanning and sensing capabilities, and integrative capabilities for ecosystem orchestration. We further argue that integrative capabilities play a key role in improving the ability of platform leaders to capture value.

AB To spur technology transfer, emerging market policymakers often require foreign firms to form joint ventures (JVs) with domestic firms. Through knowledge spillovers, JVs may reduce technology acquisition costs for domestic firms. Yet domestic firm rents from JVs could discourage innovation through a cannibalization effect. Which force dominates is an empirical question. I address it with novel data on China's auto sector. In response to fuel economy standards requiring firms to upgrade technology or sacrifice quality, firms with JVs reduced quality and price relative to their counterparts. Consistent with cannibalization, firms with JVs drive the negative effect.

ID WORD-OF-MOUTH; CONSEQUENCES; CASCADES; ACCESS
AB Crowdfunding recently emerged as an alternative funding channel for entrepreneurs. We use pledge-level data from Startnext, the biggest German platform, to gain insights on funding dynamics and pledgers' motivations. We find that the majority of projects that eventually succeed are not on a successful track at 75% of their funding period. These late successes are boosted by information cascades during the final 25% of the funding duration. We conclude-in contrast with earlier literature-that project success is only partially path-dependent. While early pledges do anticipate project success, a lack of them does not necessarily mean that projects will fail. Interviews and questionnaire responses indicate that projects' communication efforts play a role in making severely under track projects succeed eventually. Moreover, our dataset uniquely allows us to quantify the extent of self funding. Self pledges account for about 10% of all initial pledges and 9% of all pledges that secure funding Nonetheless, the late surges at severely under track projects are mostly driven by external funders. Furthermore, we find no evidence of subsequent herding triggered by self pledges.

AB Systems integration encompasses both system design and management of supplier networks. We examine the "second face" of systems integration related to the organization and management of supplier networks. We analyze a unique dataset on the supply chains for three major U.S. weapon systems to examine how systems integrators balance the economies-of-scope benefits of general-purpose technologies and the benefits of horizontal supplier specialization. We show that horizontal specialization-an establishment's focus on a particular market-differs with distance from the systems integrator. Systems integrators derive the benefits of specialization primarily (though not exclusively) from their direct suppliers, and they access general-purpose technologies from lower-tier suppliers. Some of the lower-tier suppliers themselves integrate complex subsystems, belying the image of the supplier network as a "production pyramid" with simple firms at its base. We further find that the supply chains of the three weapon systems that we study are dominated by facilities whose main line of business is in non-defense markets, because of the large number of lower-tier suppliers that serve commercial markets. This demonstrates the importance of the supply chain as a source of commercial-military integration, linking defense production to the wider economy and casting doubt on the view that there is a "wall of separation" that prevents the U.S. defense effort from gaining access to civilian technologies.

AB This paper provides a unique perspective on knowledge ecosystems by studying their organization. Grounded in empirical evidence, we propose that knowledge ecosystems consist of users and producers of knowledge that are organized around a joint knowledge search. A distinction is drawn between knowledge ecosystems searching for a knowledge domain and those searching within an identified knowledge domain, respectively characterized as prefigurative and partial forms of organizing. In a knowledge ecosystem organized in prefigurative form (to identify a knowledge domain), actors whose participation is affiliated, self-resourced, and unobliged probe that domain to identify and establish shared knowledge as a basis for collective actorhood, with no formal rules or coordination mechanisms. In a knowledge ecosystem organized in partial form (where a knowledge domain has already been identified), actors search and reveal problem- and solution-related knowledge, participating though formal membership and access to resources, and their contributions are monitored. The present study contributes to the literature by 1) specifying the distinct types of joint search performed by knowledge ecosystems; 2) considering how the nature of joint search affects how knowledge ecosystems are organized; and 3) distinguishing two forms of organizing knowledge ecosystems, with a focus on participation and coordination.

AB Access to affordable lifesaving medicines is considered a human right. This leads to a question largely understudied in the catch-up literature on accumulation of industrial capabilities. Can the need to improve access to an essential commodity impact the sectoral catch-up trajectory of the corresponding industry? In 1996, Brazil initiated a policy of universal and free access to highly-active ARV therapy, which put an enormous pressure on the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH). In order to ensure an adequate supply of ARVs in the public healthcare system with a limited budget, MoH started negotiating price reductions for high-cost patented drugs, often deploying the threat of using compulsory licensing. Through a scoping review of the literature and construction of the Brazilian case study, the paper explores how the need to access is impacted by prior catch-up in the pharmaceutical sector and triggers in turn future sectoral catch-up. It shows that price negotiations may or may not impact both catch-up and access positively. Catch-up can provide bargaining strength in price negotiations and have a positive inter-temporal impact on both future catch-up and access. However, results suggest that only successful catch-up can lead to long term access, as the capabilities accumulated in aborted catch-up are not sufficient for large scale production of low cost essential medicines. Thus, industrial policy and health policy can impact one another and twining between catch-up and access can be helpful.

AB Background: Aim: Despite the availability of effective treatments for asthma, many patients still suffer from uncontrolled asthma. This study evaluates whether a single educational session could improve asthma control assessed by Asthma Control Test (ACT) score as well as knowledge of the inhaler device, knowledge of medication and inhalation technique.
   Methods: This prospective single blinded randomized controlled trial of 160 adults with asthma, examined the effectiveness of a single standardized, educational intervention, performed by a respiratory nurse specialist. The education provided to the intervention group consisted of basic information about asthma treatment and instructions on inhalation technique for about 10min. This additional education was not offered to the control group. In both groups ACT scores, knowledge of medication, knowledge of inhaler device and inhalation technique were assessed at baseline and after three months. Asthma was considered well-controlled when the ACT score exceeded 19.
   Results: At baseline there were no significant differences in patient demographics, degree of asthma control, knowledge of medication or device and inhalation technique between the intervention group and the control group. In the intervention group the educational session resulted in a significantly higher proportion of well-controlled asthma patients with an ACT > 19 (43% versus 77%) (p < 0.001) after three months. In the control group this proportion remained similar (57% versus 67%) (p > 0.1).
   We also observed improvements in knowledge of medication (p < 0.001), knowledge of device (p < 0.001) and inhalation technique (p = 0.004) in the intervention group and not in the control group.
   Conclusion: A single 10 min, educational session provided by a respiratory nurse specialist can substantially improve asthma control determined by the ACT score after three months.

AB Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and results in both substantial and increasing socioeconomic burden. Guidelines on COPD encourage primary care physicians to detect the disease at an early stage. Our main aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of COPD at the primary health care.
   Methods: 6466 patients were randomly selected in 22 Italian primary care practices (46% males, mean age 56 +/- 16 years) and were asked about respiratory symptoms and risk for any chronic respiratory disease including COPD. After a prior evaluation, 701 patients (51% males, mean age 59 +/- 15 years) were sent by General Practitioners (GPs) to Pulmonary Units (PU) for confirming the diagnosis. The agreement in diagnosing COPD between GPs and pulmonary diseases specialists was assessed by using Cohen's kappa (k) statistic.
   Results: Lack of precision in COPD diagnosis resulted in 13% of over-diagnosis and 59% of under-diagnosis. GPs were quite good in correctly excluding the patients who did not have COPD (specificity = 87%), but less good in diagnosing the patients with COPD (sensitivity = 41%). The risk of under-diagnosis was higher in people with age > 62 years and in current/ex-smokers, when compared to no COPD, whereas it was higher in subject < 62 years old and in those with no previous spirometry when compared to correctly diagnosed COPD.
   Conclusion: Our results confirm that COPD misdiagnosis is common in primary care and that under-diagnosis is a major problem. It is necessary to enhance COPD diagnosis and to reduce misdiagnosis in primary care settings.

AB This report is a summary of a workshop focusing on using telemedicine to facilitate the integrated care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty-five invited participants from 8 countries met for one and one-half days in Stresa, Italy on 7-8 September 2017, to discuss this topic. Participants included physiotherapists, nurses, a nurse practitioner, and physicians. While evidence-based data are always at the center of sound inference and recommendations, at this point in time the science behind telemedicine in COPD remains underdeveloped; therefore, this document reflects expert opinion and consensus. While telemedicine has great potential to expand and improve the care of our COPD patients, its application is still in its infancy. While studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in some patient-centered outcomes, the results are by no means consistently positive. Whereas this tool may potentially reduce health care costs by moving some medical interventions from centralized locations in to patient's home, its cost-effectiveness has had mixed results and telemonitoring has yet to prove its worth in the COPD population. These discordant results should not be unexpected in view of patient complexity and the heterogeneity of telemedicine. This is reflected in the very limited support offered by the National Health Services to a wider application of telemedicine in the integrated care of COPD patients. However, this situation should challenge us to develop the necessary science to clarify the role of telemedicine in the medical management of our patients, providing a better and definitive scientific basis to this approach.

AB Objective: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed new genetic variants behind self-reported individual circadian preference, a distinct biological trait that is fairly stable during adulthood. In this study we analyze whether these genetic variants associate with objectively measured sleep timing from childhood to adolescence, over a nine-year period, with self-reported circadian preference during late adolescence.
   Methods: The participants (N = 100, 61% girls) came from a community cohort from Finland born in 1998. Sleep midpoint was measured with actigraphy at 8, 12 and 17 years. Circadian preference was self-reported at the age of 17 years. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted at 12 years of age from the Illumina OmniExpress Exome 1.2 bead array data. Weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated based on top SNPs from a recent GWAS for morningness-eveningness in an adult population.
   Results: The PRS for circadian preference towards morningness was associated with earlier sleep midpoint from childhood to adolescence. When the time points were analyzed separately, the association between genetic tendency towards morning preference and earlier sleep midpoint was strongest among the 17-year-olds. Furthermore, the shift towards later sleep rhythm from early to late adolescence was milder for those with a higher PRS for morning preference. PRS for morning preference was also associated with self-reported circadian preference towards morningness in late adolescence.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that genetic variants found for circadian preference in adults are already associated with objective sleep timing during childhood and adolescence, and predict individual developmental sleep trajectories from childhood onwards. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: This study translated the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale-revised (ASHSr) into Persian and aimed to validate its psychometric properties using classical test theory and Rasch analyses.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 14-18 (n = 389; 199 males) and their parents in Iran participated in the study. Each adolescent wore a wrist actigraphy device during sleep time and completed the ASHSr, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A parent of each adolescent completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC).
   Results: The construct validity of the ASHSr was supported by both classical test theory (factor loadings from confirmatory factor analysis [CFA] = 0.64 to 0.88; corrected item-total correlations = 0.70 to 0.92; test-retest reliability = 0.72 to 0.90) and Rasch analyses (infit mean square = 0.73 to 1.30; outfit mean square = 0.74 to 1.32). ASHSr had significantly negative associations with DASS subscales (beta = -0.15 to -0.42, ps < 0.001) and GHQ (beta = -0.663, p < 0.001). Known-group validity was demonstrated by the significant differences between poor and good sleep hygiene based on ASHSr in the actigraphy measure and scores of PDSS, PSQI, and SDSC. The multigroup CFA and differential item functioning in Rasch analyses suggested that all the participants interpreted the ASHSr similarly, regardless of their gender or living in a private room.
   Conclusions: The Persian ASHSr demonstrated good reliability and validity in assessing sleep hygiene among Iranian adolescents. Healthcare providers may use it to assess the effectiveness of sleep hygiene programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Low parental tolerance for crying has been associated with infant sleep problems, yet the directionality of this link remained unclear. This longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy through six months postpartum.
   Methods: Sixty-five couples were recruited during pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months.
   Results: Concomitant associations were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months, indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover, fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying.
   Conclusion: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.

AB Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is related to the demyelination of intracranial nerves at multiple sites, while restless legs syndrome (RLS) appears to be caused by dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Since RLS prevalence is higher among MS patients than in the general population, we carried out an updated meta-analysis to understand whether the two diseases might be associated.
   Method: Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and SinoMed databases were searched for observational and case-controlled studies of RLS prevalence in MS. Eligible studies were meta-analyzed using Stata 12.0.
   Results: Pooled RLS prevalence among MS patients of various ethnicities was 26%, and prevalence was lower in Asia (20%) than outside Asia (27%). Prevalence was higher among cross-sectional studies (30%) than among caseecontrol studies (23%). RLS prevalence was higher among female than male MS patients (26% vs. 17%), and it was higher among MS patients than among healthy controls (OR 3.96, 95% CI 3.29 -4.77, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis updates the most recent meta-analysis in 2013 and provides perhaps the first reliable pooled estimate of RLS prevalence in MS. The available evidence strongly suggests that RLS risk is higher among MS patients than healthy controls. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; HYPOXIA; DEMENTIA; SURGERY
AB Background: Childhood obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, may lead to cognitive impairment. This study aims to investigate the association between mild or moderate childhood OSAHS and cognitive dysfunction.
   Methods: A total of 59 children (4-12 years of age) diagnosed with mild or moderate OSAHS by poly-somnography and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy children were included in the study. The China-Wechsler Younger Children Scale of Intelligence and China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children were used to evaluate the cognition of the participating children aged <6 years and >= 6 years, respectively.
   Results: In the <6-years-old subgroup, children with OSAHS had significantly lower scores of full-scale IQ (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), comprehension test, and visual analysis than the healthy children (all p < 0.05). In the >= 6-years-old subgroup, VIQ and classification test scores were significantly lower in children with OSAHS than in the healthy controls (all p < 0.05). FIQ VIQ and performance IQ (PIQ) scores did not correlate with AHI, OAHI, and the lowest nocturnal SO2. Notably, in the <6-years-old subgroup of OSAHS, the accumulated time of SO2<90% (p = 0.046) and the percentage of the accumulated time of SO2 <90% in the total sleep time (p = 0.034) correlated with PIQ negatively and significantly.
   Conclusions: Mild to moderate childhood OSAHS may adversely affect cognitive function, particularly in young children (<6 years of age). This study may increase the awareness of childhood OSAHS-associated cognitive dysfunction and advocate early interventions in childhood OSAHS. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A proteomic analysis of the soluble venom of the coral snake Micrurus pyrrhocryptus is reported in this work. The whole soluble venom was separated by RP-HPLC and the molecular weights of its components (over 100) were determined by mass spectrometry. Three main sets of components were identified, corresponding to peptides with molecular masses from 5 to 8 kDa, proteins from 12 to 16 kDa and proteins from 20 to 30 kDa. Two components were fully sequenced: one a-neurotoxic peptide of 7210 Da with slight blocking activity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and a phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) with molecular weight 13517 Da and no effect on the nAChR. PLA(2) activity was evaluated for all RP-HPLC components. In addition, N-terminal sequence was obtained for eleven components using Edman degradation. Among these, three were similar to known PLA(2)'s, six to three-finger toxins (3FTx) and one to Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the venom allowed the separation of about thirty spots with components of molecular weights from 25 to 70 kDa. Seventeen spots were recovered from the gel, digested with trypsin and the corresponding peptides (85) were sequenced by MS/MS allowing identification of amino acid sequences with similarities to snake venom metalloproteases (SVMP), PLA(2)'s, L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO), acetylcholinesterases (AChE) and serine proteases (SP). In addition, LC-MS analysis of peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of whole soluble venom allowed the identification of 695 peptides, whose amino acid sequence could correspond to at least 355 components found in other snake venoms, where C-type lectins, vespryns, zinc finger proteins, and waprins were found, among others. These results show the complexity of the venom and provide important knowledge for future work on identification and activity determination of venom components from this coral snake.

AB The pufferfish saxitoxin- and tetrodotoxin-binding protein 2 (PSTBP2), which is involved in toxin accumulation, was knocked out in Takifugu rubripes embryos by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing technology. Treating the embryos with one of two single guide RNA (sgRNA) resulted in mutation rates of 57.1% and 62.5%, respectively, as estimated using a hetero-duplex mobility assay at 3 days postfertilization. Both sgRNAs might induced frameshift mutations that knocked out the T. rubripes PSTBP2.

AB Phospholipase-B-like (SVPLB-like) enzymes are present in relatively small amounts in a number of venoms, however, their biological function and mechanisms of action are un-clear. A three-dimensional model of the SVPLB-like enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus was generated by homology modeling based on the crystal structures of bovine Ntn-hydrolyases and the modeled protein possesses conserved domains characteristic of Ntn-hydrolases. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that activation by autocatalytic cleavage results in the removal of 25 amino acids which increases accessibility to the active site. SVPLB-like enzymes possess a highly reactive cysteine and are hence amidases that to belong to the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase family. The Ntn-hydrolases (N-terminal nucleophile) form a superfamily of diverse enzymes that are activated auto catalytically; wherein the N-terminal catalytic nucleophile is implicated in the cleavage of the amide bond.

AB Live measles vaccine (MV) may have beneficial off-target/non-specific effects (NSEs) reducing child mortality beyond prevention of measles infection. In contrast, the non-live pentavalent (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis-H. influenzae Type B-Hepatitis B) vaccine has no beneficial NSEs. The NSEs are strongest for the most recent vaccine. Hence, sequence of vaccination may affect survival. In Guinea-Bissau, we followed 7094 measles-vaccinated children prospectively from first home visit after 9 months (when MV is scheduled) to 5 years of age. We compared survival by sequence of MV and third Pentavalent vaccine (Penta3; scheduled at 31/2 months) in Cox proportional-hazards models. Compared with being vaccinated insequence (Penta3-then-MV), having received out-of-sequence Penta3-after-MV before the visit was associated with an adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) of 1.19 (95%CI: 0.84-1.69); Receiving missing Penta doses on the visit date tended to be associated with higher mortality (aHR = 1.87 (0.96-3.65)) while not receiving missing doses of Penta was not (aHR = 0.93 (0.57-1.54)), test for interaction p = 0.09.

AB Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) leads to lethal hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate as high as 90%, thus posing a serious global public health concern. However, while several vaccines based on the EBOV glycoprotein have been confirmed to be effective in animal experiments, no licensed vaccines or effective treatments have been approved since the first outbreak was reported in 1976. In this study, we prepared the extracellular domain of the EBOV GP protein (designated as N2O) by prokaryotic expression and purification via chromatography. Using CTA1-DD (designated as H45) as a mucosal adjuvant, we evaluated the immunogenicity of N20 by intranasal administration and the associated protective efficacy against mouse-adapted EBOV challenge in mice. We found that intranasal vaccination with H45-adjuvanted N20 could stimulate humoral immunity, as supported by GP-specific IgG titers; Th1 cellular immunity, based on IgG subclasses and IFN-gamma/IL-4 secreting cells; and mucosal immunity, based on the presence of anti-EBOV IgA in vaginal lavages. We also confirmed that the vaccine could completely protect mice against a lethal mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) challenge with few side effects (based on weight loss). In comparison, mice that received N20 or H45 alone succumbed to lethal MA-EBOV challenge. Therefore, mucosal vaccination with H45-adjuvanted N20 represents a potential vaccine candidate for the prevention of EBOV in an effective, safe, and convenient manner. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to rapidly and accurately determine viral infectivity can help improve the speed of vaccine product development and manufacturing. Current methods to determine infectious viral titers, such as the end-point dilution (50% tissue culture infective dose, TCID50) and plaque assays are slow, labor intensive, and often subjective. In order to accelerate virus quantification, Laser Force Cytology (LFC) was used to monitor vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells. LFC uses a combination of optical and fluidic forces to interrogate single cells without the use of labels or antibodies. Using a combination of variables measured by the Radiance (TM) LFC instrument (LumaCyte), an infection metric was developed that correlates well with the viral titer as measured by TCID50 and shortens the timeframe from infection to titer determination from 3 days to 16 h (a 4.5 fold reduction). A correlation was also developed between in-process cellular measurements and the viral titer of collected supernatant, demonstrating the potential for real-time infectivity measurements. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of LFC as a tool for rapid infectivity measurements throughout the vaccine development process. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A formulation of a defined antigen dosage together with an appropriate and convenient immunisation regime are the main problems of a plant-derived oral vaccine against HBV. Both factors have to be mutually adjusted to ensure efficacious vaccination and to minimise the risk of oral tolerance acquisition. As based on previous research, solely oral immunisation appears to be of limited effectiveness, but a combined immunisation scheme via injection priming and oral boosting can be proposed. Thus, the previously optimised plant lyophilisate with accumulated S-HBsAg was orally administered in a series of mouse immunisation trials. The impact of various S-HBsAg oral dosages and concentrations on the induction of an active immune response was studied. Immunisation via i.m. priming followed by double oral boosting in 6-week intervals was comparably efficient as standard i.m. vaccination. Among the tested dosages, 2x 5 or 200 ng triggered effective and exclusively systemic responses. Mucosal adjuvants CTB or quillaja bark saponins as well as alhydrogel either had no or a negative effect on immune response, which indicates that a low-dosed plant lyophilisate as an oral booster vaccine may not require exogenous adjuvants. Additionally, a positive effect of S-HBsAg encapsulation in lyophilised cells on immune response stimulation was confirmed by comparison with the antigen released in the plant extract. The low-dosed plant lyophilisate with concentrated S-HBsAg was proven as an effective and convenient oral booster vaccine. Results of immunisation via a mixed injection-oral route provide the foundation for research on further standardisation of a plant-derived oral vaccine against HBV and details of immune response together with effects for health condition.

AB No effective human vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) has yet been developed; however, a protective vaccine using immunogenic peptides in a safe delivery vehicle system offers promise. Here, we employed bioinformatics to design a multimeric recombinant T. gondii vaccine using predicted T and B cell epitopes of SAG1, AMA1, ROP2, and GRA4 proteins based on their binding capabilities to common major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Furthermore, we encapsulated the expressed protein in poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle and also used alum as an adjuvant to determine the vaccine potency of this multimeric antigen. BALB/c mice were vaccinated and then challenged with T. gondii RH strain, and the survival rate and cytokine profiles were studied. Mice vaccinated with the multi-epitope-based vaccine, both with and without PLGA, had greater Th1 immune responses, survival rates, specific antibody titers, and IFN-gamma and IL-2 levels than controls, while the alum-adsorbed vaccine stimulated a Th2-type humoral immune response.

AB Background: In early 2016, there was a Yellow Fever (YF) outbreak in Central Africa with several deaths reported from Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Due to a shortage in vaccine supply, fractional dosing (0.1 ml) of 17DD Yellow Fever Vaccine (YFV) was proposed in preventive vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in August 2016. A Pharmacovigilance surveillance at community level was implemented to track Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs). The objective of this study was to describe AEFIs as captured from community-based pharmacovigilance and to compare the safety profile of the fractional dosing of YFV between gender.
   Methods: PV information sessions were organized in churches, academic institutions, and pediatrician, obstetrician and friend networks. Prior to data collection, education about AEFI was provided through face-to-face discussions, phone calls, SMS and WhatsApp messages. Individuals reported AEFIs though the above communication channels to assigned individuals. Reported AEFIs were entered into VigiFlow and extracted for statistical analysis using Stata 12. Only vaccinees who received fractional dose (subjects from the age of 2-year-old and non-pregnant women) were included in analysis. Proportional t-test was used to compare AEFI preferred terms among males and females.
   Results: A total of 4020 subjects reported 5409 AEFIs. Reporters were mostly males (54.9%) with an average age of 26 +/- 10.7 years. Fever and injection site pain were the most reported systemic and local AEFI respectively. The safety profile was similar between gender although females reported more diarrhea and dizziness whilst males reported more asthenia (P < 0.001). Five individuals reported serious AEFIs. Among them, 4 were less-immunocompetent.
   Conclusion: Fractional dosing of 17DD YFV has a good safety profile, which is similar between gender. These findings complement the documented immunogenicity profile to support recommendation of fractional dose of YFV for outbreak control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In 2010, a safety signal was detected for narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix, an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) vaccine. To further assess a possible association and inform policy on future use of adjuvants, we conducted a multi-country study of narcolepsy and adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines.
   Methods: We used electronic health databases to conduct a dynamic retrospective cohort study to assess narcolepsy incidence rates (IR) before and during pH1N1 virus circulation, and after pH1N1 vaccination campaigns in Canada, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Using a case-control study design, we evaluated the risk of narcolepsy following AS03- and MF59-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines in Argentina, Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, we also conducted a case-coverage study in children born between 2004 and 2009.
   Results: No changes in narcolepsy IRs were observed in any periods in single study sites except Sweden and Taiwan; in Taiwan incidence increased after wild-type pH1N1 virus circulation and in Sweden (a previously identified signaling country), incidence increased after the start of pH1N1 vaccination. No association was observed for Arepanrix-AS03 or Focetria-MF59 adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines and narcolepsy in children or adults in the case-control study nor for children born between 2004 and 2009 in the Netherlands case-coverage study for Pandemrix-AS03.
   Conclusions: Other than elevated narcolepsy IRs in the period after vaccination campaigns in Sweden, we did not find an association between AS03- or MF59-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines and narcolepsy in children or adults in the sites studied, although power to evaluate the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix brand vaccine was limited in our study.

AB This paper presents a method for microplastic (MP) mass quantification using a Focal Plane Array-based Fourier Transform Infrared imaging technique. It discusses the issue that particle number is not a conserved base quantity and hence less suited than mass to compare independent studies on MP in the environment. It concludes that MP mass should be included when quantifying MP pollution in the environment, supplementing the conventional approach of reporting particle numbers. Applying mass as the unit of MP measurement, the paper presents data showing that Danish wastewater treatment plants discharge around 3 t/year of MP in the size range 10-500 mu m. This value corresponds to an annual per capita emission from these plants of 0.56 g MP/(capita year). The distribution of polymer types by mass and particle number differed because the size of MP particles of the different material types varied. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To address the issues of eutrophication and the potential risk of phosphorus (P) shortage, it is essential to remove and recover P from P-containing streams to close this nutrient cycle. Electrochemical induced calcium phosphate (CaP) precipitation was shown to be an efficient method for P recovery. However, the influence of natural organic matter (NOM) is not known for this treatment. In this paper, the behavior of NOM and its effect on CaP precipitation was studied. In contrast to studies where NOM hindered CaP precipitation, results show that the interaction of NOM with CaP improves the removal of P, independent of the types of NOM. The P removal at the average increased from 43.8 +/- 4.9% to 58.5 +/- 1.2% in the presence of 1.0 mg L-1 NOM. Based on the yellow color of the CaP product, NOM is co-precipitated. The bulk solution pH with and without buffers has totally different effects on the precipitation process. Without buffer, CaP precipitates on the cathode surface in a wide pH range (pH 4.0-10.0). However, the precipitation process is completely inhibited when the bulk solution is buffered at pH 4.0 and 6.0. This is probably due to neutralization of OH- by the buffers. Regardless of the presence or absence of NOM and solution pH, the recovered products are mainly amorphous CaP unless the electrolysis time was increased to seven days with 4.0 A m(-2), in which crystalline CaP formed. These findings advance our understanding on the interaction of Ca, P and NOM species for the application of electrochemical method for P recovery from real wastewater. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) that found in water in many locations are of concern. Among the available water treatment methods, heterogeneous photo catalysis using TiO2 is an emerging and viable technology to overcome the occurrence of PPCP in natural and waste water. The combination of carbonaceous materials (e.g., activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets) with TiO2, a recent development, gives significantly improved performance. In this article, we present a critical review of the development and fabrication of carbonaceous-TiO2 and its application to PPCP removal including its influence on water chemistry, and the relevant operational parameters. Finally, we present an analysis of current priorities in the ongoing research and development of carbonaceous-TiO2 for the photodegradation of PPCP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the IWA Activated Sludge Model No. 2d (ASM2d) was expanded to identify the most important mechanisms leading to the anoxic nitrous oxide (N2O) production in the combined nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal activated sludge systems. The new model adopted a three-stage denitrification concept and was evaluated against the measured data from one/two-phase batch experiments carried out with activated sludge withdrawn from a local, large-scale biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plant. The experiments were focused on investigating the effects of different external carbon sources (acetate, ethanol) and electron acceptors (nitrite, nitrate) on the mechanisms of N2O production in enhanced biological P removal by polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and external carbon-based denitrification by ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHOs). The experimental results explicitly showed that N2O production was predominantly governed by the presence of nitrite in the reactor regardless of the examined carbon source and the ratio COD/N in the reactor. The model was capable of accurately predicting (with R-2 > 0.9) the behavior of not only N2O-N, but also NO3-N, NO2-N, soluble COD, and PO4-P. The simulation results revealed that only OHOs were responsible for N2O production, whereas the present denitrifying PAOs reduced only nitrate to nitrite. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sludge disposal such as land application is suspected as a significant source of microplastic (MP) pollution in the environment. To examine such a hypothesis, the present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of MPs in sludge by analyzing 79 sewage sludge samples collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 11 Chinese provinces. MP concentrations in the sludge samples ranged from 1.60-56.4 x 10(3) particles per kilogram of dry sludge, with an average of 22.7 +/- 12.1 x 10(3) particles per kilogram of dry sludge. Thereinto, the sludge-based MP contents were greater in eastern China than in western China and varied during different months. Their colors and types were mainly white (59.6%) and fibers (63%), respectively. Microscope Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that most of MPs belonged to polyolefin, acrylic fibers, polyethylene and polyamide. Some WWTP parameters, such as servicing area, proportion of industrial wastewater, secondary treatment and sludge dewatering may have affected MP concentrations in sludge. Based on the total sludge production in China, the average amount of sludge-based MPs entering into natural environmental was estimated to be 1.56 x 10(14) particles per year. The findings confirmed that sewage sludge discharge is an important source of MP pollution in the environment. Further evaluation of the associated environmental hazards with MPs is deemed necessary.

AB A novel biological process to upgrade biogas was developed and optimised during the current study. In this process, CO2 in the biogas and externally provided H-2 were fermented under mesophilic conditions to volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which are building blocks of higher-value biofuels. Meanwhile, the biogas was upgraded to biomethane (CH4 >95%), which can be used as a vehicle fuel or injected into the natural gas grid. To establish an efficient fermentative microbial platform, a thermal (at two different temperatures of 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C) and a chemical pretreatment method using 2-bromoethanesulfonate were investigated initially to inhibit methanogenesis and enrich the acetogenic bacterial inoculum. Subsequently, the effect of different H-2:CO2 ratios on the efficiency of biogas upgrading and production of VFAs were further explored. The composition of the microbial community under different treatment methods and gas ratios has also been unravelled using 16S rRNA analysis. The chemical treatment of the inoculum had successfully blocked the activity of methanogens and enhanced the VFAs production, especially acetate. The chemical treatment led to a significantly better acetate production (291 mg HAc/L) compared to the thermal treatment. Based upon 165 rRNA gene sequencing, it was found that H-2-utilizing methanogens were the dominant species in the thermally treated inoculum, while a significantly lower abundance of methanogens was observed in the chemically treated inoculum. The highest biogas content (96% (v/v)) and acetate production were achieved for 2H(2):1CO(2) ratio (v/v), with Acetoanaerobium noterae, as the dominant homoacetogenic hydrogen scavenger. Results from the present study can pave the way towards more development with respect to microorganisms and conditions for high efficient VFAs production and biogas upgrading. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although ultrafiltration (UF) membranes are highly beneficial for removing algae, the removal process causes serious UF membrane fouling. To avoid the unfavorable effects of algal cells that have been damaged by oxidants, our previous study reported a novel, moderate pre-oxidation method (KMnO4-Fe(II) process) that aimed to achieve a balance between the release of intracellular organic matter and enhanced algae removal. This study further investigated the performance of a UF membrane with KMnO4-Fe(II) pretreatment in the presence of algae-laden reservoir water after a long running time. We found that algae could be completely removed, membrane fouling was significantly alleviated, and the overall performance was much better than that of Fe(III) coagulation alone. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) during Fe(III) coagulation increased to 42.8 kPa, however, that of the KMnO4-Fe(II) process only increased to 25.1 kPa for after running for 90 d. The slower transmembrane pressure was attributed to the larger floc size, higher surface activity, and inactivation of algae. Although there was little effect on microorganism development, lower microorganism abundance (20.7%) was observed during the KMnO4-Fe(II) process than during coagulation alone (44.9%) due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances. We also found that the floc cake layer was easily removed by washing, and many of the original membrane pores were clearly observed. Further analysis demonstrated that the effluent quality was excellent, especially its turbidity, chromaticity, and Mn and Fe concentrations. Based on the outstanding UF membrane performance, it may be concluded that the KMnO4-Fe(II) process exhibits considerable potential for application in the treatment of algae-laden water.

AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is regarded as a promising alternative for enhancing the removal of antibiotic pollutants. In this study, oxytetracycline served as an electron donor in the anode chamber of MFCs, and after continuous operation for 330 days, the efficiency of removal of 10 mg/L oxytetracycline in MFCs increased to 99.00% in 78 h, whereas removal efficiency of only 58.26% was achieved in microbial controls. Compared to microbial controls, higher ATP concentration and persistent electrical stimulation mainly contributed to bioelectrochemical reactions more rapidly to enhance oxytetracycline removal in MFCs. In addition, the analysis of bacterial communities revealed that Eubacterium spp.-as the main functional bacterial genus responsible for oxytetracycline biodegradation-flourished starting from merely 0.00%-91.69% +/- 0.27% (mean +/- SD) in MFCs. High-throughput quantitative PCR showed that the normalized copy numbers of total antibiotic resistance genes (ARCS) and mobile genetic elements in MFCs were 1.7364 and 0.0065 copies/cell respectively, which were markedly lower than those in the microbial controls. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between oxytetracycline concentration in the influent and abundance of ARGs in effluent from MFCs. Nevertheless, Tp614, a transposase gene, was found to be enriched in both MFCs and microbial reactors, suggesting that it may be a common challenge for different biological processes for wastewater treatment. This study therefore showed a lower probability of upregulation and transmission of ARGs in MFCs when compared to a traditional anaerobic microbial treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biotransformation of most organic micropollutants (OMPs) during wastewater treatment is not complete and an unexplained steady decrease of the biotransformation rate with time is reported for many OMPs in different biological processes. To minimize and accurately predict the emission of OMPs into the environment, the mechanisms and limitations behind their biotransformations should be clarified. Aiming to achieve this objective, the present study follows a mechanistic modelling approach, based on the formulation of four models according to different biotransformation hypotheses: Michaelis-Menten kinetics, chemical equilibrium between the parent compound and the transformation product (TP), enzymatic inhibition by the TP, and a limited compound bioavailability due to its sequestration in the solid phase. These models were calibrated and validated with kinetic experiments performed in two different anaerobic systems: continuous reactors enriched with methanogenic biomass and batch assays with anaerobic sludge. Model selection was conducted according to model suitability criteria (goodness of fitting the experimental data, confidence of the estimated parameters, and model parsimony) but also considering mechanistic evidences. The findings suggest that reversibility of the biological reactions and/or sequestration of compounds are likely the causes preventing the complete biotransformation of OMPs, and biotransformation is probably limited by thermodynamics rather than by kinetics. Taking into account its simplicity and broader applicability spectrum, the reversible biotransformation is the proposed model to explain the incomplete biotransformation of OMPs.

AB Tannery wastewaters are difficult to treat biologically due to the high salinity and organic matter concentration. Conventional treatments, like sequential batch reactors (SBR) and membrane bioreactors (MBR), have showed settling problems, in the case of SBR, and ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling in the case of MBR, slowing their industrial application. In this work, the treatment of tannery wastewater with an osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) is assessed. Forward osmosis (FO) membranes are characterized by a much lower fouling degree than UF membranes. The permeate passes through the membrane pores (practically only water by the high membrane rejection) from the feed solution to the draw solution, which is also an industrial wastewater (ammonia absorption effluent) in this work. Experiments were carried out at laboratory scale with a FO CTA-NW membrane from Hydration Technology Innovations (HTI). Tannery wastewater was treated by means of an OMBR using as DS an actual industrial wastewater mainly consisting of ammonium sulphate. The monitoring of the biological process was carried out with biological indicators like microbial hydrolytic enzymatic activities, dissolved and total adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the mixed liquor and microbial population. Results indicated a limiting conductivity in the reactor of 35 mS cm(-1) (on the 43th operation day), from which process was deteriorated. This process performance diminution was associated by a high decrease of the dehydrogenase activity and a sudden increase of the protease and lipase activities. The increase of the bacterial stress index also described appropriately the process performance. Regarding the relative abundance of bacterial phylotypes, 37 phyla were identified in the biomass. Proteobacteria were the most abundant (varying the relative abundance between 50.29% and 34.78%) during the first 34 days of operation. From this day on, Bacteroidetes were detected in a greater extent varying the relative abundance of this phylum between 27.20% and 40.45%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soluble organic compounds released by alkaline (ALK), ultrasonic (ULS) and combined alkaline ultrasonic (ALK-ULS) pretreatment as well as their transformation in the anaerobic digestion systems were investigated. The maximum methane production of 197.1 +/- 3.0 mL CH4/g tCOD(feed) was observed with ALK-ULS pretreated sludge (pH 12 and specific energy input of 24 kJ/g TS). The combined treatment likely enhanced the sludge solubilization and produced more low molecular weight (LMW) substances, which were beneficial to improve the biogas generation rate. However, such pretreatment released not only easily biodegradable substances but also more recalcitrants, such as humic substances (HS) and complex high molecular weight (HMW) proteins. Thus, more residual dissolved organic matters (DOMs) were detected after digestion, which may pose adverse effects on the downstream water treatment. Refractory HS and hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon (HO DOC) were the main components of the residual DOMs, which accounted up to 35.0% and 22.3% respectively. At the molecular level, a large amount of residual polycyclic steroid-like matters, alkanes and aromatics were identified. Specific higher MW residual compounds, e.g. polar metabolites (like dipeptide, benzene and substituted derivatives), and non-polar lipids (like diacylglycerols, long chain fatty acids, alkenes, flavonoids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and their derivatives) were also identified. The results indicate that further polishing steps should be considered to remove the remaining soluble recalcitrant compounds. This study helps to understand the insight of sludge treatment from macro to micro level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated investigation to document high anammox abundance, activity and diversity in upfiow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating low-strength ammonium loading sewage was performed and showed that the optimal anammox granular sludge sizes could mitigate undesirable N2O emission. The enhanced anammox bacterial abundance, activity and specific anammox rate were achieved with optimal granules sludge sizes of 0.5-0.9 mm with multiple "Jettenia", "Brocadia", and "Anammoxoglobus" species. The tightly-bound extracellular polymeric substance (TB-EPS) was the main EPS layer found in anammox granular sludge, in which polysaccharides play an important structural role. Over this granular sludge sizes, the anammox bacterial abundance and activity did not significantly decrease, but N2O emission significantly increased. High throughput sequencing and ecological networks demonstrated the patterns of anammox and their co-occurring bacteria, with availability N2O-producer and N2O-reducer functional genes. Incomplete denitrification and insufficient carbon source mainly contributed to N2O production in granular sludge, as supported by results of stratification analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The extent of pathogen transport to and within aquatic systems depends heavily on whether the bacterial cells are freely suspended or in association with suspended particles. The surface charge of both bacterial cells and suspended particles affects cell-particle adhesion and subsequent transport and exposure pathways through settling and resuspension cycles. This study investigated the adhesion of Faecal Indicator Organisms (FIOs) to natural suspended intertidal sediments over the salinity gradient encountered at the transition zone from freshwater to marine environments. Phenotypic characteristics of three E. coli strains, and the zeta potential (surface charge) of the E. coli strains and 3 physically different types of intertidal sediments was measured over a salinity gradient from 0 to 5 Practical Salinity Units (PSU). A batch adhesion microcosm experiment was constructed with each combination of E. coli strain, intertidal sediment and 0, 2, 3.5 and 5 PSU. The zeta potential profile of one E. coli strain had a low negative charge and did not change in response to an increase in salinity, and the remaining E. coli strains and the sediments exhibited a more negative charge that decreased with an increase in salinity. Strain type was the most important factor in explaining cell-particle adhesion, however adhesion was also dependant on sediment type and salinity (2, 3.5 PSU > 0, 5 PSU). Contrary to traditional colloidal (Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek (DLVO)) theory, zeta potential of strain or sediment did not correlate with cell-particle adhesion. E. coli strain characteristics were the defining factor in cell-particle adhesion, implying that diverse strain-specific transport and exposure pathways may exist. Further research applying these findings on a catchment scale is necessary to elucidate these pathways in order to improve accuracy of FIO fate and transport models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study demonstrated the removal and recovery of uranium(VI) in a fed-batch stirred tank reactor (STR) using waste digested activated sludge (WDAS). The batch adsorption experiments showed that WDAS can adsorb 200 (+/- 9.0) mg of uranium(VI) per g of WDAS. The maximum adsorption of uranium(VI) was achieved even at an acidic initial pH of 2.7 which increased to a pH of 4.0 in the equilibrium state. Desorption of uranium(VI) from WDAS was successfully demonstrated from the release of more than 95% of uranium(VI) using both acidic (0.5 M HCl) and alkaline (1.0 M Na2CO3) eluents. Due to the fast kinetics of uranium(VI) adsorption onto WDAS, the fed-batch STR was successfully operated at a mixing time of 15 min. Twelve consecutive uranium(VI) adsorption steps with an average adsorption efficiency of 91.5% required only two desorption steps to elute more than 95% of uranium(VI) from WDAS. Uranium(VI) was shown to interact predominantly with the phosphoryl and carboxyl groups of the WDAS, as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy studies. This study provides a proof-of-concept of the use of fed-batch STR process based on WDAS for the removal and recovery of uranium(VI). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stability of colloidal particles contributes to the turbidity in the water column, which significantly influences water quality and ecological functions in aquatic environments especially shallow lakes. Here we report characterization, origin and aggregation behavior of aquatic colloids, including natural colloidal particles (NCPs) and total inorganic colloidal particles (TICPs), in a highly turbid shallow lake, via field observations, simulation experiments, ultrafiltration, spectral and microscopic, and light scattering techniques. The colloidal particles were characterized with various shapes (spherical, polygonal and elliptical) and aluminum-, silicon-, and ferric-containing mineralogical structures, with a size range of 20-200 nm. The process of sediment re-suspension under environmentally relevant conditions contributed 78-80% of TICPs and 54-55% of NCPs in Lake Taihu, representing an important source of colloids in the water column. Both mono- and divalent electrolytes enhanced colloidal aggregation, while a reverse trend was observed in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). The influence of NOM on colloidal stability was highly related to molecular weight (MW) properties with the high MW fraction exhibiting higher stability efficiency than the low MW counterparts. However, the MW-dependent aggregation behavior for NCPs was less significant than that for TICPs, implying that previous results on colloidal behavior using model inorganic colloids alone should be reevaluated. Further studies are needed to better understand the mobility/stability and transformation of aquatic colloids and their role in governing the fate and transport of pollutants in natural waters.

AB Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a new cyanobacterial neurotoxin produced by more than 20 genera of cyanobacteria, has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) or Alzheimer's disease. Although BMAA has been shown to be removed in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), studies regarding the reactions between BMAA and the commonly used oxidants in DWTPs are limited to chlorine under specific conditions. In this study, the reaction kinetics between BMAA and five oxidants commonly used in DWTPs, including chlorine, potassium permanganate, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were investigated. The oxidation of BMAA by chlorine, ozone or OH radical followed the second order reaction rate law, and the reaction rate was in the order of OH radicals > ozone >> chlorine. The rate constants increased by 20 times from 2 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) at pH 5.8 to 4.93 x 10(4) M(-1)s(-1) at pH 7, and kept in a relatively stable level at pH 7-9.5; rate constants of OH radicals were 1.11 x 10(8) M(-1)s(-1) at pH 6.5 and 5.51 x 10(9)- 1.35 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1) at pH > 6.5. For both permanganate and H2O2 only, the removal of BMAA was negligible. The pH dependency of chlorine and the OH radical may be attributed to the neutral form of BMAA with free lone pair electrons readily to be attacked by oxidants. However, for ozonation of BMAA, the rate constants were 1.88 x 10(6)-3.72 x 10(10)M(-1)s(-1), with a linear dependency on pH, implying that the hydroxide concentration governs the reaction. In addition, the rate of BMAA degradation was found to be slower in natural water if compared with that in deionized water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Controlled drainage (CD) is a structural conservation practice in which the drainage outlet is managed in order to reduce drain flow volume and nutrient loads to water bodies. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of CD to improve water quality for two different seasons and levels of outlet control, using ten years of data collected from an agricultural drained field in eastern Indiana with two sets of paired plots. The Rank Sum test was used to quantify the impact of CD on cumulative annual drain flow and nitrate-N and phosphorus loads. CD plots had a statistically significant (at 5% level) lower annual drain flow (eastern pair: 39%; western pair: 25%) and nitrate load (eastern pair: 43%; western pair: 26%) compared to free draining (FD) plots, while annual soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) loads were not significantly different. An ANCOVA model was used to evaluate the impact of CD on daily drain flow, nitrate-N, SRP and TP concentrations and loads during the two different periods of control. The average percent reduction of daily drain flow was 68% in the eastern pair and 58% in the western pair during controlled drainage at the higher outlet level (winter) and 64% and 58% at the lower outlet level (summer) in the eastern and western pairs, respectively. Nitrate load reduction was similar to drain flow reduction, while the effect of CD on SRP and TP loads was not significant except for the increase in SRP in one pair.
   These results from a decade-long field monitoring and two different statistical methods enhance our knowledge about water quality impacts of CD system and support this management practice as a reliable system for reducing nitrate loss through subsurface drains, mainly caused by flow reduction.

AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) or persulfate activation by sulfur-containing minerals has been applied extensively for the degradation of contaminants; however, the role of sulfur conversion in this process has not been fully explored. In this study, pyrite (FeS2)-based PMS activation process was developed for diethyl phthalate (DEP) degradation, and its underlying mechanisms were elucidated. PMS was found to be efficiently activated by FeS2 for DEP degradation and mineralization, achieving 58.9% total organic carbon removal using 0.5 g/L FeS2 and 2.0 mM PMS. Sulfides were the dominant electron donor for PMS activation, and mediated Fe(II) regeneration to activate PMS on the surface of FeS2 particles. Meanwhile, different sulfur conversion intermediates, such as S-5(2-), s(8)(0), S2O32-, and SO32-, were formed from the oxidation of sulfides by Fe(III) and PMS, and determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. SO32- was the dominant sulfur species responsible for sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) generation by activating PMS directly or activating Fe(III) to initiate a radical chain reaction, which was supported by the electron paramagnetic resonance results. This study highlights the important role of sulfur conversion in PMS activation by pyrite and provides new insights into the mechanism of oxidant activation by sulfur-containing minerals.

AB Dichloromethane (DCM) is a widespread and toxic industrial solvent which often co-occurs with chlorinated ethenes at polluted sites. Biodegradation of DCM occurs under both oxic and anoxic conditions in soils and aquifers. Here we investigated in situ and ex situ biodegradation of DCM in groundwater sampled from the industrial site of Themeroil (France), where DCM occurs as a major co-contaminant of chloroethenes. Carbon isotopic fractionation (epsilon(C)) for DCM ranging from -46 to -22 parts per thousand were obtained under oxic or denitrifying conditions, in mineral medium or contaminated groundwater, and for laboratory cultures of Hyphomicrobium sp. strain GJ21 and two new DCM-degrading strains isolated from the contaminated groundwater. The extent of DCM biodegradation (B%) in the aquifer, as evaluated by compound-specific isotope analysis (delta C-13), ranged from 1% to 85% applying DCM-specific epsilon(C) derived from reference strains and those determined in this study. Laboratory groundwater microcosms under oxic conditions showed DCM biodegradation rates of up to 0.1 mM.day(-1), with concomitant chloride release. Dehalogenase genes dcmA and dhlA involved in DCM biodegradation ranged from below 4 x 10(2) (boundary) to 1 x 10(7) (source zone) copies L-1 across the contamination plume. High-throughput sequencing on the 16S rrnA gene in groundwater samples showed that both contaminant level and terminal electron acceptor processes (TEAPs) influenced the distribution of genus-level taxa associated with DCM biodegradation. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential of DCM biodegradation in multi-contaminated groundwater. This integrative approach may be applied to contaminated aquifers in the future, in order to identify microbial taxa and pathways associated with DCM biodegradation in relation to redox conditions and co-contamination levels.

AB The bacterial growth potential is important to understand and manage bacterial regrowth-related water quality concerns. Bacterial growth potential depends on growth promoting/limiting compounds, therefore, nutrient availability is the key factor governing bacterial growth potential. Selecting proper tools for bacterial growth measurement is essential for routine implementation of the growth potential measurement.
   This study proposes a growth potential assay that is universal and can be used for different water types and soil extract without restrictions of pure culture or cultivability of the bacterial strain. The proposed assay measures the sample bacterial growth potential by using the indigenous community as inocula. Flow cytometry (FCM) and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) were used to evaluate the growth potential of six different microbial communities indigenous to the sample being analyzed, with increasing carbon concentrations. Bottled mineral water, non-chlorinated tap water, seawater, river water, wastewater effluent and a soil organic carbon extract were analyzed.
   Results showed that indigenous bacterial communities followed normal batch growth kinetics when grown on naturally present organic carbon. Indigenous bacterial growth could detect spiked organic carbon concentrations as low as 10 mu g/L. The indigenous community in all samples responded proportionally to the increase in acetate-carbon and proportional growth could be measured with both FCM and ATP. Bacterial growth was proportional to the carbon concentration but not the same proportion factor for the different water samples tested. The effect of inoculating the same water with different indigenous microbial communities on the growth potential was also examined. The FCM results showed that the highest increase in total bacterial cell concentration was obtained with bacteria indigenous to the water sample.
   The growth potential assay using indigenous bacterial community revealed consistent results of bacterial growth in all the different samples tested and therefore providing a fast, more stable, and accurate approach for monitoring the biological stability of waters compared to the previously developed assays. The growth potential assay can be used to aid in detecting growth limitations by compounds other than organic carbon. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows from land to sea in the Yangtze River basin were simulated for the period 1900-2010, by combining models for hydrology, nutrient input to surface water, and an in stream retention. This study reveals that the basin-wide nutrient budget, delivery to surface water, and in-stream retention increased during this period. Since 2004, the Three Gorges Reservoir has contributed 5% and 7% of N and P basin-wide retention, respectively. With the dramatic rise in nutrient delivery, even this additional retention was insufficient to prevent an increase of riverine export from 337 Gg N yr(-1) and 58 Gg P yr(-1) (N:P molar ratio = 13) to 5896 Gg N yr(-1) and 381 Gg P yr(-1) (N:P molar ratio = 35) to the East China Sea and Yellow Sea (ECSYS). The midstream and upstream subbasins dominate the N and P exports to the ECSYS, respectively, due to various human activities along the river. Our spatially explicit nutrient source allocation can aid in the strategic targeting of nutrient reduction policies. We posit that these should focus on improving the agricultural fertilizer and manure use efficiency in the upstream and midstream and better urban wastewater management in the downstream subbasin.

AB As the main intermediate metabolite in anaerobic digestion of wasted activated sludge (WAS), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are proper substrate for mixed culture (MC) polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis. To further optimize the performance of MC PHA production process, VFA_(odd) (i.e., VFA with odd carbon atoms) oriented acidification process was proposed and conducted in this study. Three regulation factors including reaction pH, fraction of added beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and glycerol were selected and response surface methodology (RSM) was used to enhance and effectively regulate the VFA_(odd) production while maintaining enough acidification degree in the WAS acidification. High percentage of VFA_(odd) (larger than 60% and dominated by propionic acid) can be obtained in the operating condition area with glycerol addition ratio (quantified by C/N) ranging from 15 to 20 and reaction pH ranging from 8.0 to 9.5 when beta-CD addition was held at zero level (0.2 g/gTSS) according to the RSM. Semi-continuous acidification and MC PHA production assays further verified the reliability and effectiveness of the VFA_(odd) oriented acidification strategy. Microbial function group related to propionic acid production (G(prop)) was defined based on the relationships between system function and microbial community structure, and 13 frequent species were found being involved in the G(prop). Roles of the group members in the oriented acidification were analyzed to understand the mechanisms of the regulation of VFA_(odd) production at microbial ecological level. A synergistic effect of WAS and glycerol on the VFA_(odd) production in the acidification process was revealed based on the ecological analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation and subsequent post-treatments are increasingly implemented in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for enhanced micropollutant abatement. While this technology is effective, micro pollutant oxidation leads to the formation of ozonation transformation products (OTPs). Target and suspect screening provide information about known parent compounds and known OTPs, but for a more comprehensive picture, non-target screening is needed. Here, sampling was conducted at a full-scale WWTP to investigate OTP formation at four ozone doses (2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/L, ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 gO(3)/gDOC) and subsequent changes during five post-treatment steps (i.e., sand filter, fixed bed bioreactor, moving bed bioreactor, and two granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, relatively fresh and pre loaded). Samples were measured with online solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and negative modes. Existing non-target screening workflows were adapted to (1) examine the formation of potential OTPs at four ozone doses and (2) compare the removal of OTPs among five post treatments. In (1), data processing included principal component analysis (PCA) and chemical knowledge on possible oxidation reactions to prioritize non-target features likely to be OTPs. Between 394 and 1328 unique potential OTPs were detected in positive ESI for the four ozone doses tested; between 12 and 324 unique potential OTPs were detected in negative ESI. At a specific ozone dose of 0.5 gO(3)/gDOC, 27 parent compounds were identified and were related to 69 non-target features selected as potential OTPs. Two OTPs were confirmed with reference standards (venlafaxine N-oxide and chlorothiazide); 34 other potential OTPs were in agreement with literature data and/or reaction mechanisms. In (2), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied on profiles detected in positive ESI mode across the WWTP and revealed 11 relevant trends. OW removal was compared among the five post-treatments and 54 -83% of the non-target features that appeared after ozonation were removed, with the two GAC filters performing the best. Overall, these data analysis strategies for non-target screening provide a useful tool to understand the behavior of unknown features during ozonation and post-treatment and to prioritize certain non-targets for further identification.

AB Many pathogens can enter into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in response to harsh environmental stresses. Bacteria in this state can retain certain features of viable cells, such as cellular integrity, metabolic activity, or virulence and may present health risks associated with drinking water. In this study, we investigated the ability of chlorination and chloramination, which are widely used methods to disinfect drinking water, to induce Escherichia coli into a VBNC state. After treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/L, the counts of culturable E. coli cells decreased from 10(6) CFU/mL to 0 CFU/mL at 5-60 min post treatment. Meanwhile, viable cell counts were still approximately 10(3)-10(6) cells/mL. These viable E. coli cells may be induced into a VBNC state by chlorination and chloramination. Scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy showed that some bacteria maintained cellular integrity, but the average length of VBNC cells was less than that of culturable cells. Respiratory activity of VBNC cells decreased approximately 50% relative to that of culturable cells. We also used heavy water (D2O) combined with Raman microspectroscopy to show that E. coli in a VBNC state retained metabolic activity involving water (e.g. condensation reactions) at the single-cell level. Furthermore, soxR, gadA, and katG genes remained highly expressed, suggesting that VBNC cells were physiologically active. Finally, resuscitation of VBNC cells induced by chlorine in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth was identified by calculating the generation time. Results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the health risks associated with VBNC bacteria and the development of more effective strategies for drinking water disinfection.

AB Seasonal algal blooms in freshwater and marine water can increase the input of algal organic matter (AOM) to the pool of dissolved organic matter. The impact of bromide (Br-) and iodide (I-) on the formation of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) was studied from chlorination of AOM solutions extracted from three species of cultured isolates of freshwater and marine algae (Microcystis aeruginosa (MA), Synechococcus (SYN), and Alexandrium tamarense (AT)). Comparable concentrations of DBPs were formed from three types of AOM. In the absence of Br-, trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and haloacetaldehydes (HALs) were the main groups of DBP formed, and haloacetonitriles (HANs) were formed at lower concentrations. In contrast, the formation of iodinated THMs was <8 nM (1.7 mu g/L) since most of initial I- was oxidized to iodate. Increasing initial Br- concentrations increased the formation of THMs and HANs, while concentrations of total organic halogen and HAA remained stable. On the contrary, total HAL concentrations decreased due to the instability of bromated HALs. Decreasing the specific UV absorbance (SUVA) value of AOM favours bromine substitution since bromine more preferentially reacts with low reactivity organic matter than chlorine. Increasing the pH enhanced the formation of THMs but decreased the formation of HANs. Concentrations of HANs and HALs decreased at high pH (e.g., 9.0), high initial chlorine concentration and long reaction time due to the decomposition. Based on the cytotoxicity calculations, unregulated HANs and HALs were the main contributors for the total toxicity of DBPs measured, even though based on the weight regulated THMs and HAAs predominated.

AB In urine-separating sanitation systems, bacterial urease enzymes can hydrolyse urea to ammonia during the pipe transport and storage of urine. The present study investigated whether it was possible to reduce the urine volume without losing the nitrogen as ammonia. A method for stabilising the urine prior to dehydration was developed. Briefly, fresh human urine was stabilised by passage through an anion-exchanger, added to an alkaline media (wood ash or alkalised biochar), and dehydrated. Urine dehydration was investigated at three temperatures: 40, 45 and 50 degrees C. The influence of various factors affecting the dehydration process was modelled and the rate of urine dehydration was optimised. Results indicated that 75% (v/v) of the urine has to pass through the ion exchanger for alkaline stabilisation of urine to occur. At all investigated temperatures, the dehydrator accomplished >90% volume reduction of ion exchanged urine, > 70% N retention and 100% recovery of P and K. To realise high degree of nutrient valorisation, this study proposes combining source separation of human urine with alkaline dehydration. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) has attracted considerable attention due to its ubiquitous presence in different environmental compartments worldwide. However, information on its aerobic biodegradability in coastal environments remains unknown. Here, the aerobic biodegradation of TBBPA using a Pseudoalteromonas species commonly found in the marine environment was investigated. We found that extracellular biogenic siderophore, superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) were involved in TBBPA degradation. Upregulation of genes (nqrA and lodA) encoding Na+-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and L-lysine-epsilon-oxidase supported the extracellular O-2(center dot-) and H2O2 production. The underlying mechanism of TBBPA biodegradation presumably involves both O-2(center dot-) reduction and (OH)-O-center dot-based advanced oxidation process (AOP). Furthermore, TBBPA intermediates of tribromobisphenol A, 4-isopropylene-2,6-dibromophenol, 4-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol, 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 2-bromobenzoic acid were detected in the culture medium. Debromination and beta-scission pathways of TBBPA biodegradation were proposed. Additionally, membrane integrity assays revealed that the increase of intracellular catalase (CAT) activity and the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) might account for the alleviation of oxidative damage. These findings could deepen understanding of the biodegradation mechanism of TBBPA and other related organic pollutants in coastal and artificial bioremediation systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment systems receiving municipal wastewater are major dissemination nodes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between anthropogenic and natural environments. This study examined the fate of antibiotic resistome and class 1-3 integron-integrase genes in photobioreactors that were treating municipal wastewater diluted (70/30) with lake or tap water for the algal biomass production. A combined approach of metagenomic and quantitative (qPCR) analysis was undertaken. Municipal wastewater treatment in the photobioreactors led to reduced antibiotic resistome proportion, number of ARG subtypes, and abundances of individual ARGs in the bacterial community. The ARGs and intI1 gene abundances and relative abundances in the discharges of the photobioreactors were either comparable or lower than the respective values in the effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants. The reduction of the resistome proved to be strongly related to the changes in the bacterial community composition during the wastewater treatment process as it was responding to rising pH levels caused by intense algal growth. Several bacterial genera (e.g., Azoarcus, Dechloromonas, and Sulfuritalea) were recognized as potential hosts of multiple antibiotic resistance types. Although the lake water contributed a diverse and abundant resistome and intI genes profile to the treatment system, it proved to be considerably more beneficial for wastewater dilution than the tap water. The diversity (number of detected resistance types and subtypes) and proportion of the antibiotic resistome, the amount of plasmid borne integron-integrase gene reads, and the abundances and relative abundances of the majority of quantified ARGs (aadA, sulI, tetQ tetW, qnrS, ermB, blaOXA2-type) and intI1 gene as well as the amount of multi-resistance determinants were significantly lower in the discharges of photobioreactors where lake water was used to dilute wastewater.

AB Nitrogen fate and transport through contaminated groundwater systems, where N is both ubiquitous and commonly limits pollutant attenuation, must be re-evaluated given evidence for new potential microbial N pathways. We addressed this by measuring the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic N (DIN = NH4+, NO2-, and NO3-) and N functional gene abundances (amoA, nirK, nirS, hszA) from 20 to 38 wells across an NH4+, hydrocarbon, and SO42- contaminated aquifer. In-situ N attenuation was confirmed on three sampling dates (0, +6, +12 months) by the decreased [DIN] (4300 - 40 mu M) and increased delta N-15-DIN (5 parts per thousand-33 parts per thousand) over the flow path. However, the assumption of negligible N attenuation within the plume was complicated by the presence of alternative electron acceptors (SO42-, Fe3+), both oxidizing and reducing functional genes, and N oxides within this anoxic zone. Active plume N cycling was corroborated using an NO2- dual isotope based model, which found the fastest (similar to 10 day) NO2- turnover within the N and electron donor rich central plume. Findings suggest that N cycling is not always O-2 limited within chemically complex contaminated aquifers, though this cycling may recycle the N species rather than attenuate N.

AB Prediction of micropollutant abatements by catalytic ozonation is critical for its process design and optimization in water treatment. In this study, a chemical kinetic model based on ozone (O-3) and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) rate constants (k(O3) and k(OH)(center dot)) and O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures is proposed for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation. Several micropollutants with k(O3) ranging from <0.15 to 1.0 x 10(6)M(-1) s(-1) were spiked in water matrices (deionized water and surface water) and then treated by ozonation alone and homogeneous catalytic ozonation with varying transition metals (Ti2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+). The addition of the varying catalysts enhanced the kinetics and yield of (OH)-O-center dot formation from O-3 decomposition to different extent. Consequently, for the same applied O-3 doses, higher (OH)-O-center dot exposures can generally be obtained at the expense of lower O-3 exposures during catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts compared to ozonation alone. The changes in O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures did not considerably influence the abatement of micropollutants with high and moderate O-3 reactivities (diclofenac, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate), whose abatement efficiencies were generally >90% during both ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with the varying catalysts. In contrast, ozone-resistant micropollutants (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, clofibric acid, and ibuprofen) were less effectively abated during ozonation (similar to 40-60% abatement), and the addition of the varying catalysts could enhance their absolute abatement efficiencies to various extent (similar to 0-10% in the deionized water and similar to 0-22% in the surface water) during catalytic ozonation. Despite the differing catalytic mechanisms of the varying transition metals, the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by catalytic ozonation could be satisfactorily predicted by the chemical kinetic model using the O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot rate constants of the micropollutants reported in literature and the O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures determined during the treatment processes. These results demonstrate that the chemical kinetic model can provide a useful tool for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by homogeneous catalytic ozonation.

AB Biological conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals and biofuels has emerged as an attractive strategy to address the energy and environmental concerns caused by the over-reliance on fossil fuels. In this study, an innovative microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC), which combines the strengths of reverse electrodialysis (RED) and microbial electrosynthesis technology platforms, was developed to achieve efficient CO2-to-value chemicals bioconversion by using the salinity gradient energy as driven energy sources. In the MREC, maximum acetate and ethanol concentrations of 477.5 +/- 33.2 and 46.2 +/- 8.2 mg L-1 were obtained at the cathode, catalyzed by Sporomusa ovata with production rates of 165.79 +/- 11.52 and 25.11 +/- 4.46 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Electron balance analysis indicates that 94.4 +/- 3.9% of the electrons derived from wastewater and salinity gradient were recovered in acetate and ethanol. This work for the first time proved the potential of innovative MREC configuration has the potential as an efficient technology platform for simultaneous CO2 capture and electrosynthesis of valuable chemicals.

AB Widespread microplastic pollution is raising growing concerns as to its detrimental effects upon living organisms. A realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance, size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics. Raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics (<20 mu m). Still, its use is far from widespread, in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by fluorescence. This review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identification of microplastics using Raman spectroscopy. Among discussed topics are: enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing; automated particle selection for faster Raman mapping; comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching. A last section introduces non-conventional Raman techniques (non-linear Raman, hyper spectral imaging, standoff Raman) which permit more advanced applications such as real-time Raman detection and imaging of microplastics.

AB Biochar has been reported to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in co-cultures between Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens, a model defined co-culture system. In this study, the biochar derived from the activated sludge with different pyrolysis temperature was added to the co-cultures, the ethanol metabolism rates (Re) and succinate production rates (Rs) of co-culture with biochar-800 were 1.05- and 1.42-fold higher than that without addition. The results suggested that the conductivity of the biochar did not correlate with the facilitating effect of the biochar on the co-culture metabolism. Furthermore, the surface functional group and surface charge of biochar may also influence the facilitating effect on the interspecies electron transfer between the two Geobacter cells. Based on these results, it supported that the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging process of the surface functional groups might play a major role in facilitating the direct electron transfer process by the biochar derived from activated sludge here. This study could shed light on the better understanding of the bacteria-biochar electron transfer system and the potential utilization of the biochar in the environmental wastewater treatments.

AB UV-LEDs are considered as the most promising UV light sources, because it has the potential to replace conventional UV lamps in some water treatment applications in the foreseeable future. In this study, UV LEDs at four wavelengths in the UV-C or near UV-C range (i.e., 257.7, 268, 282.3, and 301.2 nm) were used to investigate the wavelength-dependency on chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation. The fluence-based photodecay rates of hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypochlorite (OCI-) were monotonically correlated to their molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields, and the chlorine photo decay rates were much more significantly affected by molar absorption coefficients (beta = 0.949) than quantum yields (beta = 0.055). An empirical model that incorporated the chlorine photodecay rate constants, quantum yields, and molar absorption coefficients of HOCI and OCI- was established, validated and then used to predict the chlorine photodecay rate at any wavelength (257.7-301.2 nm) and pH (5-10). The modelling results suggested that the maximum fluence-based rate constant (1.46 x 10(-4) m(2) J(-1)) was obtained at 289.7 nm and pH 9.95. The wavelength dependency was larger at alkaline pH than at acidic pH, and the pH dependency was the largest at the longest wavelength. The formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO.) and reactive chlorine species (RCS) decreased with increasing wavelength at pH 6, and increased with increasing wavelength at pH 7. More HO. was formed at pH 6 than pH 7, but RCS showed the opposite pH-dependency. The findings in this study provide the fundamental information in selecting UV-LEDs with specific wavelength for enhancing/optimizing chlorine photodecay and/or its radical generation at different pHs in real-world applications.

AB Elevated nutrient inputs have led to increased eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems worldwide. An understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources is imperative for effective water quality management. Stable isotope values of nitrate (delta N-15(NO3-), delta O-18(NO3-)) can complement conventional water quality monitoring programs to help differentiate natural sources of NOT from anthropogenic inputs and estimate the processes involved in N cycling within an ecosystem. We measured nutrient concentrations, delta N-15(NO3-), and delta O-18(NO3-) in 76 locations along a salinity gradient from the lower end of the Pearl River Estuary, one of China's largest rivers discharging into the South China Sea, towards the open ocean. NO3 concentrations decreased with increasing salinity, indicative of conservative mixing of eutrophic freshwater and oligotrophic seawater. However, our data did not follow conservative mixing patterns. At salinities <20 psu, samples exhibited decreasing NO3 concentrations with almost unchanged NOT isotope values, indicating simple dilution. At salinities >20 psu, NO3 concentrations decreased, while dual NO3 isotopes increased, suggesting mixing and/or other transformation processes. Our analysis yielded mean estimates for isotope enrichment factors (15s = 2.02%o and (18 epsilon) = 337%0), Delta(15,18)= -5.5%o and delta N-15(NO3-) -delta O-18(NO2-)_= 12.3 parts per thousand. After consideration of potential alternative sources (sewage, atmospheric deposition and groundwater) we concluded that there are three plausible interpretations for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour (1) NO3 uptake by assimilation (2) in situ NOT production (from fixation -derived nitrogen and nitrification of sewage derived effluents) and (3) input of groundwater nitrate carrying a denitrification signal. Through this study, we propose a simple workflow that incorporates a synthesis of numerous isotope -based studies to constrain sources and behaviour of NO3 in urbanized marine environments.

AB Haloacetamides (HAMS), a group of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs), can decompose to form corresponding intermediate products and other DBP5. The stability of ten different HAMs, including two chlorinated, five brominated, and three iodinated species was investigated with and without the presence of chlorine, chloramines, and reactive solutes such as quenching agents. The HAM basic hydrolysis and chlorination kinetics were well described by a second-order kinetics model, including first order in HAM and hydroxide and first-order in HAM and hypochlorite, respectively, whereas the HAM neutral hydrolysis kinetic was first-order in HAM. Furthermore, HAMs decompose instantaneously when exposed to hypochlorite, which was almost two and nine orders of magnitude faster than HAM basic and neutral hydrolysis, respectively. In general, HAM hydrolysis and chlorination rates both increased with increasing pH and the number of halogens substituted on the methyl group. Moreover, chlorinated HAMs are more unstable than their brominated analogs, followed by the iodinated ones, due to the decrease in the electron-withdrawing inductive effect from chlorine to iodine atom. During hydrolysis, HAMs mainly directly decompose into the corresponding haloacetic acids (HAAS) via a nucleophilic reaction between the carbonyl carbon and hydroxide. For HAM chlorination reactions, hypochlorite reacts with HAMs to form the N-chloro-HAMs (N-C1-HAMs) via CI+ transfer from chlorine to the amide nitrogen. N-CI-HAMs can further degrade to form HAAS via hypochlorous acid addition. In contrast, the reactions between chloramines and HAMs were found to be insignificant. Additionally, four common quenching agents, including sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, ascorbic acid, and ammonium chloride, were demonstrated to expedite HAM degradation, whereas ammonium chloride was the least influential among the four. Taft linear free energy relationships were established for both HAM hydrolysis and chlorination reactions, based on which the hydrolysis and chlorination rate constants for three monohaloacetamides were estimated. The hydrolysis and chlorination rates of 13 HAMs decreased in the following order: TCAM > BDCAM > DBCAM > TBAM > DCAM > BCAM > DBAM > CIAM > BIAM > DIAM > MCAM > MBAM> MIAM (where C = chloro, B = bromo, I = iodo, T = tri, D = di, M = mono). Lastly, using the HAM kinetic model established in this study, HAM half-lifes in drinking water distribution systems can be predicted on the basis of pH and residual chlorine concentration.

AB During high-solids anaerobic digestion (HS-AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), an important total solid (TS) removal occurs, leading to the modification of the reactor content mass/volume, in contrast to 'wet' anaerobic digestion (AD). Therefore, HS-AD mathematical simulations need to be approached differently than 'wet' AD simulations. This study aimed to develop a modelling tool based on the anaerobic digestion model 1 (ADM1) capable of simulating the TS and the reactor mass/volume dynamics in HS-AD of OFMSW. Four hypotheses were used, including the effects of apparent concentrations at high TS. The model simulated adequately HS-AD of OFMSW in batch and continuous mode, particularly the evolution of TS, reactor mass, ammonia and volatile fatty acids. By adequately simulating the reactor content mass/volume and the TS, the HS-AD model might bring further insight about potentially inhibitory mechanisms (i.e. NH3 buildup and/or acidification) occurring in HS-AD of OFMSW.

AB This work presents a method to emulate the flow dynamics of physically based hydrodynamic simulators under variations of time-dependent rainfall and parametric scenarios. Although surrogate modelling is often employed to deal with the computational burden of this type of simulators, common techniques used for model emulation as polynomial expansions or Gaussian processes cannot deal with large parameter space dimensionality. This restricts their applicability to a reduced number of static parameters under a fixed rainfall process. The technique presented combines the use of a modified Unit Hydrograph (UH) scheme and a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to emulate flow from physically based hydrodynamic models. The novel element of the proposed methodology is that the emulator compensates for the errors induced by the assumptions of proportionality and superposition of the UH theory when dealing with non-linear model structures, whereas it approximates properly the behaviour of a physically based simulator to new (spatially-uniform) rainfall time-series and parametric scenarios. The computational time is significantly reduced, which makes the practical use of the model feasible (e.g. real time control, flood warning schemes, hydraulic structures design, parametric inference etc.). The applicability of this methodology is demonstrated in three case studies, through the emulation of a simplified non-linear tank-in-series routing structure and of the 2D Shallow Water Equations (2D-SWE) solution (FLOW-R2D) in two computational domains. Results indicate that the proposed emulator can approximate with a high degree of accuracy the behaviour of the original models under a wide range of rainfall inputs and parametric values.

AB BACKGROUND: Inflammatory lesions of the pituitary gland including hypophysitis are poorly understood, and it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis on the basis of only clinical and radiologic findings.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An otherwise healthy 68-year-old man presented with sudden onset of headache, visual impairment, and pituitary insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary mass with cystic component showing changing intensity on follow-up images. Also, changing density of the lesion was demonstrated on computed tomography over a short period of time. These findings suggested a hemorrhagic lesion, and a preoperative diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy associated with a preexisting pituitary adenoma was made on the basis of clinical and radiologic findings. In the endoscopic endonasal approach for tumor resection, there was neither hematoma nor adenoma. Histopathologic diagnosis was lymphocytic hypophysitis.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of hypophysitis with radiologic signal changes over a short period. Vigilant attention regarding the clinical diagnosis of such rare entity is paramount.

AB BACKGROUND: Currently, anterior transdiscal access and posterior interlaminar approach are the main approaches for percutaneous endoscopic cervical discectomy (PECD). To overcome access shortcomings, we previously described a novel anterior endoscopic transcorporeal approach on a migrated cervical disc. We innovatively introduced bone wax into endoscopic surgery to aid hemostasis and facilitate the process of drilling an intracorporeal tunnel.
   METHODS: Five patients with cervical intervertebral disc herniation (CIDH) were treated by PECD via the anterior transcorporeal approach. During the operation, we marked the punctured tunnel with bone wax containing indigo carmine as a guide and smeared bone wax on the endoscopic burr to aid hemostasis.
   RESULTS: A satisfactory clinical outcome was observed in all 5 patients postoperatively; pain and neurologic condition were dramatically improved. Surgery-related complications, such as esophageal injury, vascular rupture, hematoma, intervertebral disc infection, or postoperative headache, were not encountered. A computed tomography scan was used to observe the process of bone healing. At 3-month postoperative follow-up, the bone defect within the drilling tunnel had partially shrank and was completely healed at 6 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anterior endoscopic transcorporeal approach for PECD is a novel, valuable alternative for the treatment of CIDH. Bone wax could indeed facilitate the operation by guiding the drilling process and instantly controlling the bleeding without obvious interference with bone healing. Long-term follow-up is warranted in further clinical studies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The giant calcified herniated thoracic disc ( HTD), a rare disease, is a challenge for surgeons because of its complications. This review aimed to confirm the surgical treatment, including surgical approach, results, and complications of HTDs.
   METHODS: This systematic review of the literature complies with the PRISMA guidelines and involves a search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for all papers describing surgical treatment of giant calcified HTDs in >= 3 patients. Data on the surgical approach, change in neurologic impairment, and complications were extracted from the search results.
   RESULTS: A total of 11 studies, including 164 patients with giant calcified HTDs that met the inclusion criteria, were included in this systematic review. Of the 164 patients, 145 had myelopathy in giant calcified HTDs, and 8 surgical approaches were included. After the surgical treatment, the neurologic grades were improved in 69% of patients, remained unchanged in 22% of patients, and worsened further in 3% of patients at the final follow-up. Also, of the total patients analyzed, 3% had permanent neurologic deterioration, 4% patients had subarachnoide-pleural cerebrospinal fluid fistula complications, 30% had other complications, 4% had reoperation via transthoracic approach, 13% had permanent neurologic deterioration via the posterolateral approach, and 25% had permanent neurologic deterioration via the thoracoscopy approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment can improve or stabilize neurologic impairment for most patients with giant calcified HTDs. We thus recommend the anterior thoracotomy approach for giant calcified HTDs because of the theoretical advantages over other approaches and the low rate of neurologic deterioration, subarachnoide-pleural cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and reoperation.

TI Histopathological Demonstration of Subacute Endothelialization Following
   Aneurysm Retreatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endothelialization; Flow diverting stent; Intracranial aneurysm;
   Pipeline embolization device
ID FLOW DIVERSION; STENTS; AORTA
AB BACKGROUND: Endothelial cell coverage along the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is 1 of 2 primary proposed mechanisms of action of the device, along with induction of intra-aneurysmal thrombosis. The temporal course of endothelialization following device deployment is poorly understood in human patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old female with a persistent aneurysm in the communicating segment of the internal carotid artery was treated with a second PED 14 months after the deployment of a first PED and subsequently developed a fatal intraparenchymal hemorrhage at 3 weeks postimplantation. Histopathological analysis at autopsy showed evidence of endothelialization along the second PED at this time, as well as neointimal growth between both devices. Patency of the vessel lumen with no intraluminal thrombus but thrombus showing early organization (endothelial cell ingrowth) was observed within the aneurysm dome. To our knowledge, this case represents the earliest demonstration of intimal cell growth along the PED.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm healing via endothelialization following flow diverter treatment may occur subacutely and not chronically as previously stipulated.

TI Brainstem Congestion Due to Dural Arteriovenous Fistula at the
   Craniocervical Junction: Case Report and Review of the Literature

ID PERIMEDULLARY VENOUS DRAINAGE; CLINICAL PRESENTATION; MR-ANGIOGRAPHY;
   MYELOPATHY; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; PATTERN; SIGN
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) at the craniocervical junction are rare. Clinical manifestations range from acute or chronic myelopathy to subarachnoid hemorrhage to brainstem dysfunction. We encountered 4 cases of DAVFs at the craniocervical junction with progressive brainstem dysfunction and investigated the typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features using T-2-weighting imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced imaging. Literature review revealed 10 case reports of DAVFs at the craniocervical junction manifesting with brainstem dysfunction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Four patients presented with DAVFs at the craniocervical junction with progressive brainstem dysfunction. Two patients underwent midline suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy, and 1 patient underwent transarterial endovascular embolization with Onyx 18 under general anesthesia. All neurologic deficits gradually improved after the operation. In the fourth case, the patient received conservative treatment and did not undergo any surgical procedure. MRI showed high signal intensity on T-2-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and magnetic resonance venography. Abnormal dilated vessels and flow-void signs around the lesions were detected on susceptibility-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced images. Two cases revealed no abnormalities and had improved neurological deficits than those showed on diffusion-weighted imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, or contrast-enhanced scanning should be used during MRI examination of patients with progressive brainstem dysfunction to differentiate DAVFs at the craniocervical junction from other diseases, such as glioma or infection. Prompt diagnosis using MRI is of great significance in producing good functional outcomes of the patients.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Ablation; Mandibular nerve; MITA; Transoral; Trigeminal ablation;
   Trigeminal neuralgia; V3
ID NEURALGIA; NERVE; NEURECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic orofacial pain syndrome that presents with debilitating shooting pains in the V3 nerve distribution. The condition is traditionally responsive to anticonvulsant therapy; however, cases that become refractory to medications often require surgical intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of TN that was treated with minimally invasive trigeminal ablation. The patient presented with a 6-year history of TN that had been resistant to medical management. The patient opted for minimally invasive management, refused stereotactic radiosurgery, and was treated using the minimally invasive trigeminal ablation approach. At 16 weeks postoperatively, the patient reported complete alleviation of pain with minimal sensorineural numbness.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic approach allows for precise targeting through visual guidance, which is ideal in patients undergoing neuroablation for pain within specific nerve distributions. This is the first documented case of an endoscopic minimally invasive transoral approach toward ablative TN management.

LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Endovascular procedure; Fusiform; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: We report a case of a ruptured fusiform aneurysm of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) involving the anterior choroidal artery and posterior communicating artery, treated with selective coil embolization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 86-year-old woman was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography and computed tomography angiography showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with a fusiform aneurysm, as well as severe atherosclerotic change in the distal ICA. A transfemoral cerebral angiogram showed a fusiform aneurysm in the supraclinoid segment of the ICA with a daughter sac. The bleb lesion was considered the cause of the bleed. The suspected bleeding point was selectively obliterated using the double-microcatheter technique. The patient was discharged without focal neurologic deficits. The treatment of choice for a ruptured fusiform aneurysm remains controversial.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mostly, surgical clipping (vascular reconstruction, proximal occlusion, or trapping) with bypass surgery is necessary for this lesion. However, in our case, selective coiling was successfully performed only at the suspected rupture point. This technique can be a good alternative treatment modality.

ID SYNANGIOSIS; DYSFUNCTION; ANASTOMOSIS; TERRITORY; BYPASS
AB OBJECTIVE: The authors present cases of childhood moyamoya disease successfully treated with bilateral superficial temporal artery to anterior cerebral artery (ACA) direct anastomoses and describe the surgical techniques used in this vascular reconstruction method.
   METHODS: The authors conducted bilateral superficial temporal artery to ACA anastomoses, combined with indirect bypass in 3 pediatric patients with moyamoya disease from 2009 to 2015. All 3 patients presented with transient ischemic attacks related to ischemia of the ACAs and had cerebral blood flow insufficiency, predominantly in the ACA regions bilaterally.
   RESULTS: In all 3 cases, ischemic symptoms corresponding to ACA ischemia had disappeared after bypass surgery. No patients experienced any postoperative neurologic or wound complications associated with the procedure. Improvement of cerebral blood flow in bilateral ACA territories and the patency of the direct bypasses were confirmed by follow-up imaging in all 3 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The described technique can be considered an effective and uncomplicated revascularization procedure for the ACA regions, which are crucial for normal intellectual growth in the pediatric population.

AB The nondominant hemisphere (usually right) is determinant for main cognitive functions such as visuospatial and social cognitions. Awake surgery using direct electrical stimulation for right cerebral tumor removal remains challenging due to the complexity of the functional anatomy and the difficulties in adapting the classical bedside tasks for awake surgery conditions. An understanding of semiology, anatomical bases, and an analysis of the available cognitive tasks for visuospatial and social cognition per operative mapping will allow neurosurgeons to better appreciate the functional anatomy of the right hemisphere and its application to tumor surgery. In this second review of 2 parts, we discuss the pertinence of the neuropsychological tests available for the study of nondominant hemisphere functions for the surgery on right-sided tumors in awake surgery conditions. In conjunction with part I of the review, which focuses primarily on the anatomical, functional, and semiological basis of the right hemisphere function, this article provides a comprehensive review of current knowledge supporting the awake surgery in the right hemisphere.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate how frameless navigational techniques can be implemented to support standard frame-based stereotactic procedures.
   METHODS: In 25 patients (18 deep brain stimulation procedures, 3 stereotactic biopsies, and 4 stereo-encephalography procedures), 57 trajectories were planned. A navigation reference array was attached to the stereotactic frame for automatic registration applying intraoperative computed tomography.
   RESULTS: User-independent automatic registration resulted in a low navigation registration error (0.76 +/- 0.30 mm). Because the stereotactic scan is performed intraoperatively, it can also be used for automatic navigation registration without additional patient radiation exposure. Low-dose intraoperative computed tomography protocols allowed the effective radiation dose to be reduced to 0.39 mSv (i.e., by a factor of 7.7) compared with standard head protocols without impeding navigational accuracy with a registration error of 0.65 +/- 0.05 mm. Additional use of navigation-facilitated surgery, in which entry points and alignments of trajectory paths could be easily checked, provided additional safety. Visualizing the depth of a biopsy needle or electrode during the procedure in relation to target and risk structures greatly enhanced the understanding of the procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a setting with intraoperative imaging, the combination of frameless and frame-based techniques offers new possibilities. Because of the high registration accuracy, the additional navigation provides improved safety and redundancy. Furthermore, the stereotactic procedure is supported by enhanced intuitive intraoperative visualization during the advancement of a biopsy needle or electrode. However, further technical refinements are necessary, such as possibilities to track microelectrodes during the advancement with a microdrive.

AB OBJECTIVE: Irregular shape is a known risk factor of intracranial aneurysm rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of aneurysm shape on intraoperative rupture (IOR) during microsurgical clipping of ruptured aneurysms.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center study of consecutive patients that underwent clipping between 2010 and 2017. Based on 3-dimensional reconstructions from preoperative computed tomography scan and digital subtraction angiography, aneurysm shape was classified as regular aneurysm (RA) or irregular aneurysm (IRA). Risk factors for IOR were identified using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
   RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with 32 RAs and 102 IRAs were included in the analysis. IRAs had a larger size than RAs (8.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 4.6 +/- 2.3 mm, respectively; P < 0.001). There were 36 instances of IOR (26.1%). The IOR rate was greater in IRAs than in RAs (31.1% vs. 9.4%, respectively; P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, IRA shape was the only significant independent risk factor for IOR (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-14.6; P = 0.047). Unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score greater than 2) was not significantly associated with aneurysm shape (P = 0.998) and IOR (P = 0.260).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IRA shape is an independent risk factor for IOR. In the analyzed patient cohort, aneurysm shape and IOR had no significant impact on patient prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patients from contemporary populations with traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from epidural hematoma (EDH) may differ regarding age, comorbidities, and coagulation status. We therefore analyzed predictors for the clinical outcome of patients with EDH treated surgically regarding modern approaches to resuscitation and trauma care.
   METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was carried out. All patients included underwent surgery. The indication for surgery followed international guidelines. Retrospective data evaluation considered data reflecting the effectiveness of trauma care, baseline characteristics, and radiologic findings. In this analysis, we divided patients into 2 groups (isolated EDH vs. EDH plus other intracranial traumatic injuries). The neurologic outcome was assessed at discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.
   RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-eight patients with epidural hematoma, of whom 131 underwent surgery, were treated between January 1997 and December 2012 in our level-1 trauma center. The overall mortality was 6.8% (mortality for patients with Glasgow Outcome Scale score < 9, 15%). As expected, factors with a highly significant (P < 0.01) impact on outcome were concomitant with other intracranial injuries, brain midline shift, and higher Injury Severity Score. Alcohol intoxication was a significant (P < 0.05) predictor of an unfavorable outcome. Anticoagulants and Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission had no significant impact on the outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The outcome for EDH is more favorable than decades ago, most probably reflecting a well-established chain of trauma care. Therefore, EDH is a treatable disease with a high probability of a favorable outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neuronavigation systems are routinely used during neurosurgical procedures. Currently, new imaging technologies are emerging, such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. With mixed-reality devices, the user can analyze and interact with the real environment using virtual objects. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to offer a proof of concept by testing the clinical feasibility and accuracy of a wearable mixed-reality device (Hololens) for preoperative neurosurgical planning.
   METHODS: In patients with an indication for brain tumor surgery, preoperative planning of tumor localization with the Hololens was compared with standard neuronavigation in the operating room. Magnetic resonance imagingLbased 3-dimensional holograms of the patient's head and tumor were created and projected on the physical patient's head using the Hololens. The 2-dimensional projection of the tumor borders as perceived by the neurosurgeon on the skin of the patient's head was outlined both with the Hololens and neuronavigation. Accuracy of the Hololens localization was assessed using neuronavigation as the gold standard.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in this study. Holograms were successfully created in all cases. In 9 patients tumor localization with the Hololens did not differ from the standard neuronavigation system and the overall median difference was 0.4 cm (interquartile range 0-0.8).
   CONCLUSIONS: This prospective clinical study offers a proof of concept of the clinical feasibility of the Hololens for brain tumor surgery planning in the operating room, with quantitative outcome measures. Further development is needed to improve the accuracy of this wearable mixedreality device.

TI Feasibility and Midterm Outcomes of Endovascular Coil Embolization of an

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Embolization; Intracranial aneurysm; Middle cerebral artery; Therapeutic
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular coiling has emerged as an option for the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, which was traditionally treated via surgical clipping. Unlike aneurysms elsewhere, aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) have several features that are favorable for surgery. However, endovascular treatment can be difficult for MCA aneurysms, especially if they have incorporated branches. We report the results of coil embolization of incorporated MCA aneurysms.
   METHODS: From 2012 to 2017, 129 unruptured aneurysms including 10 incorporated MCA aneurysms were treated. The mean neck, height, and width of the aneurysms were 3.74 +/- 1.07, 4.26 +/- 1.06, and 3.97 +/- 1.03, respectively. The mean aspect ratio, neck/sac width, and sac width/neck were 1.19 +/- 0.37, 1.09 +/- 0.21, and 0.95 +/- 0.18, respectively.
   RESULTS: Nine cases of incorporated MCA aneurysms were treated using the double microcatheter technique, whereas the triple microcatheter technique was used in 1 case. There were no procedure-related complications. Postcoiling angiograms showed that 4 aneurysms achieved complete occlusion (40%), 5 had a remnant neck (50%), and 1 had a remnant sac (10%). During the follow-up period, (26.0 +/- 4.5 months; range, 3-49 months), there were no incidents of recurrence and bleeding. One patient experienced a small cerebral infarction 1 month after the procedure, but it did not lead to any permanent neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Branch-incorporated MCA aneurysms can be treated with coil embolization, with few procedural complications and midterm durability with appropriate techniques and devices.

AB OBJECTIVES: We report the surgical outcome of trigonal meningiomas through 3 different approaches with attention to visual outcomes.
   METHODS: Between 1994 and 2017, 23 patients underwent resection of trigonal meningiomas. We performed tumor removal using 3 different surgical approaches through the superior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and modified MTG. The patients were retrospectively identified, and surgical results including visual outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with a mean age of 45 years formed the study group. The most common symptom and sign were headache (N = 14, 60.9%) and visual disturbance (N = 6, 26.1%). All patients underwent surgical resection, 6 via a translateral approach through MTG, 8 via a translateral approach through modified MTG, and 9 via a transparietal approach through the superior parietal lobule (SPL). Gross total resection was achieved in all patients. We found that visual preservation rate was 25% (1/4) in the MTG group, 62.5% (5/8) in the modified MTG group, and 100% (7/7) in the SPL group, respectively (P = 0.044). Permanent complication rate was 50% (3/6) in the MTG group, 50% (n = 4/8) in the modified MTG group, and 11.1% (n = 1/9) in the SPL group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The superior parietal lobule approach is a safe and applicable procedure with a great visual preservation and an acceptable risk of morbidity for trigonal meningiomas when there is a chance of visual recovery or preservation.

ID MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; TUMORS; ASSOCIATION; GRADE; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Although intracranial and spinal ependymomas are histopathologically similar, the molecular landscape is heterogeneous. An urgent need exists to identify differences in the genomic profiles to tailor treatment strategies. In the present study, we delineated differential gene expression patterns between intracranial and spinal ependymomas.
   METHODS: We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the term "ependymoma" and analyzed the raw gene expression profiles of 292 ependymomas (31 spinal and 261 intracranial). The gene expression data were analyzed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 2 regions. The fold change (FC) and false discovery rate (FDR) were used to assess DEGs after gene integration (vertical bar log(2)FC vertical bar> 2; FDR P < 0.01). Enrichment and pathway analysis was also performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 201 genes (105 upregulated and 96 downregulated) were significant DEGs in the data sets. The underexpression of NF2 in spinal ependymomas was statistically significant (FDR P=7.91 x 10(-9)). However, the FC of NF2 did not exceed the cutoff value (log(2)FC, -1.2). The top 5 ranked upregulated genes were ARX, HOXC6, HOXA9, HOXA5, and HOXA3, which indicated that spinal ependymomas frequently demonstrate overexpression of HOX family genes, which play fundamental roles in specifying anterior/posterior body patterning. Moreover, the gene ontology enrichment analysis specified "anterior/posterior pattern specification" and "neuron migration" in spinal and intracranial ependymomas, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The most substantial magnitude of DEGs in ependymoma might be HOX genes. However, whether the differential expression of these genes is the cause or consequence of the disease remains to be elucidated in a larger prospective study.

AB BACKGROUND: Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) is a rare but devastating complication following pterional craniotomy. Although the causes of OCS are unclear, external compression of the orbit by a myocutaneous flap is commonly mentioned as a major factor. We evaluated the ocular influence of external compression using an extraocular pressure monitor.
   METHODS: We measured extraocular pressure in 86 patients who underwent surgery for cerebral aneurysm via a pterional approach. Clinical information and radiologic parameters, including the area of the medial rectus muscle (MRM) and the craniotomy height from the bottom of the anterior skull base, were collected. As a control group, 117 patients who underwent surgery without pressure monitoring were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Extraocular pressure reached a maximum during craniotomy (mean, 22.0 mm Hg; range, 18.4-51.0 mm Hg) and decreased after myocutaneous flap adjustment (mean, 7.9 mm Hg; range, 5.4-17.5 mm Hg). Pressure before myocutaneous flap manipulation differed between patients with anterior communicating artery (Acomm) aneurysms and other patients (mean, 16.5 mm Hg vs. 9.4 mm Hg; P = 0.003). Among Acomm aneurysm cases, the monitored group showed a significantly lower MRM swelling ratio (postoperative MRM area/preoperative MRM area) compared with the control group (1.03 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.17 +/- 0.15; P = 0.036).
   CONCLUSIONS: Myocutaneous flaps can produce unnoticed overpressure on the orbit, resulting in OCS-related blindness during aneurysm clipping surgery, especially in cases involving mandatory lower craniotomy. The continuous extraocular compressive pressure monitoring technique is a simple and effective approach to prevent such a serious complication.

AB OBJECTIVE: The timely treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for limiting the effects of damage; however, there is no consensus regarding an effective method for early intervention. In August 2011, our hospital launched a novel trauma workflow using the hybrid emergency room (ER), consisting of an interventional radiology-computed tomography (CT) unit installed in the trauma resuscitation room to facilitate early interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of the hybrid ER system on functional outcomes in patients with severe TBI.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective historical control study of patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8) who received conventional treatment (August 2007-July 2011) or treatment in the hybrid ER (August 2011-July 2015). The primary end point was unfavorable outcome at 6 months after injury (death, vegetative state, or lower severe disability) as evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Secondary end points included time from arrival to the start of CT examination and emergency intracranial operation. Potential confounders were adjusted with multivariable logistic regressions.
   RESULTS: Among 158 included patients, 88 were in the conventional group and 70 were in the hybrid ER group. After model adjustment, the hybrid ER group was significantly associated with a reduction in unfavorable outcomes. Times to CT examination and intracranial operation were significantly shorter in the hybrid ER group than that in the conventional group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ER system is useful for realizing immediate CT examination and emergency surgery and improving functional outcomes in patients with severe TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: The fusiform gyrus and the collateral sulcus are the anatomical structures located in the temporobasal region. In this study, the topographic anatomy of the fusiform gyrus and the collateral sulcus is detailed to make a contribution for a successful course of temporal lobe surgery.
   METHODS: We studied the basal surface of the temporal lobes of 38 formalin-fixed adult human brain specimens. In the morphometric analysis, the distance between anterior and posterior transverse collateral sulcus and the distance between the occipitotemporal sulcus and fusiform apex were used as parameters. The topographic anatomy of collateral sulcus was identified in detail, and 4 sulcal patterns were used to classify the sulcal arrangement of basal surface of temporal lobe in each hemisphere: type 1, single-branch and unbroken collateral sulcus with no connection; type 2, continuous with the rhinal sulcus; type 3, continuous with the occipitotemporal sulcus and; type 4, continuous with both rhinal and occipitotemporal sulcus.
   RESULTS: The current study showed that type 1 was the pattern seen most frequently (42.1%, 16/38), whereas type 4 was the least (7.9%, 3/38). Overall, 63.2% (12/19) of subjects had the same sulcal pattern in both temporal lobes. The morphometric analysis showed that the mean distance between anterior and posterior transverse collateral sulcus was 50 +/- 16.2 mm and the mean distance between occipitotemporal sulcus and fusiform apex was 26 +/- 8.4 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The topographic anatomy of the collateral sulcus with its surrounding structures is detailed in this study. This study clarifies and supplements the knowledge presently available to help develop a more feasible surgical concept.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the amount of screws needed to achieve an adequate skill level for pedicle screw placement (PSP) via the freehand technique in the nondeformed thoracolumbar spine using the cumulative summation test for learning curve (LC-CUSUM) analysis.
   METHODS: This study includes the first 85 patients who underwent pedicle screw installation in the thoracic and lumbar spine by a single orthopedic surgeon. The surgeon had 1 years' experience of fellowship training in a tertiary teaching hospital. The learning curve of freehand PSP was investigated using the LC-CUSUM analysis. Procedure success was defined as acceptable accuracy of PSP, which was divided into group 1 (the screw breaches the pedicle's cortex by less than 2 mm) and group 2 (the screw is completely within the pedicle).
   RESULTS: A total of 52 cases and 313 pedicle screws were included and analyzed in this study. The LC-CUSUM analysis signaled competency for freehand PSP at the 115th pedicle screw (17th case) in group 1 and at the 312th pedicle screw (52nd case) in group 2. This means that a trainee with no experience with freehand PSP reached an adequate accuracy level of PSP with less than 2 mm pedicle breaches at the 115th screw and completely within the pedicle at the 312th screw. There were no major complications, such as neurovascular injury, and life-threatening complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the learning curve analysis demonstrated that a substantial learning period may be necessary before an adequate level of performance is achieved for freehand PSP in the nondeformed thoracolumbar spine.

AB OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of flow diversion for distal circulation aneurysms of the cerebral vasculature has not been well evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess the use of flow diversion for distal circulation aneurysms (defined as at or beyond the M1, P1, and A1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, and anterior cerebral artery, respectively) in an international multicenter cohort.
   METHODS: Clinical and radiologic records from all patients undergoing flow diversion treatment of distal circulation aneurysms at 3 academic centers (2 in the USA and 1 in Europe) from 2014 until 2017 were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Forty-six patients (mean age, 58.2 years; 33 women) harboring 46 aneurysms who underwent treatment with either the Pipeline Embolization Device (Medtronic Inc., Dublin, Ireland) or the Flow Re-Direction Endoluminal Device (MicroVention, Tustin, California, USA) were included in these analyses. Thirty-four aneurysms (74%) were located in the anterior circulation and 12 (26%) were located in the posterior circulation. With a mean follow-up of 13.0 months, complete (100%) and near-complete (90%-99%) occlusion was noted in 36 aneurysms (78.2%). Angiographic evidence of side branch or perforator vessel coverage was present in 35 aneurysms (76.1%) but was not associated with failure to occlude at follow-up (P = 0.06). All patients had good functional outcomes after treatment (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). There were 2 cases (4.3%) of perforator vessel stroke and no hemorrhagic complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion for aneurysms beyond the circle of Willis has occlusion rates comparable to alternative treatments and low morbidity. The clinical significance of flow limitation through covered side branches requires further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive skull base approaches, including the cosmetically optimal transblepharo-preseptal modified orbitozygomatic (TBMOZ) technique, have been described to treat proximal anterior circulation aneurysms. The use of minimally invasive techniques for previously ruptured aneurysms is rare because of perceived technical challenges in controlling intraoperative ruptures. Herein, we determine the utility of the minimally invasive TBMOZ approach for the treatment of ruptured proximal anterior circulation aneurysms.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an institutional review board-approved, prospective database was performed to identify patients with ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms treated with a TBMOZ approach. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, temporary clip time, intra-operative ruptures, and neurologic outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients (9 females, 6 males; average age, 53.6 +/- 12.2 years) underwent a TBMOZ craniotomy following subarachnoid hemorrhage for clipping of 17 aneurysms (12 anterior communicating, 3 posterior communicating, and 2 carotid terminus). Four of 15 patients (26.6%) experienced intraoperative rupture, which was easily controlled in all patients and did not affect clinical outcomes. All patients had complete aneurysm ablation confirmed on postoperative cerebrovascular imaging. Good neurologic outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Score [GOS] of 5) were achieved in 73.3% (n = 11) of patients at time of hospital discharge; the remaining patients had a GOS of 3-4. No patients experienced frontalis muscle weakness or facial nerve injuries, and all patients had acceptable cosmetic outcomes. One patient (6.6%) experienced a surgery-related complication: postoperative versus vasospasm-induced perforator infarcts.
   CONCLUSIONS: The TBMOZ approach provides a minimally invasive option for the safe treatment of previously ruptured proximal anterior circulation aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Young neurosurgeons have little opportunity to receive expert feedback while learning microvascular anastomosis. Our objective was to determine the importance of expert feedback. We compared students who studied anastomosis by self-learning with those who studied it with expert feedback. Our second objective was to determine the efficacy of intensive training by comparing the skills of the students with expert feedback with those of neurosurgeons.
   METHODS: Twenty-five medical students and 9 neurosurgeons participated. The students were provided with instructional Digital Video Disks (DVDs) and spent 2 weeks practicing gauze fiber microsuturing followed by 6 weeks practicing end-to-side anastomosis using silicone tube. The students assigned to the expert feedback group received weekly feedback through a video call, whereas those in the self-learning group did not. After training, the students completed a final practical examination that was recorded on DVD. The DVDs and procedural products were numbered and distributed to 2 blinded independent expert neurosurgeons for grading. The neurosurgeons completed a similar examination, and their performances were also recorded and compared with those of the medical students.
   RESULTS: Compared with the self-learning group, the expert feedback group showed significantly higher anastomosis scores (P = 0.0261) and a nonsignificant tendency toward slower anastomosis times (P = 0.4188). The expert feedback group also achieved significantly higher anastomosis scores than did the neurosurgeons (P = 0.0055).
   CONCLUSIONS: Expert feedback improves mastery of microvascular anastomosis. Intensive training with regular expert feedback enables medical students to achieve microvascular anastomosis skills better than those of neurosurgeons.

AB BACKGROUND: The pterional keyhole approach is a more recently introduced minimally invasive version of the traditional pterional approach for treating aneurysms of the anterior circulation.
   METHODS: In this study, we compared operative parameters and clinical outcomes in patients treated with the pterional keyhole approach and historical controls in whom the traditional pterional approach was used. We reviewer records of 356 patients treated with the pterional keyhole approach between 2009 and 2016, along with those of 301 patients treated via the traditional pterional approach at the same period who served as a control group. The clinical manifestations, surgical details, postoperative complications, and modified Rankin Scale scores in the 2 groups were retrospectively compared.
   RESULTS: There were 408 aneurysms in the study group and 362 aneurysms in the control group. In the pterional keyhole group, the total clipping ratio was 93.6%, leaving a remnant/wrapping rate of 6.37%, compared with 93.9% and 6.08%, respectively, in the standard pterional group. In the patients treated via the keyhole approach, the mean bone flap diameter was 4 x 3 cm, mean blood loss was 204 +/- 100 mL, mean operation time was 160 +/- 57 minutes, and mean length of stay was 8.32 +/- 2.72 days, compared with control group parameters of 5 x 6 cm, 284 +/- 150 mL, 180 +/- 49 minutes, and 11.32 +/- 2.48 days, respectively. At a 6-month follow-up, 71.1% had a favorable outcome, 25.8% had a poor outcome, and the mortality was 3.09%, compared with 68.1%, 29.9% and 1.99%, respectively, in the control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pterional keyhole approach offers shorter operative times, less blood loss, shorter length of stay, and improved cosmesis without sacrificing outcomes compared with traditional pterional craniotomy.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of lumbar interbody fusion-induced biomechanical changes on the adjacent segments, especially disc height and segmental lordosis restoration, and to provide more information for proper surgical strategy selection.
   METHODS: The medical records of 528 patients who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion were retrospectively reviewed, and a total of 89 patients were included. Surgical indications included degenerative spondylolisthesis (nonspondylolytic), marked disc herniation, or lumbar spinal stenosis requiring extensive decompression at L4/5. Postoperative adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) was assessed based on X-rays and functional status. Disc height, foraminal height, segmental lordosis, lumbar lordosis, and cage geometry were compared between the ASD and non-ASD patients. To identify the possible risk factors for radiographic ASD, univariate analysis was performed first, followed by multivariate logistic regression using variables with P < 0.20.
   RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that the postoperative disc height in the non-ASD group were significantly greater than in the ASD group. The postoperative segmental lordosis in the non-ASD group was significantly greater than that in the ASD group, and the lumbar lordosis in the non-ASD group was also significantly greater than that in the ASD group at the final follow-up visit. Four variables were identified as independent risk factors for ASD by subsequent multivariate logistic regression: postoperative relative disc height of L4/5 (P = 0.011), postoperative segmental lordosis (P = 0.046), lumbar lordosis at the final follow-up visit (P = 0.007), and cage height (P = 0.038).
   CONCLUSIONS: Improved lumbar lordosis is correlated with a lower incidence of ASD, and adequate disc height and segmental lordosis restoration are essential for ASD prevention.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysm rupture is associated with a high mortality and disability despite modern medical care. Multiple aneurysms occur in nearly 16% of patients, and imaging studies of naturally occurring multiple aneurysms are valuable for computational fluid dynamics studies. In this study, we describe and analyze the hemodynamic changes produced in a distal aneurysm after the treatment of a proximal aneurysm.
   METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2017, 24 cases of multiple intracranial aneurysms of the same vascular tree were treated in our center. Full carotid segmentations from digital subtraction angiography, computed tomography angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography were obtained, and transient pulsatile simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics software. Output variables included maximum peak systole wall shear stress (WSS) minimum mid -diastolic WSS, maximum systolic pressure, low shear area, and high shear area both before and after treatment of the proximal aneurysm.
   RESULTS: The mean size of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms was 7.05 and 5.23 mm, respectively (P = 0.035), with respective aspect ratios of 1.22 and 2,04 (P = 0,001), Maximum peak systole WSS was lower and minimum mid diastolic WSS was higher in unruptured aneurysms (P = 0.04 and 0.034, respectively). After treatment of the proximal aneurysm, low shear area in the distal aneurysm increased from 54.15% to 56.93% (P = 0.02). The opposite effect is noted in aneurysms with an interaneurysinal distance <10 mm. Posttreatment peak systole pressure was also increased significantly (P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic changes in a distal aneurysm after treatment of a proximal aneurysm showed an unfavorable profile associated with an increased theoretical risk of bleeding.

TI Petrogenesis of the Middle Triassic Erenhot granitoid batholith in

   the Triassic Mo mineralization in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic

AB Voluminous post-orogenic magmatism holds a key to monitoring important geodynamic processes and crustal evolution within an extensional accretionary orogen. The Middle Triassic Erenhot granitoid batholith from central Inner Mongolia, northern China, is tectonically located in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. This batholith consists of monzogranite, syenogranite, alkali-feldspar granite and albite granite with minor mafic to felsic enclaves and dykes. The formation of this composite batholith involved distinct mafic and felsic magma end-members, concomitant episodic mafic-felsic interaction and intra-felsic magma evolution. Mafic (diabasic) and high-Mg intermediate (dioritic) dykes show enrichment in large ion lithophile elements, depletion in high field strength elements and heterogeneous isotopic compositions, indicative of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle source inherited from prior oceanic slab subduction. The monzogranites and aplites have arc-like elemental features and variable isotopic compositions (I-sr(t) = 0.706132, epsilon(Nd)(t) = -0.4, zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) = 2.8 to 7.4, zircon delta O-18 = 5.32 to 6.74 parts per thousand), clearly suggesting that the felsic magma end-member of a dual heritage was derived from dominant newly-underplated mafic crust and subordinate ancient lower crust. Hybridization processes between mantle-derived mafic magma and crust-derived felsic magma result in the formation of monzonitic enclaves (I-sr(t) = 0.704850, epsilon(Nd)(t) = -0.1) with an isotopic resemblance to the host granites. Fractional crystallization of the monzogranitic magmas endows the differentiated syenogranites and alkali-feldspar granites with highly evolved elemental characteristics. We further deduce that the magmatic immiscibility between K-rich and Na-rich residual melts in a deep reservoir produces albite granites with distinct deformation imprints, variable K2O contents and wide range of crystallization temperatures. Combining with coeval regional igneous episodes as well as concomitant sedimentary and structural events in the northern China-Mongolia tract, the Triassic Erenhot composite batholith can be considered as post-orogenic magmatic products possibly within a coupled geodynamic scenario between lithospheric dripping and concurrent gravitational collapse. Therefore, the documentation of this large-scale Triassic post-orogenic magmatism could not only lead to the characterization of the eventual closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, but also capture a snapshot into the tectonic background for the widespread porphyry-type Mo mineralization in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt during early Mesozoic.

AB The Naoniushan Cu-dominated polymetallic deposit in the central Great Xing'an Range is associated locally with Pb-Zn-Ag or Mo mineralization. Mineralization mainly occurs in the Lower Cretaceous continental volcanic rocks. Here, we present new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock geochemical data, Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data and Re-Os ages for the Naoniushan deposit. The emplacement of the porphyry occurred at 137.8 +/- 1.4 Ma ant the mineralization at 134.3 +/- 0.8 Ma. The granodiorite porphyry has high SiO2 (67.84-73.70 wt%) ant K2O + Na2O (7.67-8.30 wt%) contents and low contents of MgO (0.60-1.04 wt%, Mg-# = 0.44-0.51), TFeC (1.29-2.16 wt%), CaO (1.67-3.66 wt%) and K2O/Na2O (0.75-0.87). The porphyry is rich in large ion lithophilc elements (LILEs, e.g., Rb, Sr, Ba, and K) and light rare earth elements (LREEs), without significant Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.84-1.01), and depleted in heavy REE (HREEs) with LREE/HREE = 12.78-16.57 and (La, Yb)(N) = 15.37-20.68, high field strength elements (HFSEs, e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti) and siderophile elements (e.g. Cr, Co, and Ni). These features are similar to those of adakitic rocks derived from thickened lower crust. The Naoniushan porphyry exhibits positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values ranging from +1.9 to +2.8 and relatively low initia Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, ranging from 0.70458 to 0.70497. Most in-situ zircon Hf isotopic analyses show variable positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from +3.1 to +9.4, corresponding to relatively young two-stage Hf model age: ranging from 994 to 591 Ma (excluding one spot). These isotopic features suggest that the primary magma of thc Naoniushan granodiorite porphyry was mainly derived from the partial melting of Neoproterozoic juvenile lower crust (comprising a mixture of 80% juvenile basalt and 20% ancient lower crust). These elemental, isotopic, ant geochronologic data, combined with the regional geology, deposit geology and fluid characteristics, suggest that the Naoniushan Cu-dominated polymetallic deposit formed in an evolving environment that decreased it compression over time due to slowing of the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate and the transition from a compressional to an extensional tectonic regime following the closure of the Mongol. Okhotsk Ocean.

AB The Dasuji porphyry Mo deposit is located in the Wulanchabu area of Inner Mongolia, within the northern Nortl China Craton (NCC). Three phases of Mesozoic felsic intrusions have been recognized in the mining area, in eluding two pre-mineralization intrusions (i.e., a quartz porphyry and a granite porphyry) with molybdenite bearing stockworks and veins, and an ore-related granite porphyry with disseminated and stockwork Mo mineralization. Zircon U-Pb-Hf analyses, intergrated with the previously reported molybdenite Re-Os isochror ages, suggest that the Mo mineralization of the Dasuji deposit occurred in the Late Triassic (222-224 Ma) am that the ore-related granitoids were derived from partial melting of old lower crust, with a subordinate contribution from mantle materials. Major and trace element analyses show that the pre-ore granite porphyr! (227 Ma) and the ore-related granite porphyry (224 Ma) are both characterized by high silica contents ant relatively high levels of oxidation, with a high differentiation index (DI = 85.0-98.8). The granitoids belong tc the high-K calc-alkaline series and are highly peraluminous, with depletion in Ba, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti, showing similar geochemical characteristics to those of post-collision-related granitoids in North China. Based on geological, geochronological, isotope systematic, and geochemical studies, integrated with regional geological in formation, we suggest that the Dasuji Mo deposit was formed in a post-collisional setting associated with the transition from regional compression to extension between the NCC and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB during the Late Triassic.

AB Many porphyry and skarn Cu (Fe, Mo, Au, Zn) deposits have been discovered along the western Tianshar Orogenic Belt within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Generally, these Cu polymetallic deposits are considered tc be linked to porphyries that formed in an arc setting, e.g., in a continental magmatic arc and island magmati arc, but an agreement on their source region has not been reached. The Husite granitic complex and associatec Kekesala skarn Fe-Cu deposit from the Boluokenu metallogenic belt provide significant insights into a cornprehensive study of the ore-forming porphyries in Boluokenu. The ore-forming porphyries are mainly grano diorites and belong to calc-alkaline and high-K calc-alkaline series. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating on tin granodiorites yields ages of 368 Ma. The trace element compositions of the granodiorites are characterized by enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), depletion in high fielc strength elements (HFSE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE), and slightly negative Eu anomalies and an similar to rocks that form in a continental arc setting. These rocks also show large variations in their epsilon(Hf)(t) (+4.7 to +9.7) and Mg# (38-69) values, alongside low Ba/Th (4-230) and high Th/Yb (3.77-7.41) and Th/Ls (0.21-0.71) ratios, suggesting that the granodiorite magma originated from the partial melting of mafic lowe; crust with a mantle wedge component and involved signals of subduction-zone sediments and fluids. The Husitt mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) exhibit high Mg# (50-62), MgO (3.25-6.93 wt%) and low SiO: (48.8-59.5%) contents, with positive em(t) from +3.3 to +7.4. The zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of the MME (373 Ma) indicate nearly coeval formation between the MMEs and HMPs during the Late Devonian. Then features with the petrological and mineralogical characteristics (such as needle-like apatite and disequilibriun feldspar xenocrysts) suggest that the Husite MMEs formed from the mixing of felsic magma from the partia melting of mafic lower crust and mafic magma that was derived from mantle wedge, rather than restite, xenoliths or fractional crystallization of magma. Thus, the skarn Fe-Cu mineralization were probably related tc hybrid intermediate-acid magma that is characterized by high water and oxygen contents and high sulfur fugacity. It can be inferred that the response to ongoing slab roll-back during the Junggar plate's subductior beneath the Yili Block, including the underplating of mantle-derived mafic magmas from the metasomatism o subduction-zone melts, led to the partial melting of the mafic lower crust to form felsic magma. Then, tht continuous reaction between the mafic and felsic magmas further increased the Fe-Cu concentrations and wa; closely related to the subsequent Fe-Cu mineralization.

AB The East Kounrad Mo-W deposit is located in the eastern part of the Balkhash metallogenic belt, Central Kazakhstan. The intrusion in the East Kounrad deposit is a Permain complex that includes medium- and fine-grained granites. Both the primary magma and hydrothermal fluids of the East Kounrad deposit are characterized by high fluorine and high oxygen fugacity, which would be important for the formation of high-grade large Mo deposit. Four mineralization stages are identified in this study. Stage I quartz-wolframite +/- molybdenite +/- fluorite veins, which were associated with intensively greisen alteration, were formed from fluids with high temperature (340-460 degrees C), high pressure (250-400 bars), high/low salinity (54.5 wt% and 3.4-10.2 wt%, respectively), and high oxygen fugacity with a fluid system of H2O-NaCl-CO2. Stage II quartz-molybdenite +/- pyrite veins, which were accompanied by K-feldspars-muscovite-fluorite alteration, were formed from fluids with medium-high temperature (260-400 degrees C), medium pressure (100-250 bars), high/low salinity (39.1-58.4 wt% and 2.4-11.7 wt%, respectively), and relatively low oxygen fugacity. After the main stage of W and Mo mineralization, stage HI quartz-pyrite +/- molybdenite veins, associated with quartz-sericite alteration, were formed from fluids with medium-low temperature (160-340 degrees C), low pressure (less than 100 bars), various salinity (4.5-46.2 wt%) and high oxygen fugacity. Stage IV quartz-polymetallic sulfide veins, related to argillic alteration, were formed under temperature of 120-220 degrees C and salinity of 1.7-8.1 wt%. Remarkably, fluid boiling is the most important precipitation mechanism of molybdenite and wolframite. In addition, the decreasing oxygen fugacity and temperature also play a vital role in triggering deposition of molybdenite. The Pb isotopic composition of sulfides shows that the ore-forming materials at East Kounrad are dominantly derived from the lower crust.

AB The Aktogai Group (more than 12.5Mt of Cu and 80t of Au) is located in the western part of the Central Asia' Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The mineralization of the Aktogai deposit is associated with the Early Carboniferous tonalite porphyry which intruded into the Koldar complex. The ore-forming tonalite porphyry has higher oxygei fugacity and sulfur contents than those of wall rocks based on results of mineralogical chemistry analyses Hydrothermal fluid activities result in the potassic, sericite(-chlorite) and propylitic alteration, and are associated with disseminated and/or vein mineralization. The alteration and mineralization include three stages Potassic stage is characterized by hydrothermal K-feldspar, biotite, magnetite, "A" veins and disseminated mineralization. Sericite(-chlorite) stage that partly overprinted on potassic stage is characterized by sericite chlorite, "C" veins and disseminated mineralization. Propylitic stage is characterized by chlorite, epidote and "C" veins, and develops in the tonalite porphyry and wall rocks. Five types of fluid inclusions have been recognize in the Aktogai deposit, including liquid-rich (L-type), vapor-rich (V-type), daughter mineral-bearing (S-type) CO2-bearing (C-type) and minor SO2-bearing fluid inclusions. In the potassic stage, ore-forming fluid belongs H2O-NaCl-CO2 system with four types fluid inclusions, homogeneous temperatures and salinities of fluid in elusions are 320 degrees C to 448 degrees C and 0.35 wt% to 51.08 wt%, respectively. In the sericite(-chlorite) stage, the fluff belongs to H2O-NaCl-CO2 system with L-type, V-type and C-type fluid inclusions, homogeneous temperature and salinities of fluid inclusions are 243 degrees C to 315 degrees C and 1.22 wt% to 13.27 wt%, respectively. In the propylitio stage, the fluid belongs to H2O-NaCl system with L-type and V-type fluid inclusions, homogeneous temperature and salinities of fluid inclusions are 211 degrees C to 328 degrees C and 0.35 wt% to 11.46 wt%, respectively. A relativell negative delta S-34 parts per thousand values (-4.61 parts per thousand to -3.18 parts per thousand) indicate that the sulfur derived from a high oxygen fugacity magma. Decreases of the temperature, pressure and oxygen fugacity of the ore-forming fluid result in meta precipitation in the Aktogai deposit.

AB The Tuwu porphyry copper deposit is located in the Eastern Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang, China. Lentiform-likf ore bodies are hosted in the Early Carboniferous Qi'eshan group, and Cu mineralization shows a close association with tonalite porphyry. Porphyry and country rocks have undergone extensive potassic, chlorite-sericite, phyllit and propylitic alteration. The mineralized veins in the Tuwu deposit can be divided into: earlier quartz bio tite magnetite chalcopyrite veins (stage I), quartz chalcopyrite bornite pyrite veins (stage II) ant quartz molybdenite chalcopyrite pyrite calcite veins (stage III), and later calcite quartz vein: (stage N). The Stage H and III are the main Cu mineralization stages. At the Tuwu deposit, three types of fluic inclusions have been distinguished: liquid-rich (L-type), vapor-rich (V-type) and halite-bearing (S-type), re spectively. Laser Raman spectra identified magnetite, hematite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite at S-type inclusions.
   The quartz veins in stage I and II contain all inclusion types. L-type and V-type inclusions are recognized it stage HI quartz minerals, but only L-type inclusions are present in stage IV quartz minerals. Fluid inclusions it quartz of stage I, II, III and IV are characterized by homogenization temperature vary of 275-492 degrees C, 232-477 degrees C 199-287 degrees C and 133-227 degrees C, with corresponding NaCl (equiv). salinities of 2.2-58.7 wt% NaCl (equiv)., 1.4-58.3 wt9 NaCl (equiv)., 1.1-6.0 wt% NaCl (equiv)., and 1.1-4.2 wt% NaCl eq iv., respectively. Initial ore-forming fluids of du Tuwu deposit belong to relatively oxidized H2O-NaCI system with moderate-high temperature and salinity Sulfur isotope data from chalcopyrite and pyrite suggest a magmatic source. Two types of chlorite (type 1 ant type 2) are recognized based on the relationship with metal sulfides. Electron microprobe analysis shows tha chlorites are plotted in ripidolite and pycnochlorite. Decreasing Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios of chlorites indicate that tlu meteoric water was involved in the magmatic water, combined with the positive correlation with ARV, implying that the chlorite formed in a relatively reduced and acidic environment. The hydrothermal fluids in type] chlorite bring large quantities of reduced metallic minerals compared to the barren fluids in type 2 chlorite. Tht formation temperatures of chlorite are roughly coincident with the results that obtained from fluid inclusior studies, which show a decrease trend. Changes in temperature, redox, pH, and fluid-rock interaction likely plat an important role in the transportation and precipitation of metal sulfides of the Tuwu deposit.

AB The Bianbianshan Cu-polymetallic deposit is located in the Xilamulun Cu-Mo belt of Inner Mongolia, NE China, and occurs within Late Jurassic andesite, rhyolite and tuff. Cu mineralization is observed in various types of hydrothermal disseminated veins exhibiting siliciification, sericitization and chloritization. The ore-forming process occurred in four stages: (1) chalcopyrite-pyrite-quartz, (2) pyrite-chalcopyrite-quartz-vein, (3) sphalerite-galena-quartz-vein, (4) and quartz-calcite-vein. Three types of fluid inclusions were identified in the deposit, including C-type (CO2-NaCl-H2O) as well as V- and L-type (NaCl-H2O) inclusions, where only L-type inclusions are observed in the fourth stage. Homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in the four stages are 325-365 degrees C, 282-335 degrees C, 268-312 degrees C, and 195-259 degrees C, respectively, all of which exhibit salinities lower than 13 wt% NaCl equiv. Trapping pressure estimated from C, V- and L-fluid inclusions are between 550 and 900 bars, corresponding to minimum depths of 2.5-3.7 km. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of quartz from different stages (delta D = 109.7 similar to 107.6%o, delta O-18 = 7.6-9.6%o, V-SMOW) suggest that the mineralizing fluid gradually evolved from a magmatic to a meteoric origin. Sulfur (delta(34)(Sv-CDT) = 0.7 to 0.4%o) and lead isotopes ((208)pbi(204)pb = 37.746-38.137%o; Pb-208/Pb-204 = 15.52-15.56%; Pb-208/Pb-204 = 17.75-18.36%) indicate that ore-forming materials were derived from mantle with minor additional participation of crustal reservoirs. Our data suggests the ore-forming fluids of the Bianbianshan Cu-polymetallic deposit are attributed to a moderate temperature, moderate-low salinity, and moderate density system, where decreases in pressure, phase separation and local mixing with meteoric water drove precipitation of metals.

AB Porphyry Cu deposits can be strongly deformed during subsequent tectonic evolution. To date, research pertaining to the deformation and the enrichment of mineralization in porphyry deposits has suffered from a paucity of proof. Here, we describe the diagnostic petrologic and geochemical signatures of the Yuleken porphyry Cu deposit from stages of metallogenic overprinting. The rocks studied in this work are from deformationmetallogenic structures that have (1) a distinguished metallogenic and tectonic evolution, (2) a three-layer, spatial, deformation-metallogenic structure, (3) distinguishably different fluid components within protomylonite, mylonite, and ultramylonite zones, and (4) variational geochemical characteristics of coexisting chalcopyrite and magnetite.
   Integrated sulfide and oxide mineral investigations pertaining to the mineral deformation and the trace element variation of the minerals chalcopyrite and magnetite in the Yuleken porphyry Cu deposit indicated that Cu and Mo can be enriched during ductile deformation through physical (analogous geochemical characteristics of chalcopyrite from different stages) and chemical migrations. The elemental variation of magnetite (magnetites from deformed stages have higher contents of Ti, V, Co, Mn, and Ga than those from other stages) and the variation of the fluid components within the protomylonite, mylonite, and ultramylonite zones reveal that the migration and precipitation of Cu, Mo, and Fe were influenced by oxygen fugacity, fluid components, and temperature variation. In conclusion, the arc-related porphyry deposits were able to become involved in the ductile deformation zone, inducing areas of Cu and Mo enrichment in theory. Units subjected to ductile deformation may have great potential for porphyry Cu (-Mo) deposit formation under the influence of magmatism.

AB Although there are important implications for mineral exploration, the genetic links between porphyry Mo and peripheral Mo-Cu vein deposits remain unclear. To constrain their possible relationships, this paper studied hydrothermal veins, Ar-Ar geochronology, and O-H-S-Pb isotopes from three Mo-Cu deposits in the Baituyingzi district, NE China.
   Mineralization in the Baituyingzi district occurs as quartz stockworks (e.g., the Baituyingzi porphyry Mo deposit) surrounding the Baituyingzi monzogranite porphyry and 0.1-1.5 m wide quartz veins (e.g., the Kulitu and Baimashigou Mo-Cu deposits) along regional faults. Apart from the quartz unidirectional solidification textures (stage 1) observed at Baituyingzi, the sequence of hydrothermal activity at each deposit was similar (although with minor differences) and includes: stage 2, sulfide -barren and Cu -bearing quartz veins related to potassic alteration (e.g., K -feldspar, biotite, hematite); stage 3, Mo-bearing quartz veins with no obvious alteration; stage 4, pyrite -rich quartz veins related to quartz-muscovite-illite alteration; and stage 5, calcite-quartz veins representing late hydrothermal activity.
   Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages of muscovite from stage 4 demonstrated that hydrothermal activities in Baituyingzi (241.4 +/- 1.4 Ma) and Kulitu (239.4 +/- 1.2 Ma) were contemporaneous, consistent with earlier Re -Os ages, indicating that the three deposits were co -genetic in the Early Triassic. Moreover, similar fluid inclusion assemblages, homogenization temperature ranges (up to 500 degrees C) and O-H isotopic ratios (5 delta O-18(fluid) = 4.14%o to 7.89%o and delta D = - 97%o to - 90%0, indicative of magmatic origin) of stage 2 veins, and 834S values (0-3%o) and radiogenic lead isotope ratios of sulfide samples were identified from each deposit, further confirming that the three deposits belong to individual mineralized centers.
   Integrated with previous data, we consider that: (1) the Baituyingzi hydrothermal system formed during the intrusion of the similar to 248 Ma Baituyingzi monzogranite porphyry, and (2) the different stress regimes (e.g., regional structures and local fluid pressures), wall rock compositions, and fluid characteristics (e.g., salinity) of initial fluid branches resulted in the formation of three hydrothermal deposits with different vein attitudes and Cu/Mo ratios.
   Thus, our study reveals that the Mo-Cu vein deposits can constitute individual mineralization centers of a porphyry system as a result of different fluid branches that evolved along individual T-P-wall rock routes. This finding is a novel supplement to the magmatic hydrothermal mineralization model and can provide guidance for the exploration of similar Mo-Cu vein deposits.

AB Fluvial processes have a significant impact on buildings and infrastructure and despite their local character they cause annually considerable costs in mountain areas worldwide.
   Vulnerability studies are based mainly on empirical data from past events whereas laboratory studies investigating the impact forces on buildings are still limited.
   The paper presents a study on impact forces resulting from complex flow processes on buildings, the influencing factors they depend on and the identification of process parameters they correlate with.
   A 1:30 physical scale model was built, representing the torrential fan of the Schnannerbach torrent (Austria). Measurement devices, installed on the building structures located on the torrential fan, recorded impact forces induced by a set of fluviatile flood scenarios. The measured impact forces were compared to computation results using recently developed calculation approaches and to measurements resulting from experiments with a simplified, homogeneous scale model set-up with a single wall element in a rectangular flume. The results show a clear correlation between the approaching flow heights and the impact forces on exposed buildings. Compared to clear water conditions, bed-load transport and deposition processes highly influence the impact forces due to sediment accumulations close to the buildings on the torrential fan. The gained insights contribute to a better understanding of potentially damage-causing impacts on buildings resulting from the interaction of flood processes and the exposed built environment.

AB The use of radar rainfall estimates has been limited by the lack of a reliable method of obtaining operationally accurate radar-based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process. Moreover, the existing approaches have difficulty merging ground- and radar-based measurements due to spatial and temporal variations in bias as well as the uncertainties in model parameters that also can affect the overall bias. This study proposes a novel approach for radar rainfall estimates using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) in the context of bias correction. In particular, three different variations (i.e. the partial-pooling model (PPM), complete-pooling model (CPM), no-pooling model (NPM)) of the HBM are explored to better characterize the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty. In the case of the CPM, rain gauges are assumed to have a constant bias level over the spatial domain, which results in a significant increase in RMSE. Conversely, in the NPM approach, the parameters are independently estimated for each station, resulting in an increase in the uncertainty of the parameters caused by compensating for the estimates of other parameters; this approach also leads to a substantial increase in the RMSE. Here, we introduce the PPM approach, which aims to jointly estimate correction factors across all gauging stations, while considering the covariance structure of both parameters and model errors. The results obtained for the PPM show a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters when compared to that of the NPM. We also note a decline in the bias of radar rainfall estimates. Finally, we further utilize the proposed PPM-based bias correction approach as an ensemble generator for simulation of radar rainfall estimates. The simulated rainfall ensembles can satisfactorily reproduce key statistical properties retrieved from ground reference measurements.

AB Groundwater flow is one of the main driving factors in the erosion of streambanks, particularly during return flow of bank storage as sediment particles on the bank face may be entrapped or liquefied by seepage flow into the stream, and when acting in concert with fluvial forces. Previous research has mainly focused on seepage erosion mechanisms, whereas in this study, a remedial solution using randomly distributed 6-mm-long polypropylene fibers mimicking the behavior of plant roots in slopes was investigated by laboratory physical streambank model experiments. Reduced-scale sandy (14 kN/m(3) unit weight) streambank models (45 degrees bank slope) with dimensions of 195 cm long, 100 cm wide and 110 cm high were constructed in an erosion flume. Two different seepage gradients were generated within the streambanks by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm H2O and 100 cm-H2O in the upstream section of the erosion flume during experiments. Models were equipped with vibrating wire piezometers to measure the pore-water pressures within the streambank. In addition, tensiometers measured pore-water pressures near the wall section. Erosion of sediment from the streambank initiated concurrently as seepage flow emerged on the bare streambank surface. Erosion volumes were computed by three-dimensional laser scanning. Triaxial compression tests on sand samples (fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0% to 1.0%) indicated an increase in cohesion by fiber content. Fibrous streambank protection with 0.3% fiber content inclusion reduced the total amount of seepage erosion by 35%, and 47% under 50-, and 100 cm-H2O piezometric head boundary condition (BC), respectively. Seepage erosion rate and seepage discharge demonstrated a power-law relationship. Due to the increased cohesion, fibrous streambank protection with 1.0% fiber content effectively prevented seepage erosion during streambank experiments under the same BCs.

AB A first systematic study of the isotopic composition of precipitation on the Crimean Peninsula was carried over the period of 58 months at two stations located on the Crimean Piedmont (Simferopol, 290 m a.s.l.) and on the northern slope of the Main Range of the Crimean Mountains (Chatyr-Dag, 980 m a.s.l.). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of these stations yielded a Crimean Local Meteoric Water Line: delta H-2 = 7.3 delta O-18 + 4.8; r(2) = 0.97. The isotopic composition of precipitation at the two stations is partly (25% and 39%, respectively) correlated with the local air temperature, but the degree of this correlation shows large temporal variability. No correlation between isotopic composition and precipitation amount was observed. Far-field controls, such as changing sources, supplying moisture for the Crimean precipitation, or varying strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation do not influence the isotopic composition of precipitation in Crimea on these short time scales.

AB Global warming may affect the regime of hydroclimatic systems and induce more frequent occurrences of extremes, such as drought, heat wave and flood. Apart from the assessment of each extreme, recent decades have witnessed a surge in the study of compound extremes, i.e., the concurrence of multiple extremes. To aid the understanding of compound extremes, a variety of studies has been conducted to assess the dependence among different variables or extremes. As such, it is important to model multiple contributing variables of compound extremes to characterize the associated risk taking into account the dependence. In this study, a multivariate approach based on the meta-Gaussian model is proposed for the statistical analysis of compound extremes in the trivariate case. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated with the compound drought and hot extreme in the U.S. based on monthly precipitation, soil moisture and temperature from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The likelihood of the occurrence of compound drought and hot extreme is assessed based on the joint distribution, which is shown to be higher in regions with significant land atmosphere interactions. The impact of precipitation and temperature on the occurrence of agricultural drought is also assessed based on the conditional distribution. Overall, results show that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical assessments of the compound extreme through constructing the joint and conditional distribution.

AB Reliability of flood stage and inundation extent predictions are affected by the performance of a hydraulic model. However, uncertainties at all times exist in the model setup process. Therefore, prediction from a single hydraulic model implementation may be subject to huge uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is applied in this study to combine ensemble predictions from different hydraulic model implementations and to develop a robust deterministic water stage prediction as well as the prediction distribution. The BMA approach is tested over the Black River watershed in Missouri and Arkansas based on water stage predictions from 81 LISFLOOD-FP model configurations that integrate four sources of uncertainty including channel shape, channel width, channel roughness and flow input. Model ensemble simulation outputs are trained with observed water stage data during one flood event to obtain the weight and variance for each model member, and BMA prediction ability is then validated for another flood event. The results indicate that the BMA approach is able to provide consistently good and reliable deterministic flood stage prediction across the basin, though it does not always outperform the best model in the ensemble. The BMA water stage prediction has better performance than the ensemble mean prediction. Additionally, high-chance flood inundation extent derived from a BMA probabilistic flood map is more accurate than the probabilistic flood inundation extent based on the equal model weights in the Black River watershed.

AB Hydrological-hydrodynamic modelling of basins, rivers and large bodies of water, such as lakes and lagoons, is usually performed by external coupling of hydrological-hydraulic models and 2D or 3D hydrodynamic models. Therefore, the river discharges into the lake are calculated by using the hydrologic model. The data is used then as an input to the hydrodynamic model. This approach allows for a detailed simulation of lake or lagoon hydrodynamics and circulation. However, when the objective is solely to simulate water levels and flooded areas, this approach may become too costly, making it difficult to establish operational systems such as those for flood forecasting. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a first integrated approach using one single hydrologic hydraulic model, the MGB-IPH model, to simulate complex systems such as wind shear influence. This model was applied to simulate the Patos Lagoon (PL) basin located in Brazil and Uruguay countries. Results showed that it was possible to use the single model to simulate hydrographs, flooded areas and water levels in the PL basin. Results of performance indicators in the lakes and lagoons were within the range of results available in the literature. Improvements of model performance metrics were verified with the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing algorithm, thus encouraging the use of the proposed model for the establishment of flood forecasting systems or for the simulation of other similar hydrological systems.

AB The stage-discharge relationship is one of the frequently used methods for continuous river flow measurement. In the management of water resources and flood control, the accuracy of the rating curve is a key priority. Various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage-discharge curves in open channels, including the model of Ahmadi et al. (2017) in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level. In the present study, a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi-objective optimization. To this end, multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross-section. The unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) approach. The validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross-sections. Results showed a close agreement between the estimated and observed data. In the next step, the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the previous model using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results demonstrated that the proposed model was more efficient than the previous one.

ID PAST 50 YEARS; CHINA; TRENDS; ATTRIBUTION; MODEL
AB Pan evaporation, as a straightforward proxy of potential evapotranspiration, has consistently decreased during the last several decades in many regions across the globe mainly because of global dimming and/or decreases in wind speed. Based on a robust measurement dataset of 30-year large-pan evaporation, however, we found that recent increasing extreme climate events have reversed the decreasing trend in pan evaporation by the Lower Yellow River, with a significant increase of up to 25.2 mm/yr during 2008-2014. Further analyses show that the decrease in large-pan evaporation during 1985-2008 (-5.1 mm/yr) was mainly caused by the decreased vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and sunshine hours. While the sharp increase in large-pan evaporation after 2008 was mainly caused by more frequent heat wave and drought events in spring and summer, which resulted in concurrent increases in air temperature, VPD, and sunshine hours. Our finding of evaporation rebound due to heat wave and droughts calls for improved strategies of water and crop managements for mitigating the negative effects of increasing extreme climate events.

AB We study the role of a hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well producing from a bounded (or finite) dual-porosity formation. A combination of Laplace transform (LT) and the finite Fourier cosine transform (FFCT) are used to solve the diffusivity equation. The presented analysis allows identification of five flow regimes, including: 1) early linear flow, 2) volumetric depletion of natural fractures, 3) natural-fracture radial flow, 4) transition from natural-fracture radial flow to total (natural fractures and matrix) radial flow, and 5) pseudo-steady state flow. The results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient, storativity ratio, natural fracture permeability anisotropy, and reservoir size play significant roles on the identified flow regimes compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape. The developed solution can be useful for well test analysis by generating a new set of type curves or can be applicable to a forward model for estimating parameters of reservoir. This study presents a new semi-analytical solution which finds application in well testing of hydraulically fractured wells in dual-porosity formations.

AB The solution for the inverse problem of seawater intrusion at an aquifer scale has not been studied as extensively as forward modeling, because of the conceptual and computational difficulties involved. A three-dimensional variable-density conceptual phreatic model is developed by constraining with real-field data such as layering, aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial conditions. The initial aquifer parameters are layered heterogeneous and spatially homogeneous that are based on discrete field measurements. The developed conceptual model shows poor correlation with observed state variables (hydraulic head and solute concentration), signifying the importance of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of all the layers. The conceptual model is inverted to estimate the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersivity at the pilot points by minimizing the least square error of state variables across the observation wells. The inverse calibrated model is validated for the hydraulic head at validation wells and the solute concentration is validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from the electrical resistivity, which shows good results against the field measurements. The verification of estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with the electrical resistivity tomography image shows good agreement. This investigation gives an insight about constraining the highly parameterized inverse model with real-field data to estimate spatially varying aquifer parameters for an effective simulation of the seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer.

AB For overbank flows in meandering channels, the flow direction along a meander varies and is affected by floodplain vegetation. This study proposes a model for predicting the depth-averaged two-dimensional flow direction (depth-averaged flow angle) along a meander in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channels. Laboratory experiments were performed in smooth and vegetated channels. Measurements show that the height of the secondary current cell in the main channel is increased by dense floodplain vegetation comparing with that in a non-vegetated channel. A method of determining the height of the cell is proposed. At the middle section between the apex and exit sections, where the secondary current cell is absent, the depth averaged flow angle is independent of the height of the cell. Beyond the middle section, a new secondary current cell is formed, and the flow angle is highly dependent on the height of the cell. The proposed model is thoroughly verified using the flume experimental and field observed data. Good agreement is obtained between predictions and measurements, indicating that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the depth-averaged flow angle along a meander in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channels.

AB The vaporization plane in porous media separates the region of capillary flow from the dry surface layer, where the water transports only in its gas phase. Knowledge of the depth and geometry of the vaporization plane is critical for estimating water flux in the soil-atmosphere interphase, for understanding evaporating processes in general, and for prediction of locations of damaging salt crystallization, etc. However, detection of the vaporization plane is a challenging task. This paper explores the use of sodium fluorescein dye (uranine), a popular hydrological tracer, to visualize the vaporization plane in porous media. Uranine was used in the forms of solution or powder on sand, sandstone, and autoclaved aerated concrete, in both laboratory and field experiments. The property of uranine solution to change its color according to its concentration can be used to: i) visualize the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark-orange zone where the pore water evaporates, and ii) to distinguish the zone of vapor flow from the zone where capillary flow is present. Similarly, uranine powder, when applied onto a porous material, clearly visualizes the dry surface layer and the capillary zone, divided by the vaporization plane. This technique can also visualize a complex-shaped vaporization plane in hydrophobic materials. In comparison with other techniques, such as sensible heat balance or heat pulse methods, the use of uranine is accurate, cost-effective, and straightforward.

AB Flood coincidence risk analysis is of great significance for reservoir operation and flood control. Traditional research only focuses on the coincidence of flood peak. Actually, when half or more than half of flood hydro graphs of two rivers are overlapping, the flood event should be defined as flood coincidence. Thus, during the flood coincidence analysis, the whole hydrograph information should be considered. This study proposes a flood hydrograph coincidence analysis method in which flood magnitudes of two flood hydrographs and flood interval time are taken as three reference variables. The Pearson Type III distribution and the mixed von Mises distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for flood magnitudes and flood interval time, respectively. Then three-dimensional copula functions were used to establish the joint distribution of these variables. Selecting the upper Yangtze River in China as a study, the characteristics of flood interval time were analyzed and the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrograph for different return periods were calculated. Results showed that the selected marginal and joint distributions fitted the observed flood data well. For floods occurring in the Jinsha River, MM River and Jialing River, the coincidence probabilities between any of those rivers were higher. The coincidence probabilities between the Wu River and the other three rivers mentioned above were lower. The calculated coincidence probabilities by the proposed method were compared with those by the traditional statistical method. Results indicated that those values were nearly the same and the proposed method reflected the actual coincidence situation.

AB The presented paper describes spatial and temporal variations in extended stable isotope datasets of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in the Sava River water that were used to estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of stream water using an exponential flow model. The re-examining MRT was < 2 years in the Slovenian part of the Sava River and was in a good agreement with previous estimates and with the MRT estimated in the Sava River at Ostrulnica near Belgrade, Serbia. A MRT > 2.2 years was observed in the Danube River at Vina also near Belgrade. The spatial distribution of delta O-18 in precipitation over the Sava River Basin (SRB) was mapped based on the long-term weighted mean annual delta O-18 values and established relationship with various geographical controls (latitude, longitude and altitude). The modelled delta O-18 values in precipitation agree with the measured values in the surface river water at different locations indicating that the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation is the dominant factor controlling surface water isotope ratios over the SRB.

AB Tree pits are attractive stormwater control measures (SCMs) for implementation in dense urban areas because of their small footprint, their potentially low cost and the co-benefits they may bring through improved street tree growth. While they provide street trees with passive irrigation, it remains to be determined if tree pits may achieve meaningful reductions in stormwater runoff. We undertook a streetscape experiment to quantify runoff retention of tree pits in a heavy clay soil with low-rates of exfiltration. We calibrated and validated a water balance model using the field experiment data to identify tree pit characteristics driving runoff retention performance. We then applied the model to different implementation scenarios to ascertain how useful these tree pits may be at reducing runoff to return a more natural flow regime in dense urban areas. The main drivers of runoff retention were identified as exfiltration rates from the tree pits and the connected impervious catchment size. Our results show that it is possible, even in dense urban streetscapes with low conductivity (heavy-clay) soils, to achieve a 90% reduction in annual runoff and to reduce days of runoff to just 15 days per year. However, to achieve this, tree pits need to be sized between 2.5% and 8% of the impervious catchment area, depending on pit exfiltration rates. In practice, achieving these tree pit to catchment area ratios for a dense urban streetscape will require consideration in the planning stages of development works and is expected to be most feasible through implementation of tree pits alongside a suite of other complementary SCMs.

TI Bridging iterative Ensemble Smoother and multiple-point geostatistics

AB Inverse method can be used to fill the gap between huge amount of data from sensors and complex groundwater model. The iterative Ensemble Smoother (iES) is one of the most efficient algorithms applied to groundwater modeling for data assimilation. However, the iES only works for multi-Gaussian fields, because two-point statistics are used to estimate the co-relation between state variables and parameters. In curvilinear geometries, such as sinuous channels in fluvial deposits, the distribution of hydraulic conductivity is non-multiGaussian. Multiple-Point Geostatistics (MPG) method has gained popularity for modeling curvilinear structures by conditioning on directly measured data, such as conductivities. This paper is aimed at bridging the iES and MPG method via pilot points to deal with inverse problem for further conditioning on indirect data, such as piezometric head, in non-Gaussian fields. As a result, the better flow and transport modeling will be achieved because both data and the concept model (e.g., geological structures) are honored after data assimilation. To do that, the iES is used to update conductivities at pilot points by assimilating indirect data, then the updated values at pilot points together with measured conductivities will be used as hard data to model hydraulic conductivity field via Direct Sampling, an MPG method. A synthetic example was used to demonstrate the methodology in terms of characterization of conductivity and flow and transport predictions. The results show that this new approach can not only assimilate dynamic data into groundwater flow model but also preserve curvilinear structures.

AB We perform a comparative study of water discharge from Euclidean and fractal reservoirs. The Euclidean reservoir is modeled by a filter with a translationally invariant cubic network of straight square channels. As a model of fractal reservoir with the scale invariant pore network we use a pre-fractal inverse Menger sponge. The gravity-driven discharge experiments were carried out with two different setups. In the first setup, a porous filter is fixed in container above a lateral exit duct. In the second setup, the exit duct is connected to one of lateral exits of the pore network. In both cases, we found that the squared outflow velocity is a linear function of water table elevation above exit orifice. Hence, the water discharge is governed by the Bemoulli's principle rather than by the Darcy's law. Furthermore, we found that filters placed above the exit duct have no effect on the discharge rate, because absolute permeabilities of both filters are large enough to supply water into the volume between filter's bottom and exit orifice. Conversely, when the exit duct is connected to the lateral exit of the pore network, the water discharge from the inverse Menger sponge is faster than from the Euclidean reservoir. Experimental data fittings with a modified Torricelli's equation suggest that a loss of mechanical energy of flowing water in the fractal pore network is less than in the translationally invariant network of channels. This finding reveals that an effective wetted area along a flow path of least resistance in the self-similar pore network is smaller less than in the periodic network of straight channels. So, the fractal features of the pore network can have a strong impact on hydrological processes in natural reservoirs and karst aquifers which commonly possess statistical scale invariance.

AB At the in-situ Long Term Sorption Diffusion Experiment (LTDE-SD), performed in the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden), anomalous penetration profiles of tracers were observed. The concentration of sorbing tracers, particularly Cs-137, sharply decreased around the rock surface but was still quite high in the distance, which was known that it is difficult to model with the classic Fick's law. To understand the mechanism of matrix diffusion and sorption of solute by reproducing the observed penetration profiles in the LTDE-SD test, three cases for the matrix were proposed and evaluated: (1) homogeneous medium with a disturbed zone; (2) heterogeneous medium considering mineral grains with intragranular porosities and their intergranular pores; and (3) heterogeneous medium considering vein and microfractures as well as porous mineral grains and intergranular pores. The modelling domains for Cases 2 and 3 were established using 2-D microstructure characterization results from analyses including chemical staining of minerals and C-14-PMMA autoradiography. The numerical models for Cases 1-3 were calibrated by minimizing the discrepancies between simulations and observations of the penetration profiles and the changes in concentration in the reservoir for the tracers, Cs-137 and Na-22. The results show that only the calibrated transport parameter values for Case 3 were within the reported ranges, and we concluded that the sharp decrease in concentrations in the near-surface zone in the observed penetration profiles was likely to result from disturbed biotite grains and the long tails in the observed penetration profiles might originate from diffusion along the vein and microfractures transacting minerals.

ID DISCHARGE; STAGE
AB Accurate forecast stages at river sections is of paramount importance to properly address Flood Forecasting and Warning Systems (FFWSs) operating in real-time. The forecast values can be provided by flood wave routing models to be implemented when gauged sections are operative along the channel. Different models have been proposed in the literature and the forecast can be approached by neglecting or involving the contribution of lateral inflows. Among the latter, recently STAFOM-RCM (STAge FOrecasting Model-Rating Curve Model) has been proposed assuming a lateral contribution uniformly distributed along the reach. Therefore, the model application is not suitable for future stage prediction at hydrometric sections located just downstream river confluences. To overcome this issue, we propose a methodology that exploits the probabilistic forecast estimated at a gauged site on a tributary through a Bayesian approach and the probabilistic relationship between the stages recorded here and the ones at a downstream site located along the main channel, where the forecasted stage estimate is of interest.

TI Runoff response and sediment yield of a landslide-affected fire-climax

AB Decades of logging and slash-and-burn agriculture have turned vast tracts of land in tropical South-east Asia into unproductive fire-climax grasslands whose hydrological functioning is poorly known. To help fill this knowledge gap, a 3.2 ha landslide-affected Imperata grassland micro-catchment with perennial flow on Leyte Island (Philippines) was instrumented and monitored for a year. The area was hit by typhoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013, one of the largest events on record. Landslide surfaces covered 3.4% of the catchment prior to typhoon Haiyan and contributed to 'direct runoff' (Q(q)). This basic 'contributing area' increased to 7.7% by activation of old landslides and formation of new ones during typhoon Haiyan. Median storm runoff coefficients (Q(q)/P) based on straight-line hydrograph separation were 9% and 23% before (48 events) and after the typhoon (43 events), respectively, but the ratios of period-total Q(q) and P were much larger (24% and 47%, respectively). Both storm runoff volumes and peak discharge increased rapidly once a mid-slope water storage threshold for the upper 60 cm of soil of 250 mm was exceeded. Storm runoff contributions above those generated on landslides were most likely in the form of overland flow given the prevailing very low soil hydraulic conductivities. Post-typhoon water use of the heavily disturbed vegetation was reduced initially by nearly 70%, recovering to nearly 80% of the pre-typhoon value after similar to 3 months. The high annual sediment yield (similar to 27 t ha(-1)) was heavily dominated by post-Haiyan sediment transport (94%); bedload contributed similar to 8% of the total sediment yield.

AB Radioactive pollutants enter the subsurface hydrology environment commonly because of operation or accidental leakage from nuclear sites. In some occasions, heterogeneity in the groundwater system controls the fate of water transport in the aquifer; it determines how contaminated groundwater change at site boundary. Assumption of uniform and homogeneous conditions in subsurface hydrology will lead to unpredictable errors in the decision when initiating a protection program for groundwater. This study presents a novel process to establish a practical procedure of reliability and risk assessment for a Quaternary aquifer relating to hypothetical nuclear facility installed on the ground surface. This research performs reliability and risk analysis considering specified limit as resistance and in situ groundwater condition as load; it shows a safety state of the studied site regarding the records of radioactivity in the aquifer. It demonstrates a novel result of groundwater at different observation locations and natural environment discharge point associated to reliability issue, and represents recommendation for the use of groundwater or environmental monitoring as safety protection of the studied site.

AB Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) cause environmental problems and health risks, but poor guidance exists on the use of rainfall data for sizing optimal CSO control solutions. This study first reviews available types of rainfall information as input for CSO modelling and, secondly, assesses the impacts of three rainfall data selection methods (continuous simulation, historical rainstorms selected based on rainfall depth or maximum intensity and IDF-derived storms) on the estimation of CSO volume thresholds to control in order to reach specific seasonal CSO frequency targets. The methodology involves hydrological/hydraulic modelling of an urban catchment in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Continuous simulation provides the most accurate volume estimations and shows high sensitivity to the number of simulated years. Alternatively, when historical events extracted from rainfall data separated by a minimum inter-event time (MIT) criterion are selected based on their total rainstorm depth, the CSO volumes are underestimated significantly; whereas an analysis based on rainstorm maximum intensities over durations similar to the time of concentration provides more conservative volumes. Finally, synthetic storms constructed from multiple points of an IDF curve tend to underestimate slightly the CSO volumes, but provide acceptable results compared to single point derived storms. It was found that the overflow structures local characteristics had a marginal influence on results obtained from continuous simulation compared to event-based simulation. The use of design rainfall events should thus be restricted to preliminary assessment of CSO volume thresholds, and the final volume estimation for solution sizing should be reviewed under continuous simulation. The innovative contribution lies in the improvement of modelling procedures for solutions design to achieve a maximum CSO frequency, such as specified by many regulating agencies.

AB The macroscopic effects of soil textural heterogeneity and fine-scale soil layering on unsaturated flow remain poorly understood. In this study we used the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to numerically generate artificial particle packings of heterogeneous sands from which the pore structure can be extracted. Packings were generated from known grain size distributions following sand grain mixing and fine-scale profile layering. Five sands with different mean grain sizes were used to investigate the effects of heterogeneity on their pore structure, including changes in the permeability and soil water retention (SWR). Heterogeneous media were created by mixing a relatively fine sand with coarser sands. In addition, we created layered media having sharp as well as transitional interfaces between the two sand samples. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused reductions in the average pore body and pore throat sizes of the coarser sands, and hence also in their intrinsic permeability. The layered media with a transitional interface showed lower porosities at the interface because of penetration of small particles into the larger pores, while the porosities increased at sharp interfaces. The nonlinear relationships between permeability and the average pore body and throat radii were explored using different unimodal sands. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused a decrease in the capillary pressure at a given water content of the new medium, and hence larger values of the van Genuchten a parameter. The SWRCs of the layered soils with a sharp interface were best described using bimodal functions. Sharp interfaces caused a non-monotonic change in the drainage curve due to discrepancies between the pore throat radii of the two adjacent sands. This change was influenced by d(50) of the sands used for the layered media. In contrast to the sharp interface, a monotonic (smooth) change in the drainage curve was observed for two sands having small differences in their d(50) values. The study gave considerable insight into how particle heterogeneity and layering affects the hydraulic properties of unsaturated media.

AB The present paper studies the effects of alternative modifications of a subsidy for electricity used to pump groundwater on the behavior of profit maximizing groundwater users. It proposes a stylized model for groundwater extraction, and then numerically derives general results by simulation. The model is applied to aquifers in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico and Kern County, California. The performance of two traditional policy intervention measures-subsidy elimination and reduction-are compared to a new, innovative modification policy, namely, decoupling the subsidy from the electricity bill; this policy is arguably more politically acceptable. The results of extensive simulations suggest that the rate of aquifer water extraction, and the consequent level of water in the aquifer, can be improved significantly by changing the subsidy structure.

AB In tropical karstic regions, knowledge about the timing and quantity of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes is important, as those nutrients may affect sensitive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs. High permeability of karst aquifers, combined with high discharge during heavy rain events, lead to a close connectivity between groundwater in the hinterland and the coastal zone. Alteration between dry and wet periods can lead to a temporal variability of groundwater discharge volume and its associated nutrient fluxes. We studied the seasonal variability of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes in the tropical karstic region of Gunung Kidul (southern Java, Indonesia) from November 2015 to December 2016. Satellite thermal infrared imagery revealed two major areas of direct submarine and coastal groundwater discharge. Nutrient fluxes were estimated at the largest coastal spring using a discharge dataset from a subsurface river dam and a monthly record of nutrient concentrations sampled from the spring. Nitrate fluxes ranged from 6 x 10(6)-245 x 10(6) mol/day, dissolved silicon fluxes from 58 x 10(6)-546 x 10(6) mol/day and phosphate fluxes from 17 x 10(3)-1571 x 10(3) mol/day. Nutrient fluxes are mostly controlled by discharge and show a high variability through time. Extraordinarily high nitrate and phosphate fluxes were observed after a period of constant and heavy rain. Most likely a nutrient pool in the top soil in the hinterland from untreated sewage or fertilizer is flushed during rain events through the aquifer to the coast. In tropical karstic regions sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge may affect coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs making them especially vulnerable during high discharge events.

DT Article
DE Precipitation; Asymmetric dependence; Empirical copula
ID GENERATION MODEL; RAINFALL FIELDS; SIMULATION; SINGAPORE; COEFFICIENT
AB Precipitation plays an important role in any hydrological analysis. The aim of this study is to empirically investigate the behaviour of spatial dependence of precipitation fields. This would determine whether the Gaussian assumption is fulfilled in regard to symmetric spatial dependence structure between low and high precipitation values. An asymmetry function that can incorporate zero precipitation amounts is introduced on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas. The asymmetry function is calculated by integrating the empirical bivariate copula density in the upper right and the lower left parts for any given quantile thresholds. Zero precipitation amounts are handled as latent variables and the thresholds, therefore, are set to be bigger than probability of zero. The Gaussian simulations based testing is applied for determining the degree of uncertainty. The empirical bivariate copulas are constructed using the concept of regionalized variables in spatial random process with a given separating distance. For any selected time interval, the precipitation over the region of interest is assumed to be a single realization of a spatially stationary random process. The investigations are conducted in Singapore and Bavaria. To take temporal characteristics and seasons into account, precipitation occurrences with different time scales for different seasons are analysed.
   The empirical evidence proves that the precipitation events tend to follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence structure, particularly at a short separating distance. This implies that precipitation amounts with higher intensities tends to be more spatially correlated than that with lower intensities because precipitation occurrences tend to occur in a clustered manner. Consequently, spatial precipitation models that are based on the symmetric Gaussian dependence could result in an underestimation of the spatial extent of actual precipitation extremes. Moreover, this pattern is higher for smaller time scales (hourly to daily).

AB Surrogate-assisted simulation-optimization technique is an effective approach for identifying aquifer remediation strategies. Using surrogate models to replace high-fidelity groundwater simulation models is key to reduce computing time. Inevitably, uncertainties persist in surrogate model structure and parameters and may lead to poor accuracy in prediction. However, past studies often adopt one surrogate to capture the original model response and rarely investigate uncertainties and approximation accuracy of surrogate models. In this study, we present an ensemble surrogate modeling approach to address uncertainty in surrogate model predictions for saltwater intrusion mitigation designs using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well. Firstly, polynomial response surface surrogate models are constructed to capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates of a horizontal well. Secondly, a stochastic optimization model that includes multiple ensemble surrogates is developed to determine the optimal saltwater extraction schedule. Chance-constrained (CC) programming is used to account for model selection uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear concentration constraints. Akaike information criterion correction (AICc) based Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method is adopted to determine required statistics of concentrations in the chance constraints. Finally, a set of saltwater intrusion mitigation strategies are obtained through an interior point optimization algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied to the saltwater intrusion problem in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A high-fidelity flow and solute transport model is developed, but requires 16 h for one model run. The study shows that the developed surrogate models perform well and have strong predictive capabilities with respect to the solute transport model response, while considerably reducing computation time. Including model selection uncertainty through multimodel inference and model averaging provides more reliable remediation strategies compared with the single surrogate assisted approach.

AB Areal reduction factors (ARFs) transform an estimate of extreme rainfall at a point to an estimate of extreme rainfall over a spatial domain, and are commonly used in flood risk estimation. For applications such as the design of large infrastructure, dam safety and land use planning, ARFs are needed to estimate flood risk for very rare events that are often larger than the biggest historical events. The nature of the relationship between ARFs and frequency for long return periods is unclear as it depends on the asymptotic dependence structure of rainfall over a region, i.e., the extent to which rainfall from a surrounding region is extreme as rainfall at a point becomes more extreme. Miscalculating this for very rare events could lead to poor design of infrastructure. To investigate this, spatial rainfall processes are simulated using asymptotically dependent and independent models, and the implications for ARFs of the asymptotic assumptions are explored in a synthetic study. The models are then applied to a case study in Victoria, Australia, using 88 daily rainfall gauges with 50 years of data. The analysis shows that the observed data follow the behaviour of an asymptotically independent process, leading to ARFs that decrease with increasing return period. The study demonstrates that the use of inverted max-stable process models to simulate ARFs can provide a rigorous alternative to empirical approaches, particularly for long return periods requiring significant extrapolation from the data.

AB Short-term prediction of hydrological time series using chaotic dynamical systems approach has gained popularity. However, noise can severely affect the prediction accuracy of any data driven modelling approach. Noise reduction processes attempted in chaotic hydrological time series analysis were later questioned by Elshorbagy et al. (2002) for their appropriateness for noise reduction processes. Only a few studies on noise reduction have appeared since then, and these too were limited to introducing new noise reduction methods.
   Most of the past studies on chaotic time series noise reduction shared a general perception that the noise reduced data trained models can give better predictions; they used off line noise reduction methods to obtain a 'noise reduced data set' which was then used to make prediction models. However, the results of this study showed that this was not necessarily true and often flawed, when the input data was noisier. Instead, noise reduced data inputs, were shown to yield higher prediction accuracy even with noisy data trained models. Thus, the study showed a real need to use real-time noise reduction methods instead of off-line noise reduction methods that had previously been used.
   The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a popular nonlinear state estimation method from controls literature, was introduced as a real-time noise reduction method and its effectiveness was demonstrated on both synthetic chaotic time series and real river flow time series. EKF produced prediction improvement as high as 15%-40% on the benchmark time series with noise levels varying from 1% to 30%. Two river flow series, with low average flows, showed prediction improvement whereas three other flow series, with relatively large average flows, did not. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used as the state-space models in EKF, and adopting them to time delays different from 1 unit was also demonstrated. The study demonstrated an 'indirect' validation method to verify the effectiveness of noise reduction when several interrelated time series were available; this was supported in observed discharge time series of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta, Indonesia.

   RESPONSES; DRY; PRECIPITATION
AB Plant water use is an important component in the function of Earth's critical zone and this can be examined by decomposing isotope composition of xylem water into contributions from precipitation stored in shallow soil layers and deeper groundwater. The usual procedure for estimating the proportional use of groundwater by plants is to sample the isotope composition of soil and groundwater and determine the most probable mixing coefficients from all potential sources. Here we propose and test a novel method for achieving the same goal without sampling soil water. The method is based on analyzing variability in the stem water isotope ratios of several members of a community and the known isotope ratio of groundwater to 'triangulate' the unknown isotope ratio of stored rainwater. Using a simple water balance model, parameterized to produce the best fit between actual and estimated stem water isotope ratios, we simulated seasonal variation in the volume and isotope ratio of rainwater storage, along with species-specific groundwater use ratios. The method was applied to eight woody plant species growing on two rocky outcrops in the South China karst. Estimated average proportional groundwater use over two seasons varied between 14% and 62% and was site-dependent. For the majority of species, groundwater use increased as estimated stored rainwater volume declined. The two species with highest groundwater use were taller, deciduous or semi-deciduous trees with lower wood densities. While the new method was inspired by the inability to sample water stored in the rocky outcrops, it may have broader use in any environment where the spatial variability of soil water isotope composition is a barrier to estimating average groundwater use ratios. The broader adoption of this or equivalent methods would greatly improve the study of the Earth's critical zone.

AB In this work, we conducted two laboratory column experiments on an undisturbed sandy soil. The first deals with a percolation-drainage experiment whereas the second deals with an infiltration of a constant water flux at the surface of the unsaturated soil. A Bayesian assessment of the soil parameters is performed for both experiments with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using measurements of pressure head inside the column and cumulative outflow collected during the experiments. The results show that both experiments can be well reproduced with the mathematical model based on the Richards equation and the van-Genchten/Mualem models. Furthermore, the inversion of the two laboratory experiments yields similar results in terms of mean estimated parameter values but strong discrepancies occur between confidence intervals used to quantify uncertainty on the estimated parameters. Compared to the percolation-drainage experiment, the infiltration experiment yields more accurate parameters with narrower uncertainty regions.

AB Operative distributed/semi-distributed rainfall-runoff formulations need a mathematically tractable component for estimating the expected areal-average infiltration rate,  I , while point infiltration models are usually adopted for this purpose. A model for  I , suitable for hydrological applications, was proposed by Morbidelli et al. (2006, Hydrological Processes, 20: 1465-1481). The main model tenet is the use of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable and replacement of time by its expected value. While this model- as with many other models for field-scale infiltration- was tested through Monte Carlo methods, it remains untested with experimental observations. In this study, a reassessment of the model's applicability is conducted through experimental evidence from several rainfall-runoff events observed under natural conditions at the plot scale over a slight slope characterized by a silty loam soil. During each experiment rainfall rate, surface runoff at the plot outlet and soil water content vertical profiles were monitored at short time intervals. An overall analysis of our results suggests that the model reliably simulates  I  and surface runoff as functions of time and is also suitable for applications under time-dependent rainfall events. The process of redistribution under rainfall hiatus is not addressed by this model.

AB During the complex dynamic interactions between rainfall and basin properties, different portions of the basin produce runoff at different moments. Capturing this spatiotemporal variability is important for flood analysis, but knowledge of this subject is limited. The presented research aims at improving the understanding of runoff contributing areas (RCA; hillslope sections from which water flows, reaches the stream network, and consequently the basin outlet) and at examining their relationship with the magnitude of a flash flood's peak discharge. A distributed hydrological model (GB-HYDRA) that enables computing RCA and flood discharge was developed. The model was applied to four medium-size basins (18-69 km(2)) in a Mediterranean climate and 59 flash flood events were analyzed. The correlation between basin input flux (basin area multiplied by the basin maximal rain intensity averaged over the time of concentration) and output flux (observed peak discharge) was poor (R-2 = 0.16). However, using a newly developed index, termed IRCA, to calculate the input flux accounting only for the RCA extent and rainfall intensity over it, resulted in a substantially higher correlation (R-2 = 0.64) across a wide range of flood magnitudes. The highest correlation was found using a 50-min time window, which is shorter than the time of concentration. Flood events were categorized according to their magnitude and the differences of several factors among the groups were examined. Pre-storm soil moisture content was found to be similar for all event magnitudes; however, pre-peak soil moisture content was substantially different between moderate and large extreme events. Other important properties that differed between magnitudes were: RCA extent and its averaged rain intensity and ratio of convective rainfall. Finally, areas with land-uses characterized by low runoff potential became dominant and contributed mainly during large and extreme events. Although the RCA and its extent full potential is yet to be fulfilled, it is proposed as a significant tool for understanding processes of flash flood generation at the basin scale in future research.

AB Karst aquifers are known for their complex flow mechanisms produced by the high spatial heterogeneity of void distribution. This study aims at confirming and enhancing the understanding of these flow mechanisms in a fissured karst aquifer using flow simulation with a double medium approach. Groundwater level (GWL) variations of the studied site (a 17 km(2) topographic hill located in Burgundy, France) are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes, 3 karstic resurgences and the outlet river discharge of the catchment basin (40 km2). The Gerke and Van Genuchten double porosity model is implemented in the METIS code and used to simulate GWL variations with a matrix and a fracture medium. Model parameters are calibrated by fitting a simulated fracture medium GWL to measured GWL for four boreholes that are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics. The double medium approach succeeds in reproducing measured fast GWL responses, after recharge events that are not reproduced by a single medium approach. Investigating the model parameters' impact on simulated GWL variations and the exchange flow between the two media allows the conceptualization of the physical structure and the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer. The spatial organization of parameters is observed and indicates areas of higher fracture density producing rapid GWL responses in contrast to lower fracture density areas, which produce slower and higher GWL responses. The fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter controlling the matrix/fracture interface properties are the most influential parameters for the simulated fracture medium GWL and the exchange flow between the matrix and the fracture medium during a recharge event. Calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary respectively from 6.3E to 05 m.s(-1) and 0.3% to 3.2E-04 m.s(-1) and 2.4%, and the exchange parameter varies from 2.9E-10 m(-1).s(-1) to 6.5E-10 m(-1).s(-1). Matrix medium hydraulic conductivity variations have little impact on the simulation results while matrix medium effective porosity affects slightly simulated GWL, values vary from 11% to 17%. Finally, this study shows the Gerke and Van Genuchten double porous medium validity for the simulation of groundwater level in a fissured karst aquifer.

AB Most plant materials are contaminated with small doses of Fusarium mycotoxins and its modified forms that exert subclinical toxic effects on humans and animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the carry-over of zearalenone and deoxynivalenol (pure parent compounds) to intestinal and liver tissues during 6 weeks of exposure to mycotoxins administered per os to gilts. The experiment was performed on 36 gilts with average body weight of 25 +/- 2 kg, divided into 2 groups: an experimental group (group E, administered zearalenone at 40 mu g/kg BW and deoxynivalenol at 12 mu g/kg BW daily with feed) and a control group administered placebo. Tissue saturation with mycotoxins was analysed by liquid chromatography in samples collected at weekly intervals. Six gilts were euthanized in each week of the study. The conducted analyses revealed: (i) a non-uniform increase in zearalenone levels in the duodenum, jejunum, ascending colon and the liver; and (ii) an increase in deoxynivalenol levels, mainly in the ileum, caecum, ascending colon and the transverse colon, and a minor increase in the liver. The degree of tissue saturation was determined by the type of mycotoxin, but not by the time of exposure.

AB We examined the gene expression levels of equinatoxin and equistatin in the sea anemone Actinia equina, when reared at varying environmental temperatures for five months. Both genes were significantly downregulated at 10 degrees C compared to 16 degrees C but showed no significant change at 22 degrees C. This provides the first evidence of an effect of temperature on gene expression, but with no effect of increasing temperatures such as those predicted due to climate change.

AB Accidents involving snakebites constitute a serious public health problem in many regions around the world. However, there are no study about a possible action of snake venom on the reproductive system. Herein we show that Crotalus durissus sp. (Linnaeus) rattlesnake venom (25 mu g/kg of body weight) affected chromatin condensation, and increased the number of sperm with abnormal morphology and the sperm count. In conclusion, besides the known hazards of the C. durissus sp. venom to animal health, this study was the first to show its effect also on male germ cells.

AB Dinoflagellates of the genus Dinophysis produce okadaic acid (OA) and analogues. Cultures of a strain of Dinophysis acuta isolated from the Galician Was contained high levels of pectenotoxins but little OA. Isomeric forms of the latter were suspected as the concentration of OA increased after alkaline hydrolysis. High resolution mass spectra of candidate compounds suggest the presence of an OA-C9-diol ester, reported for the first time in Dinophysis acuta.

AB The gamma-type inhibitor of snake venom phospholipase A(2) (PLI gamma) is expressed extensively in livers of both venomous and non-venomous snakes. It is not clear why PLI gamma s from different snake species possess diverse activities. To obtain high activity PLl gamma s and interpret the sequence-function relationships, we used DNA shuffling to hybridize the PLI gamma s of Sinonatrix annularis (saPLl gamma) and Elaphe carinata (ecPLl gamma). Chimera PLI gamma s (cPLI gamma) of similar to 550 bp were obtained by a series of gene manipulations including DNase I digestion, primer-free PCR, and PCR amplification with PLl gamma s primer pair. After successful insertion of cPLI gamma s into pCANTAB5e phage vector, the transformed TG1 strain of Esherichia coli was achieved. The cPLI gamma phage library was produced and panned in a five-pace snake venom-coated immune tube. Three high affinity cPLI gamma isoforms survived two rounds of panning. Prokaryote expression by the pET28c vector was employed for production of the three cPLl gamma s and the two parental PLI gamma s. These all showed anti-hemorrhage activity with cPLl gamma 2 demonstrating superior inhibition to the parent PLl gamma s. Sequence alignment showed that the three kinds of cPLI gamma were produced by gene splicing of S. annularis and E. carinata at different sites. Primary sequence changes brought regional changes in secondary and tertiary structure, which may explain the differences in PLI gamma activity.

AB Envenomation by the larval or pupal stages of moths occurs when the victim presses their hairs. They penetrate the subcutaneous tissue, releasing toxins such as proteolytic enzymes, histamine and other pro-inflammatory substances. Cutaneous reactions, including severe pain, oedema and erythema are frequent local manifestations of caterpillar envenomation, but, in some cases, the reactions can evolve into vesicles, bullae, erosions, petechiae, superficial skin necrosis and ulcerations. Alternatively, some individual can develop allergic reactions, renal failure, osteochondritis, deformity and immobilization of the affected joints and intracerebral bleeding. Caterpillars produce venom to protect themselves from predators; contact with humans is accidental and deserves close attention. Their venoms have not been well studied, except for toxins from some few species. The present review brings together data on venomous caterpillars of moths, primarily addressing the available literature on diversity among the different families that cause accident in humans, the structures used in their defense, venom composition and clinical aspects of the envenomations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of action of caterpillars' toxins may lead to the development of more adequate treatments.

AB Co-occurrence of mycotoxin contamination of feeds is a frequent problem, therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) on lipid peroxidation, parameters and regulation of the glutathione redox system in broiler chickens in a sub-chronic (7 day) study. The applied doses were: low mix: 0.23 mg T-2 toxin and 4.96 mg DON/kg feed; medium mix: 1.21 mg T-2 toxin and 12.38 mg DON/kg feed; and high mix: 2.42 T-2 toxin and 24.86 mg DON/kg feed. Liver samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the feeding trial. Lipid peroxidation decreased significantly as compared to the control on days 3 and 7 as effect of low and high doses, which can be related to the activation of the antioxidant system, which is supported by the elevated glutathione peroxidase activity and reduced glutathione concentration as compared to the control on day 3 in the medium and high dose groups. Gene expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) elevated on day 1 in a dose dependent manner, and showed continuous elevation in the highest dose group thereafter. The results suggested that common exposure of T-2 toxin and DON induced oxidative stress in the liver of broiler chickens, which activated the enzymatic antioxidant system, and consequently decreased lipid peroxidation.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary ochratoxin A (OA), in the presence and absence of L-carnitine (LC) and vitamin E (VE), on the humoral immune responses of White Leghorn cockerels (WLC). One-day old white male Leghorn chicks were divided into 12 groups, having 20 birds each and were offered ration contaminated with OA (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg feed) alone and concurrently with LC (1.0 g/kg) and/or VE (0.2 g/kg), for 42 days. The humoral immune responses were accessed by lymphoproliferative response to avian tuberculin, in vivo phagosomes activity to carbon particles and antibody response to the sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). The dietary addition of OA alone suppressed the humoral immune responses, however, the exposure of birds to 1.0 mg/kg OA in the presence of LC and/or VE showed a significant reduction in OA induced immunotoxicity. This protective response was absent in the birds fed 2.0 mg/kg OA in the presence and absence of LC and/or VE. Histopathological and morphometric examination of the bursa of Fabricius exhibited a decrease in the severity and frequency of OA induced lesions in the presence of dietary LC and/or VE. The use of LC and VE as dietary supplement, can effectively overcome OA (<= 1.0 mg/kg) induced immunosuppression.

AB In the present study, 45 children in Upper Egypt (less than 16 years old) were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for scorpion envenomation (SE). They were compared with 30 apparently healthy children of matching age and sex as controls. Out of the studied victims, 35 children (78%) showed signs of severe envenomation, while 10 victims (22%) showed signs of mild envenomation. The case fatality was 33%. The serum levels of cardiac markers, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI), as well as the enzymatic activities of creatine kinase-MB (CPK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined for both victims and controls. In addition, the serum levels of oxidative stress markers, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and zinc (Zn) were measured. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were done. All the envenomed victims showed significantly higher mean values of cTnT, cTnI, CPK-MB and LDH than control group. These cardiac markers were elevated in severe cases and in non survivors in comparison with mild cases and survivors respectively. Furthermore, the serum levels of NO and MDA were significantly higher while the serum levels of SOD, GSH and Zn were significantly lower in all envenomed victims than the controls (p < 0.05 for all). There were no significant differences in the serum levels of oxidative stress markers among severe and mild cases or between survivors and non survivors victims. There were no significant correlations between the serum levels of cardiac markers and the oxidative stress markers in envenomed victims. In conclusions, oxidative stress occurs in scorpion envenomed children, but does not determine prognosis. Cardiac markers, but not the oxidative stress, remain the most important determining factor for the severity and the outcome of SE.

AB The main aim of this research was to evaluate the toxicokinetic characteristics of fusarenon-X (FX) and its metabolite, nivalenol (NIV), in goats. The amounts of FX and NIV in post-mitochondrial (S-9), microsomal and cytosolic fractions of diverse tissues of the goat were also investigated. FX was intravenously (iv) or orally (po) administered to goats at dosages of 0.25 and 1 mg/kg bw, respectively. The concentrations of FX and NIV in plasma, feces and urine were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The concentrations of FX in plasma were quantified up to 8 h with both routes of administration. A large amount of NIV (metabolite) was quantifiable in plasma, urine and feces after both administrations. The C-max value of FX was 413.39 +/- 206.84 ng/ml after po administration. The elimination half-life values were 1.64 +/- 0.32 h and 4.69 +/- 1.25 h after iv and po administration, respectively. In vitro experiments showed that the conversion FX-to-NIV mainly occurs in the liver microsomal fraction. This is the first study that evaluates the fate and metabolism of FX in ruminant species.

AB Herein, we report the presence and concentrations of three most common variants of microcystin (MC-LR, -RR and -YR) in the liver and muscle tissues of wild Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and African Sharp Tooth Catfish (Clarias gariepinus), which were collected from two study sites of the present study on Koka reservoir, Ethiopia. A total of 36 fish liver and 36 fish muscle samples were collected for six months. Microcystins (MCs) were quantified using LC-ESI-HRMS. The results show that MCs were found in most of the fish liver samples, while they were below the detection limit of the method of analysis used in the muscle samples. In addition to the three most common congeners of MCs, eight other microcystin variants and cylindrospermopsin were detected in the fish liver samples although further detailed study is needed. Among the three most common MC congeners, MC-LR was more prevalent than MC -RR and MC-YR in the liver samples of the three fish species. The highest MC concentration was found in Nile Tilapia collected in April (591.60 mu g/g DW of MC-LR), whereas the lowest detected concentration was in Catfish collected in March (2.23 mu g/g DW of MC-RR). The results of this study suggest that further intensive assessment and monitoring of the reservoir from different perspectives should be conducted in order to reduce the concentrations of the MCs and seek solutions to the potential public health risk. Moreover, this is the first study ever to report detailed quantification of MCs in fish liver and muscle samples collected from Ethiopia.

AB With an extensive range in tropical and subtropical waters of Indo-Australian region and the Pacific coast of the American continent, the yellow-bellied sea snake, Hydrophis platurus, is the most broadly distributed snake species on our planet. We report a comparative analysis of the mRNA and microRNA transcriptional profiles of the venom glands of Costa Rican juvenile and adult yellow-bellied sea snakes, and correlate these datasets with the previously reported venom proteome gathered from an adult specimen of the same population of Playa del Coco. The transcriptomic profiles are qualitatively and quantitatively remarkably similar across both age classes, being overwhelmingly (> 99%) dominated by only three toxin classes, three-finger toxins (3FTx, 88%), phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2), 10-11%), and cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP, 1%). The only appreciable difference between the transcriptomes of juvenile and adult Costa Rican yellow-bellied sea snake lies in the relative abundance of short and long neurotoxic 3FTxs. Comparison of venom gland transcriptome and venom proteome datasets suggest that the venom arsenal of adult H. platurus from Playa del Coco (CR) is subjected to post transcriptional modulation, involving repression of the translation of pelamitoxin a-encoding mRNAs and enhancement of the translational activity of PLA(2) and CRISP mRNAs.

AB Botulinum toxin type A (subtype A1) is used as therapeutic agent for some neurological disorders causing spasticity. The toxin products have an upper dosage limit, and their adverse events, such as side effects of diffusion following high-dose administration, have become serious issues. Therefore, a preparation with greater therapeutic efficacy at lower dosages and less diffusion in the body is desired. We have attempted to produce neurotoxin derived from subtype A2 (A2NTX), which has a different amino acid sequence from that of neurotoxin derived from subtype A1. In this study, to investigate whether A2NTX is applicable for treatment, we compared the muscle relaxation effects and the toxicity between A1LL and A2NTX in adult cynomolgus macaques. In the isometric muscle contraction test elicited by 30 Hz tetanus stimulation, the contractions observed in the 0.4 U/site A1LL-treated group were similar in value to those in the 0.13 U/site A2NTX-treated group. In the toxicity test, the 12 and 24 U/kg A1LL- and A2NTX-treated groups all exhibited similar signs of toxicity regarding symptoms, rate of weight loss, and decrease in the length of the right lower leg perimeter. Thus, A2NTX demonstrated approximately 3.0-times higher muscle relaxation activity than A1LL, and their toxicity was equivalent. This study suggested that A2NTX products are more suitable for the treatment of neurological disorders.

AB Snakebite causes a large amount of morbidities and mortalities in Africa. The safety, efficacy, and homogeneity of anti-snake venoms are crucial for snakebite treatments to be effective with minimal adverse effects. We assessed the homogeneity of preparations of three different batches of Combipack snake venom antiserums (Pan Africa) [CSVAPA] by quantitatively analysing F(ab')(2), IgG, and other contaminating proteins of plasma. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that approximately 92.4% of the proteins from the CSVAPA samples was IgG/F(ab')(2) and the percent composition of contaminating proteins in CSVAPA varied from 0.07 to 4.6%. Batch 1 of the CSVAPA also contained a minor amount of undigested IgG and F(ab')(2) aggregates. CSVAPA contained more than 60% venom specific antibodies, showed moderate complement activation, no IgE contamination, safe level of endotoxin, and also showed pre-clinical safety. The immuno cross-reactivity of CSVAPA against 14 Viperidae and Elapidae snake venoms of Africa was tested by ELISA and immunoblotting, and the neutralization of major enzymatic venom activities, demonstrating that high molecular weight (> 50 kDa) venom proteins are better recognized/neutralized compared to relatively low molecular weight (< 20 kDa) venom proteins. CSVAPA at a dose of 3-12 times higher than the clinical dose did not cause deaths or adverse reaction of treated rabbits. The results suggest the satisfactory quality, safety, and efficacy of CSVAPA.

AB Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) recipients are at an increased risk of infectious complications, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality post-transplant. Vaccination of donors is one of the strategies that has been studied to improve immune reconstitution post-transplant, however the efficacy and safety of this strategy is not well reviewed in the literature. In this systematic review we sought to evaluate the current strategies of donor vaccination along with their immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety. Utilizing strict selection criteria with defined MeSH terminology, an electronic search was conducted from the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scopus. Abstracts of various professional society meetings were also screened and hand searching of various reviews and guideline articles was carried out. The full text of 52 articles were reviewed, from which 5 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria for effectiveness and immunogenicity trials and 1 article was included for safety data. Jadad score was used to assess the quality of included studies. The results of the included studies were inconsistent, and the studies were generally of suboptimal methodological quality. Most of the included studies (n = 3) investigated the use of more than one vaccine, however not all commonly used vaccines in HCT were investigated. None of the studies reported any long-term benefits for HCT recipients of vaccinated donors. Only one study reported safety data of using vaccination in donors. Given the suboptimal quality of the studies, and questionable effectiveness, donor vaccination cannot be recommended for all. Prospective high quality vaccine trials in HCT donors are needed.

AB Almost all commercial poultry are vaccinated against avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using live attenuated vaccines mass administered by spray at day of hatch. Although many different types of IBV vaccines are used successfully, the ArkDPI serotype vaccine, when applied by spray, does not infect and replicate sufficiently to provide protection against homologous challenge. In this study, we examined a different Ark vaccine strain (Ark99), which is no longer used commercially due to its reactivity in one day old chicks, to determine if it could be further attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs but still provide adequate protection. Further attenuation of the Ark99 vaccine was achieved by passage in embryonated eggs but ArkGA P1, P20, and P40 (designated ArkGA after P1) were still too reactive to be suitable vaccine candidates. However, ArkGA P60 when given by spray had little or no vaccine reaction in one day old broiler chicks, and it induced protection from clinical signs and ciliostasis following homologous challenge. In addition, vaccinated and challenged birds had significantly less challenge virus, an important measure of protection, compared to non-vaccinated and challenged controls. The full-length genomes of viruses from egg passages 1, 20, 40, and 60 were sequenced using the Illumina platform and the data showed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had accumulated in regions of the genome associated with viral replication, pathogenicity, and cell tropism. ArkGA P60 accumulated the most SNPs in key genes associated with pathogenicity (polyprotein gene 1ab) and cell tropism (spike gene), compared to previous passages, which likely resulted in its more attenuated phenotype. These results indicate that the ArkGA P60 vaccine is safe for spray vaccination of broiler chicks and induces suitable protection against challenge with pathogenic Ark-type virus.

AB Background: Standard influenza vaccines may be of limited benefit to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). These patients may benefit from high-dose influenza vaccine, currently indicated for patients aged >= 65 years. Studies in other populations have demonstrated that high-dose vaccine elicits a stronger immunological response. We compared vaccine uptake in the United States and predictors of receipt for high-dose and standard influenza vaccines.
   Methods: Using data from the United States Renal Data System (2010-2013), we conducted a cohort study of 421,482 adult patients on hemodialysis. We examined temporal trends in uptake of high-dose or standard trivalent influenza vaccine each influenza season, and used multivariate logistic regression to assess the association between individual-level variables (e.g., demographics, comorbidities) and facility-level variables (e.g., facility size and type) with vaccine receipt.
   Results: The proportion of patients with ESRD who were vaccinated with any influenza vaccine increased from 68.3% in 2010 to 72.4% in 2013. High-dose vaccines were administered to 0.9% of patients during the study period, and 16.7% of high-dose vaccines were administered to patients <65 years of age. Among patients aged >= 65 years, older patients (>79 vs. 65-69 years: OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19-1.41) and patients at hospital-based versus free-standing dialysis facilities (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.13-2.45) were more likely to receive high-dose vaccine, while blacks (vs. whites [OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.71]) and patients with longer duration of ESRD (>9 vs. 0 years: OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78) were less likely to receive the high-dose vaccine.
   Conclusions: While the overall influenza vaccination rate has increased, use of high-dose vaccine among patients with ESRD was very low. Being an older patient, living in the Midwest, and receiving care at hospital-based facilities were the strongest predictors of receiving high-dose vaccine. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype Asia-1 is prevalent in countries considered high risk for incursion into Australia, and has recently been responsible for a number of outbreaks in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Turkey. In vitro vaccine matching has shown a number of contemporary FMDV Asia-1 strains vary antigenically to the Asia-1 Shamir vaccine strain, which could result in poor protection with use of this vaccine. Therefore it was important to test the ability of the Asia-1 Shamir vaccine to protect sheep from challenge with a recent, heterologous strain at different days post-vaccination (dpv), including in an emergency vaccination scenario (challenge 4 or 7 dpv). Sheep (5 per group) were challenged with the Asia-1 /PAK/19/2014 isolate by intra-nasopharyngeal instillation 21 (V21), 7 (V7) or 4 (V4) dpv with high-potency (>6 PD50) Asia-1 Shamir vaccine. An additional five sheep were mock-vaccinated with adjuvant only (antigen-free preparation) 4 days prior to challenge (A4), and five unvaccinated (UV) control sheep were also challenged. All V21, V7 and V4 sheep were protected from clinical FMD. Eighty percent of V21 sheep and 40% of V7 sheep had sterile immunity, however all V4 sheep became systemically infected. Vaccination reduced excretion of virus in nasal and oral secretions but had no effect on the development of persistent infection. All A4 sheep and UV control sheep developed clinical FMD. The high-potency Asia-1 Shamir vaccine will protect against disease should an outbreak of contemporary Asia-1 viruses occur. Intranasopharyngeal instillation is an effective challenge method for use in vaccine efficacy studies in sheep. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a disease burden in the swine industry in the US and is a challenge to prevent due to substantial genetic and antigenic diversity of IAV that circulate in pig populations. Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines formulated with oil-in-water (OW) adjuvant are commonly used in swine. However, WIV-OW are associated with vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) when the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the vaccine strain are mismatched with the challenge virus. Here, we assessed if different types of adjuvant in WIV vaccine formulations impacted VAERD outcome. WIV vaccines with a swine delta 1-H1N2 were formulated with different commercial adjuvants: OW1 OW2, nano-emulsion squalene-based (NE) and gel polymer (GP). Pigs were vaccinated twice by the intramuscular route, 3 weeks apart, then challenged with an H1N1pdm09 three weeks post-boost and necropsied at 5 days post infection. All WIV vaccines elicited antibodies detected using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against the homologous vaccine virus, but not against the heterologous challenge virus; in contrast, all vaccinated groups had cross-reactive IgG antibody and IFN-gamma responses against H1N1 pdm09, with a higher magnitude observed in OW groups. Both OW groups demonstrated robust homologous HI titers and cross-reactivity against heterologous H1 viruses in the same genetic lineage. However, both OW groups had severe immunopathology consistent with VAERD after challenge when compared to NE, GP, and non-vaccinated challenge controls. None of the WIV formulations protected pigs from heterologous virus replication in the lungs or nasal cavity. Thus, although the type of adjuvant in the WIV formulation played a significant role in the magnitude of immune response to homologous and antigenically similar H1, none tested here increased the breadth of protection against the antigenically-distinct challenge virus, and some impacted immunopathology after challenge.

AB Introduction: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection acquired during pregnancy can pose a risk to the infant at birth that can lead to significant and lifelong morbidity. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) is recommended for anyone at increased risk for contracting HBV infection, including pregnant women. Limited data are available on the safety of HepB administration during pregnancy.
   Objectives: To assess the frequency of maternal HepB receipt among pregnant women and evaluate the potential association between maternal vaccination and pre-specified maternal and infant safety outcomes.
   Methods: We examined a retrospective cohort of pregnancies in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) resulting in live birth outcomes from 2004 through 2015. Eligible pregnancies in women aged 12-55 years who were continuously enrolled from 6 months pre-pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum in VSD integrated health systems were included. We compared pregnancies with HepB exposure to those with other vaccine exposures, and to those with no vaccine exposures. High-risk conditions for contracting HBV infection were identified up to one-year prior to or during the pregnancy using ICD-9 codes. Maternal and fetal adverse events were also evaluated according to maternal HepB exposure status.
   Results: Among over 650,000 pregnancies in the study period, HepB was administered at a rate of 2.1 per 1000 pregnancies (n = 1399), commonly within the first 5 weeks of pregnancy. Less than 3% of the HepB-exposed group had a high-risk ICD-9 code indicating need for HepB; this was similar to the rate among HepB unvaccinated groups. There were no significant associations between HepB exposure during pregnancy and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, cesarean delivery, pre-term delivery, low birthweight or small for gestational age infants.
   Conclusions: Most women who received maternal HepB did not have high-risk indications for vaccination. No increased risk for the adverse events that were examined were observed among women who received maternal HepB or their offspring. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza vaccination is the most effective intervention to prevent influenza virus infections. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary due to factors such as matching between vaccine strains and prevailing strains, age and other characteristics of the vaccine recipients.
   Objective: To evaluate influenza VE against medically-attended illness in different age groups and against specific influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong.
   Methods: A test-negative study was conducted from December 2014 through August 2017 in 20 outpatient clinics. Patients at least 6 months of age presenting with at least two symptoms of acute respiratory illness, ARI (fever >= 37.8 degrees C, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, myalgia and phlegm) within 72 h of onset were tested for influenza virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Vaccination history was assessed by self-report or medical records at the clinics. VE against medically-attended illness was estimated using conditional logistic regression for influenza PCR result versus vaccination history, matching by calendar time and adjusting for age, age-squared, sex, and chronic medical illness. Additional analyses examined VE by age group and by influenza type/subtype.
   Results: We enrolled 2566 patients, of whom 1118 (43.6%) tested positive for influenza A or B virus by PCR. Test-positive subjects were generally older, more likely to present with one of the symptoms of ARI, and less likely to receive vaccination against influenza. VE estimates for influenza A(H1N1), A (H3N2), B/Yamagata and B/Victoria were 61.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 21.8%, 81.1%), 26.4% (95% CI: -1.3%, 46.6%), 67.0% (95% CI: 25.9%, 85.3%), 60.4% (95% CI: 0.3%, 84.3%), respectively. Estimates of VE by age group were generally higher in adults aged 50-64 and lower among children and older adults.
   Conclusions: VE against medically-attended influenza was moderate in Hong Kong, confirming the impact of influenza vaccination in reducing disease burden. The reduced VE for influenza A(H3N2) is a continuing concern. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The immunomodulatory effects of statins may reduce the immune response induced by influenza vaccines. However, evidence regarding the effect of statin use on the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines against medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) in the elderly remains scarce.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Elderly adults aged >= 66 years who were vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines during the 2007-2008 to 2012-2013 influenza seasons were enrolled for this analysis. We compared the risk of MAARI between statin and non-statin users. Propensity score matching and conditional logistic regression models were used to analyze the data.
   Results: A total of 440,180 elderly were included in this study. In general, the risk of MAARI was higher in statin users than non-statin users (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.05). Statin exposure after vaccination was associated with a higher risk of MAARI (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07). Among different statin agents, simvastatin and lovastatin use was associated with a significant increase in the risk of MAARI (ORsimvastatin : 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18; ORlovastatin: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12-1.25).
   Conclusions: Statin exposure, especially simvastatin and lovastatin, was associated with a higher risk of MAARI in the seasonal influenza vaccinated elderly. Future studies exploring the differences between individual statins and mechanisms of their immunomodulatory effects are necessary. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Newborns and infants less than 6 months of age continue to be at highest risk of severe outcomes from pertussis infection. Pertussis vaccination during the last trimester of pregnancy can confer protection to newborns as a result of trans-placental transfer of pertussis antibodies. In several countries, pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is recommended routinely and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued similar routine recommendations in February 2018. Using second trimester bio-banked plasma samples (n = 1752) collected between 2008 and 2011, we measured the pre-existing anti-pertussis toxin (PT) levels in a large cohort of second-trimester pregnant women using a commercial ELISA test. We found that 97.5% of these women had anti-PT IgG titres below 35 IU/mL. Women with higher incomes had slightly higher anti-PT levels but 96% still had titres <35 IU/ml. In conclusion, almost all of the pregnant women in this large cohort had anti-PT levels low enough to suggest susceptibility to pertussis infection in both the mothers and their newborn infants.

AB Influenza vaccines are the most effective intervention to prevent the substantial public health burden of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA), as the main antigen in inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), elicits functional neutralizing antibodies and largely determines IIV effectiveness. HA potency has been evaluated by single-radial immunodiffusion (SRID), the standard in vitro potency assay for IIVs, to predict vaccine immunogenicity with a correlation to protective efficacy. We previously reported that limited trypsin digestion (LTD) selectively degraded stressed HA, so that an otherwise conformationally insensitive biophysical quantification technique could specifically quantify trypsin-resistant, immunologically active HA. Here, we demonstrate that isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), a method capable of quantifying the absolute HA concentration without reference antigen use, can be further expanded by adding LTD followed with precipitation to selectively quantify the active HA. We test the LTD-IDMS assay on H7N9 vaccines stressed by low pH, raised temperature, or freeze/ thaw cycles. This method, unlike SRID, has no requirement for strain-specific reference antigens or antibodies and can generate potency values that correlate with SRID. Thus, LTD-IDMS is a promising alternative in vitro potency assay for influenza vaccines to complement and potentially replace SRID in a pandemic when strain specific reagents may not be readily available.

AB Background: A hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) is a well-described adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) in young children. There is limited data regarding recurrence post re-vaccination.
   Method: A retrospective analysis of HHEs reported to two tertiary paediatric hospitals in Australia: The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne [2006-11] and the Children's Hospital Westmead, Sydney [1997-2014].
   HHE definition level of confidence was allocated according to Brighton Collaboration (BC) criteria and defined immediate if within 30 min post vaccination. The Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) was utilised to document current immunisation status.
   Results: 235 HHE cases (135 Melbourne, 100 Sydney) were identified: 47% were female and 67% (157/235) occurred following the routine dose one vaccines at 6-8 weeks of age. Median time following immunisation was 120 min (range 1 min to 14 days) An immediate HHE occurred in 43% (102/235) and by BC criteria, 74% (173/235) were level 1 (definite). Subsequent vaccines were administered under supervision in hospital in 37% overall (86/235); 43% (58/135) in Melbourne and 28% (28/100) in Sydney. HHE recurrence rate was 3% (7/235) [95% confidence interval 1-6%1. AIR records were available in 94% (221/235). At a median age of 3.1 years, 84% (186/221) were up-to-date with recommended vaccines.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of specialist immunization clinics in supporting the National Immunisation Program, through follow-up and management of serious adverse events following immunization. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE; RISK; GIRLS
AB HPV vaccination has been offered to 12-year-old girls as part of the Danish Childhood Vaccination Programme since 2009. From 2013, an increasing number of suspected severe adverse events (AE) without a documented causal link to the vaccine was observed, resulting in public concerns about vaccine safety and a decline in uptake. This study aimed at describing the group of females reporting AE and comparing them to vaccinated peers not reporting AE. A questionnaire focusing on demographics, lifestyle, and health-related issues was distributed to 251 female cases who had reported severe AE and 1,003 female controls randomly selected from the population-based Danish Vaccination Registry. All had been HPV-vaccinated. There were no significant differences on measures of self-reported psychiatric or somatic conditions before vaccination. More cases reported being physically very active prior to first HPV vaccination (OR 4.2) whereas fewer cases than controls sometimes (OR 0.31) or often/always (OR 0.36) felt sad. This is unexpected because two recent Danish registry-based case-control studies concluded that females reporting severe AE were more likely to consult a psychologist/psychiatrist and to have pre-existing psychiatric conditions before first HPV vaccination. One of these studies also showed that cases had increased health-care seeking regarding a number of somatic conditions prior to first vaccination. Our study adds value when seeking to understand the lifeworld of the affected females and their interpretations of their everyday lives pre- and post-HPV vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The use of vaccines with higher doses of antigen is an attractive strategy to improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in transplant recipients. However, the effect of vaccination with a double-dose (DD) containing 30 mu g of antigen in this population remains unknown.
   Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the immunogenicity and safety of DD (30 mu g) vs. standard dose (SD, 15 mu g) of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in kidney and liver transplant recipients. Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Vaccine response was defined as seroconversion to at least one viral strain 2 weeks after vaccination and seroprotection as a titer >= 40.
   Results: Sixty-three kidney and 16 liver transplant recipients were enrolled. Forty patients received the DD and 39 the SD vaccine. Overall, 40% of patients in the DD compared to 26% in the SD group (P = 0.174) responded to vaccine. In the DD arm, more patients were seroprotected to all viral strains after vaccination (88% vs 69%, P= 0.048). Post vaccination geometric mean titers of antibodies were 131.9 vs. 89.7 (P = 0.187) for H1N1, 185.4 vs. 138.7 (P = 0.182) for H3N2, and 96.6 vs. 68.8 (P = 0.081) for influenza B with the DD vs. SD. In both groups, most of the adverse events were mild and no vaccine-related severe adverse events were observed.
   Conclusion: Double-dose influenza vaccine is safe and may increase antibody response in transplant recipients. In this population, DD vaccination could be an alternative when high-dose vaccine is not available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory disease throughout life. Here we report differences in naturally acquired immunity with age and presumed exposure.
   Methods: A longitudinal, non-interventional, observational study was performed in healthy adults (20 paediatric healthcare workers and 10 non-healthcare workers), children (10 aged 3-6 years) and infants (5 aged 2-4 months and 20 aged 6-12 months). Blood samples were analysed for RSV-neutralising antibody titre, F/Ga/Gb-specific antibody titres, F-specific IgG/IgA memory B-cell frequencies and T-cell production of IFN gamma, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17.
   Results: Serum G-specific antibody titres were significantly lower in infants and children than adults. However, serum titres of F-specific and RSV-neutralising antibody and IFN gamma-producing T-cell frequencies were low or absent in the infants, but comparable between children and adults. Interestingly, F-specific memory IgA B-cells could not be detected in paediatric samples and in samples from non-healthcare workers, but recordable IgA memory B-cells were found in 9/18 paediatric healthcare workers and 2/8 non-healthcare workers at the end of the RSV season. These responses waned 4-6 months later. By contrast, F-specific IgG memory B-cells were detectable in samples from all adults without significant variation across time points. T-cells producing IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17 responses were not detectable in peripheral blood from a subset of volunteers.
   Conclusions: Repeated RSV exposure in early life generates immune responses that are inversely related to frequency of severe disease. Induction of F-specific antibody and cellular immune responses through infant vaccination might help to accelerate the development of protective immune responses at an early age.

AB Liposomal vaccines incorporating adjuvant and CD4 T cell helper peptides enhance antibody responses against weakly immunogenic B cell epitopes such as found in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 subunit. While the inclusion of exogenous helper peptides in vaccine formulations facilitates stronger and more durable antibody responses, the helper peptide incorporation strategy per se may influence the overall magnitude and quality of B cell target antigen immunogenicity. Both variability in individual peptide encapsulation as well as the potential for liposome surface-associated helper peptides to misdirect the humoral response are potential parameters impacting outcome. In this study, we used MPER/liposome vaccines as a model system to examine how the mode of the potent LACK T helper peptide formulation modulates antibody responses against the MPER antigen. We directly compared liposome surface-arrayed palmitoyl LACK (pLACK) versus soluble LACK (sLACK) encapsulated in the liposomes and free in solution. Independent of LACK formulation methods, dendritic cell activation and LACK presentation were equivalent in vivo. The frequency of MPER-specific GC B cells promoted by sLACK was higher than that stimulated by pLACK formulation, a finding associated with a significantly greater frequency of LACK-specific GC B cells induced by pLACK. While there were no significant differences in the quantity of MPER-specific serological responses, the MPER-specific antibody titer trended higher with sLACK formulated vaccines at the lower dose of LACK. However, pLACK generated relatively greater MPER-specific antibody affinities than those induced by sLACK-formulated vaccines. Overall, the results suggest that liposomal surface-associated LACK enhances immunogenicity of LACK through better engagement of LACK-specific B cells. Of note, this is not detrimental to the induction of MPER-specific immune responses; rather, the elicitation of higher affinity anti-MPER antibodies benefits from augmented help delivered via covalent linkage of the pLACK CD4 T cell epitope in conjunction with MPER/liposome presentation.

AB The human adenovirus type 19a/64 (hAd19a) is a rare serotype in the human population that transduces human dendritic cells (DCs) and human muscle cells more efficiently than the well-characterized human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5).
   To further characterize the potential of this vector as a vaccine we designed replication deficient hAd19a, hAd5 and MVA vectors expressing a papillomavirus (PV) antigen fused to the human MHC class II associated invariant chain T cell adjuvant (hIi) and investigated their immunogenicity in vivo in mice and cynomolgus macaques.
   We initially showed that the hIi encoded in the hAd5 enhanced PV specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice. The T cell responses induced after hAdl9a vaccination was similar to those induced by hAd5 vaccination. The hAd19a induced responses were not reduced in presence of preexisting Ad5 immunity in mice. In macaques both vaccines were equally potent at inducing CD8+ T cells after MVA boost, while the level of CD4+ T cell responses were found to be broader in hAd19a primed animals.
   These data demonstrate the potential of hAd19a as an alternative vector to hAd5 to elicit potent T cell responses to PV. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mucosal vaccines against Helicobacter pylori consisting of either whole cell bacteria or recombinant antigens can induce immune protection against challenge in mice only when co-administrated with a strong mucosal adjuvant such as cholera toxin (CT) or Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT). The strong enterotoxicity of these adjuvants however preclude their use in human vaccines. The recently developed multiple mutant CT (mmCT) is a strong, yet practically non-toxic novel mucosal adjuvant which here was admixed with a formalin-inactivated H. pylori whole cell vaccine (WCV) as a potential vaccine candidate against H. pylori infection. We report that intragastric immunizations with H. pylori WCV together with mmCT, similar to immunization with WCV together with CT, resulted in 50-125-fold reduction in colonization of H. pylori in the stomach of mice associated with rises in both serum IgG and intestinal-mucosal IgA anti-H. pylori antibody responses and strong T cell and IFN gamma and IL-17A cytokine responses. Data presented in this study also supports that the proposed vaccine can be grown in a bioreactor and would be effective against infection caused by a multitude of pathogenic H. pylori strains isolated from patients from various continents. The results warrant immunization studies in humans to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the proposed H. pylori WCV and mmCT. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB China has a national requirement that children's vaccination status is to be checked upon entry to kindergarten and school; children who have missed vaccine doses are to be referred to vaccination clinics to receive the necessary vaccinations. Most provinces have Immunization Information Systems (IIS) that contain and manage vaccination records of children served by immunization clinics. We conducted an evaluation in Hubei and Ningxia provinces using IIS data to determine the effect of their school entry immunization record checking strategy (SECS) on vaccination coverage and rate of catch-up for selected vaccines.
   We selected two counties with well-functioning IISs from each province. Names and demographic information of children enrolled in 185 kindergartens and 125 primary school in 2016 were used to identify children in the 115 and obtain their vaccination records. We calculated vaccination coverage before and after implementation of the SECS and determined catch-up rates for 5 vaccines, of which 3 are given before 2 years of age and 2 are given after 2 years of age.
   Among the 20,215 newly-enrolled children, 75% were able to be matched with IIS records. Few children who had missed one or more doses of the 3 vaccines recommended in the first two years of life received catch-up doses after SECS. For vaccines scheduled after 2 years of age, there was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) coverage increase in both provinces following the school-entry record check. Among children who were age-eligible for the selected vaccines before SCES, the catch-up rate was <50%.
   SECS provides opportunities to identify incompletely vaccinated children, improve coverage, and remind families of school-age children about up-coming vaccinations; SECS has potential to improve completeness of IIS data and enrollment of children in immunization clinics. Evidence-based policy with implementation guidance and routine monitoring are necessary to improve China's school entry checking strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The optimal strategy for the vaccinating against herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine remains unknown. Cost-effectiveness analyses provide insight to the most cost-effective age groups but results vary across studies. The optimal strategy is important given that vaccine efficacy and duration vary depending on vaccination age. Therefore, small changes from the optimal age can affect long-term outcomes and produce sub-optimal results. The objective of this research was to determine the optimal timing policy for HZ vaccination. We simulated cohorts of men and women and use stochastic dynamic programming to evaluate the decision to vaccinate or defer each year from age 50 to 100. If the decision was to defer, the cohort risked developing HZ. If HZ occurred, the cohort was subjected to cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss for a typical HZ infection (including complications) at that age. If HZ did not occur, the decision was evaluated at the next age. Then, we extend the model to consider the case in which a booster vaccine is available. A set of probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to check model robustness. Results show the optimal policy for women is to vaccinate between ages 66 and 77, and for men between ages 66 and 74, assuming a willingness to pay (WTP) of $100,000 per QALY. It becomes optimal to vaccinate earlier if a booster vaccine is available, and women have a wider range of ages than men. This research is the first to examine exactly when the HZ vaccine should be administered. It is also the first study, to our knowledge, that used stochastic dynamic programming to examine the question of a second dose for any vaccine. This research provides the first simple policy on when to vaccinate and re-vaccinate against HZ. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, confirmed the precipitation and distribution of nanocrystals, with sizes around 10-13 nm, in an amorphous silica network. Under excitation at 980 nm, along with blue, red and NIR characteristic up-conversion emissions of Tm3+ ions, intense UV upconversion emissions coming from I-1(6) and D-1(2) levels of Tm3+ ions were also observed in all the studied samples. Additionally, when substituting Y3+ by Gd3+ ions, UV up-conversion emissions coming from Gd3+ ions, along with a reduction of the UV up-conversion emissions of Tm3+ ions, were observed, involving an energy transfer process from Yb3+/Tm3+ systems to Gd3+ ions. UC mechanisms and energy transfer processes were confirmed by transient emission and pump power measurements. Moreover, power dependence analysis revealed saturation effects in all up-conversion emissions, even at low pump power. Results suggest that these highly efficient up-conversion nano-glass-ceramics present potential applications as UV-blue solid state laser materials and solid state lighting.

AB The new bipyridine-based ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(bpy)(2)(Hapbim)](2+) (bpy being 2,2'-bipyridine, and Hapbim is 2-aminophenylbenzimidazole) was synthesized and characterized. On the basis of elemental analysis, spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, H-1 NMR, UV-Visible), magnetic, conductivity and thermal analysis measurements, it was found that the Hapbim ligand coordinates to Ru(II) kernel in a neutral bidentate fashion through cyclic azomethine N of benzimidazole moiety along with the terminal nitrogen of the amino group forming six-membered chelate ring. Thin films of the Ru(II)-complex were prepared using thermal evaporation technique. The thin film structure was characterized using FTIR and X-Ray diffraction techniques. FTIR analysis revealed that the complex is chemically stable under both thermal evaporation and thermal annealing. The optical properties were studied by spectrophotometric measurements. The optical constants of the complex were calculated and it is found to have 1.5 eV band gap. Also, the effect of thermal annealing on the optical properties of the complex is studied. Annealing of the complex thin films increased the values of the dispersion parameters and decreased the value of the band gap.

AB Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were dispersed in the nematic matrix of a room temperature pristine liquid crystalline material. Thermodynamic, electro-optical and dielectric parameters of nematic host dispersed with SWCNTs were investigated. The alignment and reorientation of SWCNTs with external electric field in nematic matrix were also studied. The inclusion of SWCNTs changes the physical parameters such as transition temperature, switching threshold voltage, orientational order, dielectric anisotropy, splay elastic constants and activation energy of host nematic liquid crystal. The switching threshold voltage reduces and the steepness of the transmission voltage curve improves for the composite systems. This shows that dispersion of SWCNTs enhances the orientational order of nematic liquid crystals media. Consequently overall improvements were observed for the display parameters of dispersed systems.

AB In this paper we have studied comprehensively annealed and non annealed single quantum well (QW) light emitting diode (LED) structures with different doping concentrations in the barriers. Computations have been carried out through the self-consistent solutions of Schrodinger and Poison equations. Wide changes in the transition energies (TE) and the transition probabilities (TP) are observed due to the doping variation. On annealing, with the increase of diffusion length, the results show that depending on the doping concentration, the TE increases monotonically as well as it goes through red-blue shifts. It is also observed that, for lower doping, TP increases and/or decreases with the diffusion length. The variation of TP also depends on the operating current. After a critical doping in the barriers, on annealing, the optical performances of QW LEDs deteriorate. Through change in doping and annealing, the optical performance of the InGaN/GaN QW LEDs may be improved. This information should be of importance to the optoelectronic designer.

AB In the present study, third-order nonlinear optical properties of three chalcone derivatives, (2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (MNC), (2E)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-(3-nitrophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (ML3NC) and (2E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-l-one (DMMC) doped Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films are reported. The thin films were prepared using spin-coating technique at three different doping concentrations. Surface roughness and linear optical properties of the films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum, respectively. The intermolecular interactions of the chalcones were studied using Hirshfeld surface analyses (HSA). The third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the films were investigated by using Z-scan technique with DPSS continuous wave (CW) laser excitation at 532 nm. All the films exhibited strong nonlinear absorption (NLA) behavior, and the obtained nonlinear absorption coefficients (beta) increases with doping concentration of chalcones. Further, we observed the optical limiting property for all the films, which is mainly originated from two-photon absorption (TPA) mechanism. The calculated third-order nonlinear absorption coefficients (beta), imaginary part of third-order nonlinear susceptibilities (Im chi((3))) and the optical limiting (OL) thresholds of the films are in the order of 10(-5) cm/W, 10(-8) esu and 10(3)J/cm(2), respectively. The results revealed that the chalcones doped PMMA thin films are promising materials for optical limiting applications in visible region.

AB Eu(BA) (TTA)(2)/PVP and Eu(BA) (TTA)(2)Phen/PVP are electrospun into nano-spider-web-like fibers with diameters about 100-300 nm. Differential luminescence behaviors are revealed under ultraviolet (UV) radiation and effectiveness of Phen ligand is verified in enhancing red emission behavior. Total emission photon number and luminous efficacy are derived to be 7.96 x 10(13) cps and 9.91%lm/W in Eu(BA) (TTA)(2)Phen/PVP fiber, respectively, which are 1.4 times higher than those of Eu(BA) (TTA)(2)/PVP fiber under the excitation of 367 nm UVA light emitting diode (UVA-LED) pump source. Similar results on absolute spectral parameters of the triligand fibers under the excitation of 308 nm UVB light emitting diode (UVB-LED) further support the availability of europium-complexes/PVP spider-web-like fibers for red-light therapy. Improved emission behavior and higher photon emission indicate that europium-complexes/PVP spider-web-like fibers can play a positive role in absorbable and curative medical sutures.

AB Absorption and luminescence spectra in the first biological window of Nd3+ single-doped and Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped Y3Ga5O12 nano-garnets have been studied to evaluate their potential use as simultaneous optical nano-heaters and nanothermometers in biomedicine. Nd3+ -doped nano-gamets uses the 808 nm laser radiation, resonant with the largest absorption peak of the I-4(9/2)-> F-4(5/2) transition, for both heating the nanoparticle and populating the F-4(3/2) emitting level. Changes in the relative intensities of different emission peaks between Stark levels of the F-4(3)/2(R-1(,2)) -> I-4(9/2)(Z(1)(.5)) transition can be directly related to the temperature of the nano-garnet. On the other hand, the Yb3+/Er3+ combination takes advantage of the large absorption cross-section of the Yb3+ ions at around 920 nm to heat the sample, while triggering the Yb3+ -to-Er3+ upconversion energy transfer processes that populate the thermally coupled H-2(11/2),S-4(3)/2 emitting levels of Er3+ ions, whose relative intensity changes with temperature can be calibrated. Accurate spatially- and temperature-controlled optically stimulated heating of these nano-garnets from room temperature up to 75 degrees C within the first biological windows is proved.

AB Zinc citrate is an organic salt complex prepared with organic carboxylate and inorganic cation. In the study, a series of C12H14O16Zn3: Eu3+ phosphors were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and then the as-prepared phosphors were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectrometer. The morphology of C12H14O16Zn3: Eu3+ phosphors was a flake with the size of 1 -10 mu m x 0.5 similar to 5 mu m and the length-width ratio of 0.2-20. The strongest emission peak of C12H14O16Zn3: Eu3+ at 621 tun was ascribed to D-5(o) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ and the peaks centered at 590, 653 and 702nm respectively corresponded to D-5(o) -> F-7(1), F-7(3), and F-7(4) transitions. C12H14O16Zn3: Eu3+ gave the red light emission, as indicated by color coordinate analysis. The photoluminescence intensity of the phosphors prepared under the Eu(3+ )concentration of 7% was the highest. As a new kind of phosphors C12H14O16Zn3: xEu particles may be applied in biological fluorescent tags and luminescent materials.

AB Er3+ and Pr3+ co-doped YAP laser crystal with high optical quality was grown successfully by the Czochralski method for the first time. By contrast, an Er3+ single doped YAP laser crystal was also grown. The cell parameters of the two crystals were obtained by the X-ray Rietveld refinement method. The X-ray rocking curves indicate that the as-grown crystals possess excellent crystalline quality. The absorption spectra show that the crystals are suitable to be pumped by 972 nm LD. The NIR and MIR emission spectra, the up-conversion spectra and the fluorescence decay curves were also measured to investigate the influence of Pr3+ ions on the spectroscopic properties. The results indicate the Pr3+ ions acting as the deactivator can decrease efficiently the lifetime of the lower laser level I-4(13/2) of the Er3+ ions from 10.72 to 0.489 ms, which would be beneficial to decrease the laser threshold and increase the laser conversion efficiency.

AB We report on the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of Ce3+ doped LiLa9(SiO4)(6)O-2 (LLSO) crystals, grown using the slow cooling flux method. The luminescence and optical spectroscopic properties and luminescence decay kinetics were studied upon excitation with UV, VUV, X-ray photons and cathode rays. Two impurity Ce3+ centres substituting for La3+ - ions in two nonequivalent crystal positions are observed in LLSO:Ce3+. They are well distinguished spectroscopically in the UV range both in emission and excitation spectra. Apart from emission associated with Ce3+ 5d -> 4f interconfigurational transitions, a low-temperature defect-related emission has been observed upon UV-VUV and higher energy X-ray excitation. Processes lying behind the temperature quenching and host-to-impurity energy transfer are analyzed and discussed.

AB In the present study, we have used two ionic liquids (ILs) with different alkyl chain lengths belonging to the imidazolium family to prepare electronic ink (E-Ink). To apply bromide as an anion, compounds such as 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide were utilized as charge control agents. We prepared the E-Ink containing copper phthalocyanine blue15:3 (PB15:3) nanoparticles, which had been modified with ILs in tetrachloroethylene (PCE). As-prepared samples were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared technique, thermogravimetric analysis, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering and t .-potential approaches. Based on the obtained results, ILs had been successfully covered onto the surface of PB15:3 nanoparticles. Thereafter, to prepare E-Ink microcapsules, the electrospraying method with a coaxial nozzle was used. According to optical microscopy data, the size of microcapsules was smaller than 200 mu m. Application of ionic liquids improved zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility properties. In the future, these materials and their modified structures can be considered as appropriate candidates for application as molecular charge control agents. Moreover, we demonstrated that electrospraying is a suitable approach for producing E-ink microcapsules.

AB We present an optical pressure sensor KMgF3:Eu2+ suitable for experiments in diamond anvil cell (DAC), which we have calibrated against the ruby reference sensor at pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 30 GPa (300 kbar), at room temperature. The emission spectra of KMgF3:Eu2+ consist of one prominent emission line related to the P-6(7)/2 -> S- 8(7/2) electronic transition (zero phonon line) accompanied by weak phonon sidebands. The energy of emission at atmospheric pressure was determined to be 27846 +/- 7 cm(-1). The edge of the excitation spectrum lies at wavelength around 325 nm (30800 cm(-1)) making it suitable to excite with He-Cd laser (325 nm). The sensor exhibits linear pressure shift of rate equal to -0.815 +/- 0.007 cm(-1)/kbar at pressures up to 300 kbar. The pressure shift of the emission is totally reversible and the pressure sensor is suitable for multi cycle pressure experiments. The sensor's exceptional feature is that excitation and emission spectra lie in near UV, which makes it very convenient to use in high pressure optical measurements in visible and IR region with no interference from the sensor's luminescence.

AB Bismuth-doped silica-based glasses have already been proved to be promising materials for the fiber lasers and amplifiers operating in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region. However, the development of such devices, which would have eligible efficiency, is impossible without a solid understanding of the NIR emitting center's nature. In the present work, based on the crystal field calculations we demonstrate that in silica and germanosilicate glasses this center is a univalent Bi ion affected by a rather strong local crystal field. According to our results, a transition from the first excited state to the ground state in Bi+ causes the famous NIR photo-luminescence. The relatively high degree of reduction of the spin-orbit coupling constant indicates, most probably, the formation of weak covalent bonding of Bi+ with ions of the environment.

AB BCG/CaCl2/PEG-g-CDA composites with different mass ratios of BCG and CaCl2 under constant PEG-g-CDA were synthesized via liquid-phase reaction method. The composites were analyzed and characterized using FT-IR, XRD, DSC and UV-vis. The results show that the color changes visibly from green to yellow by improving temperature from 50 degrees C to 62 degrees C, and turns back to green reversibly with temperature cooling back to room temperature. The infrared emissivity values increase rapidly at the temperature range of 50 degrees C-62 degrees C, and the maximum variation reaches 0.23. Furthermore, the mechanisms for thermochromic phenomenon and tunable infrared emissivity were also proposed. The reversible thermochromic phenomenon is attributed to the molecular structure transformation of BCG between ring-opened quinone structure and ring-closed lactone structure. The tunable emissivity at different temperatures is ascribed to the changes of resistivity under temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that BCG/CaCl2/PEG-g-CDA composites are a potential candidate for smart adaptive camouflage in visible and infrared waveband.

AB The synthesis of luminescence nanostructures is always related with complicated procedures, and it is still challenging to control their luminescence properties by a facile method. In this work, CaWO4:Eu3+ nanostructures with different morphology, structures and sizes were prepared at low temperatures (2 degrees C), and the luminescence properties of the prepared nanostructures were studied. The nanostructure growth can be controlled by pH values of the precursor, reaction temperatures and Eu3+ doping concentrations. Low temperature (2 degrees C) synthesis is believed to control the nanocrystal growth easily due to slow growth process caused by the low temperature. The pH values of the precursor have a significant impact on the structure of CaWO4, leading to the formation of self-assembled microstructures and isolated nanoparticles. CaWO4:Eu3+ nanowires were produced as the Eu3+ doping concentration is 10%. The luminescence properties show that the reaction temperatures and pH values play an important role in the luminescence of CaWO4 host and the energy transfer from the host to Eu3+ leading to the tunable luminescence color from CaWO4:Eu3+. The method developed in this paper is believed to be beneficial for large-scale synthesis of luminescence nanostructures toward white light emitting diode phosphors.

DE Nitride phosphor; Red phosphor; LED lighting phosphor

AB A new narrowband red phosphor, Ba0.8Sr0.2Mg3SiN4:Eu, suitable for use in LED lighting, has been identified as the optimal composition from the series of Ba(1-x)SrxMg3SiN4:Eu including x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1. Experimental X-ray diffraction measurements and structures calculated via density functional theory reveal that Ba(1-x)SrxMg3SiN4:Eu stabilizes in a tetragonal crystal structure, changing to the triclinic structure for Ba > 0.8. Narrow band Eu2+ emission is observed in the tetragonal phase, but as a function of Ba substitution onto the Sr site, several properties change in concert: the emission maximum shifts to longer wavelengths, room temperature quantum efficiency improves, Eu2+ decay time increases and thermal stability of emission improves. Concomitant with the structure change to triclinic, the narrow Eu2+ emission band becomes broadened, the bandgap increases, and decay time slows to a typical Eu2+ decay of similar to 1 mu s. Although significantly moisture-sensitive, the strong absorption of Ba0.8Sr0.2Mg3SiN4:Eu at 450 nm, its emission peak at 635 nm and width of 51 nm FWHM provide efficient color rendering in the red, potentially achieving CRI and R9 values in excess of 95, along with good efficacy, in combination with other phosphors. Excitation intensity droop is comparable to other similar Eu-doped nitrides, but while thermally induced quenching is reduced with Ba substitution, it is still significant. The measured photoluminescence decay for Ba0.8Sr0.2Mg3SiN4:Eu of similar to 200 ns is faster than of related Eu-doped nitrides, and together with a Q.E. of only - 40% suggests the presence of competing non-radiative decay routes, thought to be due to thermal ionization of the Eu2+ excited state to the conduction band. Improved Q.E. for SrMg3SiN4:Eu partially substituted with Ba is likely due to the cation disorder this introduces, suppressing non-radiative processes correlated with lattice vibrations and increasing the population of shallow traps that release electrons on the emission lifetime timescale, consistent with the emission decay time lengthening and Q.E. improvement as a function of Ba content.

AB Solar cells entailing multi-coloring capability can pave the way for solar-powered colorful displays. Therefore, the energy that is usually wasted in color displays could be harvested to produce useful electrical power. On the other hand, introduction of color filters with capability of active control on the output color results in more compact and efficient optical devices. In this work, we have proposed a chromatic electrode in which the transmitted light has been employed as a source for the solar energy device while the reflected light generates polarization-tuned colors, simultaneously. Aiming to design such a chromatic electrode, a hybrid nanostructure of graphene and aluminum nanocross arrays has been employed for the first time. In addition to replacing ITO in organic solar cells by a novel electrode and achieving performance enhancement of organic solar cells, mapping the polarization of the incident light to visible color results in solar-powered chromatic polarizers with potential applications including active color displays, security tags, and polarization imaging. Using finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations, it has been shown that the proposed nanostructured electrode leads to enhanced photocurrent densities in the range of 11.82-17.05 (mA/cm(2)) due to the light trapping plasmonic properties of the nanocross arrays. Additionally, replacing ITO, suffering from poor mechanical properties and cost-ineffectiveness, offers a promising approach for large-area growth of organic photovoltaics.

AB Er, Pr co-doped GSAG laser crystal with high optical quality was successfully grown by the Czochralski method for the first time. X-ray rocking curve exhibit the high crystalline quality of this crystal. The intensities of optical transmission and luminescence of Er,Pr:GSAG crystal were not deteriorate after the gamma-ray irradiation even with a dose of 1.16 x 10(6) Gy, confirming the excellence radiation resistant property of Er, Pr:GSAG crystals. The efficiencies of energy transfer from I-4(1)1/2 to (1)G(4) and I-4(13/2) to F-3(4) between Er3+ and Pr3+ ions in GSAG crystal are determined as 16.7% and 94.9%, which indicate that the Pr3+ can act as an deactivator ions for Er3+ ions in Er,Pr:GSAG crystal. Additionally, the luminescence spectra of Er,Pr:GSAG crystal are compared with that of Er:GSAG crystal in the visible and near-IR regions, which provided that Pr3+ ions can efficiently depopulate the (4)I(13/2 )level and reduce the fluorescence lifetime. All the results demonstrate that Er,Pr:GSAG crystal can realize multi-wavelength laser output at 2.6-2.9 mu m under harsh radiation environment.

AB The fluorescence properties of Bi3+/Yb3+ co-doped SiO2-Al2O3-P2O5-YF3 glasses and glass-ceramics are investigated. The 6s(2)-type Bi3+ is used as a novel sensitizer for near infrared (NIR) down-conversion (DC) of Yb3+ ions due to its allowed excitations favorable to the high absorption of excited energy. Involvement of the energy transfer (ET) process from Bi3+ to Yb3+ under the ultraviolet (UV) excitation is demonstrated for all Bi3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass sample's. Based on crystallization kinetics analysis, thermal treatment is performed on glass samples under different heating conditions to induce homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth. Emission and excitation spectra as well as Bi3+ emission decay curves confirm that the ET from Bi3+ to Yb3+ is tremendously intensified due to proper crystallization treatment. The possible ET mechanism is discussed with the help of the simplified energy level diagrams of Bi3+ and Yb3+. The present Bi3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass ceramics are likely applied to solar cells via spectrum conversion.

AB Novel metasurface absorber based on crossed shaped resonator placed at the top surface is proposed to exhibit enhanced absorption resonances in the entire solar spectrum. Different cases of the absorber are discussed with special emphasis on large spectral width and peak amplitude. It is found that the absorption resonances and their corresponding spectral widths can be significantly modified and widened by adding extra nanorods to the crossed shaped structure at different locations. Furthermore, the weighted absorption under the AM1.5 solar spectrum (A(AM1.5)) of the solar cell is also evaluated by varying the structural parameters, which reaches to - 86.35%. Such high value of A(AM1.5 )indicates that the proposed design is highly suitable for solar cell application because it greatly enhance the conversion efficiency.

AB In this work, the pure CdSe and Mn-doped CdSe quantum dots were synthesized by Successive ionic layer absorption and reaction method for the high performance of quantum dots sensitized solar cells. Relevant molar concentrations of Mn(CH3COO)(2)center dot 2H(2)O were changed at 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, and 0.5 mM as mixing with Cd(CH3COO)(2)center dot 2H(2)O anion source corresponding to x represent for the Mn2+-doped molar concentration. As a result, the quantum dots Solar cells were successfully prepared with the enhanced short current density from 7.63 mA/cm(2) to 18.99 mA/cm(2) for Mn2+ ions doped on CdSe nanoparticle corresponding to the enhanced efficiency of quantum dots solar cells from 1.64% for pure CdSe nanocrystal to 3.77% for Mn2+ ions doped on pure CdSe nanoparticle. Actually, Mn2+ dopant rises in the conduction band of pure CdSe nanocrystal, reduces recombination, enhances the efficiency of high harvesting, improve the charge transfer and collection. In addition, Mn2+ dopant can rise in the conduction band levels of pure CdSe nanocrystal, which leads to reduce the charge recombination, enhances the light-harvesting efficiency and improve the charge diffusion and collection. Correspondingly, the photoluminescence decay and Electrochemical Impedance Spectra were carried to determine the lifetime of excited electrons and dynamic resistances in QDSSCs.

AB Efficient and stable upconversion white-light is critical for optical applications. Herein, LiNbO3:Ho/Yb/Tm single crystals with different [Li]/[Nb] ratios were grown by Czochralski method. It is found that the crystal structures are not changed with [Li]/[Nb] ratios which varied from 0.946 to 0.991 in the single crystals. The RE ion concentrations are reduced faintly and crystal structures approach perfect with increasing the [Li]/[Nb] ratios. More ideal upconversion white-light is obtained when the [Li]/[Nb] ratio is close to 1. The integrated effects of intrinsic defect concentrations and RE ion concentrations affect the upconversion emission intensity of the single crystal. The lower crystal defect in the bulk single crystal has a positive impact on the enhancement of upconversion emission intensity. In addition, all the CIE coordinates are hardly changed with [Li]/[Nb] ratios and located in the white-light region. The upconversion mechanism analysis indicates the longer lifetimes of intermediate energy levels and the shorter lifetimes of luminous energy levels are beneficial to the upconversion process, and the larger intensity variation of upconversion emission arises from its greater lifetime variations of energy levels. The near-stoichiometric LiNbO3:Ho/Yb/Tm single crystal demonstrates potential applications in stable white-light devices and photoelectric instruments.

AB An efficient BiFeO3/BiOI composite photocatalytic material was fabricated via simple wet impregnation process and photocatalytic performances were evaluated by the catalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA) in visible-light illumination. Structural, light absorption and morphological features of the fabricated photocatalysts were investigated by various spectroscopic and microscopic procedures. The photodegradation efficiency results demonstrated that the BiFeO3/BiOI composite with 2 wt% loading of BiFeO3 (2% BiFeO3/BiOI) displayed the higher photocatalytic activity than various other BiFeO3 loadings, pristine BiOI and BiFeO3. A maximal photodegradation efficiency of RhB and BPA are similar to 100% and 71% were accomplished using the optimized composite when compared to merely similar to 56% and similar to 36% using pristine BiOI, respectively. The significant enhancement in the photodegradation rates of RhB (similar to 5 times) and BPA (similar to 2 times) pollutants using 2% BiFeO3/BiOI composite is credited to the efficient charge separation of photoinduced hole-electron pairs by transferring the electrons from BiOI to BiFeO3 catalyst surface. The photostability results revealed that the compost was retained their photocatalytic activity up to 3 cycles of degradation experiments. The higher photocatalytic activity, long time stability and reusability tests exposed that the BiFeO3/BiOI composite might be a potential photocatalytic material for topical applications in the field of water treatment.

AB In this paper, colloidal suspension of graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONPs) were synthesized using the novel microwave assisted hydrothermal method. Different concentrations in distiller water is reported. Nonlinear optical properties of the samples were measured by the z-scan technique. For the experimental, a diode laser was used as an excitation source, the excitation beam was focused to a small spot by using a lens. Then, the sample was moved across the focal region along the z-axis. It was shown that the concentration of GONPs can greatly improve the nonlinear optical properties of the sample. The morphology and structure of GONPs, were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. From the experimental results, the optical nonlinear refractive indices of GONPs were obtained, ranging from -2.53 x 10(-9) cm(2)/W to -2.57 x 10(-9) cm(2)/W. This suggests that GONPs aqueous solution, could be a very promising nonlinear medium, establishing the bases of nonlinear photonics.

AB We synthesized the novel inorganic-organic nanohybrid systems in hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystal growth processes under the presence of tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)europium (HI) (EuTH) complex for the first time. The nanohybrid states were successfully controlled by the EuTH concentration to Ca ions in HA. The morphology of the HA was observed by a transmission electron microscope and the nanocrystalline aspect ratios were estimated to be 2.5-4.8. The segregated EuTH molecules on the HA nanocrystals covered over the aplane in HA, leading to the effective crystal growth along with the uncovered c-plane. The luminescence properties of the nanohybrids were different from that of the EuTH itself in the solution and solid states, indicating the unique Eu3+ ion states on the HA nanocrystals because of the different ligand field symmetry. Moreover, the relative luminescence intensity ratio based on the D-5(0) -> F-7(1) and D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transitions in the nanohybrid became lower with increasing the EuTH concentration, suggesting that the hybridization lowered the coordination environment symmetry of Eu3+ ion. The luminescence intensity and quantum efficiency of the nanohybrids were higher than that of the EuTH itself. Therefore, the interaction at EuTH-HA interface as well as between EuTH-EuTH molecules significantly changed by the inorganic-organic hybridization under different EuTH concentrations. In future, the present hybridization technique can be applied for preparing the nanohybrids with various metallic complexes.

AB In this paper, Nd3+/Yb(3+ )codoped SrWO4 phosphors for temperature sensing are investigated. Firstly, the doping ratio of Nd(3+ )and Yb3+ was optimized. Then, under a 980 nm excitation, the temperature response of the near infrared (NIR) upconversion emission spectra in the temperature range of 313 K-453 K was characterized. The results show that the NIR emission peaks increase notably with the increase of temperature. With the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique, thermal sensing property of the optimized phosphor was investigated. A maximum thermal sensitivity of 0.02857 K-1 (I-801/I-869) at 453 K was achieved, which is higher than that of the other previously reported similar materials. The minimum temperature uncertainty is about 1 K at 453 K. The results reveal that SrWO4: Nd3+/Yb3+ is a promising material for optical thermometry.

AB Present study reports the effects of varying concentrations of Pr3+ ions on the optical properties of 10ZnO-5Na(2)CO(3)-10Ni(2)O(3)-75-xB(2)O(3)-xP(6)O(11) (x = 0.1-1 mol%) glasses prepared through melt- quench technique with an aim to achieve suitable optical gain medium for optoelectronic applications. Minimal changes in the measured density, X-Ray diffractogram and Fourier Transform Infrared spectra of the prepared samples confirmed the stability of the glass structure even after 1 mol% doping of the Pr3+. Bonding nature of Pr3+ ion with surrounding ligands and Judd-Oflet (J-O) intensity parameters of the glasses were determined using optical absorption spectra. The photoemission spectra exhibited reddish orange emission around 605 nm at 445 nm excitation. The calculated color chromaticity with x = 0.5847, y = 0.3701 coordinates for 0.1 mol% of the Pr3+ in the glasses suggests suitable optical gain medium for reddish orange LED applications. Metastable lifetimes of the Pr3+ ion were found-out by exponential fitting to the decay profiles. Lasing parameters of the glasses such as branching ratio, radiative transition probability and stimulated emission cross-section of D-1(2)-> H-3(4) transition were calculated using JO parameters indicating 0.1 mol% Pr3+-doped glasses suitable for 605 rim solid-state laser applications. The mechanism of energy transfer is determined by applying the Inokuti-Hirayama model and was found to involve a dipole-dipole type of interactions. Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves of the gamma-ray treated 0.1 mol% Pr3+-doped zinc sodium bismuth borate glasses were de-convoluted using Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution method to evaluate the energy storage properties of the glasses. The intensity variation of the 11, component peak (CP2) at 500 K showed linear behavior up to 3 kG y suggesting application in high dose measurements.

By incorporating electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties into a single molecule endows the compound bipolar characteristic and obtains high performance OLED. Oxd-bCz emits purple-blue fluorescence with emission peak at 431 nm in dilute dichloromethane. The blue OLED with Oxd-bCz as emitter exhibited high performances of a low turn-on voltage of 3.6 V and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.6% with excellent color saturation (CIEy similar to 0.07). With a triplet energy of 2.39eV, Oxd-bCz can be utilized as host for Ir (ppy)(3)-guested green OLED with a low turn-on voltage of 2.8 V, current efficiency of 29 cd/A and an EQE value of 8.17%.

AB For the first time, KBaGd(MoO4)(3):Eu3+ phosphors were synthesized by sol-gel method and its structure, morphology and luminescent properties were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), excitation and luminescent spectra. The results show that shape and the particle size distribution of samples synthesized by sol-gel method were more regular and narrower than those synthesized by solid state method. Under the excitation of near UV light (395 nm), an intensive red emission band around 617 nm corresponding to the transition of D-5(0)-> F-7(2) was observed. The effects of the dose of citric acid, pH value of precursor solution and concentration of Eu3+ ions on the morphology and luminescent properties of the samples were also analyzed. The phosphors show the highest emission intensity as the molar ratio of citric acid to metal ions (C:M) was 2:1, and the optimum concentration of Eu3+ was x = 0.8. The thermal stability of the KBaGd0.2(MoO4)(3):0.8Eu(3+) phosphor was investigated in the framework of crossover mechanism, and the activation energy was determined to be 0.264eV. Lastly, a red LED was fabricated using the as-synthesized phosphor and its luminescent performances were investigated.

AB Strontium mixed borate based bioactive glasses of the composition (55-x)B2O3-5SiO(2)-20CaO-20Na(2)O: xSrO (with x = 2,4,6,8 and 10 mol%) were synthesized using conventional melt quenching technique. Structural variations in the glasses due to addition of SrO were assessed from FTIR and optical absorption spectroscopy methods. Degradation and bioactivity studies of the glasses were performed by immersing the glasses in simulated body fluid (SBF). Degradation studies of these glasses measured as function of immersion time were analyzed in terms of structural modifications taken place due to strontium mixing. The formation of hydroxy apatite (HA) layer on the surface of glasses, treated in SBF solution was examined by XRD, FTIR, optical absorption and scanning electron microscopy studies. The observed bone like apatite formation on glass surface demonstrated the potentiality of the chosen glass for integration with bone. Quantitative analysis of results of the studies on the bioactive behavior of the titled glass indicated that the mixing of SrO to the optimum levels improved its bioactivity.

AB Substantial enhancement of nonlinear high-order harmonics generation based on Fano-resonant nanostructures has received growing interest due to their promising potential for developing integrated and advanced next generation nanophotonic devices. In this study, going beyond conventional subwavelength structures, we propose an optothermally functional hetero-metallodielectric asymmetric eight-member octamer cluster composed of a central silicon nanodisk and peripheral disks with a phase-change material (Ge2Sb2Te5). Using full electromagnetic calculations, we show that in the amorphous phase of the surrounding nanoparticles, the oligomer acts as an all-dielectric cluster, while in the crystalline regime, the octamer turns into a hybrid metallodielectric assembly. Exploiting the exquisite ability of supporting distinct Fano lineshapes at different wavelengths depending on the phase of Ge2Sb2Te5, we showed the generation of both second and third harmonics at amorphous and crystalline phases of GST nanodisks, respectively with the produced harmonic wavelengths of 425 nm and 317 nm, respectively. Our calculations for the corresponding conversion efficiencies revealed significant enhancements as eta(SHG) = 0.0081% and eta(THG) = 0.012% for SHG and THG, respectively. Such an exquisite feature of multiresonant optothermally tunable cluster allows generation of several harmonics with substantial intensities using a single system for future photonics applications.

AB Zinc Lead Alumino Borate (ZPAB) glasses doped with varying concentrations of Terbium (Tb3+) ions have been prepared via melt quenching technique. Structural studies like XRD and FT-IR were performed to ascertain the amorphous nature and functional groups present in the as prepared glasses respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as prepared glasses were investigated by performing excitation and emission spectral studies under 545 nm and 369 nm wavelengths respectively. Under n-UV excitation, these glasses exhibit four emission peaks due to transitions from the excited D-5(4) level of Tb3+ to F-7(J) (J = 3 to 6) ground level. Among all, the intense emission band was observed at 545 nm corresponding to the D-5(4)-> F-7(5) transition and the emission intensity increases up to 1 mol%, beyond concentration quenching took place. The Dexter theory confirms the possibility of energy transfer via electric dipole-dipole interaction between Tb3+-Tb3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity coordinates and color purity were evaluated which falls in intense green region and close to European Broadcasting Union illuminant green. The PL decay studies were carried out to know the experimental lifetimes of the fluorescent levels of Tb3+ ions. The lifetime measured for D-5(4)-> F-7(5) transition of the as prepared glasses decreasing with increase in Tb3+ ions concentration, may be due to efficient energy transfer between Tb3+-Tb3+ ions. The aforementioned results confirm potentiality of these glasses in solid state green laser and as a green component in tricolor w-LEDs.

AB Intense blue and near-infrared emissions were observed in Ca-10(PO4)(6)O:Eu2+ and Ca-10(PO4)(6)O:Eu2+,Nd3+ phosphors. The emissions can be excited by broad band in near ultraviolet region. Blue emission is characterized by CIE coordinates 0.1519, 0.0696 which can be useful as a blue component of LED lamp based on near ultraviolet chips. Near-infrared emission is obtained as a consequence of Eu2+-> Nd3+ energy transfer. The efficiency of Eu2+-> Nd3+ energy transfer is as high as 95%. Fast (10 ns) and slow (300 ns) components observed in decay curves could be identified with isolated Eu2+ and Eu2+ ions near Nd3+, respectively. NIR Emission intensity is limited by Nd3+-> Nd3+ energy transfer and the consequent concentration quenching. Critical distances for Eu2+-> Eu2+ and Nd3+-> Nd3+ energy transfers are 18.86 and 12.62 angstrom, respectively. Absorption of near ultraviolet radiations followed by conversion to blue/NIR indicates the potential applications in solid state lighting and solar photovoltaics.

AB Sm3+, Pr3+ and Dy3+-doped Ca3Nb1.6875Ga3.1875O12 - CNGG and Ca3Li0.275Nb1.775Ga2.95O12 - CLNGG crystals are of interest as solid-state laser materials emitting in the yellow-orange spectral range, especially for diode pumping due to their partially disordered nature. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, single crystals of Sm, Pr and Dy-doped CNGG and CLNGG crystals were grown by the Czochralski method. For the doping of CNGG and CLNGG crystals, five new stoichiometric garnets were synthesised by solid-state reaction method: praseodymium-gallium-garnet (PrGG), dysprosium-gallium-garnet (DyGG) and praseodymium-lithium-niobium gallium-garnet (PrLNGG), samarium-lithium-niobium-gallium-garnet (SmLNGG), and dysprosium-lithium-niobium-gallium-garnet (DyLNGG). Samarium-gallium-garnet (SmGG) was also sintered and used for the doping of Sm:CNGG crystal. Structural properties of sintered materials and grown crystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction and the chemical compositions of the grown crystals were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) method. The spectroscopic investigations of the grown crystals have shown that they are promising laser materials in the yellow-orange spectral range.

AB A sensitive arsenic (III) (As(III)) detection method based on the fluorescence quenching system using bovine serum albumin (BSA) capped carbon-gold composite (C-Au-BSA) was developed. BSA could attach to the surface of C-Au composite and increase the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, As(III) could combine with BSA and remove it from C-Au composite to decrease the PL efficiency. A linear relationship was observed between (As (HI)) concentration and PL quenching at low concentrations (5-50 ppb - for drinking and bore water detection) and high concentrations (100-800 ppb - sedimentary arsenic) of the metal. The limit of detection was more superior (low conc; R-2 = 0.96 with sensitivity 0.004 ppb, high cone; R-2 = 0.98 with sensitivity 0.0002) when compared to other techniques. Thus, this method can be applied to determine low levels as well as sedimentary levels of As(III).

AB Green phosphors Er:Yb:KY(WO4)(2) doped with various Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations were synthesized by the modified Pechini method. Cell parameters evolution was evaluated by Rietveld refinement. Stokes spectra at 514 nm of samples were dominated by Er3+ and Yb3+ luminescence. Samples under 980 nm exhibited strong upconversion emission at 530 nm and 550 nm and low 660 nm emission for different Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations. Luminescence dynamics of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions has been described by analysing upconversion emission intensity dependence on the excitation power, as well as from Stokes emission and decay time measurements. Based on 1931 CIE chromaticity calculations as coordinates, dominant wavelength and color purity, Er:Yb:KY(WO4)(2) was suggested as a possible green phosphor for technological applications.

AB The coupling of space light to optical fiber is the key problem in free space optical communication. The diameter of fiber core is very small, which brings great difficulty to coupling. We first analyze the coupling model, and propose the conical fiber array as a new receiver to improve the efficiency. After that, the sample of conical fiber array is produced in the laboratory, and the testing experiment in micro vibration environment is carried out. In this experiment, two methods are used to measure the received optical power. In the first method, the light from nine fibers is merged into one with the optical splitter. In the second method, a large target avalanche photo diode (APD) is used to receive the light from nine fibers. Compared with our previous work, both measurement methods show the coupling efficiency of the conical fiber array is higher.

AB Zinc lead tungsten tellurite glasses with varying concentration of samarium ions were synthesised by melt quench method and studied their absorption, excitation, emission and decay spectral features to understand their utility in visible photonic devices. The bonding parameter evaluated from the absorption spectra reveals the nature of bonding between Sm3+ ions and its surrounding ligands as ionic. Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters estimated from absorption spectral features are used to evaluate radiative parameters for the fluorescent levels of Sm3+ ions in these glasses. The bandwidths (Delta lambda(p)), emission cross-sections (sigma(se)), and branching ratios (beta(R)) were evaluated from the emission spectra. The experimental lifetimes measured are correlated with radiative lifetimes and were used to determine the quantum efficiency (eta) of the titled glasses. Relatively higher values of sigma(se), beta(R), eta and CIE coordinates obtained for 1 mol% of Sm3+ ions in the as prepared glass reveals its suitability for visible photonic devices.

AB For the first time, the optical parameters of mats of polymeric, polyacrylonitrite (PAN) nanofibers containing ferroelectric and semiconducting antimony selenoiodide (SbSeI) are presented. The novel material has been made by electrospinning. The SbSeI nanowires, used as the filler, have been prepared sonochemically using elemental Sb, Se and I-2 in the presence of ethanol under ultrasonic irradiation (20 kHz, 565 W/cm(2)) at 323 K within 2 h. The products have been characterized by using techniques, such as powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. The spectral characteristics of diffusive transmission and reflectance of PAN/SbSeI mats have been measured at room temperature to determine absorption and scattering coefficients. The absorption spectrum of PAN/SbSeI has been least square fitted with the theoretical dependence appropriate for the sum of the indirect allowed absorption with an absorption/emission of phonons without excitons and a constant absorption term. The indirect allowed optical energy gap of PAN/SbSeI has the value E-gia = 1.59 (1) eV.

AB Organic crystals of 2',3,4,4',5-pentamethoxy chalcone (PMC), grown by slow evaporation technique, are subjected to spectroscopic and nonlinear optical analyses. The experimental and theoretical vibrational spectra confirm that the charge-.transfer interaction between the methoxy group and phenyl ring through the ethylenic bridge of the PMC molecule must be responsible for the simultaneous IR and Raman activation of C=C stretching and ring modes. The Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Atoms In Molecules (AIM) calculations verify the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the molecule. The large NLO efficiency predicted for PMC is confirmed for the first time by powder SHG efficiency experiment by Kurtz and Perry, while the third order nonlinearity is measured by means of open-.aperture Z-.scan technique. From the results, the use of PMC for nonlinear optical applications is suggested. The Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectral investigations have been performed to obtain the adsorption geometry of PMC on the silver surface. Density functional theory at B3LYP/SDD level has been used to compute energies of different configurations of silver adsorbed-PMC to find their stability, optimized geometry of the most stable configuration, and for characterizations including vibrational, NBO and hyperpolarizability analyses.

Studied materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and luminescence spectroscopy (luminescence spectra and lifetime measurements). The morphology of the phosphors was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The luminescence excitation spectra of EuxCa1-1.5xMoyW1-yO4 phosphors were mainly attributed to O2- -> Mo6+ and O-2. -> W6+ charge-transfer (CT) bands in the UV region, at similar to 260-340 nm, and some sharp lines of Eu3+ transitions with the two strongest at 394 nm and 465 nm (in near-UV and visible regions). The EuxCa1-1.5xMoyW1-yO4 phosphors showed intense red luminescence characteristic for the Eu3+ ions and the emission peaks were ascribed to the D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions, respectively. The calculated chromaticity coordinates indicate these phosphors as potential candidates of red phosphors for high quality light source, e.g. LEDs.

AB This paper reports the preparation and characterization of europium doped barium bismuth fluoroborate glasses (Eu3+: BBFB) prepared by conventional melt quenching technique. The structural properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction spectra which confirm the amorphous nature of the prepared glass. Optical properties of the glasses were studied by the optical absorption, emission and decay curve measurements. Nephelauxetic ratio (beta) and bonding parameters (delta) were calculated from the absorption spectra to examine the nature of the bonding between the Eu3+ ion and its surrounding ligands. The band gap and Urbach energy of the glasses were determined from the absorption spectra to study the electronic band structure. A band gap value varies inversely with the Urbach energy values. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters were determined from the least square fit analysis. In the luminescence spectra, predominant high intense radiation, shows at D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ ion, is observed around 610 nm. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters were used to analyse the transition probability (A(R)), branching ratio (beta(R)), radiative lifetime (tau(R)) and stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(E)(P)) for all the glasses. The colour chromaticity CIE coordinates have been calculated from the emission spectra and characterized through Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 diagram. The decay analysis D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition exhibits single exponential behavior for all the glasses. The higher value of the stimulated emission cross-section, at 612 nm, confirms that the prepared glass is a potential candidate for red colour laser emission applications.

AB In this paper, the effect of spin-coating cycles with different densities on the light scattering properties of Ag nanowires (Ag NWs) transparent conductive films was investigated. The Ag NWs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The results indicate that haze factor and the scattering in reflection and transmission directions increased with an increase in Ag NWs density. The resulting Ag NWs show cross point dropped down from similar to 800 nm to similar to 600 nm for spin coating 4-7 cycles. The ratio of back and forward scattering for Ag NWs exhibited a cross point that shifted to lower wavelengths with the increase in density. The controlling scattering properties of Ag NWs films may open a new avenue for Ag NWs application.

AB We report on the study of the third-order nonlinear optical interactions in InxGa1-xAsyP1-y/InP strip-loaded waveguides. The material composition and waveguide structures were optimized for enhanced nonlinear optical interactions. We performed self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing and nonlinear absorption measurements at the pump wavelength 1568 nm in our waveguides. The nonlinear phase shift of up to 2.5 pi has been observed in self-phase modulation experiments. The measured value of the two-photon absorption coefficient alpha(2) was 19 cm/GW. The four-wave mixing conversion range, representing the wavelength difference between maximally separated signal and idler spectral components, was observed to be 45 nm. Our results indicate that InGaAsP has a high potential as a material platform for nonlinear photonic devices, provided that the operation wavelength range outside the two-photon absorption window is selected.

AB The extinction coefficient (k) of free-standing chitosan-based films is determined in the spectral range 250-840 nm from normal incidence transmittance spectra showing partial coherence. Films of thicknesses (d) ranging between 3.7 and 20 mu m casted from chitosan-acid acetic solutions are analyzed. Fast Fourier transform of oscillations in the transmittance spectra is used to determine film thicknesses by assuming normal dispersion in the refractive index (n) as reported in the literature. Transformation of partially coherent spectra to incoherent spectra was used to determine k which resulted of the order of 10(-4). The strength of anomalous dispersion in n introduced by an absorption band in k centered at wavelength 293 nm is analyzed within the framework of the Lorentz harmonic oscillator model. The reliability of the assumed dispersion of n, the determined k spectra and d values is tested by analyzing the experimental transmittance spectra with a theoretical model accounting for partial coherence. An inverse relationship between the degree of coherence and film thickness is found.

ID CARRIER DIFFUSION LENGTHS; P-TYPE GAN; AIRY FUNCTION; MINORITY; GAAS
AB The theoretical relationship between the hole concentration (n), electron diffusion length (L-D), and surface photoelectron escape probability (P) was studied. It is found that with increase of n, L-D decreases and P increases. Based on the Spicer's three-step photoemission model and the quantum efficiency (QE) formula of negative electron affinity (NEA) GaN photocathode, the theoretical relationship between n and QE could be obtained. A three-dimension graph was drawn to show the relationship between QE and photon energy (E), which allowed us to observe the QE changing with n intuitively. In the whole wavelength range, QE tended to rise firstly and then fall down. The optimal n shifted to the lower concentration with the increase in wavelength due to the deeper attenuation length of the long-wavelength light. Based on the photo-electrical response of the effective band, the optimal doping concentration of 1.26 x 10(17)cm( )(-3)was obtained. The comparison results indicated that the experimental data were consistent with the simulated curves.

AB Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we were able to trace the quasi-vanishing of the second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of a newly synthesized organic salt, bis(triphenylguanidinium) L-malate, to the pseudo-centrosymmetry of its structure. The employed experimental techniques were single crystal X-ray diffraction to determine the structure, "open-aperture" Z-scan technique to measure the nonlinear absorption, Kurtz and Perry powder method and Maker fringes techniques for second- and third-harmonic generation. The molecular hyperpolarizability tensors (beta and gamma) were calculated within Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the macroscopic second- and third-order susceptibility tensors were estimated by combining the supermolecule approach with the oriented gas model. The calculations performed with global hybrid GGA and range-separated functionals reproduced the correct order of magnitude of the observed second- and third-order susceptibilities.

AB In the present study, the AgInSe2 (AIS) thin films 500 nm in thickness were prepared by selenization of the Ag/In/Ag/In multilayer deposited by DC magnetron sputtering. The selenization was carried out at 250 degrees C and was followed by annealing at 450 degrees C, 475 degrees C and 500 degrees C. The selenized and annealed films were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), UV-Visible-NIR spectroscopy, Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD analysis revealed the formation of the desired AgInSe2 phase along with Ag2Se (AS) impurity phase. The impurity Ag-2 Se phase is being diminished at higher annealing temperature (500 degrees C) resulting the formation of AgInSe2 phase. The super ionic nature of alpha-Ag2Se phase facilities the diffusion of Ag ion with its neighbouring tetrahedral sites. The low band gap Ag2Se impurity phase suppression by annealing at 500 degrees C lead to optical band gap increase. The Raman spectrum shows individual AgInSe2 and Ag-2 Se peaks and also the overlapping of these two phases. The Ag2Se peaks are vanished after annealing. The EDXRF study revealed that the film is off-stoichiometric and exhibit n-type conductivity. The RBS analysis indicates the diffusion of the film material to the glass substrate. From Hall measurement it is confirmed that the film shows n-type conductivity and the resistivity decreases with increasing the annealing temperature.

AB Surface morphological evolution is observed in thermally activated nanocrystalline CdS (nc-CdS) thin films. The chemical bath deposited nc-CdS thin films show flower like structures on micro-crack background. Thermal annealing of nc-CdS thin films at different temperatures viz. 300, 350, 400 and 450 degrees C for 3 h in Ar ambient developed surface morphology towards salt rock like structures with clear particle boundaries at higher temperatures. Besides, structural phase transition from zincblende to wurtzite is observed, at 350 degrees C in nc-CdS thin films. It is observed that on increasing the annealing temperature longitudinal optical phonon Raman mode shifts toward higher frequency side in either of the crystal structure and bandgap reduces. Photoluminescence study illustrates thermally activated enhancement in green emission and disappearance of yellow and red emission in both the structures. The variation in emission intensity is described on the bases of morphology and structural changes occur due to thermal activation.

AB In this work is reported the fabrication and characterization of the triple-layer electroluminescent organic devices using a mixture of the gadolinium and europium beta-diketonate complexes [GdxEuy(TTA)(3) (TPPO)(2)] as emitting layer. The OLED devices contained the 1-(3-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-carboxyaldehyde-1,1''-diphenylhydrazone (MTCD) as hole-transporting layer and tris(8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum) (Alq(3)) as electron transporting layer. The electroluminescence spectra present emission narrow bands from D-5(1 )-> F-7(1,2) and D-5(0) -> F-7(0,1,2,3,4) transitions characteristics of the Eu3+ ion. These sharp lines are overlapped with a broad band attributed to the electrophosphorescence due to the T-1 -> S-0 transition from TTA ligand. The intermolecular energy transfer from Gd-chelate to Eu-chelate is discussed based on this electrophosphorescence appearance.

AB The leader of todays solar energy revolution is undoubtedly the silicon photovoltaic (PV) module. However, despite the immense progress in efficiency and the phenomenal drop of manufacturing and installation costs the dark blue flat panels have not found widespread use in the modern urban environment. The scarcity of available rooftop space, the high cost of land and the irregular metropolitan skyline have not allowed conventional solar technologies to supply cities with clean energy. Thus, new concepts are being investigated to integrate solar generators into new and existing buildings in the form of facades or windows. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs) offer a novel approach for the utilization of solar irradiation in the form of transparent glazing systems that have the potential to become functional elements of the building envelope. This paper highlights and compares the most recent technological advances in the field of LSC technology and the contribution of colloidal chemistry with reabsorption-free emitters offering broadband absorption and enhanced stability. Combined with a critical study of the newly emerged LSC applications in various fields this study will also attempt to give a possible glimpse of the near future of transparent solar harvesting devices.

AB Despite the crucial role of plasmonic nanostructures in enhancing the performance of organic solar cells, the actual absorption of the active layer in these cells is restricted by the parasitic metal absorption loss limiting their efficiencies. In this paper, a bilayer of Al-TiN nanosquare array has been proposed as a novel plasmonic scheme in order to improve the photocurrent and the solar absorption of organic solar cells. The hybrid design of Al and TiN materials reduces the parasitic loss issue offering extended application of plasmonic light-harvesting structures. Engineering the energy band diagram of the cell and concentrating the electrical field distribution inside the active layer result in boosting the absorption as well as the optical current densities for each layer. Utilization of TiN in the proposed design also benefits from the cost effectiveness, abundance, and CMOS compatibility of this material compared to noble metals as well as featuring appropriate light trapping properties. In addition, the symmetric scheme of the proposed structure makes it polarization insensitive under the normal incidence. The numerical simulations of this study based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method show an enhanced absorption of 70-88% over the spectral range of 300-625 nm and the maximum enhancement factor of 2.16 at the wavelength of about 665 nm. Moreover, an improved photocurrent density of 13.7082 (mA/cm(2)) has also been achieved despite the usage of an ultrathin active layer. The proposed design can also be developed to achieve performance enhancement of other thin film solar cells in the future.

AB NaCe(MoO4)(2) (NCM) crystal with dimensions of 20 x 20 x 18 mm(3) was grown by the Czochralski method. Rietveld structure refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data confirms that the compound crystallizes in the tetragonal system I4(1)/a. Transmission spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were measured at room temperature, which demonstrate that NCM crystal has relatively high transmittance in the 800-2000 nm regions after annealing in air and Ce(3+ )ions could exist stably in the structure of the scheelite molybdates. The magnetic susceptibility in different directions and Faraday characteristics of NCM crystal were investigated. The results show NCM crystal has obvious magnetic anisotropy and larger Verdet constants than those of TGG reported. The reason of large Verdet constants was analyzed in terms of Ce 4f-4f5d electronic transitions based on the Van Vleck-Hebb theory.

AB The proposed structure shows the tunable plasmon-induced reflection (PIR) effect within the mid-infrared region. The destructive interference between a graphene nanoribbon as the bright mode resonator and two graphene nanodisk resonators (NDRs) as the dark mode resonators is responsible for the PIR window formation. The structure is simulated numerically by the 3D-FDTD method, and the results show that the PIR window can be simply tuned by the design parameters as well as the dynamic change in the Fermi energy of the NDRs. The formation of the double PIR effect is possible when the NDRs are displaced in opposite directions. The simplicity of the structure, from both the design and the implementation point of view, which is due to the possibility of the realization of the device in one single spatial plane and the straightforward parameter tuning makes it appropriate for various applications including multi-channel filters, sensors, and fast-light-based devices.

AB Hybrid thin films of doped polyaniline (PANI) with Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in bimodal mesoporous silica-forming (ZnO@SiOx) NPs were prepared. The preparation was done by spin coating techniques of the solution of a protonated PANI with TFA acid with sequential weight ratios of ZnO@SiOx NPs in the range from 15% to 60%. The prepared thin film morphologies were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The aggregation or the clustering of ZnO@SiOx) NPs in the polymer network matrix is very limited due to the silicone oxide (SiOx) which is known to limit the growth of aggregation clusters. The optical properties of hybrid thin films were studied through reflectance and transmission spectroscopy in the UV-Vis range. The optical constants such as the refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (k), real (epsilon') and imaginary (epsilon '') parts of dielectric permittivity and the absorption coefficient were deduced via analysis of the transmittance spectra using 'CODE' software. Increase of the ZnO@SiOx NPs content gives rise to a decrease of the values of these constants: The refractive index n showed a significant decrease for the highest ratio. The static dielectric permittivity constant, the gap energy E(g )and the Urbach energy were determined by using common optical models. E-g decreases with increasing ZnO@SiOx NPs content. For the nanocomposites corresponding to an amount of 45%, the value of E-g reached 2.4eV. The bonding of the ZnO@SiOx NPs to the protonated PANI by TFA doping was investigated thoroughly by FTIR spectroscopy. Based on its optical and electrical properties the novel PANI/ZnO@SiOx hybrid nanocomposite is a promising candidate for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.

AB A comparative study of anti-reflection microstructures (ARMs) and ARMs with Al2O3 coatings (Al2O3/ARMs) on zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been carried out. The transmittance and electric field intensities were analyzed and presented using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. ARMs were successfully fabricated on ZnSe surfaces by reactive ion etching and an Al2O3 layer was deposited onto the ARMs by an ion beam sputtering method. The theoretical analysis and experimental results showed that the transmittance of Al2O3/ARMs-treated ZnSe had a close relationship with the thickness of Al2O3 layer and was higher than that of ARMs-treated ZnSe in the 2-5 mu m wavelength range, which was due to the fact that the Al2O3/ARMs had a better graded refractive index profile. The angle-dependent reflectance of ZnSe with Al2O3/ARMs was lower than that with ARMs. A difference of the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity between ARMs and Al2O3/ARMs was observed due to the surface Al2O3 coating, which predicted qualitative laser damage thresholds for both structures. The results of this study provide potential applications in high-efficiency IR optoelectronic devices and high power mid-infrared laser systems.

AB Glycinium 2-carboxy 6-nitrophthalate (G3N) has been grown by slow evaporation method at ambient temperature using water solvent in 1:1 M ratio. Single crystal XRD study confirmed that the G3N crystal having a monoclinic structure with space group P2(1)/c. The solid-state parameters like Fermi energy, Penn energy, Plasma energy, and polarizability were estimated theoretically. The crystalline quality of grown crystal was scrutinized by High-resolution XRD study. The mode of vibrations and presence of functional groups in the G3N compound was identified from the vibrational analysis. The lower cut-off wavelength of the G3N crystal is endowed to be 377 run and the calculated band gap energy is 3.09 eV. Photoluminescence (PL) property of G3N crystal was studied. The imaginary (Im (chi)((3)) = 0.43 x 10(-6) esu) and real parts (Re (chi)((3)) = 5.68 x 10(-6) esu) of the third order susceptibility values were determined from Z-scan studies. The surface laser damage threshold value of G3N crystal was endowed to be 6.22 GW/cm(2) using an Nd: YAG laser. TG-DSC analysis divulges that the crystal was thermally steady up to 184 degrees C. The dielectric manner of a G3N crystal was evaluated in the frequency between 40 and 70 Hz at various temperatures. The hardness of G3N crystal was accomplished on the (1 0 0) and (similar to 1 0 0) planes to understand the mechanical properties of the crystal.

AB Luminescence measurements were made on NaMgF3 :Mn before and after irradiation with X-rays over a wide Mn concentration range from x = 0.1 0 /0-5%. Photoluminescence (PL) is seen from distorted Mn2+ sites that saturate for x >= 1% and non-distorted Mn2+ sites. The non-distorted Mn2+ crystal field parameter and crystal field splitting are independent of Mn concentration and they are B = 779 +/- 14 cm(-1) and 10Dq = 9250 +/- 160 cm(-1 ). F-centre/Mn complexes are seen for all concentrations with a PL emission at similar to 670 nm. The complexes have perturbed Mn2+ energy levels that shift by less than 1630 cm(-1) in the 320 nm-570 nm wavelength range. There is also a PL emission at similar to 730 nm that is likely to arise from F-3 -centres perturbed by nearby Mn. The PL from these two perturbed centres is linear in dose up to 3.8 kGy when probed in the 550 nm-650 nm region and it can be repeatedly probed without bleaching. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) occurs for all Mn concentrations from the non-distorted Mn2+ site after X-ray irradiation. The OSL intensity is linear up to similar to 270 Gy for 0.5% Mn and the trapped carriers can be selectively bleached. Radioluminescence (RL) is also observed in all samples from both Mn2+ sites. Not all Mn(2+ )displays RL and a larger fraction of distorted Mn2+ sites do not display RL, which may be due to a higher concentration of nearby non-radiative recombination sites. The ratio of the RL of the non-distorted Mn2+ to the distorted Mn2+ is nearly dose-history-independent after an initial predose for 0.1% Mn, and it is linear in dose up to 9.6 kGy for 5% Mn. Our results show that NaMgF3 :Mn has great potential for real-time and total dose measurements where there are complementary methods available to obtain the dose rate, the dose-history, the dose after each irradiation, and the cumulative dose up to very high doses.

AB Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) meso flanked BODIPY dyad are synthesized and investigated by using spectroscopic, fluorescence lifetime decay, electrochemical and DFT method. Excitation (lambda(exc) = 290 nm) of the Bn-OH-BDY dyad leads to emission (lambda(emi) = 545 nm) totally directed by the BODIPY subunits pointing to excitation energy transfer (EET) from the ESIPT to BODIPY core. A large shift of 255 nm has been observed between excitation and emitted light. Attachment of ESIPT unit does not cause any perturbation in the low-energy absorption band of the Bn-OH-BDY dyad. The electrochemical study shows an irreversible peak of single-electron oxidation of ESIPT core at 0.38 eV and reduction of BODIPY core at 1.023 eV. DFT calculation studies show the existence of charge transfer (CT) state from ESIPT to BODIPY core. The results obtained from photophysics, electrochemical study and DFT support EET from excited ESIPT core to BODIPY subunits. The DFT results show dominating electronic contribution to the linear polarizability (alpha) and first hyperpolarizability (beta). NLO response was measured using Z scan technique. The values obtained for nonlinear absorption coefficient (beta) in DMSO is -5.95 x 10(-12) (m/W) and for third-order susceptibility (chi)(3) it is 14.19 x 10(-13) (e.s.u). The geometries of the dyad were optimized by using B3LYP/6-311 + + G (d,p) level of theory.

AB Glass based nanocomposites with embedded noble metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au, Cu) exhibit interesting optical features that can be of immense importance while designing devices for a variety of optical applications. Silver glass nanocomposites were prepared using soda glass as host matrix by a two-step method i.e. ion-exchange followed by irradiation using low energy Argon (Ar+) ions at an angle of 50 degrees. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) along with energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) spectroscopy were performed for morphological investigations of thus prepared nanocomposites. The structural characterization of the nanocomposites was carried out using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which revealed their possibility to be used as IR based filters with a transmittance of about 96% over a wavelength range of 2.5-20 mu m (mid-infrared region) in case of sample with 5x10(16) Ar+ ions cm(-2). UV-visible spectroscopy was utilized to calculate optical parameters like optical energy gap, urbach's energy, refractive index and its dispersion for computing useful dispersion parameters by applying single-effective-oscillator model given by Wemple and DiDomenico and in addition optical conductivity for virgin glass and silver glass nanocomposites.

AB This article presents the photophysical and photoconductive properties of a newly synthesized low band gap Donor-Acceptor conjugated poly (benzothiadiazole-triphenylamine) co-polymer labelled as P(BTZ-TPA) in which 2,1,3 benzothiadiazole (BTZ) act as the electron deficient moiety and triphenylamine (TPA) is used as donor moiety. Photophysical properties of this synthesized polymer were analyzed by recording steady state absorption and emission spectra of dilute solution and thin films respectively. In addition to this, solvatochromic experiments were carried out using a binary mixture consisting of toluene and acetonitrile to understand the solvent dependence on the ground state and excited states of this polymer. The optical characterization revealed high degree of intramolecular charge transfer through the polymer backbone. The P(BTZ-TPA) thin films exhibit good fluorescence emission with emission peak around 615 nm. Quantum yield of the fluorescence emission is measured in relative method. Also, fluorescence decay parameters were examined using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Carrier generation and transport of the generated carriers upon photo excitation is studied in pristine polymer films as well as in P(BTZ-TPA):PCBM blend films, by performing photoconductivity studies using broad spectral source and lasers of wavelengths 488 nm and 632 nm. P(BTZ-TPA) thin films exhibited good photoresponse over the entire visible region, with promising internal photo current efficiency. Quenching of fluorescence is observed in PCBM blend films. This drastic quenching of fluorescence emission is assigned to the charge transfer interaction between co-polymer and PCBM, and is confirmed by substantial increment in photoconductivity of the blend films. An internal photocurrent efficiency of 17.4% was obtained in the blend films for a biasing field of 10 V/mu m.

AB The temperature dependent properties of three liquid crystals (LC) namely effective geometry parameter, order parameter and temperature gradients of refractive indices of two fluorinated isothiocyanato nematic liquid crystal (NLC) compounds 4'-pentylcyclohexyl-3,5-difluoro-4-isothiocyanatobiphenyl, 4' - butylcyclohexyl - 3, 5 - difluoro - 4 - isothiocyanato-biphenyl of high clearing temperature (T-C) and low T-C LC compound 4 (trans-4'-n-hexycyclohexyl) isothiocyanatobenzene (6CHBT) have been studied. In this paper, the effective geometry parameters of the three LC compounds are calculated. The order parameters of three LC compounds are also calculated from the effective geometry parameter. From the available data, it is found that the two fluorinated NLC compounds exhibit moderately high value of birefringence (similar to 0.24-0.26) and 6CHBT exhibits a lower value of birefringence (similar to 0.16). From the study, it is found that the order parameter is found to be higher in higher birefringence and higher T-C LC compounds. The values of temperature gradient of ordinary refractive index (dn(o)/dT) are found to be showing negative to positive value while increasing temperature which gives the crossover temperature (T-CO). The crossover temperature has been calculated from the temperature gradient at the value (dn(o)/dT) = 0. LC compounds with lower T-C are found to have larger T-CO value which gives narrower temperature between T-CO and T-C. The T-CO value of compound having larger alkyl group is found to be smaller. The Lorentz field factors for both compound are also reported which can be used for order parameter calculation by different aspects.

AB The effect of the annealing temperature on the photoelectrical properties of the nanoporous silicon/zinc oxide nanocrystallites-based (Pt/n-PSi/ZnO NCs/Pt) photodetector was investigated. Different morphologies of 3D ZnO were synthesized onto the n-PSi substrates via radio frequency (RF) sputtering in the absence of a catalyst. The synthesis of ZnO NCs was controlled by varying the growth temperature between 600-700 degrees C and 800-900 degrees C. The effect of the synthesis temperature on the structural, morphological, and optical properties of the n-PSi/ZnO NCs was systematically studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) techniques. The roughness was found to be dependent on the anodization current density. The optimal n-PSi/ZnO NCs-based metal-semiconductor-metal UV detector (MSM) was fabricated at 700 degrees C. The fabricated device showed a high sensitivity of 1007.14, an internal photoconductive gain of 11.07, and a responsivity of 5.99 A/W with a low dark current when illuminated with 380 run light (1.55 mW/cm(2)) at +5 V bias voltage. In addition, the response and recovery times were determined to be 0.34 and 0.22 s, respectively. This approach offers a cost-effective substrate and simple synthesis method to improve the growth of the n-PSi/ZnO NCs and demonstrates the successful fabrication of nanoscale photodetectors with potential application in nano-optics devices.

AB Light-emitting composites are materials that combine the light-emitting characteristic of phosphor materials with the solubility of conductive polymers. This paper has the purpose of showing an experimental study on electroluminescence in a light-emitting composite comprising PEDOT:PSS as the conductive polymer and Zn2SiO4:Mn as the phosphor material. The relationship between d.c. current and voltage, as well as luminance and voltage, of light-emitting devices were measured for different active layer thickness and different temperature conditions. Luminance was also measured during impedance spectroscopy experiments (a.c. characterization). It was observed that the electroluminescence in the studied light-emitting composite is a field effect mechanism, with turn-on electric field of (4.6 +/- 0.2) kV/cm, and that the electroluminescence efficiency is independent of temperature. Additionally, it was observed that electroluminescence is strictly dependent on the drift current of charge carriers. Finally, a model was proposed to describe the electrical properties and luminance of the studied light-emitting composite.

AB Nano-powders of La(1-x)DyxPO4 with rod-like morphology have been synthesized via hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, TEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction patterns collected for the prepared materials indicated the high purity of crystalline phase with a monoclinic structure. Photoluminescence properties have been investigated based on excitation and emission spectra, decay curves and chromatic coordinates. The emission spectra show a broad blue band ascribed to the transitions from the excited levels I-4(11/2), I-4(13/2), I-4(15/2) and F-4(9/2) to the fundamental levels H-6(15/2). A yellow band related to the F-4(9/2)-> H-6(13/2) transition has been observed at 573 nm. The luminescence intensities ratio and lifetimes have been found to be dependent on the concentration of Dy3+ ion and the excitation wavelength. The decay curves present double exponential shape for all concentration of Dy3+. The yellow-to-blue emission intensity ratios and CIE chromaticity coordinates have been used to estimate the color of the emitted light. A high-quality of white light with three-color temperature (Warm, Natural or Daylight, Cool) has been obtained from a single emitting phosphor, LaPO4:Dy3+. The improved emission lifetimes and color temperature are suitable for application in the white light LED devices.

AB Novel organic nonlinear optical material 4-Aminopyridinium Trichloro Acetate (4ATCA) crystals were grown from aqueous solution by the slow evaporation method for the first time. Single Crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the grown crystal belongs to an orthorhombic system with a space group of Pbca. The morphological study identifies various planes in the crystal and prominent plane was found to be (0-10). The presence of functional groups and other chemical components were analyzed by FTIR study. The crystal is transparent in the entire visible region (350 nm-700 nm) and a lower cut-off value was found to be 218 nm. The laser damage threshold value of the crystal was estimated to be 3.2 GW/cm(2). The sharp endothermic peak at 170.5 degrees C, limits its NLO applications. The low dielectric loss value reveals lower defect density of the grown

AB We investigated the optical behaviour of excitons in monolayer MoS2 prepared on a 60 nm-thick metal (Au) ring structure patterned on SiO2. CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 was transferred to the metal structure and placed in contact with three different environments simultaneously: SiO2, Au metal and air. The optical properties of the transferred MoS2 on the substrates were characterized through micro-photoluminescence (mu-PL) measurements. PL peaks were observed near similar to 1.82 eV for defect-related emission, similar to 1.92 eV for an A exciton, which includes a neutral exciton and a trion, and similar to 2.1 eV for a B exciton. The optical band gap and exciton-phonon interaction of the samples on the three substrates were investigated by measuring the temperature-dependent photoluminescence.

AB Thin films of silicon nanocrystals embedded in SiO2 matrices were prepared by annealing a photoresist of hydrogen silsesquioxane. As compared to films made by a common method of annealing SiOx (1 < x < 2), significant enhancement on photoluminescence intensity was observed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was applied to figure out optical properties of nc-Si made from HSQ. High-resolution tunneling electron microscopy, photoluminescence and absorption spectra were taken to either confirm the fitting results of SE or characterize structural, morphological and photoluminescent properties of all samples. The deduced refractive indices of nc-Si:SiO2 films made from HSQ were given. The influence of particle size and spatial distribution of nc-Si on the extinction coefficient K and PL spectra was observed and discussed.

AB Zinc phosphate films doped with Ce3+, Tb3+, Mn2+, Ce3+/Tb3+ and Ce3+/Tb3+/Mn2+ were deposited at 500 degrees C by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique. Blue emission with color purity of 89.8% is generated from the Ce3+-singly doped film upon 280 nm excitation. The Mn2+-singly doped film emits neutral white light of 4896 K upon 410 nm excitation. The Tb3+-singly doped film excited at 377 nm emits in the green region. Yellowish-green emission is achieved by codoping with Ce3+ and Tb3+ upon Ce3+ excitation at 280 nm, such that Tb3+ is sensitized by Ce3+ through a non-radiative energy transfer with an efficiency of up to 25%. Yellow white emission of 2810 K can be generated from the film triply doped with Ce3+, Tb(3+)and Mn2+ upon 280 nm excitation. Tb(3+)and Mn2+ being sensitized by Ce3+ through a non-radiative energy transfer with an efficiency of 29%. The energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb(3+)and Mn2+, resulting in yellow white emission, as well the neutral white emission from the Mn2+-singly doped film, make the Mn2+ and Ce3+/Tb3+/Mn2+-doped zinc phosphate films versatile materials that could contribute to the design of efficient UV-blue LED pumped white phosphors.

AB A new method based on the use of germanium monoselenide as a germanium-containing component of the batch for preparing especially pure Ge-Se glasses has been developed. Glass samples of Ge20Se80 composition with hydrogen impurity content in the form of SeH-groups of 1.2-2.6 ppm (at) and of oxygen in the form of Ge-O of 0.1-0.2 ppm (wt) have been produced. A single-index optical fiber with a diameter of 220 mu m is fabricated from the purest Ge20Se80 glass sample by using the crucible method. In the spectrum of total optical losses of the single-index fiber, there are selective impurity absorption bands of SeH-groups with an intensity of 1.5 dB/m at a wavelength of 4.51 mu m, Ge-O (0.3 dB/m at 7.9 mu m), and Si-O (4.1 dB/m at 9.2 mu m). The optical losses in the single-index fiber in the spectral range 5-8 mu m were at the level of 1.2-1.6 dB/m; the minimum optical losses were 0.9 dB/m at a wavelength of 7.1 mu m.

AB Torrefaction is an efficient way for the biomass dewatering and upgrading before its thermal conversion and utilization. In this work, a gas-pressurized (GP) torrefaction method was proposed to torrefy the biomass wastes. The effect of gas pressure on biomass torrefaction was studied and the reaction mechanism was investigated in detail. The results indicated that the GP torrefied biomass had lower volatile matter content and higher carbon content than the torrefied biomass obtained by traditional method with carrier gas under atmospheric pressure (AP). The high heating values of GP torrefied rice straw and sawdust at 250 degrees C were as high as 17.9 MJ/Kg and 24.5 MJ/Kg, much higher than those of AP torrefied rice straw and sawdust which were13.6 MJ/Kg and 19.2 MJ/kg, respectively. The GP torrefaction at 250 degrees C removed as high as 77.88% and 66.68% of oxygen in rice straw and sawdust, respectively. Furthermore, it converted part of the volatile matter into fixed carbon through promoting aromatization reactions. The GP torrefied biomasses had richer pores and higher specific surface area than the AP torrefied biomasses. This can increase the reactivity for subsequent thermal conversion of the torrefied biomass. It was also found that the gas pressure significantly promoted the thermal decomposition of the hemicellulose and cellulose. The main difference of the reaction mechanism between the GP torrefaction and AP torrefaction was the secondary reactions between the volatiles and biomass. It was because the volatiles were not removed timely during GP torrefaction. Furthermore, the pressure was essential for effectively promoting the secondary reactions.

AB Charge air cooling is the typical technique to reduce temperature of the engine intake air, increasing air density and improving cylinder filling and engine volumetric efficiency in present turbocharged diesel engines. Usually, charge air is cooled by environmental air that crosses a heat exchanger placed in front of the vehicle: its cooling capacity is related to the vehicle speed and other constraints (presence of the main radiator). This leads to an intake air temperature from 30 to 80 degrees C, depending on engine load, external air conditions and vehicle speed again. If the intake air was more cooled down, the engine volumetric efficiency would be further increased. This can only be done by the use of a dedicated cooling fluid, operating at lower temperature with respect to external air. In this paper, therefore, an evaporator, mounted in parallel with the one of the refrigeration unit used for cabin cooling, was placed on the intake line of a turbocharged diesel engine (F1C IVECO engine), tested on a high speed dynamometer bench: the air refrigeration unit is also composed by a compressor, a condenser and a thermostatic expansion valve. The effects of the undercooling of the charge air have been experimental assessed in terms of fuel consumption and regulated emission reduction, evaluated on the most common engine operating points. Mechanical power demand of the compressor has obviously taken into account in order to assess overall benefits. Achieved net fuel consumption is in the order of 1% at fixed conditions operating the engine as a light duty type, when the intake air sub-cooling is turned on. A benefit on the regulated emissions has been observed (Nitrogen Oxides, Soot) regardless of the setup of the engine combustion processes (injection time, fuel distribution for each injection, Exhaust Gas Recirculated rate). Unburned hydrocarbon and Carbon monoxide behavior, on the other hand, deserves some more attention and call for the re-calibration of the previously cited combustion control parameters.

AB The distribution model of wind-speed data is critical for the assessment of wind-energy potential because it reduces uncertainties in the estimation of wind power output. Thus, an accurate distribution model for describing wind-speed data should be determined before a detailed analysis of energy potential is conducted. In this study, information from several goodness-of-fit criteria, e.g., the R-2 coefficient, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, Akaike's information criterion, and deviation in skewness/kurtosis were integrated for the conclusive selection of the best-fit distribution model of wind-speed data. The proposed approach integrates standardized scores and subjects each criterion to multiplicative aggregation. The approach was applied in a case study to fit eight statistical distributions to hourly wind-speed data collected at two stations in Malaysia. The results showed that the proposed approach provides a good basis for the selection of the optimal wind-speed distribution model. Furthermore, graphical representations agreed with the analytical results.

AB Continuous exploitation of natural resources especially in fossil fuels to fulfil the market demand has jeopardized the natural resources in the Earth. Bioethanol produced by microalgae is one of the promising biofuel for energy security and ecological sustainability. Yet, to date only a modest review has been reported on the bioethanol production technology from microalgae by using various pretreatment methods, fermentative microorganisms, fermentation processes, commercialization techniques and its environmental perspectives. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive information by comparing the recent pretreatment technologies by using different types of ethanologenic microorganisms in various fermentation processes to maximize the bioethanol production. Studies of the economic viability and environmental perspectives of bioethanol from microalgae have been carried out to investigate its potentialities to eliminate environmental issues and towards commercialization. Therefore, this review is essential in providing ideas for the future researches in renewable energy resources technology to develop a more efficient way to scale-up the bioethanol production from microalgae for commercial and industrial application.

AB Skip cycle strategy (SCS) is a stroke volume modulation method leading to reduction in pumping loss through deactivation of engine valves under part-load conditions. Although SCS achieves a significant fuel economy, it increases regulated pollutant emissions such as nitrogen oxide and unburned hydrocarbon in comparison to normal 4-cycle engine operation. This paper investigated normal cycle strategy, skip cycle strategy as well as combination of skip cycle strategy and variable valve timing strategy for a spark-ignition engine using one-dimensional numerical model. The skip cycle engine was modelled at several steady-state operation points and then optimised at best ignition timing providing maximum brake torque at each simulation case. The numerical results obtained for both normal cycle and skip cycle have been validated against the experimental data. After completing the validation of numerical results with engine test bench data for both normal and skip cycle operations, optimisation of intake and exhaust valve timing profiles have been carried out regarding advancing or retarding camshaft relatively to the crankshaft position. In case of SCS and variable valve timing application together, NO,, concentration was reduced by 35.1%, 39.4%, 26.8% and HC emission was reduced by 54.9%, 49.3% and 47.4% on average for brake mean effective pressure load levels of 1, 2 and 3 bar respectively at all among engine speed ranges between 1200 and 1800 rpm compared to stand alone SCS strategy. Furthermore, no remarkable additional brake specific fuel consumption was observed for SCS plus variable valve timing strategy compared to stand alone SCS.

AB Three hydride-forming metals (LaNi5, LaNi4.73Sn0.27 and LaNi4.55Sn0.45) have been studied as solid phase hydrogen storage material in batch experiments using pure hydrogen and temperatures ranging from 300 K to 340 K. This process mainly involves: physisorption of hydrogen gas molecules; chemisorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules; surface penetration of hydrogen atoms; hydride formation; and diffusion of hydrogen atoms through hydride-forming metal. In case the material is fully hydrided, hydride formation ceases and diffusion proceeds on the fully hydrided material.
   A phenomenological model was developed by aggregating the first four mechanisms in a single sorption kinetic term involving a first-order driving force, the remaining mechanism being the atomic diffusion in the hydride-forming material. The driving force is computed between external partial pressure and equilibrium pressure according to the Pressure-Composition-Temperature model (PCT). The corresponding parameters for an empirical PCT were estimated from equilibrium data. This equation is more suitable for process engineering optimization due to the smoothness in its concentration domain. Specific sorption rate and diffusion coefficients of the process were also estimated from dynamic data. From a sensitivity analysis, productivity proved to be related to particle diameter. In the frame of batch processes, the global rate is dominated by the sorption kinetic term at the beginning of the experiments with the material being free from hydride, whereas with more than 5-10% of the material being hydrided, diffusion dominates the process. LaNi(5)shows higher hydrogen storage capacity than LaNi4.73Sn0.27 and LaNi4.55Sn0.45 within the investigated temperature and pressure ranges. Diffusion and sorption kinetic limited regions were identified from a sensitivity analysis of process productivity and normalized marginal values. The present work is oriented to modeling, designing, and optimizing storage and purification devices.

AB Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a promising technology to treat slaughterhouse waste (SHW) for the bioenergy production, nutrient recovery, and pathogen reduction. Three scenarios of estimating the biomethane potential from SHW of the US and the individual States have been conducted in this study. The US meat producers discharged 18.4 million metric ton (MT) SHW in 2016, which can potentially generate 22.7 x 10(9) kWh of biomethane. In Texas State, up to 2.3 x 10(9) kWh year(-1) of energy can be potentially produced from AD of SHW and up to 106.3% of natural gas currently used in the Nebraska State for electricity generation can potentially be replaced with biomethane produced from the AD of its SHW. The technical challenges using SHW as the feedstock of AD process in the US have been summarized, including nitrogen and sulfur inhibition, foaming, sterilization, digestate disposal, supply chain etc. In addition, case studies were conducted by proposing an AD plant treating SHW from a typical slaughterhouse in a U.S. State that mostly processes the broiler, swine, and bovine. In our case studies, a net energy of 17,009-85,278 kWh d(-1) is estimated to be generated from such AD plant. Therefore, producing biomethane from SHW can significantly promote bioenergy production in the US, thus enhancing the quick reach of bioenergy development targets set at the Federal and State levels, while overcoming the technical and management barriers of using SHW.

AB Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the non-catalytic supercritical methanol transesterification reaction of castor, jatropha, pongamia, tobacco, soybean and jojoba oils to biodiesel production were evaluated in the present study. The experiments were conducted in an 83 ml closed batch reactor at different temperatures (250-350 degrees C) and reaction times (15-90 min), and at optimal methanol-to-oil molar ratios (15:1 in the case of jojoba wax-oil and 43:1 for the rest of the oils). The pressure reached in the reactor ranged from 10 to 43 MPa. Integral method was used to determine appropriated reaction orders by an adjustment of experimental data to pseudo-zero, pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic equations using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Pseudo-first-order kinetic equation was found to be the most appropriate to describe the supercritical transesterification reaction of the vegetable oils studied. Rate constants and Arrhenius parameters were calculated, the activation energy followed the sequence: castor oil < jatropha oil < tobacco oil < pongamia oil < soybean oil < jojoba wax-oil. It is difficult to explain the behavior of jojoba and castor oils in relation to that of the rest of vegetable oils because they have a very different structure and fatty acid composition, respectively. However, the aforementioned sequence observed for the rest of vegetable oils (jatropha, tobacco, pongamia and soybean oils), which have a similar structure and fatty acid composition, can be attributed to the content of linolenic acid in the oil: the higher the content of linolenic acid, the higher the activation energy and the lower the reaction rate. Finally, thermodynamic study showed that the non-catalytic supercritical methanol transesterification reaction is non-spontaneous (endergonic) and endothermic in nature.

AB This study develops a new type of heat exchanger with tungsten wires to produce a corona wind. Experimental data are presented for the velocity and temperature of the corona flow from wires to parallel electrodes with respect to the applied voltage and power. Additionally, a gas engine power generation system is manufactured, and its power generation efficiency is tested according to the fuel gas volume fraction between methane and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, an exhaust gas heat recovery system is fabricated using the proposed heat exchanger. A prototype of the corona wind heat exchanger is manufactured, and its enhanced heat recovery efficiency is tested with the gas engine. The corona wind heat exchanger operates well under the available exhaust gas conditions; it increases the temperature of 1 L/min water flow by 45 degrees C by recovering 2 kW of heat energy from the exhaust gas. The total power production efficiency was increased from 29% to 47%. The results confirm that the proposed corona wind heat exchanger can be applied to the gas engines to greatly enhance their heat recovery efficiency.

AB The global warming resulting from the emission of the greenhouse gases has led to tightened restrictions on the use of fossil. Therefore, renewable energy for new energy sources is being widely investigated. However, renewable energy has limitations such as location, environmental conditions, and the potential construction of a new electricity grid. Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is one of the potential new energy candidates that does not emit the greenhouse gases or suffer from limitations of other renewable energy sources. In this research, generating electricity by using SNF is suggested with a hybrid heat pipe system. Thermal energy from SNF worldwide is similar to 750 MWth; however, this energy is not used as an energy source but just removed by chilling in water or in air in storage facilities. To achieve electricity generation from SNF, a dry storage cask with heat pipes and a Stirling engine (UCAN, UNIST CANister) are designed. Using a 1/10-scale test facility, the experimental test of heat transfer and electricity generation as the module of the storage system is conducted. The results yield good agreement with those predicted by the thermal resistance network model, and the electricity generation of the Stirling engine is in the range from 2.3% to 3.2% of the total heat load. The calculated temperature distributions are a good agreement, deviating within 12.2%, and the cooling efficiencies range from 17.51% to 26.33%. The results show the advantages of the use of SNF and its effects, focusing on thermal management and energy generation. The amount of SNF will gradually increase because of the continued operation of nuclear power plants. The usable heat from the SNF is generated due to the decay of fission products during at least several hundred years, which enables to use the SNF as one of the energy sources.

AB In this study, first of its kind novel design of forced draft paddy straw bale combustor (FDPSBC) coupled with innovative pilot fuel injection system (PFIS) and furnace embedded internal water heat-exchanger for large scale water heating is presented. PFIS is optimized to spray 1.5 ml of diesel after every 3 min interval to achieve complete combustion of the compressed bale by maintaining the flame sustainability. Stainless steel heat-exchanger has 62 L water holding capacity circulating at the rate of 36 L per min using the heat of flue gas and has the capacity to heat 1000 L of water from 30 degrees C to 65 degrees C within three hours. Heat of combustion (> 90% combustion efficiency) was utilized to generate flue gas at 350 degrees C and hot water above 65 degrees C applied to 100 m(2) area greenhouse heating located at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana (30.56 degrees N), Punjab, India by designing two heat sink pipe networks; flue gas heat sink pipe network (FGHSPN) fabricated with galvanized iron (GI) and hot water heat sink pipe network (HWHSPN) fabricated with mild steel (MS) respectively laid inside the greenhouse for transfer of heat by radiation and free convection modes. Developed mathematical models showed that FGHSPN was able to transfer 9.6 kW (74%) and where as HWHSPN could transfer 3.38 kW (26%) of heat respectively out of the total heat (12.98 kW) transferred by both the networks to maintain the greenhouse air temperature 10 degrees C higher than the ambient air temperature after sunset hours as validated by experimental trials conducted in the month of November 2017. Installation cost of FDPSBC technology is Rs 5,00,000 ($8000) and with 24 h continuous operation, it can save about 80 kWh per day and can recover the 50% of installation and operating costs within five years time besides managing about 27% of the total paddy straw available in the state of Punjab (India) through useful heating applications including greenhouse heating.

AB Gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) based combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) or combined heating and power (CHP) system driven by natural gas is encouraged to set up for district heating/cooling demand in China due to the clean and efficient energy conversion. This paper presents a GTCC based CCHP system, which consists of a heavy-duty gas turbine, triple-pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), steam turbines, heat exchanger and absorption chiller. Turbine inlet temperature (TIT) strategy and inlet guide vanes (IGV) strategy for the gas turbine are adopted to access the part load performance. The energy distribution and exergy destruction of the CCHP system are investigated under different gas turbine loads. The primary energy saving rate (PESR) and carbon dioxide emission rate (CDER) are set up to evaluate the system at various gas turbine loads and steam extraction ratios. The ability of shaving peak power for the system is investigated. The results show that IGV plays a role in increasing the steam turbine power output and reducing the exhaust heat in HRSG but causes more exergy destruction in the steam turbine expansion process. The PESR and CDER have been enhanced as the steam extraction ratio increases for the same gas turbine load. The IGV strategy reinforces the part-load performance of the CCHP system. For instances, the PESR has been enhanced from 0.2409 to 0.3108, and CDER has been strengthened from 0.8274 to 0.8465 by the IGV strategy at half of gas turbine load and without steam extraction. For the same heating load, both PESR and CDER are enhanced by the IGV strategy. The ability of supplying heating is deteriorating as the decrease in TIT. The ability of shaving peaking power is going to be deteriorated as heating load increases. For the small heating load, like 50 MW, the advantage of the IGV strategy is prominent, the PESR and CDER is advanced 5.81% and 1.48% respectively by the IGV strategy.

AB Chemical-looping gasification (CLG) is a promising way for syngas production as the integration of chemical looping and gasification technology, which can avoid air separation with a high hydrogen extent in syngas. In this work, the multi-fluid model with chemical kinetics is employed to simulate the CLG performance in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor using char as solid fuels. The distributions of gas compositions and temperatures are predicted. The interactive mechanic between oxygen carrier and solid fuels is analyzed. In addition, the impacts of operating parameters on mixing behaviors of particles and gas products during the CLG process are evaluated. The results demonstrate that the decrease of operating velocity and oxygen carrier particle size will reduce the syngas production. An increase of oxygen carrier size weakens the mixing degree of the binary mixture, whereas increasing the gas inlet velocity can restrict the segregation of the binary mixture.

AB This paper presents a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy integrated with a reverse osmosis desalination plant to provide fresh water for a residential community. The hybrid energy system comprises a photovoltaic module and wind turbine as the main source of energy, and battery storage systems or hydrogen storage systems are used as an energy storage system, while a diesel generator is used as a backup energy source. A new multiobjective hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization - Grey Wolf Optimizer (PSO-GWO) optimization method is used to obtain the optimal size of the different system components to minimize both the total cost of fresh water production and, at the same time, CO2 emissions, for a period of 20 years. Moreover, a comparison is done between the PSO-GWO optimization method and the use of PSO alone and the use of GWO alone. The solar radiation, temperature and wind speed of the residential community are measured using the weather station system. A comparison between different hybrid system configurations using three different optimization methods is presented. The complete model for energy management strategies and the optimization models for this study are programmed using MATLAB software. The results show that the proposed PSO-GWO hybrid performs better at determining the optimization parameters than either of the same optimization methods used in isolation. The optimization results indicate that a battery storage system is more economical than a hydrogen storage system. Further reduction in cost can be achieved by incorporating a diesel generator into the hybrid system. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed to show how varying certain parameters affects total investment cost. Such analyses have shown that the variation in annual solar irradiance has a greater impact on the total investment cost than wind speed variation.

AB The Linear Joule Engine Generator is an energy conversion system made up from a linear expander, a linear compressor, and a linear alternator. It is adaptable to variable renewable energy fuel sources, e.g. biogases, biofuels, hydrogen and ammonia, etc. In this paper, an investigation on the system dynamics and thermodynamic characteristics under different operating conditions is presented. Real time adjustable parameters were identified, i.e. the system pressure, the valve timings, and the coefficient of electric resistance force. Their influence on the indicated power of the expander, the electric power output from the linear alternator and the energy conversion efficiency are scrutinised using a validated numerical model. In order to achieve stable operation of the system, each parameter is controlled within a practical range, and optimised to maximise the electricity generation efficiency. The system pressure was proved to be the most effective parameter to alter the system power output. The indicated power of the expander with the existing dimensions can reach up to 11.0 kW by adjusting the system pressure, and it cannot exceed 8.0 kW by just tuning valve timings or optimising the coefficient of electric resistance force. The coefficient of electric resistance force is found to be the most influential parameter to maximise the electricity generation efficiency up to 80%.

AB The goals of this study were to develop and to evaluate wind turbine siting scenarios for achieving a share of about 40% (250 TWh/yr) wind energy in Germany's gross electricity consumption. The scenarios were developed to quantify the influence of (1) available technology and repowering, (2) resource distribution, and (3) siting strategy on five siting suitability measures: (1) number of wind turbines, (2) cumulative installed capacity, (3) capacity factor, (4) main investment costs, and (5) distribution of wind turbines. The wind field in the analyzed hub height range was modeled by the wind speed-wind shear model on a 200 m x 200 m grid. Geographically restricted areas were considered as not suitable under all scenarios. For a better comparison of the scenarios, a novel wind turbine siting index was introduced by normalizing the suitability measures. It was found that an installed capacity of less than 100 GW and about 36,000 wind turbines are sufficient to generate 250 TWh/yr wind energy. If the current rate of wind energy expansion in Germany is maintained, this value can be achieved in the early 2030s. The results also demonstrate that inefficient wind turbine siting considerably extends the period and increases the number of required wind turbines. Against this background, the results of this study can be applied for a better coordination of wind turbine siting in Germany at different administrative levels. The methodology is portable to other countries and can be used to develop national siting strategies to achieve projected wind energy shares in the electricity mix.

AB Performance of a passively cooled thermoelectric generator (TEG) under different operating conditions is experimentally investigated in this study. The effect of input heat rate in addition to the influence of utilizing various passive heat dissipation techniques on the TEG performance are analyzed and demonstrated. The temperature of the TEG sides, power output, conversion efficiency and the response time (i.e., the time required to reach steady state operation) are accounted as a denotation to the characteristics of the TEG performance. Free convection (FC), passive water cooling (PWC) and vapor phase change cooling (VPC) are employed for heat dissipation from the TEG through the cold side. Also, the effect of utilizing finned heat sink (fins) and the effect of filling ratio (i.e., in case of utilizing PWC and VPC) on the performance of the employed heat dissipation techniques are explored. From the experimental results, it can be deduced that increasing the input heat rate and utilizing fins to aid heat dissipation have enhanced the TEG performance and provided higher power output for all other operating conditions studied. VPC aided by fins showed the best performance compared to other techniques exploited. Additionally, the results illustrated that in case of employing PWC and VPC, it is necessary to use an optimal filling ratio for the working fluid utilized in order to achieve the best performance. The experimental data obtained are compared with the data available by the TEG module manufacturer and excellent agreement is obtained.

AB Model predictive control has proved to be a promising control strategy for improving the operational performance of multi-source thermal energy generation systems with the aim of maximising the exploitation of on-site renewable resources. This paper presents the formulation and implementation of a model predictive control strategy for the management of a latent heat thermal energy storage unit coupled with a solar thermal collector and a backup electric heater. The system uses an innovative Phase Change Material slurry for both the heat transfer fluid and storage media. The formulation of a model predictive controller of such a closed-loop solar system is particularly desirable but also challenging mainly due to the nonlinearity of the heat exchange and thermal storage processes involved. A solution for the model predictive control problem to regulate a system with intrinsic nonlinearities is introduced using a mixed logic-dynamical approach. The model predictive control regulation is tested and compared with a baseline rule-based controller considering both ideal and estimated disturbance predictions. Results demonstrate the capability of the predictive controller in anticipating future disturbances and in optimising the utilisation of the more efficient energy sources. When compared to the rule-based controller, the model predictive control algorithm leads to reductions of the system primary energy demand ranging from 19.2% to 31.8% as a function of the variation of a soft constraint on meeting demand constraints. The work contributes to new knowledge on how model predictive control algorithms can be implemented to maximise the benefits of integrating thermal energy storages that employ latent heat of fusion with solar thermal technologies.

AB A coupling system composed of a high temperature fuel cell such as a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), a regenerator, and a thermoradiative cell (TRC) is established. The efficiency and power output of the coupling system are analytically derived. The performances of the system are evaluated. The optimum operation states of the system are determined. The optimal selection criteria of some key parameters are provided. It is found that when the MCFC is operated at the temperature of 923 K and the band gap of the TRC equals 0.2 eV, the maximum power output density (MPOD) of the coupling system is approximately 2.020 times of that of a single MCFC and the corresponding efficiency of the coupling system is approximately 1.304 times of that of the MCFC. The percentage improvements of the MPODs of the coupling system and other MCFC-based coupling systems in the existing literatures are compared. The results show that the MCFC-TRC coupling system can exhibit better performance and make use of the waste heat released by the MCFC more effectively in comparison with other MCFC-based coupling systems. Moreover, it is expounded that the TRC is an efficient device which can recycle and utilize the waste heat produced by other high temperature fuel cells such as solid oxide fuel cells and direct carbon fuel cells.

AB Solar adsorption refrigeration has many advantages. However, solar radiation has a relatively low energy density and requires much time to heat an adsorbent bed. In addition, the coefficient of performance (COP) of an adsorption refrigeration system is relatively low. In this paper, a new solar adsorption refrigeration prototype, which uses a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) adsorbent bed with activated carbon-methanol as the working pair, was proposed and built to shorten the cycle time and improve performance. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare its performance and characteristics to those of a conventional solar adsorption refrigeration system. The experimental results show that the speed of the temperature increase of the adsorbent bed was boosted by employing CPC collectors. Compared with a conventional refrigeration system, the desorption period of the new system was reduced by one-third over one cycle. The desorption rate of the adsorption refrigeration cycle was notably improved. By using the CPC collector in a solar adsorption refrigeration system, the COP increased by 27%. The experimental results also show that applying solar concentrating technology in adsorption refrigeration is a promising approach for improving solar adsorption refrigeration performance and achieving a fast and continuous refrigeration cycle.

AB This paper reports on the development of a new type of heat exchanger with bimetal fins for controlling the calorific value of water through phase change material (PCM) heat storage. It presents detailed numerical and experimental data on the velocity and temperature of water flow in a channel equipped with bimetal fins on the wall. Computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry are used to analyze the flow behavior around the bimetal fins. The bimetal fins increase the insulation performance at the wall, such that the heat loss rate is decreases by a maximum of 56%. Furthermore, the flow rate and calorific value can be controlled at 10 L/min and 50 kJ, respectively. Consequently, the discharging-time during which hot water can be generated increases by a maximum of 70 min.

AB The planning and operation of multi-generation units needs to be properly addressed, to guarantee a correct assessment of their performance with respect to standard energy generation units. Performance indicators are defined to compare energy conversion units, and in presence of multiple outputs an allocation methodology is required. There is currently no single method to allocate input resources and impacts in cogeneration and multigeneration systems, as the number of aspects that are involved leads to different approaches. Each method provides specific advantages related to the target for which it has been defined, but attention must be paid on the entire range of boundary conditions that could affect the results. This paper evaluates the current methodologies for allocation factors calculation in Combined Heat and Power plants, to present an indication of the strengths and the limits of each approach. The methods are applied to multiple case studies, by considering the operation data from existing natural gas plants of different size, technology and conversion efficiency. The use of real data allows to consider actual situations in which the choice of the method could lead to different indications. The results show the significant variability of the allocation factors, the main drivers being the choice of the methodology itself, the conversion technology and the reference efficiency values that are set for separate production of heat and power. A discussion is proposed on the importance of defining proper methods and reference parameters, with particular attention to the applications for which the allocation factors need to be calculated and the potential effects on energy policies and regulations.

AB This review focuses on the thermal-hydraulic performance correlations for the air-side of compact and micro channel heat exchangers. These correlations are presented in tables, mainly in terms of Colburn j-factor and fanning friction factor (f), based on each type of fin arrangements with appropriate constraints including Reynolds number ranges, geometrical parameter limits, and fitting uncertainties. The correlations used for air side arrangements of mini/micro channels, which are constructed in slabs, are the same as those used for the compact heat exchangers. In particular, these correlations are used for louver-fin, wavy-fin, offset strip-fin, and extended surfaces (plain fins and pin fins) arrangements. However, the correlations proposed for fin-and-tube (round) are only valid for the compact heat exchangers. We have also compared some correlations with the experimental data of Kays and London standard reference. Some performance correlations are generalized (as one correlation for each j- and f-factor) to represent all louver-fin types. However, other fin arrangements have distinct correlations based on their specific geometry. The most reported correlations are valid for dry fin conditions, whereas there are limited correlations devoted to wet or frost surfaces. A guideline based on this study is provided to facilitate the use of correlations for various configurations.

AB A spectral splitting photovoltaic-methane-steam-reforming hybrid system for heat and power cogeneration has been proposed. In the system, sunlight with wavelengths shorter than 870 nm is assigned to photovoltaic cells for direct power and heat cogeneration, while the rest of the solar spectrum is utilized by a methane-steam-reforming reactor via the route of solar thermal energy - chemical energy - heat and power. Analysis reveals that the hybrid system is characterized by high net solar-to-exergy efficiency (40%), high energy storage capability and low-emission energy supply (63% fossil energy saving and 77% carbon-dioxide emission reduction). Primary reasons underlying the excellent performance are full-spectrum optimized utilization of solar energy and comprehensive utilization among solar energy, thermal energy and chemical energy.

AB In order to recover diesel engine exhaust gas waste heat, a new configuration consisting of screw expander based Partial Evaporation Rankine Cycle (PERC) combined with Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power system is proposed and its performance is investigated from thermo-economic viewpoint. In studied system, a heat exchanger preparing domestic hot water is considered to recover the residual waste heat after PERC evaporator and thermo-economic performance of the system is investigated for 6 various organic fluids in ORC. Also, parametric analysis is performed to assess the effects of PERC evaporation temperature, PERC expander inlet steam quality and ORC condensation temperature on system performance. Finally, multi objective optimization is used to find the favorable performance point of system. LNG and PERC systems have a proper operation respectively from energy and exergoeconomic viewpoints. Also, ORC condenser has the highest total cost rate. System optimization results show that using isopentane fluid leads to the highest net power output and total cost rate respectively equal to 178.6 kW and 19.3 $/h and using toluene fluid leads to the lowest net power output and total cost rate that are respectively equal to 154.7 kw and 17.36 $/h.

AB As the requirements for green and industrial production of biodiesel increase, recyclable mesoporous spherical catalysts need to be developed. To achieve this, La2O3/NaY spherical particle (3-5 mm) heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by a granulating machine for the production of castor oil biodiesel. The effects of calcination temperature on catalytic activity and crushing strength were investigated. The structure, composition and morphology of the La2O3/NaY were characterized by SEM-EDS, XRD and BET analyses. The effects of calcination temperature, catalyst concentration, ethanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and time on the yield of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) were optimized by single-factor analysis. The addition of surfactant has a positive effect on the La2O3 dispersion and pore size of zeolite NaY. The synthesized catalyst shows excellent reusability and crushing strength which are essential for industrial practices. Under the optimization conditions of catalyst concentration 10 wt%, molar ratio of ethanol to oil 15:1, reaction temperature 70 degrees C for 50 min, the FAEE yield of 84.6% was obtained.

AB To provide guidance for the optimized selection of one- and two-stage ejectors, the efficiencies of these two ejectors are compared under design and off-design conditions based on a verified mathematic model. Under design condition, the one-stage ejector presents a higher efficiency at low compression ratios but the two-stage ejector is superior at high compression ratios. The superiority of the two-stage ejector is more obvious at low expansion ratios and at higher compression ratio value, due to lesser mixing loss and more boosting loss in the mixing chamber, respectively. The compression ratio of the equivalent entrainment ratio should be defined as the diacritical point between the high and low expansion ratio, whose value is approximately 1.73 for the R141b ejector. The inevitable loss of mechanical energy in the diffuser causes the crossed efficiencies of the one- and two-stage ejectors. Compared with the one-stage ejector, the two-stage ejector possesses more slow change of efficiency under off-design conditions due to a lesser primary vapor passing through the first stage ejector, obtaining the ability to resist the sharp deterioration in efficiency at single chocking mode. For the typical application of ejector refrigeration system with R141b as the working fluid, it would be best to adopt the two-stage ejector.
