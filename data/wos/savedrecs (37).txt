AB Developing an accurate model for photovoltaic solar cell and module represents a challenge to improve the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic systems use. Parameter estimation of photovoltaic solar cell and module circuit model is a crucial task that is commonly transformed into an optimisation issue solved by metaheuristic algorithms. Among these algorithms, the particle swarm optimisation has gained great interest due to its structure simplicity and rapid response. However, its major disadvantage lies in the premature convergence. In an endeavour to deal with this problem, an improved mutated particle swarm optimisation algorithm with adaptive mutation strategy is proposed in this paper. The adaptive mutation is introduced to alleviate the premature convergence problem and ensure a suitable trade-off between the explorative and exploitative capabilities over the search process. The proposed algorithm is used to identify the optimal parameters of different photovoltaic models; single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic module. The performance of the used method is firstly evaluated on measured data reported in the literature. Then, the algorithm is tested based on measured data from the laboratory work and from the data sheet of different modules. Experimental results prove that the used algorithm achieves higher accuracy and provides the lowest root mean square error compared to other previously reported parameter extraction algorithms.

AB The pyrolysis process of thermally small biomass particles was modeled combining the Lumped Capacitance Method (LCM) to describe the transient heat transfer and the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) to account for the chemical kinetics. The inverse exponential temperature increase predicted by the LCM was considered in the mathematical derivation of the DAEM, resulting in an Arrhenius equation valid to describe the evolution of the pyrolysis process under inverse exponential temperature profiles. The Arrhenius equation on which the simple LCM-DAEM model proposed is based was derived for a wide range of pyrolysis reactor temperatures, considering the chemical kinetics data of four lignocellulosic biomass species: pine wood, olive kernel, thistle flower, and corncob. The LCM-DAEM model proposed was validated by comparison to the experimental results of the pyrolysis conversion evolution of biomass samples subjected to various inverse exponential temperature increases in a TGA. To extend the validation, additional biomass samples of Chlorella Vulgaris and sewage sludge were selected due to the different composition of microalgae and sludge compared to lignocellulosic biomass. The deviations obtained between the experimental measurements in TGA and the LCM-DAEM predictions for the evolution of the pyrolysis conversion, regarding the root mean square error of temperature, are below 5 degrees C in all cases. Therefore, the simple LCM-DAEM model proposed can describe-accurately the pyrolysis-process of a thermally small biomass particle, accounting for both the transient heat transfer and the chemical kinetics by solving a simple Arrhenius equation.

AB Semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) system's performance strongly depends on its surface temperature. To provide a mechanism that decrease the temperature of STPV can improve the power generation significantly. This cooling mechanism will be more interesting if it needs no additional energy. In this paper a novel solar chimney system is proposed to cool a STPV system. The STPV is employed as a roof for the solar chimney and an air flow generated by the solar chimney cools the STPV. Based on the energy balance for three main components: STPV, air and ground, a theoretical model is developed for the proposed system. Convection heat transfer coefficients are calculated precisely for the heat transfers taking place in the system and the obtained results for the solar chimney are compared with the existing experimental data in literature. Results of proposed model have a good agreement with the previous data. It's shown that there is an optimum packing factor that maximizes the generated power for each radiation intensity. It is observed that the proposed system effectiveness depends on the radiation intensity as well as on the structural parameters. The proposed system can reduce the average temperature of the STPV up to 15 degrees C. It is concluded that, by cooling the STPV power plant with the solar chimney for a solar radiation of 500 W/m(2), an enhancement of about 29% in power generation is gained.

AB We present a detailed numerical analysis to quantify the power generation performance of a thermoelectric module in radiant heat recovery application. Due to the large temperature difference typically involved in such a system, temperature-dependent material properties of thermoelectric elements are taken into account for accurate performance prediction by employing an iterative algorithm based on the one-dimensional finite element method. Careful analysis on the radiation heat transfer with optical parameters such as surface emissivity and view factor is performed to precisely quantify the heat input to the thermoelectric system. Parasitic heat losses such as air convection loss at the hot surface and conduction through the substrates and gap fillers are also taken into account to analyze their impacts on the power output. A case study on the radiant waste heat recovery from hot steel casting slabs in steel industry is discussed in detail to theoretically estimate the power output performances and optimize the module design. We find that a power density as high as similar to 1.5 kW/m(2) and a system efficiency as high as similar to 4.6% can be achieved at a 2 m distance from the 1200 K hot steel slab using the state-of-the-art Bi2Te3 alloys with a relatively small leg thickness of 3 mm and a 20% fill factor. This optimal design with small form factors ensures a reduced material cost while keeping the power output near the maximum, so that an estimated power cost remains as low as similar to 0.2$/Watt.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the reactivity of intracellular algogenic organic matter (IOM) with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), a key reaction species in advanced oxidation processes. IOM was extracted from two green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Scenedesmus sp., and two blue-green algae, Anabaena sp. and Microcystis aeruginosa using a freeze-thaw method. The second-order rate constants of the extracted IOM with center dot OH were determined as 7.95 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), 6.71 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) (Scenedesmus sp.), 4.02 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) (Anabaena sp.), and 4.45 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) (Microcystis aeruginosa). These rate constants were significantly higher than values reported for dissolved organic matter in various water sources. This implies that IOM formation during algal bloom season could change the center dot OH water matrix demand and adversely affect the performance of advanced oxidation processes. To investigate the physical and chemical composition characteristics of IOM and their relationship to the rate constants determined for the reaction between IOM and center dot OH, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix & parallel factor analysis (FEEM-PAR-AFAC) were used. The IOM mainly consisted of low molecular weight (LMW) matter and protein-related compounds, as evidenced LMW neutrals (38-65%), biopolymers (7-19%), and tryptophan-like compounds (74-94%). Based on the composition characteristics of IOM, it was concluded that the molecular weight and the presence of nitrogen-containing compounds are influential parameters for determining the reactivity of IOM with center dot OH.

AB Two column pairs filled with 3.05-m of a sandy soil from the Upper San Gabriel Valley were operated for a period of four and 1/2 years on municipal effluent from the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant operated by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (LACSD). One column pair was fed filtered, chlorinated effluent (tertiary effluent) for the entire period. The other pair was fed ozonated secondary effluent for 8-mo, ozonated secondary effluent filtered through biological activated carbon (O-3/BAC) for 7-mo and tertiary effluent for 38-mo. Each column pair was operated in series, where the first column was operated for a shorter residence time and the second column for a longer residence time. Residence times tested were 5-d, 28-d, 30-d, 58-d, 60-d, 150-d and 180-d. For the last 38-mo, both pairs of columns had a residence time of 30-d in the first column and the total residence time of the two pairs was 150 and 180-d, respectively. Testing showed both of these pairs had the same long-term performance. The column pairs with a 150 to 180-d residence time, which were both fed tertiary effluent, reached an effluent total organic carbon (TOC) of 1.8 mg/L. Column pairs with a 28 to 30-d residence time, which were fed tertiary, ozonated, and O-3/BAC effluent, reached effluent TOCs of 2.3, 2.1 and 1.8 mg/L respectively. In the latter, some TOC removal was shifted from the soil columns to the BAC. During the last 38 months of testing, using tertiary effluent as the source water, a series of sampling events was performed throughout the soil column system for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). NDMA was substantially reduced in all the columns, with a median value of 3 ng/L after 30-d and <2 ng/L after both 150 and 180-d. Twenty-one CECs were found in the majority of tertiary effluent samples, twelve of which were attenuated by the soil columns and the remaining were not. Chemicals found to be recalcitrant were 4-nonylphenol, acesulfame-k, carbamazepine, lidocaine, primidone, simazine, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole, and TCER Using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) techniques, soluble microbial products (SMP) peak characteristic of effluent organic matter (EfOM) is nearly eliminated after a 30-d hydraulic retention time (HRT) and completely eliminated in the 150/180-d samples. The intensity of the other peaks is significantly reduced as well, resulting in an EEM much like that of natural groundwater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying freshwater systems that are at risk from anthropogenic stressors is a pressing management problem. In particular, the detection of metal pollution is often constrained by data availability and resources. To address this challenge and develop a tool to identify susceptible systems, we tested whether land cover could be predictive of stream sensitivity to metal pollution, as determined by the biotic ligand model (BLM). We used water chemistry data from the conterminous United States to estimate metal sensitivity in streams using two BLMs (i.e., HydoQual, Bio-Met). Subsequently, we combined the sensitivity estimates with land cover and physiochemical data from the GAGES-II database to build predictive models of sensitivity to metals in streams. When combined, our predictor variables (e.g., land cover, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation) generally explained about half of the variation in our dataset. In each model, the percent of wetlands in a watershed was strongly correlated with reduced sensitivity to metals, likely due to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon associated with wetlands. To validate the utility of the models, we used them to predict metal sensitivity in sites where metal concentrations had been collected, but where the full suite of BLM parameters were unknown. We were able to classify several hundred sites which are likely at risk to metal pollution. Our work highlights the value in considering metal toxicity at the landscape-scale and describes a new approach to estimate metal sensitivity when site-specific chemical parameters are unknown.

AB Benzotriazoles (BTs) are regarded as contaminants of emerging concern. However, their transformation products (BTTPs) in aquifers remains poorly characterized. The present study is the first detailed report on profiles of the BTTPs in an urban oxic intergranular aquifer related to water type, land use and the aquifer's depth. The 2-methyl-2H-benzotriazole (2-MeBT) and 2,4-dimethyl-2H-benzotriazole (2,4-dMeBT) were quantified using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analytical technique based on internal standards. For the first time the relationship between the 2-MeBT and 2,4-dMeBT concentrations was studied in sampled water and discussed with respect to the different flow paths and sources of contamination. Three main sources of BTTPs were determined in urban groundwater: BTs and BTTPs included in the outflow of effluents from wastewater-treatment plants and energy producing facilities into surface streams that recharge the aquifer and in the leaking effluents from industrial and public wastewater pipelines. The results confirm that the BTTPs are transformed from parent compounds in the aquifer's unsaturated zone in the case when the effluents are temporally stored in sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity, which is indicated with the highest median concentrations of BTTPs referring to the perched aquifers where the BTTPs proportions were 92-99%. BTTPs dominated over the parent BTs also in groundwater. The highest concentrations of BTTPs (up to 174 and 144 ng L-1 for the 2-MeBT and 2,4-dMeBT ng L-1, respectively) were measured in groundwater abstracted from the upper parts of the aquifer in the area where the losses from industrial wastewater pipelines were evidenced. The 2,4-dMeBT dominated over the 2-MeBT in the BTTPs originating from BTs included in the industrial effluents, which is the opposite to the case when their origin is in the municipal effluents. The median sum concentration of the BTTPs in drinking-water resources (2.0 ng L-1) is lower than the quality criterion recommended for BTs so far. Nevertheless, the abundance of BTs in the environment and the apparent environmental relevance of the BTTPs in urban groundwater indicate the need for a risk assessment of BTTPs with respect to health and the environment.

AB Dissolved oxygen within water column is a key variable to characterize the water quality. Water quality modeling has been extensively developed for decades. However, complex biogeochemical cycles are described using a high number of parameters. Hence, parameters' uncertainty constitutes a major problem in the application of these models. Sensitivity analysis allows the identification of the most influential parameters in a model and a better understanding of the governing processes. This paper presents a time-dependent sensitivity analysis for dissolved oxygen using Morris and Sobol methods combined with a functional principal components analysis for dimension reduction. The aim of this study is to identify the most important parameters of C-RIVE model in different trophic contexts and to understand the biogeochemical functioning of river systems. The results indicate that the maintenance respiration of phytoplankton and the photosynthetic parameters (i.e. photosynthetic capacity, the maximal photosynthesis rate and light extinction coefficients) are the most influential parameters during algal blooms. When the river system becomes heterotrophic, the bacterial activities (moderate and high temperature) and the reaeration coefficients (low temperature) affect the most the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water column. An anthropogenic effect (ship navigation) on variation of dissolved oxygen concentration has been identified and the role of this anthropogenic effect evolves with hydrological and trophic conditions.

AB Biocides are, inter alia, applied as preservatives on facades to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Their incomplete mineralization results in new compounds, so-called transformation products (TPs). Rain causes that both applied biocides and their TPs leach from facades with stormwater into the urban aquatic environment. This study is the first to investigate the introduction of the biocides Diuron, Terbutryn, and Octylisothiazolinone (OIT) and their TPs into the groundwater via urban stormwater infiltration systems. In this study, the TPs of these biocides were created by laboratory photolysis and elucidated using LC-HRMS. The results were then used to analyze TPs by LC-MS/MS in stormwater and groundwater samples, which were taken from an urban swale-trench system and from groundwater wells upgradient and downgradient of the infiltration system. A sprinkling experiment was conducted to evaluate facades as a contamination source. Biodegradation tests were conducted to determine bio-persistence of biocides and their TPs.
   Fourteen TPs were identified under laboratory photolysis. TP-186, TP-210, and TP-256 of Terbutryn were hitherto unknown. Nine TPs were qualitatively detected in environmental water samples. Parent compounds, TP-219 of Diuron and TP-212, TP-214, and TP-226 of Terbutryn were detected at a maximum concentration of 140 ng L-1 during stormwater events. Concentrations in groundwater were considerably below German drinking water limits, but were higher in groundwater samples downgradient from the investigated swale-trench system than in those collected upgradient. Neither the biocides nor most of their TPs were readily biodegradable under simulated surface water conditions. The results show that entry of biocides and their TPs into groundwater is caused by infiltration of urban stormwater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs) are the method of choice for sewage treatment in most arctic communities because they can operate in extreme climate conditions, require a relatively modest investment, are passive and therefore easy and inexpensive to operate and maintain. However, most arctic WSPs are currently limited in their ability to remove carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and ammonia-nitrogen. An arctic WSP differs from a 'southern' WSP in the way it is operated and in the conditions under which it operates. Consequently, existing WSP models cannot be used to gain better understanding of the arctic lagoon performance. This work describes an Arctic-specific WSP model. It accounts for both aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways of organic materials and considers the periodic nature of WSP operation as well as the partial or complete freeze of the water in the WSP during winter. A uniform, multi-layer (ice, aerobic, anaerobic and sludge) approach was taken in the model development, which simplified and expedited numerical solution of the model, enabling efficient model calibration to available field data.

AB This work has investigated the electrocatalytic degradation of malachite green (MG) in aqueous solution with G/beta-PbO2, SS316/beta-PbO2, Ti/beta-PbO2 and Pb/beta-PbO2 electrodes. These electrodes show high oxygen evolution over-potential and excellent electrochemical degradation efficiency for organic pollutants. The optimum conditions for the degradation of MG were obtained by studying the effects of different parameters, such as initial current densities and initial MG concentration. The remaining organic compounds concentrations (color) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency were investigated and compared. The results indicate that the efficiency of G/beta-PbO2 electrode for both color and COD removals is more than those of other electrodes. At the optimum conditions, the color and COD removal efficiencies of MG reached up to 100% and 94%, respectively. The observed degradation rate of MG was found to vary in the order G/beta-PbO2> SS316/beta-PbO2> Ti/beta-PbO2> Pb/beta-PbO2. Moreover, in this paper, the electrochemical behavior and adsorption characteristic of MG in aqueous solutions with different pH values were studied in details at glassy carbon electrode using both constant-current coulometry and cyclic voltammetry techniques. This study has led to the proposed mechanism for the oxidation pathway of MG and determine the absorption properties of MG in acidic, neutral and basic solutions. We also proposed the mineralization pathway of MG at beta-PbO2 electrode. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Toxicity arising from toxic disinfection byproducts is an unintended result of disinfection during water reclamation. To ensure safe water reclamation treatment, it is important to develop a disinfection strategy with minimal formation of overall toxicity in the reclaimed water. The cumulative disinfectant concentration over time (Ct) is a useful concept for pathogen control during reuse water disinfection. We evaluated the toxicity impact of Ct values and different methods to achieve identical Ct values by ozonation or chlorination of wastewaters from four agricultural sources on mammalian cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reactivity of the wastewater organic extracts was determined to reveal their impact on the thiol-specific biological detoxification mechanism. The results demonstrated that for two sources and for both ozonation and chlorination, higher Ct values enhanced cytotoxicity. The ozonated waters were at least 10% less toxic and as much as 22.4 times less toxic than either the non-disinfected controls or the chlorinated waters. Chlorination consistently induced higher cytotoxicity than ozonation by between 2.2 and 22.4 fold, respectively, and induced similar or higher cytotoxicity than the non-disinfected controls, by at most 4.4 fold. Given the same Ct values, the combination of high disinfectant concentration and short contact time produced finished wastewaters with higher toxicity, than the combination of low disinfectant concentration and long contact time. NAC thiol reactivity was positively and significantly correlated with mammalian cell cytotoxicity, and agreed with 80% of the cytotoxicity rank order. This suggests that the induction of cytotoxicity involved reactions with agents that acted as thiol pool quenchers. The overall results indicate that the cytotoxicity of wastewaters may increase when higher Ct values are applied to inactivate recalcitrant pathogens. To counteract the potential increase in cytotoxicity at high Ct values, for both ozonation and chlorination, lower disinfectant dose and longer contact time may be adopted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The endogenous release of nutrients from marine or lacustrine sediment is an important factor in water eutrophication. Overlying water dynamic actions (waves) may lead to sediment resuspension and even sediment liquefaction, especially under strong wind-induced waves, which may subsequently lead to the release of nutrients from sediments and contribution to water eutrophication. A wave flume simulator was used to study changes in the phosphorus concentrations in the overlying water at different consolidation stages, the key factors of which were the changes caused by endogenous release from a liquefied seabed. The results showed that the total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) found in the liquefaction stage were 59, 25 and 31 times greater, respectively, than those in the consolidation stage, and 5, 19, and 21 times greater, respectively, than those in the non-liquefaction stage. These results indicated that seabed liquefaction may lead to greater phosphorus releases from liquefied sediments into overlying water, which may subsequently contribute to water eutrophication.

AB Production of bacterial lipid-based biofuels using inexpensive substrates, as wastes, is an emerging approach. In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry weight (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% +/- 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% +/- 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L-1 and 0.02 g N L-1). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely mono-acylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic acid (C14:0) to linoleic acid (C18:2), being the most abundant palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities. This approach can decrease the costs associated to both processes and contribute to a more sustainable waste management and production of lipid-based biofuels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The shores of the Pearl River estuary are home to 35 million people. Their wastes are discharged into the large river delta-front estuary (LDE), one of the most highly polluted systems in the world. Here we construct a radium reactive transport model to estimate the terrestrial groundwater discharge (TGD) into the highly urbanized Pearl River LDE. We find the TGD comprises only approximately 0.9% in term of water discharge compared to the river discharge. The TGD in the Pearl River LDE delivers significant chemical fluxes to the coast, which are comparable to the fluvial loadings from Pearl River and other world major rivers. Of particular importance is the flux of ammonium because of its considerable role in Pearl River estuary eutrophication and hypoxia. Unlike the ammonium in many other aquifers, the ammonium in the Pearl River aquifer system is natural and originated from organic matter remineralization by sulfate reduction in the extremely reducing environment. The TGD derived NH4+ is as much as 5% of the upstream Pearl River fluvial loading and 42% of the anthropogenic inputs. This high groundwater NH4+ flux may greatly intensify the eutrophication, shift the trophic states, and lead to alarming hypoxia within the affected ecosystems in the Pearl River LDE. The large TGD derived chemical fluxes will lead to deterioration of water and will potentially affect human health. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P-nitrophenol (PNP) is a toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutant and a usual intermediate in the production of fine chemicals, which has posed a significant threat to subsurface environment safety. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a promising method to remove and remediate contamination in vadose zone with low cost and high efficiency. However, there are still research gaps for the treatment of recalcitrant contaminants by SAT in cold regions, such as un-robust indigenous microbes and low temperature constraint in vadose zone. The bioaugmentation technology was first introduced into SAT in order to enhance the removal ability of PNP by SAT operated in cold regions in this study. A high-efficiency PNP-degrading bacterium was successfully isolated, which can efficiently degrade PNP below 200 mg L-1 with a degradation rate above 99% at 15 degrees C close to the real subsurface temperature in cold regions, and added into SAT for bioaugmentation. The feasibility of bioaugmented SAT and associated PNP removal process were investigated by laboratory sand columns, along with effects of the SAT operative parameters (namely PNP loading concentration, flow rate and soil saturation level of SAT). Within the range of PNP loading stresses tested (1-200 mg L-1), PNP removal efficiency was optimal at constant flow rate of 219 mL d(-1) in unsaturated operating condition of SAT under 15 degrees C among all the investigated experimental conditions. Longer hydraulic residence time increased the PNP removal rate, although the accumulated mass removed reduced and the removal efficiencies remained constant in unsaturated operating condition of SAT. It is found from the comparison between the PNP removals via both unsaturated and saturated columns that slight difference only in the removal rate of PNP was observed and the highly efficient bioaugmented SAT can completely degrade PNP of 10 mg L-1 within 5 wetting/drying cycles under both scenarios.

AB Substantial variability in sorption capacity of black carbon (BC) has been a major challenge for accurate fate and risk assessment of organic pollutants in soils and sediments. 16 model organic sorbates (log-K-ow = 038-4.21) encompassing diverse chemical functionalities were used to probe the sorption capacity of two diesel soot samples representative of graphitic BC (BC1, specific surface area (SSA) = 87 m(2)/g) and amorphous, oxygenated BC (BC2; SSA = 3.6 m(2)/g). The BC-water sorption coefficients (logK(Bc)) of the model sorbates were determined using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) on soot-filled columns. It was found that mass-based logK(Bc's) of BC1 (1.64-3.66 L/kg(Bc)) exceeded those of BC2 (0.68 -3.48 L/kg(Bc)) consistently for all model sorbates. However, area -normalized logK(Bc's) of BC2 were larger than those of BC1, suggesting that the overall sorption was more favored on the oxygenated sorbent per area basis. Linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs) for sorption onto BC1 and BC2 were found to be logK(Bc) = (2.49 +/- 0.65)E + (-2.71 +/- 0.88)S + (1.17 +/- 0.46)A + (2.52 +/- 0.34)V and logK(BC) = (1.12 +/- 039) E + (-1.68 +/- 0.32)S + (-3.70 +/- 0.57)B + (4.37 +/- 038)V + (-1.51 +/- 0.22), respectively. The LSERs indicated that sorption onto soot was generally enhanced with increasing non-specific van der Waals and decreasing cavitation cost (i.e., eE, sS, and vV terms). The logK(BC) difference between BC1 and BC2, Delta logK(Bc), appeared to be correlated with the H-bonding capacity of the sorbates but not logK(ow). Analysis of literature and experimental logK(Bc)'s revealed that logK(BC) and logSSA across different types of BC (i.e., soot, char, charcoal, activated carbon) were linearly correlated for benzene and toluene (r(2) = 0.88-0.91). This work illustrates the utility of RP-LC in determining the sorption coefficients of high-capacity sorbents and suggests the possibility of a unified sorption model for the continuum of black carbon.

AB Extensive contamination of aquatic ecosystems with mercury (Hg) has led to a growing interest in developing in situ management strategies to repress Hg bioaccumulation in aquatic biota in reservoirs. This study used experimental chamber incubations to assess the impact of three potential treatments, oxygen addition, nitrate addition and aluminum addition, to reduce the flux of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) from profundal reservoir sediment. The study sites, Almaden Lake and Guadalupe Reservoir, are located downstream of the historic New Almaden mining district in Santa Clara Valley, California, USA. In the first experiment (experiment 1), replicate chambers from both sites were incubated sequentially under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. At both sites, mean anaerobic fluxes of MeHg were higher than aerobic fluxes (Almaden: 11.0 vs. -2.3 ng/m(2).d; Guadalupe: 223 vs 5.5 ng/m(2).d), and anaerobic MeHg fluxes correlated with rates of sediment sulfate uptake, highlighting the linkage between MeHg production and microbial sulfate reduction. Under aerobic conditions, sediment from Guadalupe Reservoir released Hg(II), iron and sulfate, suggesting the oxidative dissolution of Hg-bearing sulfide minerals. A follow-up study at Almaden Lake (experiment 2) found that mean MeHg fluxes under aerobic conditions (5 ng/m(2).d) and anoxic (nitrate -rich) conditions (1.7 ng/m(2).d were lower than anaerobic conditions (174 ng/m(2).(d)), but aluminum addition had little effect (105 ng/m(2).d) on MeHg flux. In both anaerobic and aluminum treated chambers, MeHg flux turned negative during the second half of the incubation, suggesting that highly reduced, sulfidic conditions lowered net methylation, possibly by enhancing demethylation or repressing Hg(II) bioavailability for methylation.

AB On-site biological hand washing water treatment can improve global access to safe hand washing water, but requires a thorough understanding of the chemical composition of the water to be treated, and an effective treatment strategy. This study first presents a detailed characterization of the individual inputs to hand washing water. We demonstrate (i) that soap is likely the most significant input in hand washing water, representing similar to 90% of mass loading, and (ii) that inputs to hand washing water have low concentrations of biologically-essential macro- and micro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, zinc, molybdenum and cobalt) with respect to carbon, which may impair biological carbon removal. This study next formulates a recipe that recreates a representative composition of hand washing water and develops a procedure to identify and supplement nutrients in which this recipe is estimated to be deficient. Batch testing of the nutrient-supplemented hand washing water with an inoculum of planktonic bacteria demonstrated improved assimilable organic carbon removal (99% vs. 86% removal) and produced lower final dissolved organic carbon concentrations (1.7 mg(c)/L vs. 3.5 mg(c)/L) compared to realistic (nutrient-deficient) washing water. Supplementing nutrients did promote cell growth (50x higher final total cell count). Full-scale testing in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi) system treating 75 L/day of nutrient -supplemented hand washing water showed that long-term operation (100 days) can deliver effective carbon removal (95%) without detrimental fouling or other disruptions caused by cell growth. This work demonstrates that biological treatment in a BAMBi system, operated with appropriate nutrient-balancing offers an effective solution for decentralized treatment of light greywater.

AB A novel MO-SBSPR (Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic/Sequencing Batch Sidestream Phosphorus Recovery) process was developed for phosphorus (P) recovery and nutrient removal from municipal wastewater. Meanwhile, an operational strategy based on the P mass balance for the process was proposed, where P recovery rate was coupled with sludge retention time (SRT) so as to reduce the impact of P recovery on P content in activated sludge and maintain a stable operation of the process. The results show that the proposed operational strategy is helpful for the stable operation of the AAO-SBSPR process and up to 65% of the influent P was recovered with the phosphate removal efficiency of 99.1%. Both P recovery and extended SRT had limited influence on the P release and uptake rates of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). The results of high-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the relative abundance of Accumulibacter increased while SRT was extended under high P recovery rate. Moreover, significant promotion of simultaneous nitrogen removal and P uptake was observed, where the ratio of anoxic P uptake to the total P uptake of the whole process increased from 41.7% in the AAO process to 77.5% in the AAO-SBSPR process, combined with the increase of total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency from 71.9% to 80.4%. The P recovery process is also beneficial for the reduction of sludge production and nitrification process as SRT was extended for high P recovery rate. Overall, the AAO-SBSPR process together with the operational strategy proposed in this study provides a promising and practical alternative for P recovery from municipal wastewater.

AB Some pharmaceutical conjugates can be excreted into wastewaters at levels rivalling those of the parent compounds; however, little is known about this potential reservoir of pharmaceuticals to aquatic systems. We evaluated the occurrence and distribution of four different classes of pharmaceuticals and their metabolite conjugates in a wastewater treatment plant over four months. Aqueous and suspended solids fractions of primary, mixed liquor, secondary, and final effluent, along with return activated sludge, and waste activated sludge were assessed. The only conjugate not found in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate. Moreover, thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were the only compounds quantified in the suspended solids in the final effluent. Propranolol, propranolol sulfate, thyroxine, and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration going through the wastewater treatment process, from primary to final effluent. However, there were significant decreases observed for acetaminophen (99.8%), sulfamethoxazole (71%), N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (59%), and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide (79%). The mean (+/- SEM) mass loadings in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound ranged from 0.84 +/- 0.2 g/d for thyroxine to 45.3 +/- 4.2 g/d for acetaminophen. At least as much conjugate was released into receiving waters, if not more: 1.6 +/- 0.2 gicl for thyroxine glucuronide to 18.5 +/- 4.5 g/d for sulfamethoxazole glucuronide, and 61.2 +/- 9.6 g/d for N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, the mean loading of thyroxine was 0.29 +/- 0.025 g/day and thyroxine glucuronide 1.8 +/- 0.59 g/day in the suspended solids. This equates to 26% of total thyroxine and 53% of total thyroxine glucuronide associated with suspended particulate matter that reaches receiving waters. This study reflects the importance of including phase Il conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters, and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg/L to mu g/L range.

AB Osteopontin (OPN) is a significant component of kidney stone matrix and a key modulator of stone formation. Here, we investigated the effects of different phosphorylated states of a synthesized peptide of OPN (the ASARM peptide; acidic, serine- and aspartate-rich motif) on calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) crystals, a major mineral phase of kidney stones. In vitro, phosphorylated OPN-ASARM peptides strongly inhibited COD crystal growth in solution as compared to the nonphosphorylated state, with increasing inhibitory potency correlating with the degree of peptide phosphorylation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the inhibition from the phosphopeptides resulted in distinctive, rosette-like crystal aggregates called spherulites. The OPN-ASARM peptides preferentially bound and specifically inhibited the {1 1 0} crystallographic faces of COD, as identified by combining atomic force microscopy and computational simulation approaches. These {1 1 0} surfaces of COD have high lattice calcium occupancy (exposure), providing preferential binding sites for the highly acidic peptides; binding and inhibition by OPN-ASARM peptides at the {1 10} faces led to crystal aggregation and intergrowth. The crystal spherulite formations obtained in vitro when using the most phosphorylated form of OPN-ASARM peptide at a high concentration, resembled crystal morphologies observed in vivo in a rat model of urolithiasis, in which crystal deposits in the kidney contain abundant OPN as revealed by immunogold labeling. A mechanistic model for spherulite formation is proposed based on the symmetry and crystallographic structure of COD, where the phosphate groups of OPN-ASARM bind to calcium atoms at [1 1 1] step risers on the COD {1 1 0} surface, inducing the periodic emergence of new COD crystals to form spherulites.

AB Saposins are accessory proteins that aid in the degradation of sphingolipids by hydrolytic enzymes. Their structure usually comprises four alpha-helices arranged in various conformations including an open, V-shaped form that is generally associated with the ability to interact with membranes and/or enzymes to accentuate activity. Saposin D is required by the lysosomal hydrolase, acid ceramidase, which breaks down ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid, to display optimal activity. The structure of saposin D was previously determined in an inactive conformation, revealing a monomeric, closed and compact form. Here, we present the crystal structure of the open, V-shaped form of saposin D. The overall shape is similar to the open conformation found in other saposins with slight differences in the angles between the a-helices. The structure forms a dimer that serves to stabilize the hydrophobic surface exposed in the open form, which results in an internal, hydrophobic cavity that could be used to carry extracted membrane lipids.

AB Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a causative agent of pharyngeal and dermal infections in humans. A major virulence determinant of GAS is its dimeric signature fibrillar M-protein (M-Prt), which is evolutionarily designed in modules, ranging from a hypervariable extracellular N-terminal region to a progressively more highly conserved C-terminus that is covalently anchored to the cell wall. Of the > 250 GAS isolates classified, only the subset of skin-trophic Pattern D strains expresses a specific serotype of M-Prt, PAM, that directly binds to host human plasminogen (hPg) via its extracellular NH2-terminal variable A-domain region. This interaction allows these GAS strains to accumulate components of the host fibrinolytic system on their surfaces to serve extracellular functions. While structure-function studies have been accomplished on M-Prts from Pattern A-C GAS isolates with different direct ligand binding properties compared to PAM, much less is known regarding the structure-function relationships of PAM-type M-Prts, particularly their dimerization determinants. To examine these questions, PAMs from seven GAS strains with sequence variations in the NH2-terminal ligand binding domains, as well as truncated versions of PAM, were designed and studied. The results from bioinformatic and biophysical analyses show that the different domains of PAM are disparately engaged in dimerization. From these data, we propose an experimentally-based model for PAM secondary and quaternary structures that is highly dependent on the conserved helical C-terminal C-D-domains. In addition, while the N-terminal regions of PAMs are variable in sequence, the binding properties of hPg and its activated product, plasmin, to the A domain, remain intact.

AB Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle analysis enables determination of near-atomic resolution structures of biological molecules. However, large computational requirements limit throughput and rapid testing of new image processing tools. We developed PRIME, an algorithm part of the SIMPLE software suite, for determination of the relative 3D orientations of single-particle projection images. PRIME has primarily found use for generation of an initial ab initio 3D reconstruction. Here we show that the strategy behind PRIME, iterative estimation of per-particle orientation distributions with stochastic hill climbing, provides a competitive approach to near-atomic resolution single-particle 3D reconstruction. A number of mathematical techniques for accelerating the convergence rate are introduced, leading to a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude. We benchmarked our developments on numerous publicly available data sets and conclude that near-atomic resolution ab initio 3D reconstructions can be obtained with SIMPLE in a matter of hours, using standard over-the-counter CPU workstations.

AB Protein-DNA interactions are highly dependent on salt concentration. To gain insight into how such interactions are maintained in the highly saline cytoplasm of halophilic archaea, we determined the 3-D structure of VNG0258H/RosR, the first haloarchaeal DNA-binding protein from the extreme halophilic archaeon Halobactrium salinarum. It is a dimeric winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) protein with unique features due to adaptation to the halophilic environment. As ions are major players in DNA binding processes, particularly in halophilic environments, we investigated the solution structure of the ionic envelope and located anions in the first shell around the protein in the crystal using anomalous scattering. Anions that were found to be tightly bound to residues in the positively charged DNA-binding site would probably be released upon DNA binding and will thus make significant contribution to the driving force of the binding process. Unexpectedly, ions were also found in a buried internal cavity connected to the external medium by a tunnel. Our structure lays a solid groundwork for future structural, computational and biochemical studies on complexes of the protein with cognate DNA sequences, with implications to protein-DNA interactions in hyper-saline environments.

AB Two crystal structures of a transmembrane helix-lacking FtsH construct from Aquifex aeolicus have been determined at 2.9 angstrom and 3.3 angstrom resolution in space groups R32 and P312, respectively. Both structures are virtually identical despite different crystal packing contacts. In both structures, the FtsH hexamer is created from two different subunits of the asymmetric unit by the threefold symmetry of the crystals. Similar to other published structures, all subunits are loaded with ADP and the two subunit in the asymmetric unit resemble the already known open and closed conformations. Within the ATPase cycle while the whole subunit switches from the opened to the closed state, pore loop-1 interacts with the substrate and translocates it into the proteolytic chamber. Unique to our models is a presumably inactive conformation of the pore loop which allows the closed conformation to switch back to the opened state without pushing the substrate out again. Our structures give further insights on how this new pore loop conformation is induced and how it is linked to the intersubunit signalling network.

AB Keratin-associated protein 8.1 (KAP8.1) is a hair protein whose structure, biochemical roles, and protein distribution patterns have not been well characterized. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody against human KAP8.1 to analyze the protein's roles and distribution in the human hair shaft. Using this antibody, we revealed that KAP8.1 was predominantly expressed in discrete regions of the keratinizing zone of the hair shaft cortex. The protein expression patterns paralleled the distribution of KAP8.1 mRNA and suggested that KAP8.1 plays a role associated with cells to control hair curvature. Cross-reactivity among species and epitope analysis indicated that the monoclonal antibody recognized a linear epitope shared among human, mouse, and sheep KAP8.1. The antibody failed to interact with sheep KAP8.1 in native conformation, suggesting that structural features of KAP8.1 vary among species.

AB The subtle internal communications through an intricate network of interactions play a key role in metal-binding and release in periplasmic metal uptake proteins of cluster A-I family, a component of ABC transport system. These proteins have evolved different mechanisms of metal-binding and release through sequence and thereby structure-function divergence. The CLas-ZnuA2 from Candidates Liberibacter asiaticus (CIA), in previous studies, showed a lower metal-binding affinity. The subtle communications within and between domains from crystal structure analysis revealed that protein seems to prefer a metal-free state. The unique features of CLas-ZnuA2 included a highly restrained loop L3 and presence of a proline in linker helix. In present work, S38A and Y68F mutants were studied as they play an important role during metal-binding in CLas-ZnuA2. The mutations in linker helix could not be studied as the expressed protein was not soluble and in most cases degraded with time. The crystal structure analysis of (S38A and Y68F) mutants in metal-free and metal-bound forms showed variations in interactions, an increase in number of alternate conformations and distortions in secondary structure elements, despite a similar overall structure, suggesting alterations in internal communications. The results suggested that any change in critical residues could alter the subtle internal communications and result in disturbing the fine-tuned structure required for optimal functioning.

AB In COPII mediated vesicle formation, Sec13/Sec31 heterotetramers play a role in organizing the membranes into a spherical vesicle. There they oligomerize into a cage that interacts with the other COPII proteins to direct vesicle formation and concentrate cargo into a bud. In this role they must be flexible to accommodate different sizes and shapes of cargo, but also have elements that provide rigidity to help deform the membrane. Here we characterize the influence the C-terminal disordered region of Sec31 has on cage flexibility and rigidity. After deleting this region (residues 820-1220), we characterized Sec13/Sec31 Delta C heterotetramers biophysically and structurally through cryo-EM. Our results show that Sec13/31 Delta C self-assembles into canonical cuboctahedral cages in vitro at buffer conditions similar to wild type. The distribution of cage sizes indicated that unlike the wild type, Sec13/31 Delta C cages have a more homogeneous geometry. However, the structure of cuboctahedrons exhibited more conformational heterogeneity than wild type. Through localized reconstruction of cage vertices and molecular dynamics flexible fitting we found a new hinge for the flexing of Sec31 beta-propeller domain and more flexibility of the previously known hinge. Together, these results show that the C-terminal region of Sec31 regulates the flexing of other domains such that flexibility and rigidity are not compromised during transport of large and/or asymmetric cargo.

AB Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric epithelium of half the global population, where infections can persist into adenocarcinomas and peptic ulcers. H. pylori secretes several proteins that lend to its pathogenesis and survival including VacA, CagA, gamma-glutamyltransferase and HP0175. HP0175, also known as HpCBF2, classified as a peptidyl-prolyl cis,trans-isomerase, has been shown to induce apoptosis through a cascade of mechanisms initiated though its interaction with toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we report the structure of apo-HP0175 at 2.09 angstrom with a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. Chromatographic, light scattering and mass spectrometric analysis of HP0175 in solution indicate that the protein is mainly monomeric under low salt conditions, while increasing ionic interactions facilitates protein dimerization. A comparison of the apo-HP0175 structure to that of the indole-2-carboxylic acid-bound form shows movement of the N- and C-terminal helices upon interaction of the catalytic residues in the binding pocket. Helix extension of the N/C chaperone domains between apo and I2CA-bound HP0175 supports previous findings in parvulin PPlases for their role in protein stabilization (and accommodation of variable protein lengths) of those undergoing catalysis.

   DATA-COLLECTION; INDUCED MOTION; SYSTEM
AB Automated data acquisition is used widely for single-particle reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) volumes of biological complexes preserved in vitreous ice and imaged in a transmission electron microscope. Automation has become integral to this method because of the very large number of particle images required in order to overcome the typically low signal-to-noise ratio of these images.
   For optimal efficiency, automated data acquisition software packages typically employ some beam-image shift targeting as this method is both fast and accurate (+/- 0.1 mu m). In contrast, using only stage movement, relocation to a targeted area under low-dose conditions can only be achieved in combination with multiple iterations or long relaxation times, both reducing efficiency. Nevertheless it is well known that applying beam image shift induces beam-tilt and with it a potential structure phase error with a phase error pi/4 the highest acceptable value. This theory has been used as an argument against beam-image shift for high resolution data collection. Nevertheless, in practice many small beam-image shift datasets have resulted in 3D reconstructions beyond the pi/4 phase error limit.
   To address this apparent contradiction, we performed cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions on a T20S proteasome sample using applied beam-image shifts corresponding to beam tilts from 0 to 10 mrad. To evaluate the results we compared the FSC values, and examined the water density peaks in the 3D map. We conclude that the phase error does not limit the validity of the 3D reconstruction from single-particle averaging beyond the pi/4 resolution limit.

AB The 2015/2016 Map Challenge challenged cryo-EM practitioners to process a series of publicly available cryo-EM datasets. As part of the challenge, metrics needed to be developed to assess and compare the quality of the different map submissions. The most common metric for assessing maps is determining the resolution by Fourier shell correlation (FSC), but there are well known instances where the resolution can be misleading. In this manuscript, we present a new approach for assessing the quality of a map by determining the map "model ability" rather than on resolution. We used the automated map tracing and modeling algorithms in Rosetta to generate populations of models, and then compared the populations between different map entries by the Rosetta score, RMSD to a reference model provided by the map challenge, and by pair-wise RMSDs between different models in the population. These metrics were used to determine statistically significant rankings for the map challengers for each dataset. The rankings revealed inconsistencies between the resolution by FSC, emphasized the importance of the interplay between number of particles contributing to a map and map quality, and revealed the importance of software familiarity on single particle reconstruction results. However, because multiple variables changed between map entries, it was challenging to derive best practices from the map challenge results.

AB EMAN2 is an extensible software suite with complete workflows for performing high-resolution single particle analysis, 2-D and 3-D heterogeneity analysis, and subtomogram averaging, among other tasks. Participation in the recent CryoEM Map Challenge sponsored by the EMDatabank led to a number of significant improvements to the single particle analysis process in EMAN2. A new convolutional neural network particle picker was developed, which dramatically improves particle picking accuracy for difficult data sets. A new particle quality metric capable of accurately identifying "bad" particles with a high degree of accuracy, no human input, and a negligible amount of additional computation, has been introduced, and this now serves as a replacement for earlier human-biased methods. The way 3-D single particle reconstructions are filtered has been altered to be more comparable to the filter applied in several other popular software packages, dramatically improving the appearance of sidechains in high-resolution structures. Finally, an option has been added to perform local resolution-based iterative filtration, resulting in local resolution improvements in many maps.

AB The recent successes of cryo-electron microscopy fostered great expectation of solving many new and previously recalcitrant biomolecular structures. However, it also brings with it the danger of compromising the validity of the outcomes if not done properly. The Map Challenge is a first step in assessing the state of the art and to shape future developments in data processing. The organizers presented seven cases for single particle reconstruction, and 27 members of the community responded with 66 submissions. Seven groups analyzed these submissions, resulting in several assessment reports, summarized here. We devised a range of analyses to evaluate the submitted maps, including visual impressions, Fourier shell correlation, pairwise similarity and interpretation through modeling. Unfortunately, we did not find strong trends. We ascribe this to the complexity of the challenge, dealing with multiple cases, software packages and processing approaches. This puts the user in the spotlight, where his/her choices becomes the determinant of map quality. The future focus should therefore be on promulgating best practices and encapsulating these in the software. Such practices include adherence to validation principles, most notably the processing of independent sets, proper resolution-limited alignment, appropriate masking and map sharpening. We consider the Map Challenge to be a highly valuable exercise that should be repeated frequently or on an ongoing basis.

AB We find that the overall quite good methods used in the CryoEM Model Challenge could still benefit greatly from several strategies for improving local conformations. Our assessments primarily use validation criteria from the MolProbity web service. Those criteria include MolProbity's all-atom contact analysis, updated versions of standard conformational validations for protein and RNA, plus two recent additions: first, flags for cis-nonPro and twisted peptides, and second, the CaBLAM system for diagnosing secondary structure, validating Ca backbone, and validating adjacent peptide CO orientations in the context of the Ca trace. In general, automated ab initio building of starting models is quite good at backbone connectivity but often fails at local conformation or sequence register, especially at poorer than 3.5 angstrom resolution. However, we show that even if criteria (such as Ramachandran or rotamer) are explicitly restrained to improve refinement behavior and overall validation scores, automated optimization of a deposited structure seldom corrects specific misfittings that start in the wrong local minimum, but just hides them. Therefore, local problems should be identified, and as many as possible corrected, before starting refinement. Secondary structures are confusing at 3-4 angstrom but can be better recognized at 6-8 angstrom. In future model challenges, specific steps being tested (such as segmentation) and the required documentation (such as PDB code of starting model) should each be explicitly defined, so competing methods on a given task can be meaningfully compared. Individual local examples are presented here, to understand what local mistakes and corrections look like in 3D, how they probably arise, and what possible improvements to methodology might help avoid them. At these resolutions, both structural biologists and end-users need meaningful estimates of local uncertainty, perhaps through explicit ensembles. Fitting problems can best be diagnosed by validation that spans multiple residues; CaBLAM is such a multi-residue tool, and its effectiveness is demonstrated.

AB The EMDataBank Validation Challenge was a challenging task for students newly introduced to the cryoEM and molecular modeling fields. However, the competition provided an effective space for student modelers to discover and explore the potentials of atomic modeling and refinement by practicing on published atomic structures. Here, by employing manual molecular modeling programs such as Coot, Phenix, and Chimera, we have regularized and improved three targets. The T20S proteasome and TRPV1 ion channel allowed us to broaden our understanding of these modeling techniques while the 70S ribosome served as a challenge to test the limits of our abilities. We were successful in our efforts to improve each of the models and provide here our cohesive methodology for de novo modeling with and without homology models, which may serve as a starting point for other undergraduates and researchers just entering the realm of cryoEM. Additionally, we provide some constructive criticism to facilitate the introduction of said undergraduates and researchers into cryoEM in the future.

AB Accurate structure determination from electron density maps at 3-5 angstrom resolution necessitates a balance between extensive global and local sampling of atomistic models, yet with the stereochemical correctness of backbone and sidechain geometries. Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF), particularly through a resolution-exchange scheme, ReMDFF, provides a robust way of achieving this balance for hybrid structure determination. Employing two high-resolution density maps, namely that of beta-galactosidase at 3.2 angstrom and TFtPv1 at 3.4 angstrom, we showcase the quality of ReMDFF-generated models, comparing them against ones submitted by independent research groups for the 2015-2016 Cryo-EM Model Challenge. This comparison offers a clear evaluation of ReMDFF's strengths and shortcomings, and those of data-guided real-space refinements in general. ReMDFF results scored highly on the various metric for judging the quality-of-fit and quality-of-model. However, some systematic discrepancies are also noted employing a Molprobity analysis, that are reproducible across multiple competition entries. A space of key refinement parameters is explored within ReMDFF to observe their impact within the final model. Choice of force field parameters and initial model seem to have the most significant impact on ReMDFF model-quality. To this end, very recently developed CHARMM36m force field parameters provide now more refined ReMDFF models than the ones originally submitted to the Cryo-EM challenge. Finally, a set of good-practices is prescribed for the community to benefit from the MDFF developments.

AB The Map Challenge organized by the Electron Microscopy Data Bank has prompted the development of an Xmipp high resolution reconstruction protocol (which we will refer to as highres) that is integrated in the software platform scipion. In this work we describe the details of the image angular alignment and map reconstruction steps in our new method. This algorithm is similar to the standard projection matching approach with some important modifications, especially in the area of detecting significant features in the reconstructed volume. We show that the new method is able to produce higher resolution maps than the current de facto standard as measured by the Fourier Shell Correlation, the Monogenic Local Resolution and EMRinger.

AB A recently-developed method for identifying a compact, contiguous region representing the unique part of a density map was applied to 218 Cryo-EM maps with resolutions of 4.5 angstrom or better. The key elements of the segmentation procedure are (1) identification of all regions of density above a threshold and (2) choice of a unique set of these regions, taking symmetry into consideration, that maximize connectivity and compactness. This segmentation approach was then combined with tools for automated map sharpening and model-building to generate models for the 12 maps in the 2016 Cryo-EM Model Challenge in a fully automated manner. The resulting models have completeness from 24% to 82% and RMS distances from reference interpretations of 0.6 angstrom-2.1 angstrom.

AB This article presents a methodology to assess a set of density maps, as used in the Blind Assessment Phase of the 2015/2016 Map Challenge (EMDataBank Validation Challenges). The synthetic and experimental cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps obtained by different single particle analysis protocols and by different participants, submitted in the Challenge Phase for assessment, were analyzed with this methodology and the obtained results are presented and discussed here. The goal of using such a methodology was to blindly identify the density maps with globally similar structural information, meaning the maps with the structural information mostly "reproduced" by different protocols. To this end, the density maps are "coarsened" using Gaussian-based approximations, with the same input approximation parameters for all maps of the target biological complex. The approximated maps are then represented in a common reduced-dimension (here, 3D) space of their correlation-coefficient-based distances, in which close maps mean similar maps. The distance analysis allows identifying maps with the most "reproduced" structural information by different protocols. The obtained results are also discussed taking into account the detailed information about the protocols that has been released after the end of the Blind Assessment Phase.

AB Protein tertiary structure modeling is a critical step for the interpretation of three dimensional (3D) election microscopy density. Our group participated the 2015/2016 EM Model Challenge using the MAINMAST software for a de novo main chain modeling. The software generates local dense points using the mean shifting algorithm, and connects them into C alpha models by calculating the minimum spanning tree and the longest path. Subsequently, full atom structure models are generated, which are subject to structural refinement. Here, we summarize the qualities of our submitted models and examine successful and unsuccessful models, including 3D models we did not submit to the Challenge. Our protocol using the MAINMAST software was sometimes able to build correct conformations with 3.4-5.1 angstrom RMSD. Unsuccessful models had failure of chain traces, however, their Ca positions and some local structures were quite correctly built. For evaluate the quality of the models, the MAINMAST software provides a confidence score for each Ca position from the consensus of top 100 scoring models.

AB Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is capable of achieving near-atomic resolution of biomolecular structures due to recent advances in hardware. Despite the long history of image processing software development for cryoEM, uncertainty about best practices and validation remains. The Map Challenge was therefore designed to test the current state of single particle reconstruction. As the first such challenge, the participants were given the freedom to analyze the cases in whichever way they wanted. Therefore, the maps submitted feature different sizes, sampling and orientations, making assessment non-trivial. To be fair, I developed a method to pose all maps in each case in the same configuration with minimal interpolation. I assessed the quality of these maps by visual inspection and Fourier shell correlation (FSC). Comparing the even-odd FSC with an FSC calculated against a reference structure analysis, I concluded that the quality of the maps related more to the user than to other factors, such as the software package used. Poor quality maps suffer either from lack of data or poor choices made by the user. Some maps appear significantly better than a reference or consensus of other maps, indicating overfitting. Best practices to avoid problems include an understanding of the effects of reference map modifications on particle image alignment, and generating appropriate masks. Ultimately, none of the issues revealed in the Map Challenge is insurmountable, as underscored by the excellent quality of reconstructions achieved by a significant number of participants.

AB This work focuses on the accuracy and stability of high-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for under-resolved turbulence computations. In particular we consider the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) flow to analyse the implicit large eddy simulation (iLES) capabilities of DG methods at very high Reynolds numbers. The governing equations are discretised in two ways in order to suppress aliasing errors introduced into the discrete variational forms due to the under-integration of non-linear terms. The first, more straightforward way relies on consistent/over-integration, where quadrature accuracy is improved by using a larger number of integration points, consistent with the degree of the non-linearities. The second strategy, originally applied in the high-order finite difference community, relies on a split (or skew-symmetric) form of the governing equations. Different split forms are available depending on how the variables in the non-linear terms are grouped. The desired split form is then built by averaging conservative and non-conservative forms of the governing equations, although conservativity of the DG scheme is fully preserved. A preliminary analysis based on Burgers' turbulence in one spatial dimension is conducted and shows the potential of split forms in keeping the energy of higher-order polynomial modes close to the expected levels. This indicates that the favourable dealiasing properties observed from split-form approaches in more classical schemes seem to hold for DG. The remainder of the study considers a comprehensive set of (under-resolved) computations of the inviscid TGV flow and compares the accuracy and robustness of consistent/over-integration and split form discretisations based on the local Lax-Friedrichs and Roe-type Riemann solvers. Recent works showed that relevant split forms can stabilize higher-order inviscid TGV test cases otherwise unstable even with consistent integration. Here we show that stable high-order cases achievable with both strategies have comparable accuracy, further supporting the good dealiasing properties of split form DG. The higher-order cases achieved only with split form schemes also displayed all the main features expected from consistent/over-integration. Among test cases with the same number of degrees of freedom, best solution quality is obtained with Roetype fluxes at moderately high orders (around sixth order). Solutions obtained with very high polynomial orders displayed spurious features attributed to a sharper dissipation in wavenumber space. Accuracy differences between the two dealiasing strategies considered were, however, observed for the low-order cases, which also yielded reduced solution quality compared to high-order results.

AB In this paper, we propose a rigorous and accurate non-local (in the oversampled region) upscaling framework based on some recently developed multiscale methods [10]. Our proposed method consists of identifying multi-continua parameters via local basis functions and constructing non-local (in the oversampled region) transfer and effective properties. To achieve this, we significantly modify our recent work proposed within Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) in [10] and derive appropriate local problems in oversampled regions once we identify important modes representing each continuum. We use piecewise constant functions in each fracture network and in the matrix to write an upscaled equation. Thus, the resulting upscaled equation is of minimal size and the unknowns are average pressures in the fractures and the matrix. Note that the use of non-local upscaled model for porous media flows is not new, e.g., in [14], the authors derive non-local approach. Our main contribution is identifying appropriate local problems together with local spectral modes to represent each continuum. The model problem for fractures assumes that one can identify fracture networks. The resulting non-local equation (restricted to the oversampling region, which is several times larger compared to the target coarse block) has the same form as [14] with much smaller local regions. We present numerical results, which show that the proposed approach can provide good accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Lagrangian finite volume (FV) cell-centered hydrodynamic (CCH) method and the Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) CCH method have been demonstrated to be quite stable and capable of producing very accurate solutions on many mesh topologies. However, some challenges can arise with higher-order elements and polygonal elements that have many deformational degrees of freedom. With these types of meshes, elements can deform in unphysical ways and the mesh can tangle. We present methods for obtaining more robust Lagrangian solutions on polygonal and higher-order elements. The robustness is achieved by (1) incorporating a new iterative method that modifies the velocity reconstructions in the corners of the elements, and (2) a new multidirectional approximate Riemann solver that, when coupled with the iterative method, reduces spurious mesh motion. The details of the numerical methods are discussed and their utility is demonstrated on a diverse suite of test problems using higher-order and polygonal elements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Pore-scale simulations of multiphase flow in porous media are useful in understanding the relations between macroscopic variables relevant in many applications. It is critical that simulation domains are large enough to be considered representative elementary volumes for the relevant macroscopic quantities such as relative permeability, macroscopic capillary pressure and average saturation. However, multiphase pore-scale solvers, such as dynamic flow solvers for pore network models, are typically computationally expensive due to the required solution of a global pressure problem at every time-step. In this paper, an approximate multiscale flow solver is presented, which overcomes this limitation. The solver is applicable to arbitrary unstructured pore networks and consists of three main steps. First, the global pressure problem is solved using the multiscale finite volume (MSFV) method in combination with the multiscale restricted-smoothed basis (MsRSB) prolongation operator. The computed pressure field leads to conservative fluxes across predefined subnetwork boundaries. Second, these conservative fluxes are used as boundary conditions to solve local problems on the subnetworks. Third, once these local problems are solved, the subnetworks are synchronized. Validation studies are presented and results obtained using the multiscale solver are compared to results obtained using an existing dynamic network flow solver. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB It is well known that for initial boundary value problems one may need to decrease the order of boundary closures to ensure strict stability (also called time stability) of finite difference schemes. For high-order schemes, this often reduces the global convergence rate significantly. To cure this issue, we derive high-order accurate boundary closures that satisfy a global conservation property. We show that the boundary closures cannot be both high-order accurate and conservative in the l(2)-inner product, if the grid is equidistant. Therefore, we derive particular sets of nonuniform solution points and quadrature weights near the domain boundaries. The new schemes are high-order accurate on the modified grids and conservative in the derived quadrature rules. Although we have no theoretical stability proof, numerical eigenvalue analysis suggests that the new schemes are strictly stable up to eleventh-order global accuracy for scalar linear advection equations. Numerical experiments with one- and two-dimensional linear equations corroborate the design orders of the schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new approach to constructing algorithms for gradient computations on unstructured grids. The proposed approach is to derive a gradient algorithm from a hyperbolic diffusion scheme, which solves the diffusion equation and equations for the solution gradient, by ignoring the residual component for the diffusion equation. The resulting scheme forms a globally coupled linear system of equations for the gradients with the Green-Gauss gradient formula on the right hand side, which can be solved efficiently by iterative techniques. Accuracy and iterative performance can be controlled by parameters inherited from the generating hyperbolic diffusion scheme. Second- or fourth-order gradient accuracy can be obtained on regular grids, and first-order accuracy, which is sufficient for second-order finite-volume schemes, can be obtained on irregular grids. Numerical results indicate that the method gives highly accurate gradients especially for highly-curved high-aspect-ratio grids typical in high-Reynolds-number boundary layer flows over complex geometries, and can be employed in finite-volume solvers as an efficient alternative to least-squares or Green-Gauss gradient methods. It is also shown that one of the parameters has a role of dissipation, and can be tuned to yield a smooth gradient distribution over a discontinuous function, thereby allowing an implicit finite-volume solver to converge for a discontinuous solution with a mild overshoot. The paper concludes with a discussion for future developments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we develop and implement anisotropic radial basis function methods for simulating the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers. We test the methods on two problems: the well-known benchmark ISMIP-HOM B that corresponds to a glacier size ice and a synthetic ice sheet whose geometry is inspired by the EISMINT benchmark that corresponds to a continental size ice sheet. We illustrate the advantages of the radial basis function methods over a standard finite element method. We also show how the use of anisotropic radial basis functions allows for accurate simulation of the velocities on a large ice sheet, which was not possible with standard isotropic radial basis function methods due to a small ratio between the typical thickness and length of an ice sheet. Additionally, we implement a partition of unity method in order to improve the computational efficiency of the radial basis function methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we consider the development of implicit-explicit total variation diminishing (TVD) methods (also termed SSP: strong stability preserving) for the compressible isentropic Euler system in the low Mach number regime. The proposed scheme is asymptotically stable with a CFL condition independent of the Mach number. In addition, it degenerates, in the low Mach number regime, to a consistent discretization of the incompressible system. Since it has been proved that implicit schemes of order higher than one cannot be TVD (SSP) [30], we construct a new paradigm of implicit time integrators by coupling first-order in time schemes with second-order ones in the same spirit as highly accurate shock-capturing TVD methods in space. For this particular class of schemes, the TVD property is first proved on a linear model advection equation and then extended to the isentropic Euler case. The result is a method which interpolates from the first- to the second-order both in space and time. It preserves the monotonicity of the solution, and is highly accurate for all choices of the Mach number. Moreover, the time step is only restricted by the non-stiff part of the system. We finally show, thanks to one- and two-dimensional test cases, that the method indeed possesses the claimed properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A consistent, conservative and truly high order finite difference scheme for low Mach number turbulent variable density flow simulation is presented. In the present scheme, the scalar transport equation is discretized with the explicit weighted compact nonlinear scheme (WCNS) while the continuity and momentum equations are discretized with a conservative centered high order finite difference scheme on a staggered grid. Bounded hybrid high order upwind interpolation is proposed for the evaluation of density on the cell faces of the staggered grid. The use of explicit WCNS along with the bounded density interpolation resolves the issue of degraded order of accuracy in the existing high order finite difference schemes where the centered finite difference scheme for mass and momentum conservation is combined with a total variation stable scheme for scalar transport. With the same difference operator used for the continuity and scalar transport equations, the present scheme is consistent naturally, and resolves the inconsistency problem reported in Trisjono et al. (2016) [6] without employing any modification to a scheme. Such improvements are demonstrated for several test cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new algorithm KIOPS for computing linear combinations of phi-functions that appear in exponential integrators. This algorithm is suitable for large-scale problems in computational physics where little or no information about the spectrum or norm of the Jacobian matrix is known a priori. We first show that such problems can be solved efficiently by computing a single exponential of a modified matrix. Then our approach is to compute an appropriate basis for the Krylov subspace using the incomplete orthogonalization procedure and project the matrix exponential on this subspace. We also present a novel adaptive procedure that significantly reduces the computational complexity of exponential integrators. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that KIOPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art adaptive Krylov algorithm phipm. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Typical multispecies compressible Navier-Stokes computations employ conservative equations for mass fraction transport. Upwind discretisations of these governing equations produce spurious pressure oscillations at diffuse contact surfaces between gases of differing ratio of specific heat capacities which degrade the convergence rate of the algorithm. Adding quasi-conservative equations for volume fraction can solve this error, however this approach has been derived only for immiscible fluids. Here, a five-equation quasi-conservative model is proposed that includes the effects of species diffusion, viscosity and thermal conductivity. The derivation of the model is presented, along with a numerical method to solve the governing equations at second order accuracy in space and time. Formal convergence studies demonstrate the expected order of accuracy is achieved for three benchmark problems, cross-validated against two standard mass fraction models. In these test cases, the new model has between 2 and 10 times lower error for a given grid size. Simulations of a two-dimensional air-SF 6 Richtmyer-Meshkov instability demonstrate that the new model converges to the solution with four times fewer points in each direction when compared to the mass fraction model in an identical numerical framework. This represents an 40 times lower computational cost for an equivalent error in two-dimensional computations. The proposed model is thus very suitable for Direct Numerical Simulation and Large Eddy Simulation of compressible mixing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a new data-driven closure approximation method to compute the statistical properties of quantities of interest in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. The proposed framework relies on estimating system-dependent conditional expectations from sample paths or experimental data, and then using such estimates to compute data-driven solutions to exact probability density function (PDF) equations. We also address the important question of whether enough useful data is being injected into the exact PDF equation for the purpose of computing an accurate numerical solution. Numerical examples are presented and discussed for prototype nonlinear dynamical systems and models of systems biology evolving from random initial states. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID COMPRESSION; CHICANE
AB In this work, a semi-analytical method for determining wakefields in dielectrically lined rectangular waveguides is presented. This approach is based on a Rayleigh-Ritz method to analytically identify the eigenmodes of the structure, which is currently studied for the application as a so-called 'wakefield dechirper'. The electric field is subsequently determined through an eigenmode expansion, and the wakefield is calculated from the electric field. By virtue of using an analytic ansatz throughout the wakefield determination, an expression for the Green's function wakefield is found.
   The semi-analytical method is then benchmarked against simulations using purely numerical approaches. Compared to numerical approaches, the advantages of the presented method are the independence from any need of discretisation, the computational efficiency of the method's presented Python-based implementation and finally the opportunity to calculate a true Green's function wakefield. From this Green's function, the wake potentials of different bunch shapes can be obtained via convolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an arbitrary order augmented WENO-ADER scheme for the resolution of the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) with geometric source term is presented and its application to other shallow water models involving non-geometric sources is explored. This scheme is based in the 1D Augmented Roe Linearized-ADER (ARL-ADER) scheme, presented by the authors in a previous work and motivated by a suitable compromise between accuracy and computational cost. It can be regarded as an arbitrary order version of the Augmented Roe solver, which accounts for the contribution of continuous and discontinuous geometric source terms at cell interfaces in the resolution of the Derivative Riemann Problem (DRP). The main novelty of this work is the extension of the ARL-ADER scheme to 2 dimensions, which involves the design of a particular procedure for the integration of the source term with arbitrary order that ensures an exact balance between flux fluctuations and sources. This procedure makes the scheme preserve equilibrium solutions with machine precision and capture the transient waves accurately. The scheme is applied to the SWE with bed variation and is extended to handle non-geometric source terms such as the Coriolis source term. When considering the SWE with bed variation and Coriolis, the most relevant equilibrium states are the still water at rest and the geostrophic equilibrium. The traditional well-balanced property is extended to satisfy the geostrophic equilibrium. This is achieved by means of a geometric reinterpretation of the Coriolis source term. By doing this, the formulation of the source terms is unified leading to a single geometric source regarded as an apparent topography. The numerical scheme is tested for a broad variety of situations, including some cases where the first order scheme ruins the solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Strictly stable high-order accurate finite difference approximations are derived, for linear initial boundary value problems. The boundary closures are based on the diagonal-norm summation-by-parts framework and the boundary conditions are imposed using an improved projection method. The improved projection method removes some of the numerical issues with the previously derived (here referred to as traditional) projection method. The finite difference approximations lead to fully explicit ODE systems. The accuracy and stability properties are demonstrated for linear hyperbolic and parabolic problems in 1D and 2D. In particular we study the problem where initial and boundary data are inconsistent, that causes the traditional projection method to fail. Comparisons are made also with weak (penalty) enforcement of boundary conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A class of discrete time random walks has recently been introduced to provide a stochastic process based numerical scheme for solving fractional order partial differential equations, including the fractional subdiffusion equation. Here we develop a Monte Carlo method for simulating discrete time random walks with Sibuya power law waiting times, providing another approximate solution of the fractional subdiffusion equation. The computation time scales as a power law in the number of time steps with a fractional exponent simply related to the order of the fractional derivative. We also provide an explicit form of a subordinator for discrete time random walks with Sibuya power law waiting times. This subordinator transforms from an operational time, in the expected number of random walk steps, to the physical time, in the number of time steps. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A one-way domain decomposition method (DDM) is considered for the solution of the time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering problem by inhomogeneous penetrable 3-D objects: the computational domain is partitioned into concentric subdomains and an integral representation (IR) of the electromagnetic fields on the outer boundary constitutes an exact radiation condition. The corresponding numerical code is efficiently parallelized and the full IR matrices are compressed in order to expedite the solution of very large problems. Exact and approximate high-order transmission conditions (HOTC) are obtained for the model problem of a multi-layer planar structure. Their application to real world objects is investigated in terms of well-posedness and numerical complexity. New well-posed low complexity HOTCs are proposed that speed up the convergence of the DDM algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a fourth-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is developed for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations under the framework of two-stage fourth-order temporal discretization and Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction. Due to the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a time dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface. This time evolution solution can be used not only for the flux evaluation across a cell interface and its time derivative, but also time accurate flow variables at a cell interface. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables inside each control volume, the cell averaged slopes inside each control volume through the differences of flow variables at the cell interfaces can be updated as well in GKS. So, with the updated flow variables and their slopes inside each cell, the HWENO techniques can be naturally implemented for the compact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of each time step. Therefore, a compact higher-order GKS, such as the two-stage fourthorder compact scheme can be constructed. This fourth-order compact GKS has the same stencil and as robust as the second-order scheme. In comparison with the fourth-order DG method, they have the same stencil. In order to get a fourth-order temporal accuracy, the GKS uses two stages and DG needs four stages in the time stepping methods. The CFL number used in GKS is on the order of 0.5 instead of 0.11 in the DG. This research concludes that beyond the first-order Riemann solver the use of high-order time evolution model at a cell interface is extremely helpful in the design of robust, accurate, and efficient higher-order compact schemes for the compressible flow simulations.

AB This paper details the extension of a metric-based anisotropic mesh adaptation strategy to the boundary element method for problems of 3D acoustic wave propagation. Traditional mesh adaptation strategies for boundary element methods rely on Galerkin discretizations of the boundary integral equations, and the development of appropriate error indicators. They often require the solution of further integral equations. These methods utilize the error indicators to mark elements where the error is above a specified tolerance and then refine these elements. Such an approach cannot lead to anisotropic adaptation regardless of how these elements are refined, since the orientation and shape of current elements cannot be modified.
   In contrast, the method proposed here is independent of the discretization technique (e.g., collocation, Galerkin). Furthermore, it completely remeshes at each refinement step, altering the shape, size, and orientation of each element according to an optimal metric based on a numerically recovered Hessian of the boundary solution. The resulting adaptation procedure is truly anisotropic and independent of the complexity of the geometry. We show via a variety of numerical examples that it recovers optimal convergence rates for domains with geometric singularities. In particular, a faster convergence rate is recovered for scattering problems with complex geometries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we devise an efficient and robust numerical method for a nonlocal nonlinear model of flocking dynamics. The governing equations are a hydrodynamic limit of the model of Cucker and Smale which consists of the compressible Euler equations with added nonlinear nonlocal interaction terms. The numerical scheme is based on the discontinuous Galerkin method. A semi-implicit scheme is used in the time discretization which requires only the solution of one linear system per time level while retaining the stability of an implicit scheme. A crucial point is the construction of a suitable linearization of the nonlocal terms which does not result in fill-in of the system matrices. Element-wise and inter-element artificial diffusion is added to the scheme along with a postprocessing procedure to deal with near-vacuum states that typically arise in the solution. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the scheme on numerical experiments in 1D and 2D. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the echoes-to-impedance transform, a nonlinear transform designed for acoustic imaging of layered media-for example, sedimentary geological formations, biological tissue such as skin, or laminated structures in the built environment. The transform converts time domain digital reflection data directly into impedance as a function of spatial location, using minimal prior information about the source wavelet and no prepreprocessing. It is simple, fast, and, according to numerical experiments, highly accurate. More than this, physical structure is superresolved at a finer scale than that of the source wavelet. The derivation of the echoes-to-impedance transform stems from a recently developed numerical method for wave propagation in one dimension in conjunction with the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.

AB We propose an efficient uncertainty quantification framework that makes use of multiple probabilistic graphical models to yield a nonparametric Gaussian mixture description of the target probability distribution. The methodology is indeed generic, but this work focuses on its application to the particular class of the inference problems arising from the hidden Markov process and the associated observations in a sequence. The implementation procedure is demonstrated with the dynamical system models in both low and high dimension. In case of the low dimension, it is shown that the usual factor graph for the sequential data can be used to produce a very accurate approximate solution. However, for high dimensional systems, a new family of the factor graphs are developed in order to achieve an effective dimension reduction and to facilitate a synergetic application together with multiple graphs in addressing the Bayesian data assimilation. As a result, a new paradigm for the probabilistic filtering and smoothing emerges, and the applicability of the graphical model approach has been broadened. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We combine the multigrid (MG) method with state-of-the-art concepts from the variational formulation of the numerical renormalization group. The resulting MG renormalization (MGR) method is a natural generalization of the MG method for solving partial differential equations. When the solution on a grid of N points is sought, our MGR method has a computational cost scaling as O(log(N)), as opposed to O(N) for the best standard MG method. Therefore MGR can exponentially speed up standard MG computations. To illustrate our method, we develop a novel algorithm for the ground state computation of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Our algorithm acts variationally on tensor products and updates the tensors one after another by solving a local nonlinear optimization problem. We compare several different methods for the nonlinear tensor update and find that the Newton method is the most efficient as well as precise. The combination of MGR with our nonlinear ground state algorithm produces accurate results for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on N = 10(18) grid points in three spatial dimensions.

AB We present a novel hyperviscosity formulation for stabilizing RBF-FD discretizations of the advection-diffusion equation. The amount of hyperviscosity is determined quasianalytically for commonly-used explicit, implicit, and implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integrators by using a simple 1D semi-discrete Von Neumann analysis. The analysis is applied to an analytical model of spurious growth in RBF-FD solutions that uses auxiliary differential operators mimicking the undesirable properties of RBF-FD differentiation matrices. The resulting hyperviscosity formulation is a generalization of existing ones in the literature, but is free of any tuning parameters and can be computed efficiently. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple new scaling law for polynomial-augmented RBF-FD that relates the degree of polyharmonic spline (PHS) RBFs to the degree of the appended polynomial. When used in a novel ghost node formulation in conjunction with the recently-developed overlapped RBF-FD method, the resulting method is robust and free of stagnation errors. We validate the high-order convergence rates of our method on 2D and 3D test cases over a wide range of Peclet numbers (1-1000). We then use our method to solve a 3D coupled problem motivated by models of platelet aggregation and coagulation, again demonstrating high-order convergence rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We are interested in the approximation of a steady hyperbolic problem. In some cases, the solution can satisfy an additional conservation relation, at least when it is smooth. This is the case of an entropy. In this paper, we show, starting from the discretization of the original PDE, how to construct a scheme that is consistent with the original PDE and the additional conservation relation. Since one interesting example is given by the systems endowed by an entropy, we provide one explicit solution, and show that the accuracy of the new scheme is at most degraded by one order. In the case of a discontinuous Galerkin scheme and a Residual distribution scheme, we show how not to degrade the accuracy. This improves the recent results obtained in [1-4] in the sense that no particular constraints are set on quadrature formula and that a priori maximum accuracy can still be achieved. We study the behavior of the method on a non linear scalar problem. However, the method is not restricted to scalar problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, we study the Faber polynomial series, which yields asymptotically optimal approximations converging at least R-superlinearly with the polynomial order. Numerical applications are presented for random wave propagation and harmonic chains of oscillators interacting on the Bethe lattice and on graphs with arbitrary topology. Most of the analysis and numerical results presented in this paper are for linear dynamical systems evolving from random initial states. The extension to nonlinear systems is discussed as well the challenges in the implementation of the proposed approximation methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the stability of the dispersive hybrid implicit-explicit finite difference time domain (HIE-FDTD) scheme has been studied for the time domain simulations of infinite-thin graphene structures. It has been shown that the time step stability limit is a function of the graphene parameters and more restrictive than the classical HIE-FDTD constraint. In this communication, the stability of this numerical scheme is revisited, and based on the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, alternative time step stability condition is derived. To retain the classical HIE-FDTD stability constraint, stability improved implementation of the graphene dispersion is introduced. These findings are validated by using the root-locus method from the discrete-control theory. In addition, the stability is verified numerically and the accuracy of the presented implementation is demonstrated by studying the transmission coefficient of a thin two-dimensional (2D) graphene sheet placed in a 3D domain and excellent agreement with the analytical result is observed.

AB Finite Element Methods (FEM) are becoming increasingly popular in modeling seismic wave propagation. These methods provide higher order accuracy, geometrical flexibility and adaptive gridding capabilities that are not easy to incorporate in traditional finite difference methods employed for generation of synthetic seismograms. Moreover, several studies have shown that Discontinuous Galerkin FEM (DGM) is a promising approach for modeling wave propagation in fractured media. Here we propose an Enriched Galerkin FEM (EGM) for elastic wave propagation. EGM uses the same bilinear form as DGM and the continuous Galerkin finite element spaces enriched by discontinuous piecewise constants or bilinear functions. EGM satisfies local equilibrium while reducing the degrees of freedom in DGM formulations. In this paper, we consider elastic wave propagation and derive optimal a priori error estimates for DGM and EGM. We present numerical examples in two spatial dimensions that confirm these theoretical results. In addition, we provide numerical comparisons with the Spectral element method. In previous work, DGM has been shown to be effective in modeling elastic wave propagation in fractured media using the linear slip model. We now extend these results to EGM with reduced computational costs over DGM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate simulation of scattering of electromagnetic waves in three dimensions by a diffraction grating is crucial in many applications of engineering and scientific interest. In this contribution we present a novel High-Order Perturbation of Surfaces method for the numerical approximation of vector electromagnetic scattering by a doubly periodic layered medium. For this we restate the governing time harmonic Maxwell equations as vector Helmholtz equations which are coupled by transmission boundary conditions at the layer interface. We then apply the method of Transformed Field Expansions which delivers a Fourier collocation, Legendre-Galerkin, Boundary Perturbation approach to solve the problem in transformed coordinates. A sequence of numerical simulations demonstrate the efficient and robust spectral convergence which can be achieved with the proposed algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We suggest a new positivity-preserving discrete duality finite volume (DDFV) scheme for anisotropic diffusion problems on general polygonal meshes. Like existing DDFV schemes, this scheme is built on the primary and dual meshes and has finite volume (FV) equations for both vertex and cell-centered unknowns. The transpose of the coefficient matrix for the FV equations of the cell-centered unknowns is an M-matrix while that for the vertex unknowns is not an M-matrix but a symmetric and positive definite matrix. By employing a certain truncation technique for the vertex unknowns, the positivity-preserving property for both categories of unknowns is guaranteed. Local conservation is strictly maintained for the cell-centered unknowns and conditionally maintained for the vertex unknowns. Since the FV equations of the vertex unknowns can be solved independently, the two sets of FV equations are decoupled. In contrast to existing nonlinear positivity-preserving schemes, the new scheme requires no nonlinear iterations for linear problems. For nonlinear problems, the positivity-preserving mechanism of the new scheme is decoupled from its nonlinear iteration so that any nonlinear solver can be adopted. Moreover, the positivity of the discrete solution is proved and the well-posedness is analyzed rigorously for linear problems. In numerical experiments, the new scheme is examined extensively and compared with two positivity-preserving cell-centered schemes and a nonlinear DDFV scheme. Numerical results show that the present DDFV scheme achieves second-order accuracy and preserves the positivity of the solution for heterogeneous and anisotropic problems on severely distorted grids. The high efficiency of the scheme is also demonstrated by the comparison of computation time and number of nonlinear iterations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose a time-accurate algorithm for the calculation of two-phase granular flows via two-velocity, two-pressure Eulerian models. Such flows exhibit a number of important characteristics that make their computation particularly challenging. For example, even at constant-density flows the suspended granular phase can compact or expand so that the velocity fields of the two phases are not solenoidal. Also, the granular material typically exhibits a complex and highly nonlinear rheological behaviour. Moreover, the governing equation for the granular volume fraction (often referred to in the literature as "compaction equation" or "particle migration model") involves stresses as source terms and, therefore it is strongly coupled to the momentum balance laws. Herein we show that this coupling can be a strong destabilising factor in the computations if it is not treated properly. Our algorithm is based on a predictor-corrector time-integration scheme. Further, it employs a generalized double projection method for non-solenoidal velocity fields that results in second-order elliptic equations for the phasial pressures. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated via a series of simulations of transient flows with strong concentration gradients, namely, sedimentation of a granular suspension, compaction of a dense sediment bed, and collapse of a submerged granular column. Numerical grid-convergence studies further show that the algorithm exhibits satisfactory convergence rates. Overall, these numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm is well suited for the simulation of flows of dense suspensions, flows with high volume-fraction variations or material interfaces, as well as for unsteady fluid-solid interaction problems.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model for fluid-structure interaction (FSI), that is capable to handle very large deformations as well as topology changes like contact of the solid to a wall. The model is based on a fully Eulerian description of the velocity field in both, the fluid and the elastic domain. Viscous and elastic stresses in the Navier-Stokes equations are restricted to the corresponding domains by multiplication with their characteristic functions. The solid is described as a hyperelastic neo-Hookean material and the elastic stress is obtained by solving an additional Oldroyd-B - like equation. Thermodynamically consistent forces are derived by energy variation. The convergence of the derived equations to the traditional sharp interface formulation of fluid-structure interaction is shown by matched asymptotic analysis. The model is evaluated in a challenging benchmark scenario of an elastic body traversing a fluid channel. A comparison to reference values from Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulations shows very good agreement. We highlight some distinct advantages of the new model, like the avoidance of re-triangulations and the stable inclusion of surface tension. Further, we demonstrate how simple it is to include contact dynamics into the model, by simulating a ball bouncing off a wall. We extend this scenario to include adhesion of the ball, which to our knowledge, cannot be simulated with any other FSI model. While we have restricted simulations to fluid-structure interaction, the model is capable to simulate any combination of viscous fluids, visco-elastic fluids and elastic solids.

We also construct a numerical flux for the fluid model obtained as the asymptotic limit of the flux of the kinetic equation. Finally we perform several numerical simulations for time evolution and stationary problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Galerkin Difference method, a finite element method built using standard Galerkin projection techniques but employing nonstandard basis functions, was originally developed for one space dimension in [1]. Here the method is extended to two space dimensions using a tensor product construction. Theoretical and computational evidence shows the method behaves as expected for the acoustic wave equation. For the elastic wave equation, the approximations are found to be at least as accurate as predicted, but with a free surface the scheme may exhibit an unexpected superconvergence. Extension to curvilinear mapped grids is also considered for acoustics. In all cases, the use of a tensor product construction allows for efficient solution of the linear system involving the mass matrix, which implies optimal linear time solutions with respect to the number of degrees of freedom.

AB In this work, amount of suitable diffusion in entropy stable fluxes is explicitly characterized to construct non-oscillatory schemes in total variation diminishing (TVD) sense. Further, high resolution entropy stable TVD fluxes are constructed and a generic TVD-entropy stable region is given for the flux limiter functions. The non-oscillatory TVD property of proposed fluxes does not depend on the choice of entropy functions and different choices for diffusion matrices are proposed for these fluxes. These fluxes are extendable to the system of higher dimension and resulting entropy stable schemes are used to numerically compute the solution for Burgers and shallow water equations in 1D and 2D case. It is also shown numerically that, the use of proposed diffusion matrices in TECNO schemes can significantly suppress the oscillations exhibited by them while applied with other diffusion matrices. Numerical results show that the resulting schemes capture steady shock exactly and produce non-oscillatory solution profile with high resolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SYNTHETIC ACCELERATION
AB The thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations comprise a radiation equation coupled to the material internal energy equation. Linearization of these equations produces effective, thermally-redistributed scattering through absorption-reemission. We investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of Linear-Multi-Frequency-Grey (LMFG) acceleration that has been reformulated for use as a preconditioner to Krylov iterative solution methods. We introduce two general frameworks, the scalar flux formulation (SFF) and the absorption rate formulation (ARF), and investigate their iterative properties in the absence and presence of true scattering. SFF has a group-dependent state size but may be formulated without inner iterations in the presence of scattering, while ARF has a group-independent state size but requires inner iterations when scattering is present. We compare and evaluate the computational cost and efficiency of LMFG applied to these two formulations using a direct solver for the preconditioners. This work is novel because the use of LMFG for the radiation transport equation, in conjunction with Krylov methods, involves special considerations not required for radiation diffusion.

AB We propose a new finite element method for embedded domain computations, which falls in the category of surrogate/approximate boundary algorithms. The key feature of the proposed approach is the idea of shifting the location where boundary conditions are applied from the true to the surrogate boundary, and to appropriately modify the shifted boundary conditions, enforced weakly, in order to preserve optimal convergence rates of the numerical solution. This process yields a method which, in our view, is simple, efficient, and also robust, since it is not affected by the small-cut-cell problem. Although general in nature, here we apply this new concept to the Poisson and Stokes problems. We present in particular the full analysis of stability and convergence for the case of the Poisson operator, and numerical tests for both the Poisson and Stokes equations, for geometries of progressively higher complexity.

AB Glasses in the SiO2-BaO-TiO2 system are known to exhibit high refractive indices and exceptional infrared transmission. However, their strong tendency towards crystallization limits their production and commercial applications. In this study, we substituted ZnO for SiO2, BaO and TiO2, respectively, in a baseline 20SiO(2)-30BaO-50TiO(2) glass. These glasses were synthesized by a traditional melt-quench method. The crystalline nature of both quenched between two metallic plates and heat-treated samples were assessed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, while differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to estimate Delta T (T-x-T-g), K-gl, activation energy (E-a), and the Avrami parameter (n). The structure of the SiO2-BaO-TiO2-ZnO glass system was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, while SEM was performed for microstructural characterization of glassy and crystalline phases. The results indicate that these glasses can incorporate between 10 and 20 mol% of ZnO before crystallization occurs, where the maximum ZnO concentration is highly dependent upon the oxide substitution method. The apparent activation energy (E-a) of 20SiO(2)-30BaO-50TiO(2) and Zn-Ba-2.5 are 796 kJ/mol and 511 kJ/mol while Avrami parameters (n) are 2.02 and 3.04, respectively. SEM analysis demonstrates that both glasses undergo volume crystallization. Comparing with 20SiO(2)-30BaO-50TiO(2) glass, ZnO promotes the formation of [TiO4] and "supertetrahedra" structures which can increase Delta T and K-gl to 110 degrees C and 0.30 respectively. ZnO additions to the SiO2-BaO-TiO2 glass system improves glass stability against crystallization.

AB Glasses with the composition 50SiO(2)-20TiO(2)-15BaO-7.5SrO-7.5CaO doped varied content of La2O3 have been prepared by the conventional melt quench technique. The effect of La2O3 on structure of the glasses was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and Raman spectra. The density, thermal stability and dielectric properties of glass were measured and compared by the Archimedes method, differential thermal scanning analysis (DSC) and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The results showed that the coordination of the titanium remained invariable with the addition of La2O3, while the number of Si-O-Ti bonds increased and the distribution of Q(n) changed. And the depolymerization of the glass network was observed. The thermal stability and resistance to crystallization increased significantly for glass containing 4 mol% of La2O3 resulting from the strong strength of La-O bond and the La3+ clustering. However, the resistance to crystallization for glasses was decreased with further increasing La2O3. The dielectric constant of glass decreased first and then increased with the increase of La2O3 content, while the dielectric loss was almost constant.

AB A 41.6MgO-27.1B(2)O(3)-31.2SiO(2) glass was synthesized by container-less levitation method. B K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was used to quantify the coordination of boron in the as made glass, resulting in similar to 72% of boron in 3-fold coordination. Raman spectroscopy indicated that the glass structure includes depolymerized borate units, which are pyroborate (B2O54-) and ring and/or chain-type metaborate (B3O63-, (BO2O-)(infinity)) groups. The structural changes in the glass under hydrostatic condition were investigated by high-pressure Raman spectroscopy within a diamond anvil cell at pressures up to 8.5 GPa. On the borate structure, metaborate groups decreased with pressure. In contrast, triborate groups, which include tetrahedrally coordinated boron and have a fully polymerized borate network, increased; suggesting that the coordination transformation of B and polymerization were induced via compression. However, the modification of the borate structure units seems to be reversible at least up to 8.5 GPa. As for the silicate network, Q(0) and Q(1) structures were responsible to compression. Specifically, Q(0) could be replaced by Q(1) with elevating pressure, which means that the silicate network becomes polymerized with pressure. Whereas, structure of glass samples recovered from the pressure higher than 5 GPa displayed depolymerized silicate network, as dissociation of Q(2) to Q(1). The observed structural changes in the silicate network implied a partial change of the coordination number of Si4+ ions, which can be enhanced by the presence of a modifier cation with high field strength such as Mg2+.

AB In materials engineering design understanding and prediction over the physical properties are essential to develop new class of functionalized materials. The objective of this work is to assess the radiation shielding properties for Bi2O3 - V2O5 - TeO2 glass system. For this aim, the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code was used to estimate the mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho) for the Bi2O3 - V2O5 - TeO2 glasses in the energy range of 0.356-1.33 MeV. The MCNP5 values of mu/rho were verified by XCOM at the selected energy range. The results showed that BiVTe6 and BiVTe1 glass samples have the highest and lowest values of mass attenuation coefficient respectively. The addition of Bi2O3 in the glass samples leads to a reduce in HVL and MFP values at all photon energies. Hence, BiVTe6 glass sample possesses the lowest HVL and MFP values, thus this glass sample has better shielding properties in comparison with the other samples in this work. The exploitation of their useful shielding properties may open many new technological applications in optoelectronics and radiation protection.

AB Glasses of the 17ZnO center dot 32CdO center dot 51TeO(2) system doped with Eu2O3 (0-0.75 mol per 100 mol of oxides) were obtained. Non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests showed that the glass transition temperature varied in the range of 354 degrees to 371 degrees C with the addition of Eu2O3. The samples were exposed to a thermal treatment in a laboratory oven at 420 degrees C. X-ray diffraction analysis of the treated samples showed crystalline phases of a variety of metallic oxides, the intensities of which decreased as the Eu doping amount in the samples increased. In all samples, the strongest peak corresponded to ZnTeO3 with a crystallite size of about 36 nm. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy showed that CdO and ZnO change their role from modifier to a glass former. Raman spectra showed characteristic bands corresponding to gamma-TeO2. The observations suggest that Eu2O3 induced structural changes which in turn led to the formation of molecular oxygen in the interstitial network. Deconvolution analysis of Raman spectra and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy images confirmed the formation of Te2O5, ZnTeO3 and Te nanocrystals. Photoluminescence analysis showed that Eu ions are incorporated as Eu3+ and no reduction occurred after heat treatment.

AB Er3+ ions doped Bismuth sodiumfluoroborate glasses with varying Bi2O3 content (0-50 in wt%) have been prepared following the melt quenching technique. The density, molar volume, FTIR and UV-Visible studies have been used to determine physical and structural properties of the prepared glasses. The FTIR studies explores that, addition of Bi2O3 helps the progressive conversion of [BO4] units into [BO3] units thus lead to the creation of non-bridging oxygens (NBOs). The boron-boron separation(< d(B-B) >), oxygen packing density(OPD), bond density(n(b)) and calculated Poisson's ratio (mu(cal)) values are found to decrease with the addition of Bi(2)O(3)thus reveal the fact that the network connectivity decreases due to the formation of non-bridging oxygen sites and the glass network becomes less tightly packed. Further, ionic nature of the Er3+ metal ligand bond was identified from the measured optical basicity (Lambda(th)), covalent and ionic characteristic factors, and bonding parameter (delta) values. The observed variations in the optical electronegativity, basicity, metallization criterion and optical band gap energy (E-g) values have been discussed in terms of the structural changes that takes place due to the addition of Bi2O3 into the B2O3 network. Additionally, radiation shielding properties of the prepared glasses have been studied in the energy range 0.015-15 MeV. The mass attenuation coefficient has been calculated using MCNP5 code and XCOM software. The MCNP5 results match most of the XCOM data very well. Further, the effective atomic number, mean free path and half value layer (HVL) for the titled glasses were computed. The mass attenuation coefficient and the effective atomic number were found to progressively increase with the increase in the Bi2O3 content. The addition of Bi2O3 led to decrease the half value layer which means that more Bi2O3 content enhances the radiation shielding performance for the prepared glasses.

AB High purity fused silica glass can be synthesized by CVD process in which silica particles are generated by precursors reacted in H-2/O-2 flame and deposited on the substrate. Selection of precursors has significant influence on silica particle generation, and further affects particle transport and deposited glass quality. This paper aims to reveal the underlying mechanisms that make silica particles generation different when using the precursors of SiCl4 and OMCTS. Comparative investigations were conducted using the computational fluid dynamics method. When using OMCTS as the precursor, the main reactions of precursor in the H-2/O-2 flame are exothermic. The rapid heat release from the precursor near the burner exit can promote SiO2 generation from endothermic reactions at the center of the jet close to the inlet. When using SiCl4 as the precursor, the main reactions of SiCl4 in the H-2/O-2 flame are endothermic. In this case, the precursor will diffuse further to high temperature H-2/O-2 flame to make SiO2 generation reactions happen. Thus the generated SiO2 will be away from the burner exit. The production efficiency of SiO2 by OMCTS is almost 3 times of that by SiCl4. To achieve a stable and high deposition rate, an oxygen-enriched atmosphere is preferable for both precursors. More fuel is needed for the fused silica glass process using SiCl4 than OMCTS as the precursor.

AB In situ pVT analyses of poly-ionic Na-Zn sulfophosphate liquids and glasses are carried out in conjunction with ex situ structural characterization using Raman and multi-nuclear (P-31 and Na-23) NMR spectroscopy. These ionic liquids exhibit highly homogeneous compaction behavior even close to their densification limit. With proceeding densification, no changes are seen on short-range order, however, both the increasing substitution of phosphate by sulfate and the high-pressure, high-temperature treatments show structural and thermodynamic indications of increasing chemical immiscibility, with the sodium ions preferring to surround the sulfate groups while the zinc ions prefer to neighbor the phosphate groups. It appears that such non-random cation distribution and its enhancement by structural compaction facilitates the densification behaviour of ionic glasses.

AB Porous carbon xerogels were successfully fabricated by carbonization of resorcinol-formaldehyde-phloroglucinol gels in the presence of surfactants. The effect of non-ionic, cationic, anionic and zwitterionic surfactants on the porous structure of carbon xerogels was investigated. Micropore structural carbon xerogels were obtained when a cationic surfactant was used. The result of surface tension test showed the non-ionic surfactant Tween 60 gave the lowest surface tension. Thermal conductivity experiments revealed the carbon xerogels in this work possessed low thermal conductivity and are suitable as thermal insulation materials. The pore size directly determined the thermal conductivity of carbon xerogels, and the thermal conductivity decreased with pore size. Among the obtained samples, the one using hexamethylenetetramine (HTM) exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption capacity (2.89 mmol g(-1)) and adsorption selectivity as a result of the high microporosity (88.0%). Therefore, HTM-CA was identified as a promising material for CO2 adsorption.

The incorporation of micro silica at 5% level increase the composite strength at room temperature, and it is pronounced in the paste at 800 degrees C (50% Strength gain). Thermal stability of the composites was studied using TGA/DTA analysis till 1000 degrees C. The linear dimensional stability of paste and mortar maintained till 800 degrees C without any physical damage. 10% of micro silica addition exerts more filling effect that damage the integrity of the bulk specimen of mortar and concrete thereby decrease the compressive strength. The XRD pattern of paste 0% (M1) and 5% micro silica (M2) confirms the presence of secondary hydration product of semi-crystalline Hydroxysodalite Na4Al3Si3O12OH at room temperature. The higher intensity of Nepheline (NaAlSiO4) and Albite (NaAlSi3O8,) phases in the M2 at 800 degrees C represents the Si and Al-rich N-A-S-H corroborated with the observed chemical shift of Q(4)(4Al) in Si-29 MAS-NMR and the resonance peak shift towards 60 ppm Al(IV) from 0 ppm (Al(VI)) in Al-27 MAS-NMR.

AB The elastic constants and the structural of low silica calcium aluminosilicate glasses with a low content of silica (5-25 mol%) and [CaO]/[Al2O3] = 2, are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, their elastic constants are calculated using two methods: a standard approach at zero temperature and another method designed to work at finite temperature. We show that while they both reproduce qualitatively the experimental behavior, only the method taking temperature into account provides a quantitative agreement with the experimental values. Therefore, taking temperature into account in the determination of elastic constants seems necessary to give a satisfactory account of the mechanical properties of these materials. In accordance with the experimental results, our molecular dynamics calculations show values of elastic constants that decrease with increasing amount of silica in the vitreous network. Then, the structure of the glasses is analyzed in term of pair distribution functions, oxygen kinds, and the parameter of short-range order, and discussed in correlation with the available experimental data. An overall good agreement is obtained with the calculated structure and the experimental data.

AB Glass samples in the system (60-x)P2O5-40SrO-xCoO ((0.0 <= x <= 0.6) mol%) were successfully prepared via melt-annealing route. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data reveal the amorphous nature of examined glasses. A strong absorption band is appeared in all glass samples (pure & doped) in the UV region. This band is considered due to the trace iron impurities that exist within the raw materials used to prepare these samples. Additional absorption bands were appeared in the optical absorption spectra and considered as a result of adding CoO with different concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 mol%), indicating that the divalent cobalt ions (Co2+) exist in the two coordination states (octahedral and tetrahedral) in this glass system. Optical band gap energy, E-opt was calculated and found to be in the range of 3.94-3.5 eV. E-opt decreases as the amount of CoO increases. FT-IR experimental data reveal IR vibrational bands that are featured to the specific structural building units related to the phosphate matrix. The addition of cobalt oxide with small doping quantities together with the presence of cobalt ions in structural modifying sites causes slight variations in the IR spectra.

AB Recent first-principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) results on two chalcogenide glasses (glassy GeS4 and GeSe4) are revisited by accounting explicitly for van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces. This effort is motivated by the observation that such contributions were found to be important in the case of glassy GeTe4 while they were negligible for another disordered chalcogenide system, liquid GeSe2. With the present results, we provide additional evidence intended to establish under which conditions and for which systems the consideration of dispersion forces plays a role in determining the atomic structure. For these purposes we employ two different dispersion schemes used in conjunction with the BLYP (Becke, Lee, Yang and Parr) exchange correlation functional. The first is the DFT-D2 vdW correction introduced by Grimme et al. (Grimme (2006) [1]) while the second is the vdW(w) approach based on the Wannier functions analysis (Silvestrelli, 2008 [2]). The atomic structures obtained agree well with the ones obtained by Bouzid et al. [3] without considering dispersion forces. Due to the vdW interactions, glassy GeSe4 features a higher number of Ge fourfold coordinated. The two vdW approaches also agree to a large extent, exceptions occurring for some moderate differences in the intensity of the peaks in the Ge-Ge pair correlation function.

AB This study focuses on the characterization of heavy metal oxide glasses containing CeO2 as dopant with the aim to enhance its density, as many optical applications of glasses (eg: heavy particles measurement in high energy physics) are heavily dependent on the density of the glass itself. Different concentrations of CeO2 were added to a barium bismuth borate base glass and the relative structural and optical properties were studied. The structure of the obtained material was analysed by means of density measurement, molar volume calculation, X-Ray diffraction, thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that CeO2 promotes the formation of a crystalline phase and improves the density of the base glass. Optical properties were studied, such as transmittance and luminescence, and the obtained results suggest that the crystalline formation scatters light transmittance through the sample, preventing luminescent emission. Further improvements in glass formulation have been suggested in order to enhance its optical properties together with its density.

AB The goal of this article is to explore the dynamic mechanical behavior of annealed and chemically strengthened glass used in transparent laminated structures for buildings, armor and aerospace applications. Static compression (SC) tests were first conducted using the universal testing machine followed by dynamic compression (DC) tests at an average strain rate of 650 s(-1) and 350 s(-1) using modified Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) for annealed and strengthened glass, respectively. In DC tests, high-speed photography and flashlights were made synchronous with a loading pulse to spot the damage/crack initiation, propagation, and fracture process in both types of glasses. Static tests data concerning the compressive strength revealed that annealed glass (AG) showed strain rate sensitivity, in contrast to this chemically strengthened glass (CSG) showed no substantial strain-rate sensitivity. In DC tests compared to SC tests, it was found that both types of glass are rate sensitive and compressive strength remarkably increased at high strain-rate loading. The glass fracture process for both AG & CSG is also analyzed through high-speed imagery recorded during DC tests. The crack initiation, propagation, and glass debris are also discussed to explicate the failure mechanism of glass specimens.

AB A detailed study structure and luminescence properties of Nd3+: Ga2O3-Al2O3-PbO-CaO laser glasses was conducted. The network structure was mainly dominated by Al (IV) or Ga (IV). With the increase of the Al2O3 content, the Al (IV) content increases, whereas the Ga (IV) content decreases. Hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectra reveal Al-27 and Pb-207 weak hyperfine coupling, which indicates that these nuclei are in the second- or higher-order Nd3+ coordination sphere. No Ga-69 or Ga-71 signals can be detected in the three-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (3P-ESEEM) and HYSCORE spectra. For germanate glass, the local environment of the Nd3+ ions is characterized by the Pb ligand, for aluminum gallium glasses, the Nd3+ ions are surrounded by Al3+ and Pb2+ ions, and for aluminum glass, Nd3+ ions are mainly surrounded by Al-27 cations. The change in the structure and in the local environment of Nd3+ ions results in a change in the luminescence properties of glasses.

AB During etching of a multicomponent glass in concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions, a crust can gradually appear on the glass surface, depending on the chemical etching parameters. This crust deposition is the result of the precipitation of hexafluorosilicate anions released by the glass dissolution reaction, with cations coming either from the etching solution or from the glass (like Na K+ or Ca2+). To understand the impact of this crust on the overall kinetics of both the etching and frosting process, we have studied the dissolution of four types of commercial glass substrates in etching solutions containing various concentrations of HF. The kinetics of the frosting process was investigated by two independent methods: on the one hand the chemical analysis by ICP-OES of the amount of Si dissolved from the glass as a function of time, and on the other hand the measurement of the glass weight loss with time. These two methods showed that the glass etching rate decreases with time as a result of crust formation which gradually becomes more protective. Both methods also indicated that increasing the amount of HF in the etching solution increases the etching rate in a non-linear way, and that the etching rate increases with the alumina content of the glass. A separate chemical analysis of the amount of Si present in the crust also revealed that the amount of HF in the etching solution has an impact on the amount of crust deposited on the glass surface. Finally, we have been able to rationalize all these kinetic data based on a semi-empirical quantitative etching and frosting model, allowing to extract a characteristic dissolution and precipitation constant (K-diss and K-dep), respectively.

AB To understand the unique features of germanium sulfide (similar to 60-70 at.% of S) glasses modified with Ga or Sb, the chemical order in these materials is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obtained results are correlated with Raman spectroscopy data and verified with quantum chemical calculations. It is shown that in addition to the regular corner-shared and S-S-shared [SbE3/2] pyramids and [GeS4/2] tetrahedra, a fraction of these structural units can form edge-shared fragments. The obtained XPS results also support the possibility for [SbS5/2] distorted square pyramids formation in Sb-rich glasses. At higher concentrations of antimony, a tendency to the increased concentration of homopolar bonds is observed.

TI Competitive effects of modifier charge and size on mechanical and

AB Lithium aluminoborate glasses exhibit high resistance to cracking under contact loading, but low hardness and poor chemical durability in aqueous media. On the other hand, alkaline earth aluminoborate glasses feature improved chemical resistance and hardness, but lower resistance to cracking. In this work, we investigate the possibility to simultaneously improve the mechanical and chemical resistance of aluminoborate glasses by mixing alkali and alkaline earth modifiers. We study the mixed Li/Ba and Li/Mg aluminoborate glasses, since Li+ and Ba2+ have different charge and size but similar modifier field strength (charge to size ratio), while Mg2+ has the highest field strength among these modifiers due to its small size. The two glass series will thus give insights into the competitive effects of modifier charge and size on glass structure, mechanical properties, and dissolution rates in acidic, neutral, and basic solutions. The substitution of barium for lithium at fixed [Al2O3]/[B2O3] ratio does not affect the network structure and properties, such as hardness and dissolution rate. However, the substitution of magnesium for lithium leads to an increase in hardness and chemical durability for all pH solutions (2, 7, and 14), likely as a result of the increase in the fractions of five- and six-fold coordinated aluminum species and atomic packing density. The glass with 5 mol% Li2O and 20 mol% MgO exhibits the best combination of high hardness and low dissolution rate, while maintaining a good crack-resistance comparable to that of the Li-aluminoborate glass. In both mixed glass series, the lowest dissolution rates are measured in neutral solutions, while those in acidic and especially basic media are higher. The structural origins of the trends in chemical and mechanical properties are discussed based on B-11 and Al-27 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements.

   SPECIATION
AB In this research we correlate the structural parameters obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Raman scattering to construct a self-consistent picture of the glass structure, and its variation from ambient temperature to the supercooled liquid above the glass transition temperature (Tg). The MD results show that the glass structure is composed of SiO4 tetrahedra and PbOx (x = 4, 5) polyhedra. To correlate the Q(n) population obtained from the MD and Raman a second type of Q(3) species is required. The two types of Q(3) species are interpreted as being associated with the bimodal distribution displayed by the Pb-Si pair correlation function. From a MD snapshot is also shown that the second Q(3) species can have a bridging oxygen bound to a Pb ion. As the temperature increases, depolymerization of the Q(n) speciation is observed and confirmed by the oxygen speciation determined from both Raman and MD. The depolymerization of the silica network is consistent with the non-Arrhenian (fragile) viscosity decrease with temperature and may explain this viscosity behavior.

ID SINGLE-CRYSTAL; SILICA; TRANSITION; ENERGY; QUARTZ
AB Packing models have been used as one of powerful analytical tools to investigate atomic structures comprised of single element or metallic alloy. In this study, the structures of SiO2 crystals and glasses were studied by a new packing model. To deal with two-element oxide systems like SiO2, packing structures focused only on oxygen atoms were constructed using the Voronoi tessellation method. First, the method was applied to crystal poly morphs of SiO2. Species of polyhedron, species of polygon and volume of each polyhedron were compared between the polymorphs. The calculated results captured not only structure features inherent in each crystal, but also the indication of structural changes such as alpha-beta transition or corruption of crystal structure. Next, the method was applied to SiO2 glass. The Voronoi analysis distinguished glass from crystals in terms of species of polyhedron. In addition, the same method could distinguish structural changes caused by thermal effects from those by pressure effects. The thermal effects change geometrical symmetry (i.e. shape of polyhedron and polygon) with little change in Voronoi volume, in contrast, the pressure effects change geometrical symmetry less with larger change in Voronoi volume. In addition, a new index, which represents a degree of geometrical similarity between crystals and glasses, was defined in terms of Voronoi polyhedron. In sum, the Voronoi analysis based on oxygen packing is expected to be a promising tool to investigate not only the structure of crystal polymorphs but also that of glass and liquid, taking the complimentary role to the conventional network model.

AB Atom migration, phase structure and magnetic properties in the Fe82Si2B11P4Cu1 amorphous alloy isothermally annealed at various heating rates are investigated. Annealing the samples at a high heating rate promotes the formation of Cu-rich regions and delays the phase separation process to high temperature, which is conductive to increase the volume fraction of the nanocrystalline phase and refine nanograins during the crystallization. When the alloy is isothermally annealed at 758 K for 180 s, the saturation magnetic flux density increases from 1.74 T to 1.79 T and the coercivity decreases from 7.8 A/m to 4.4 A/m with the heating rate increasing from 0.5 K/s to 20 K/s. Meanwhile, it confirms that the occupation of Si atoms in the lattice of bcc-Fe can be suppressed by the annealing with high heating rate. Increasing the heating rate is widely regarded as an effective method to improve soft magnetic properties of Fe-based nanocrystalline alloys. However, it is found that the content of the nonmagnetic atom enriched regions rises with the increase of heating rate, which can reduce the magnetic interaction in the nanocrystalline ribbons. Therefore, the exorbitant heating rate reaching 40 K/s will dramatically promote the aggregation of nonmagnetic atoms and deteriorate the soft magnetic properties.

AB Granulated blast furnace slag (GBS) is a glassy by-product of the steel industry that is formed during quenching of the molten slag after the blast furnace in a water-jet. To elucidate the cooling history of GBS, calorimetric scanning in the glass transition range and viscometric experiments at temperatures above the liquidus were performed. The GBS studied was of industrial origin with a d(50) = 700 mu m and > 99% glassy. It is found that GBS glass is of high potential energy, showing a fictive temperature that is approx. 160 K higher than the glass transition temperature under standard cooling conditions. Using different viscosity models and the relationship between quench rate and shear viscosity at the fictive temperature it is calculated that GBS was formed at a cooling rate of approx. 2.6 x 10(5) K s(-1) corresponding to a shear viscosity of 10(5.9) Pa s. Due to the high T-f and high amount of heat that is released during structural relaxation, GBS is assigned to the class of hyperquenched glasses.

AB This article presents an original work on velocity and stress autocorrelation functions, memory functions, spectral densities and atomic transport properties of two liquid alkali metals (sodium and potassium). For this, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using Green-Kubo relation under the condition of very long-time duration to obtain reliable and accurate results.
   An originality of the present work is that the interatomic forces are described by pair potentials built within the "first principles" pseudopotential formalism using the non-local and energy dependent model potential of Shaw. It is completely free of adjustable parameters since the energy dependent parameters are determined self consistently at the Fermi energy on an absolute energy scale. The Green-Kubo relationship is the main theoretical tool that allows us determining the atomic transport coefficients from appropriate time-autocorrelation functions. An important new result concerns the memory function. We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that it can be depicted as a sum of wavelets. The wavelets with their amazing features emphasize the nature of dynamic processes at the microscopic level. We also compared, for the first time to our knowledge, the spectral density associated to the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF), to experimental values obtained by incoherent inelastic neutron scattering. Finally, the temperature dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient (our previous study) and that of shear viscosity (present work) are both in excellent agreement with experiment.

AB In the present work a new low-cost sol-gel method has been developed to prepare highly porous alumina systems. The prime consideration of this research work was to avoid the complicated and laborious preparation technique and the expensive drying processes. Aluminum oxide hydroxide gel systems were synthesized by a new sol-gel route. The sol-gel process starts from only two chemical compounds; from an aluminum salt and a solvent, and it does not adopt any basic agent or complex formation. All gel systems were dried at atmospheric pressure to obtain xerogels. Different chemical agents (such as gelation agent propylene oxide, surfactant characteristic citric acid and ethyl acetate or basic agent carbamide and urotropine) were applied. Their application was varied in the steps of the sol-gel procedure. Some wet gels were subjected to different treatments (microwave radiation and freezing in vacuum) before the drying process. The cryogels evolved by lyophilization was provided for the comparison. The route of propylene oxide' addition to system reacted for 24 h produces a bead-like structure with the highest porosity and smallest pores in the present work.

AB High-resolution elastic recoil detection analysis (HERDA) has been conducted to quantify outermost OH group on a silica glass surface. The results of HERDA showed that the surface number density of OH groups (silanol number) can be measured with a good reproducibility by heating the sample in vacuum to remove the surface adsorbates. The measured silanol number depends on the temperature and is in good agreement with the result reported for porous silicas. Furthermore, by investigating the relationship between the contact angle of water and the silanol number, it was confirmed that the contact angle increases with decreasing silanol number.

AB Surface tension of some liquid simple metals has been investigated employing the hard sphere theories which were derived from the first and second order approximations of the isothermal compressibility. Atomic transport properties such as diffusion and shear viscosity are also studied for the same systems. The premier ingredients involved in the theories are effective HS diameter, the packing fraction associated with it, and the effective pair potential. For effective calculations, these ingredients are evaluated by using a local pseudopotential, variational modified hypernetted chain integral equation theory (VMHNC) and also using the linearized Weeks-Chandler and Andersen thermodynamic perturbation theory. Calculated results, when compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical values, reveal that the first order approximation theory along with VMHNC predicts much better results than those of the other theoretical values for all concerned systems except for Pb and Al. The cause of discrepancy in the results for Al and Pb is also discussed.

AB Structural investigation of disordered systems rely mainly on atomistic simulations or are inferred from experimental techniques like NMR or X-ray absorption spectroscopy, but there is still a gap when trying to combine them. Based on the structural study of the borosilicate glass ISG, we used a combination of B-11 NMR, X-ray and neutron diffraction, XANES, EXAFS and EPSR atomistic modelling to further investigate the local and medium range order of this specific glass. In particular, we present improved EXAFS fits by using local Zr environment extracted from EPSR simulations, which highlight the role of SiO4, BO3 and BO4 structural units, and the charge sharing role of alkalis in the Zr environment. We also show that multiple scattering paths are likely to be present in EXAFS data for this kind of glass, which leads to important conclusions regarding Zr environment.

AB Pure and Bi doped ZnO thin films prepared by Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method. The structural analysis shows that prepared films are polycrystalline in nature with preferential orientation along (1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) planes. Scanning electron microscope shows the morphological changes of the films with respect to increase in doping concentration. The average optical absorption value of all films was in the near visible range and the band gap of the films varies from 3.21 to 3.17 eV. The gas sensing study shows a maximum response of the films at 1000 ppm of ethanol was found to be around 60% with an operating temperature of 400 degrees C. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to obtain mechanistic understanding of the formation and development of biomedical CaP coating on a model polymer surface of plasma treated polycaprolactone (PCL). Oxygen plasma treatment changed the surface morphology at nanometre scale and introduced negatively charged groups to PCL surface. Nucleation of CaP on the treated PCL surface occurred via two modes of growth, Volmer-Weber and Stranski-Krastanov. EDX and FTIR analysis suggested that the coating progressed from compositions with low Ca/P ratios and solubility to the phases of higher ratios and stability. The results also indicated that CaP clusters formed through Volmer-Weber mode were rich in the CaP phases of the higher Ca/P ratios. This study thus provided mechanistic insights into the coating process of CaP from solution onto functionalized surfaces which could be useful in designing coatings to suit different requirements.

Experiments were carried out with a substrate temperature of 673 K and time-averaged electrical power density of 15.3 W cm(-2). Stabilization of the face-centered cubic, but not the body-centered cubic phase was observed under pulsed-DC compared to conventional DC. This was attributed to increased average adatom energy under pulsed-DC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the natural hydroxyapatite (HA) has been obtained from Corbicula moltkiana shell (CS), which are available as waste from local food processing. The shell can be used as an inexpensive source of natural HA providing at the same time to give added value to food processing by-products as well as reducing the undesirable environmental impact. The synthesized natural HA have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The XRD peaks were in agreement with the standard JCPDS file (ICSD-157481). The material obtained at 900 and 1000 degrees C (HA 900 and HA 1000) have a low crystallinity of hydroxyapatite. At 1000 degrees C, a tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) peak was observed. In addition, the crystal size of HA calculated from XRD pattern was found to be a nanosized crystal of 28.90 nm and 6.31 nm for HA 1000 and HA 900 respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Surface area is an important factor in a nanostructured material based gas sensor. A nanotube has outer as well as inner surfaces, and sensing response can be improved to adopt nanotubes as a gas sensor. Owing to extremely high aspect ratio of the nanotubes, it is difficult for gas molecules to seep into the nanotube; as a result, the sensing response of the nanotube sensor decreases. To improve this problem, porous structured nanotubes are synthesized in this study. Sputtering process is performed on PVA nanowire sacrificial templates with various sputtering power, and the sputtering durations are adjusted to fix the thickness of the nanotube wall to 30 nm. Nonporous ZnO nanotube, porous ZnO nanotube, and porous ZnO film samples are prepared through these procedures. Hydrogen sensing response is examined to study the effects of the morphologies of the nanotubes. The results of these experiments show that the sensing response is improved by 2.5 and 4.2 times as the morphology of the sensor is changed to porous structured ZnO nanotube from nonporous ZnO nanotube or porous ZnO film, respectively. In this study, the morphologies of the nanostructures of these samples are analyzed, and their mechanisms of hydrogen gas sensing are examined. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) composite electrodes were prepared via a wet-filtration-zipping technique. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the composite electrodes at various temperatures were studied. The composite electrodes exhibited electrical conductivity in the range of 1.1 x 10(1)-3.56 x 10(1) S/cm. Further, the thermal conductivity, effusivity and volumetric heat capacity were measured. Cyclic voltammograms confirmed good electrochemical performances and high stability during Li+ ion intercalation/de-intercalation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ARRAYS
AB The galvanic-cell-based synthesis is considered as an effective method for the seed-layer free preparation of ZnO nanorods. However, the nucleation stage of the growth which decides the final structures of ZnO nanorods is still not well-understood. Here we show that the nucleation is almost completed after two minutes of growth and the galvanic-cell-based method results in a condensed ZnO layer beneath of the ZnO nanorods. Beyond this finding, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the galvanic and hydrothermal growth to fabricate the condensed-layer free, well-separated ZnO nanorods that might be compatible for the ZnO-based devices.

AB We investigated the structure-property correlation for the complex concentrated alloy (CCA) coatings prepared using different precursor powders. Al3CoCrFeNi CCA precursor powders were prepared through mechanical alloying (MA) (ball milling) and direct mixing (DM). CCA coatings were developed using microwave technique through hybrid heating approach. Coatings showed good metallurgical bonding with substrate exhibiting cellular growth structure. Microstructure for both coatings was primarily composed of A2 phase segregated with B2 phase at intercellular region. CCA coatings with different precursors showed insignificant influence on hardness, elastic modulus and cavitation erosion. Nonetheless, coating developed with MA precursor showed slightly lower fracture toughness compared to DM, mainly attributed to inherently higher fraction of intermetallic B2 phase. We showed that direct mixing is an efficient and effective route for developing CCA coatings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Selective-laser melting (SLM) is one of the most rapidly developing and promising of all the so-called "Additive Manufacture" routes due to its capability to produce component geometries that would prove impossible using traditional manufacture. A selective-laser melting fabricated cuboid component was built using powder CM247LC, using standard methods, and this was subsequently analysed using neutron tomography methodology to allow for three-dimensional visualisation of the exterior and the interior of the component. The resulting neutron radiographs were processed and analysed for evidence of both porosity and grain boundary segregation within the component. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a Li-doped indium-tin-zinc-oxide (ITZO:Li) thin film transistor was investigated. The ITZO:Li active channel layer was deposited on an SiO2/Si substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The micro structure of the active channel layer is amorphous, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns. The transmittance of the films is above 80% for the visible region (400-700 nm), which indicates excellent optical transparency. The band gap energy of films annealed at 325 degrees C is about 3.71 eV from the absorption spectrum. It was demonstrated that TFTs fabricated using Li-doped ITZO have fewer oxygen vacancies and enhanced mobility compared to that of undoped ITZO TFTs. The obtained TFTs operate in enhancement mode with a threshold voltage of 0.4 V, a saturation mobility of 39.1 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), and an on/off current ratio of 8.0 x 10(6).

AB beta Crystallographic characteristics of the beta-Mg17Al12 phase have been investigated in the pre-compressed and aged Mg-9.0 wt%Al-1.0 wt%Zn alloy. Due to pre-compression, morphologies of the beta phases became much wider and shorter. The aspect ratio was reduced dramatically. Besides, octahedron shaped beta phase with Crawley OR have been observed and portion of the beta phase with Crawley OR increased. The twins generated by compression affect the ORs of the beta phase. The OR between the beta particle and the {10-12} twin is: [1-210](alpha)//[11 -1](beta), (0002)(alpha) near parallel to (1-2-1)(beta). ORs between beta particles and the {10-11} twin were more complex. Two typical ORs between the beta particles and the {10-11} twin have been identified as: [1-21-3](T)//[110](beta 1), (1-101)(T)//(3 -30)(beta 1) and [1-21-3](T)//[113](beta 2), (0-111)(T)//(21-1)(beta 2), which have rarely been reported before.

The photocatalytic activity of the materials prepared was tested for photodegradation under UV-light of model organic dyes pollutants, in aqueous media. The powder catalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic efficiency towards degradation of all three tested dyes, compared to the films. The materials containing 2.5 wt% ZnO are usually more efficient than these with 5 wt% ZnO. The highest degree of degradation (97%) was achieved for Malachite Green dye, using m-PBI/2.5 wt% ZnO powder. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed time-resolved fractal dimension analysis in ferroelectric copolymer films in order to understand the effect of polarization relaxation on domain wall roughness. Interestingly, the progressive polarization relaxation of irregular domains results from the domain back reversal at the boundaries where the antiparallel polarization encounters, and therefore has a significant influence on the fractal dimension of the irregular domains as a function of time.

AB In the present study, Janus type Ag: SnO2 heterojunction has been synthesized by a green route and has been utilized as a photocatalyst for the degradation of Doripenem, a prototype for emerging antibiotic pollutant. The kinetics of photodegradation of Doripenem was studied in aqueous solutions under solar and UV irradiation conditions. The rate constant for the photodegradation under UV irradiation was found to be 1.39 x 10(-2) min(-1). The obtained results, under the adopted conditions, indicated a marked influence of heterojunction structure and frequency of irradiation on the photodegradation rates of Doripenem.

   process and their thermoelectric properties
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Thermoelectrics; Bi2Te3; Oxygen content; Plasma activated sintering
ID POWDERS
AB Oxygen content in n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys plays a crucial role in determining the thermoelectric properties. We aimed to control the residual oxygen that originated from the ball milling process; for this, sintering processes such as spark plasma sintering (SPS) and plasma activated sintering (PAS) were utilized. The reduction of oxygen content was successfully achieved with PAS, leading to improved electrical properties. With the removal of residual oxygen, the carrier concentration increased, resulting in reduced electrical resistivity. The phonon thermal conductivity was reduced due to the grain size of this sample, which was smaller than that of the hot-pressed (HP) samples. An enhanced value of the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of 0.83 at 473 K, an increase of 25.2% compared with that of the HP samples, was achieved. The selection of the appropriate sintering process should be considered to remove oxygen content, as well as to minimize grain growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A single-trace copper wall is deposited by laser metal deposition and oxygen is introduced via removing the vacuum protection equipment. The corresponding microstructures at different positions are characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Graded microstructures with the equiaxed grains of copper, macro-precipitates of Cu2O in top position and equiaxed grains, macro-precipitates and nano-precipitates of Cu2O in bottom position are obviously observed. The macro-precipitates are formed in the primary thermal cycle while the nano-precipitates are formed in the latter thermal cycles and contribute to larger hardness. This work reveals the microstructure evolution of Cu2O precipitate and indicate the specific mechanical priority of copper production by additive manufacturing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Neutral sodium sulfate aqueous solution was used as a testing electrolyte and the effects of monomer solvent on the electrode performance were studied. Results show that the sample prepared in ethanol solution has much better capacitance performance than that in acetone or aqueous solutions. The potential window of the electrode could be enlarged to 2 V (-0.2-1.8V) and the highest energy density of the active material reached 727.3 J/g. The composite electrode also has excellent rate and cycling performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Addition of ZrC to ZrB2 is favored to improve the fracture toughness of ZrB2. In this paper, ZrB2-ZrC composite nanofibers with eutectic composition are fabricated by electrospinning and carbothermal reduction. The precursors prepared by electrospinning are smooth and uniform. ZrB2-ZrC composite nanofibers could be fabricated by heat-treatment of precursors at 1300 degrees C in argon. Heat-treatment temperature influences the crystalline structure and grain size of nanofibers. The diameter of ZrB2-ZrC composite nanofibers is about 250 nm. The mole ratio of ZrB2 and ZrC in the nanofibers is 47:53, very close to the eutectic composition of ZrB2-ZrC composites. Some amorphous carbon is present in the nanofibers. The effect of heat-treatment temperature on amorphous carbon content is analyzed. The interface between ZrB2 and ZrC nano-grains is characterized. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fatigue life of a Fe-15Mn-10Cr-8Ni-4Si seismic damping alloy, undergoing cyclic deformation-induced martensitic transformation from face-centered-cubic austenite to hexagonal-close-packed martensite, is investigated at extremely high strain amplitudes at which common steels exhibit extremely low cycle fatigue (ELCF) with a fatigue life (N-f) less than 10(2) cycles. Hourglass-shaped specimens were subjected to diametral strain-controlled cyclic tension-compression loading at room temperature with axial strain amplitudes ranging from 4 x 10(2) to 1 x 10 (1). The alloy exhibits superior N-f, for example, 112 cycles at the axial strain amplitude of 8 x 10(2), at which a carbon steel is reported to fail at less than 10 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the N-f of the alloy is the highest ever among ferrous alloys and steels at extremely high strain amplitudes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geopolymer materials based on metakaolin were produced using KOH and ecofriendly silica sources, such as rice husk ash and silica fume. The geopolymer produced by ecofriendly alkaline activators had mechanical properties that are similar to the geopolymer synthesized with commercial potassium silicate. Upon exposure of the geopolymer to high temperatures, it maintained thermal stability. Its residual compression strength after exposure to 600 degrees C reached 50 MPa, and at 1200 degrees C, it was 110-150 MPa. Exposure to high temperature resulted in sintering processes, structural rearrangement and formation of crystalline phases such as leucite, kalsilite and mullite. Additionally, upon production of 1 m(3) of ecofriendly geopolymer paste, the global warming potential emissions were reduced by 47.45% (RHA100) and 39.4% (SF100) compared with commercial potassium silicate.

TI ArchCam: Real time expert system for suspicious behaviour detection in

AB Automated Teller Machine (ATM) offers great convenience to many people by allowing quick bank transactions and cash withdrawal. However, ATM machines are also vulnerable to attacks when they are unattended during non-office hours and public holidays. Recently, many ATM machines were reported being removed from the premises or damaged using various methods in order to steal the cash inside. Due to this reason, many ATM sites are actually equipped with video surveillance systems to monitor the environment for crime prevention. However, it is difficult for security personnel to pin-point the crime scene in real time when the number of surveillance cameras increases. In this paper, a real time security expert video surveillance system was proposed to detect the suspicious behaviour by utilizing image processing techniques. The proposed expert system, hereafter referred to as ArchCam, is capable in detecting suspicious behaviours that attempt to remove or attack the ATM machines and provide early warning to the centralized video surveillance system. The suspicious behaviour that ArchCam detects include squatting/climbing (attempt to remove security alarm system or place a bomb) and carrying "belt shape" object (attempt to remove the ATM). The squatting/climbing activity is detected through novel technique to estimate the height of the moving object(s) in front of ATM. On the other hand, the "belt shape" object is detected through estimation of object width by using region splitting and merging technique. With the intelligence of detecting suspicious behaviour, the proposed expert system can effectively alert the security personnel to take proactive actions before the cash is being robbed from the ATM machines. This greatly reduces the effort for security personnel as they only need to observe the camera videos with suspicious behaviour, which on the other hand help to improve the possibility of detecting actual crime scene in real time. ArchCam was implemented in an embedded system with GPU platform and has been verified in a simulated ATM setup with good detection accuracy and fast computational timing performance.

ID SIMPLIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Symbolic regression is an important application area of genetic programming (GP), aimed at finding an optimal mathematical model that can describe and predict a given system based on observed input response data. However, GP convergence speed towards the target model can be prohibitively slow for large-scale problems containing many variables. With the development of artificial intelligence, convergence speed has become a bottleneck for practical applications. In this paper, based on observations of real-world engineering equations, generalized separability is defined to handle repeated variables that appear more than once in the target model. To identify the structure of a function with a possible generalized separability feature, a multilevel block building (MBB) algorithm is proposed in which the target model is decomposed into several blocks and then into minimal blocks and factors. The minimal factors are relatively easy to determine for most conventional GP or other non-evolutionary algorithms. The efficiency of the proposed MBB has been tested by comparing it with Eureqa, a state-of-the-art symbolic regression tool. Test results indicate MBB is more effective and efficient; it can recover all investigated cases quickly and reliably. MBB is thus a promising algorithm for modeling engineering systems with separability features. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The explosion in the rate, quality and diversity of image acquisition instruments has propelled the development of expert systems to organize and query image collections more efficiently. Recommendation systems that handle scientific images are rare, particularly if records lack metadata. This paper introduces new strategies to enable fast searches and image ranking from large pictorial datasets with or without labels. The main contribution is the development of pyCBIR, a deep neural network software to search scientific images by content. This tool exploits convolutional layers with locality sensitivity hashing for querying images across domains through a user-friendly interface. Our results report image searches over databases ranging from thousands to millions of samples. We test pyCBIR search capabilities using three convNets against four scientific datasets, including samples from cell microscopy, microtomography, atomic diffraction patterns, and materials photographs to demonstrate 95% accurate recommendations in most cases. Furthermore, all scientific data collections are released. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sentiment summarization is the process of automatically creating a compressed version of the opinionated information expressed in a text. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to summarize user's opinion expressed in reviews using: (1) Sentiment knowledge to calculate a sentence sentiment score as one of the features for sentence-level classification. It integrates multiple strategies to tackle the following problems: sentiment shifter, the types of sentences and word coverage limit. (2) Word embedding model, a deep-learning-inspired method to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words and to extract a vector representation for each word. (3) Statistical and linguistic knowledge to determine salient sentences.
   The proposed method combines several types of features into a unified feature set to design a more accurate classification system ("True": the extractive reference summary; "False": otherwise). Thus, to achieve better performance scores, we carried out a performance study of four well-known feature selection techniques and seven of the most famous classifiers to select the most relevant set of features and find an efficient machine learning classifier, respectively. The proposed method is applied to three different datasets and the results show the integration of support vector machine-based classification method and Information Gain (IG) as a feature selection technique can significantly improve the performance and make the method comparable to other existing methods. Furthermore, our method that learns from this unified feature set can obtain better performance than one that learns from a feature subset. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB HIV-1 protease site helps to understand the specificity of substrates which antagonizes AIDS by restraining the replication of HIV-1 through inhibitors. Identification of HIV-1 protease cleavage sites by experimental methods are usually labor-intensive thus time-consuming. Several computational intelligence methods have been evaluated to predict cleavage sites. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of encoding techniques in general, more research is needed to provide advance confidence in computational results. The success of an HIV cleavage site prediction system depends heavily on two things: the classifier being used and the features encoding technique applied. For the cleavage sites identification, the role of appropriate feature encoding has not been paid adequate importance. In this investigation, we use two novel ideas for HIV Cleavage site prediction. First, we propose an optimal ensemble formation technique that optimizes the search space of 2(28) formed by seven encoding techniques and four SVM kernels (7 x 4) with the use of genetic algorithm. The second is the utilization of area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC) as a fitness measure for the evaluation of optimal ensemble. The evolutionary algorithm is encoded with binary strings to decide the correlation between the encoding-classifier pair in an ensemble. The proposed method with new ensembling encoding-classifier pair increases the HIV cleavage site prediction significantly. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed by evolutionary-based ensemble model and hence becomes a valid and best alternative for peptide classification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the focus is on the application of prototype selection to multi-label data sets as a preliminary stage in the learning process. There are two general strategies when designing Machine Learning algorithms that are capable of dealing with multi-label problems: data transformation and method adaptation. These strategies have been successfully applied in obtaining classifiers and regressors for multi label learning. Here we investigate the feasibility of data transformation in obtaining prototype selection algorithms for multi-label data sets from three prototype selection algorithms for single-label. The data transformation methods used were: binary relevance, dependent binary relevance, label powerset, and random k-labelsets. The general conclusion is that the methods of prototype selection obtained using data transformation are not better than those obtained through method adaptation. Moreover, prototype selection algorithms designed for multi-label do not do an entirely satisfactory job, because, although they reduce the size of the data set, without affecting significantly the accuracy, the classifier trained with the reduced data set does not improve the accuracy of the classifier when it is trained with the whole data set.

AB Knowledge-based systems including expert systems are one of the core components of clinical decision support systems. Nonetheless, modeling the uncertainty in medical knowledge is one of the main challenges of developing and employing such systems. Among various disorders, mental disorders are especially difficult to model because of their interconnected symptoms that give rise to complex outcomes such as resistance to different treatments. Here, we propose a network-based classification framework to distinguish treatment resistant schizophrenia patients from treatment responsive ones. Within this network-based framework, different antipsychotic medications are considered as external agents that change different properties of a symptoms interaction network where each node of the network represents one symptom. The overall goal of this study is to identify the symptoms that play a major role in responsiveness of the patients to antipsychotic medications. The proposed framework was tested using Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) dataset and compared with three other commonly used feature selection methods: reliefF, Support Vector Machine (SVM) weights, and information gain. According to the results, features selected based on information gain and network analysis provided better classification performance, while the latter also considered the interactions of symptoms and is more interpretable.

TI Evolving dynamic fitness measures for genetic programming
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English

DE Genetic programming; Genetic algorithm; Fitness
ID CONFIGURATION; ALGORITHM
AB This research builds on the hypothesis that the use of different fitness measures on the different generations of genetic programming (GP) is more effective than the convention of applying the same fitness measure individually throughout GP. Whereas the previous study used a genetic algorithm (GA) to induce the sequence in which fitness measures should be applied over the GP generations, this research uses a meta- (or high-level) GP to evolve a combination of the fitness measures for the low-level GP. The study finds that the meta-GP is the preferred approach to generating dynamic fitness measures. GP systems applying the generated dynamic fitness measures consistently outperform the previous approach, as well as standard GP on benchmark and real world problems. Furthermore, the generated dynamic fitness measures are shown to be reusable, whereby they can be used to solve unseen problems to optimality. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English

ID QUANTIZATION; DESIGN
AB There are several problems associated with quantization that affect the networked control systems (NCSs). For instance, the performance degradation of the system and the data rate constrains in the communication channel. In addition to this, in many situations it is necessary to minimize the traffic in the network to save resources like bandwidth or energy. To tackle such problems, this article proposes a variation of a novel type of event-triggered dynamic quantizer that uses knowledge of the input signals to minimize the system's performance degradation, satisfy data rate constraints, and reduce the amount of traffic that the system puts in the network. The input signals knowledge is codified in a device called event-generator that decides when to send data to the plant. The quantizer design problem is formulated as a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, which is solved using metaheuristics. The quantizer effectiveness is tested with several numerical examples and the design method is compared with previously developed ones showing superior performance. This study shows the viability of using a decision making device to reduce the traffic in the network at the same time of maintaining a low degradation in the system's performance.

AB Appetite can be effectively reduced by targeting the production, secretion, circulation time or receptor of the enteric satiety hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The objective of this study was to investigate the potency of Irish Cheddar cheeses to modulate GLP-1 levels. Nine out of ten water-soluble extracts (WSEs) of representative Irish Cheddar cheeses, post 6 months ripening, significantly (p < 0.05) stimulated active GLP-1 secretion from the mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1. This secretion was associated with protein content and ripening time of cheese. C-57BL/6 mice (n = 9/10), who received the most potent sample, C2-WSE-8 M, had a significantly reduced cumulative food intake at 6 h compared to control (p < 0.05), but not overall treatment x time effect over a 7 h period. Simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, that models the upper human gut, indicated loss of GLP-1 stimulating activity once C2-WSE-8M entered the intestinal phase, suggesting efficacy of C2-WSE-8M will depend on protection during gut transit.

AB Quality parameters of acai juice processed with ultrasound-assisted, ozone and the combined methods were analyzed in this work. Two ultrasound energy densities (350 and 700 J.mL(-1)) and two ozonization times (5 and 10 min with 1.5 ppm) were analyzed for pure acai juice and 8 different treatments (22 complete factorial). To evaluate the quality parameters of the juice, physical-chemical analyzes such as pH, titratable acidity, cloud value, non-enzymatic browning, rheology, antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS), phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, enzymatic activity (peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) and microbial counts (mesophilic bacteria, molds and yeasts) were conducted. The treatments with ozone were better for microbial inactivation and the ultrasound for enzymatic inactivation. In general, the use of non-thermal methods can be a good alternative for the processing of acai juice.

AB To assess the suitability of southern-Australian macroalgae as potential marine resources for fatty acids (FA), and in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), analysis of 61 species, comprising of 11 Chlorophyta, 17 Phaeophyceae (Ochrophyta) and 33 Rhodophyta, was conducted. Total fatty acid (TFA) concentrations varied considerably (between 0.6 and 7.8 in % of dry weight (DW)) between species, with on average the highest concentrations being in the Phaeophyceae, then the Chlorophyta, and with the Rhodophyta recording the lowest average concentrations. Results revealed significant differences in the fatty acid profiles of the three algal groups. Most species exhibit high proportions of PUFA in their fatty acid profile and a low ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA. These properties highlight the potential for southern-Australian macroalgae to be used for these FA in food, animal feed and nutraceutical applications.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are non-reactive flame retardants listed among the persistent organic pollutants. This study assesses the levels and health risk of PBDEs in foods commonly consumed by the adult population in Southwest Nigeria. Eight different food categories were collected and extracted using standard QuEChERS protocol prior to analysis by gas chromatography with micro electron capture detector. Aquatic foods had the highest maximum concentration of the eight PBDEs congeners, 748 pg/g; followed by 80.3 pg/g and 54.9 pg/g in edible oil and meat products, respectively. Dairy products had the lowest concentration (0.46 pg/g). The estimated average dietary intake of PBDEs by an adult was 131 pg/kg bw/day. Based on the levels of PBDEs found in common foods consumed by the adult population in Southwest Nigeria, there is unlikely to be a health risk. However, there is a need to investigate the dietary intake of PBDEs in other food categories, especially by vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly.

AB Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) has been demonstrated to extend the shelf-life of food products, being also a potential source of bioactive compounds. The aim of this research was to optimize the ultrasound assisted extraction employing beta-cyclodextrin aqueous solutions as no-contaminant technology and Response Surface Methodology to obtain thyme extracts with the maximum antioxidant capacity. The optimal extraction conditions were: a solution of beta-ciclodextrin 15 mM, an ultrasonic treatment time of 5.9 min at a temperature of 36.6 degrees C. They resulted in an extract with a polyphenolic content of 189.3 mg GAE/mL, an antioxidant activity (DPPH center dot) of 14.8 mg GAE/mL, and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) of 3.3 mg GAE/mL. Interestingly, the extract demonstrated to inhibit the production of Maillard browning products and can be considered a potential anti-glycant agent. The obtained data is important for developing eco-friendly technologies in order to obtain natural antioxidant extracts with a potential inhibitory capacity of Maillard glycation reaction.

AB Kinetic study on the complexation of syringic acid with Fe(III) was described in aqueous solution at pH 9.0 together with a reappraisal of spectral evidence for chelate formation. The complexation reaction was found to be a first-order with rate constants for k(1) (formation) 3.67x10(-2) min(-1). Additionally, the effect of concentration and temperature on the complexation reaction was investigated. The gustatory properties of the isolated complex were investigated and complex showed no metallic taste. The isolated complex was stable at pH 9.0. The apparent activation energy of the complexation reaction was evaluated to be 168 kcal/mol. The total iron content was determined in the isolated complex by AAS technique and was found 0.0073/100 ml. The specific rotation of the complex was found at -85 degrees.

AB The following oligostilbenoids were isolated from extracts of Vitis vinifera L. Pinot Noir grape canes produced at a pilot-plant scale: (E)-epsilon-viniferin, (E)-resveratrol, (E)-piceatannol, ampelopsin A, vitisin B, pallidol, (E)-delta-viniferin, (E)-omega-viniferin, (E)-trans-cis-miyabenol C, isorhapontigenin, scirpusin A, and a new isomer named iso-scirpusin A. The antioxidant capacity of the isolated stilbenoids was studied by three different assays, and their 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) against cancer cells was determined by MTT reduction assay. Besides (E)resveratrol, stilbenoids have outstanding antioxidant capacity in the ORAC-FL assay. The strongest anti-proliferative effect was observed for (E)-piceatannol and ampelopsin A against the bladder cancer cell line J82. (E)-Piceatannol has inhibitory effect on human lung cancer SK-MES-1 cells. Moreover, the whole extract has antiproliferative effect on all tested cell lines. In conclusion, beside (E)-resveratrol, grape cane extract contains oligostilbenoids with potential health benefits. This underexploited viticultural residue has the potential to produce valuable phytochemicals or ingredients in functional foods.

AB Malbec wines from 27 parcels from the three most important winemaking regions of Mendoza, Argentina, were produced under standardized winemaking conditions, and analyzed for phenolic composition and by means of sensory descriptive analysis. Different methods of characterization and cluster analysis for each data matrix showed that some locations of Mendoza could be significantly separated from each other. The results of unsupervised statistical methods were compared using a test for similarities and divergences, also showing that different locations may be associated. The current report is the first one characterizing Malbec wines from the three major producing regions of Argentina using two different ways for locations classification. The effects of climate and geographical origin of Malbec grapes on the quality parameters of resulting wines were also evidenced. These results have enological and viticulture interest for the winemaking industry as the vineyard site selection for Malbec can considerably affect quality attributes.

AB A moisture-sensitive 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline zinc chloride complex (2AP-ZnCl2) was successfully encapsulated by spray-chilling, using a hydrophobic moisture barrier as a practical way to protect the complex and to help facilitate its general use in food applications. Use of octacosane as wall material provided a flavor retention of 65.3%. The results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro-CT) indicated desirable morphological characteristics of the matrix type microcapsules. Gas chromatography (GC) and absorbance spectroscopy were used for chemical quantitation of 2AP and ZnCl2, respectively, in the microcapsules. Results revealed no degradation of 2AP occurred as a result of the encapsulation process. This study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of producing high quality microcapsules from labile flavor complexes by spray-chilling. The use of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances, including 2AP and ZnCl2, may allow for widespread commercial use of 2AP as a flavor ingredient.

AB Edible fungi have strong ability to transform inorganic Se into organic forms. Therefore, different concentrations of selenite, selenate and Se-yeast were injected as Se-supplements into substrates to produce Se-enriched Lentinula edodes. The Se content and its speciation distribution in the fruit bodies of L. edodes were analysed at different harvest times. Results indicate that Se concentrations of L. edodes increased first and then decreased over time. Based on Se accumulation in L. edodes, selenium use efficiency was ranked as selenite > selenate > Se-yeast. SeMet was the predominant Se speciation in the fruit bodies of L. edodes. SeMet made up the biggest proportion of total Se content and increased with application time for selenite and selenate treatments, whereas no significant change was found for Se-yeast treatment. This study demonstrates that Se-enriched L. edodes is a good source of dietary Se.

AB Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a heme peroxidase with various applications in industry and medicine. In this study, the effects of ectoine, as a compatible solute, on the structure, thermal stability, thermodynamic parameters, activity, and stability of LPO have been investigated. The results showed that the catalytic activity of LPO was improved by increasing ectoine concentration. The UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and FTIR spectra studies indicated that ectoine could bind to the LPO spontaneously. Moreover, ectoine increased the enzyme Tm and Gibbs free energy. The fluorescence measurements showed that LPO fluorescence was quenched in the presence of ectoine. The quenching mechanism was probably a static quenching by forming a ground state complex. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that hydrogen bonding and Vander Waals forces played a key role in the LPO-ectoine interaction process. The findings suggest that ectoine could be used as a lactoperoxidase stabilizing agent for industrial or medical purposes.

AB In the present study, we investigated the trapping of methylglyoxal (MGO) by propyl gallate (PG), a known food grade antioxidant, and the anti-carbonyl and anti-oxidative properties of the mono-MGO adduct of PG (MM-PG). Our result indicated that more than 77.5% MGO was suppressed by PG after a 30 min incubation of PG with MGO, which was much more effective than gallic acid (15.2%). For the first time, MM-PG was purified, and its structure was elucidated based on the analysis of its H-1, C-13, and 2D-NMR data. We also demonstrated that MM-PG had strong anti-oxidative and anti-carbonyl activities. Furthermore, PG could trap the MGO generated during the preparation of roasted pork, and both mono-and di-MGO adducts of PG were detected in the roasted pork system using LC/MS technique. Thus, PG could be widely applied in the food system for inhibiting the formation of both carbonyl species and oxidative species.

AB The elevated CO2 was applied to the strawberry fruit during storage at 0 degrees C, in which its effects on energy metabolism and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt pathway were investigated. 10% and 20% CO2 maintained quality of the fruit. The energy charge of 10% and 20% CO2-treated fruit was decreased by 7.58% and 23.93% on day 12, respectively, compared with the control fruit, which was associated with the decline of NADH/NAD(+). The GABA in 10% and 20% CO2-treated fruit was increased by 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold compared with the control fruit on day 12, respectively. The accumulation of GABA resulted from the decrease of GABA transaminase activity and gene expression, which may partially contribute to the decrease of NADH at later storage. These results indicated that 20% CO2 is an optimal concentration for strawberry fruit to prolong the storage to 12 days.

AB Hydrothermal pretreatments including steam explosion and subcritical water (SCW) facilitate hydrolyses of plant cell wall materials and supply environmentally friendly extraction solvents to recover value added compounds. In this study, effect of steam and SCW and temperature (160, 180 and 200 degrees C, 5 min) on yield and beta-sitosterol content of pomace oil and phenolics were compared for value added utilization of olive pomace. Compared to acid hydrolysis, hydrothermal pretreatments yielded similar oil recovery. 54-76% of the bound oil and 18-32% of the bound beta-sitosterol of the pomace were recovered by hydrothermal pretreatments. Steam pretreatment was more effective than SCW pretreatment at lower temperatures, however SCW showed increasing trend on oil yield related to steam pretreatment. As further research on process development, use of sequential temperature might be investigated, starting with steam explosion (<180 degrees C), followed by SCW pretreatment (>200 degrees C) to obtain multiple, aqueous and meal, fractions for total valorization of olive pomace.

AB Disassembly of cell wall polysaccharides accompanied with softening is very common in harvested fruits. To develop a facile postharvest approach, which can be used at ambient temperature, for suppressing softening and maintaining higher nutritive cell wall polysaccharides of Younai plums, influences of paper containing 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on firmness, activities of cell wall-degrading enzymes, and contents of cell wall polysaccharide in Younai plums during storage at 25 +/- 1 degrees C were investigated. As compared to the control plums, 1.2 mu L.L-1 1-MCP-treated plums exhibited higher firmness, lower activities of cell wall-degrading enzymes (pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, cellulase and beta-galactosidase), higher contents of cell wall polysaccharides (sodium carbonate-soluble pectin, chelate-soluble pectin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses), and lower content of water-soluble pectin. The results suggested that paper containing 1-MCP, which was convenient to apply under ambient temperature, could significantly inhibit activities of cell wall degrading-enzymes and decrease disassembly of cell wall polysaccharides, and subsequently retard softening in Younai plums.

AB The aim of this study was to establish a new dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) technique for the determination of iron concentration in aqueous solutions and fruit juices based on the reaction between iron and 3-hydroxy-1-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylpyridin-4(1H)-one (3-OH-PMPO) as a chelating agent. A central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize the effects of independent parameters (pH, volume of disperser solvent and extractant solvent and chelating agent concentration) on extraction efficiency. Under the optimized conditions, the analytical curve is linear in a concentration range of 10-750 mu gL(-1) with a detection limit of 5 mu gL(-1). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for ten repeated determinations of iron concentrations at 40 and 200 mu gL(-1) was calculated to be 4.2% and 1.2%, respectively. Relative recovery of iron in several water samples was investigated and the average was obtained in the range of 91-108%.

AB Pulsed electric field (PEF) processing of white grapes (cv. Garganega) after crushing was studied on pilot-plant scale, to investigate the effects of the treatment on must and wine composition, wine color and predisposition to browning, wine aroma compounds and extraction of aroma precursors from grapes. PEF pre-treatment of grapes did not change the must or wine basic composition, nor was it able to modify the evolution of alcoholic fermentation. By contrast, PEF produced an increase in total dry extract, wine color and total phenolics. Treatment corresponding to a total specific energy of 22 kJ kg(-1) allowed more intense extraction of varietal aroma precursors without provoking excessive color evolution and extraction of phenolic compounds, apparently increasing the stability of wine towards oxidation. Due to the few papers available on this subject, PEF applications on white grapes should be optimized in further experiments.

AB Phytosterols can lower LDL-cholesterol and are frequently used by the functional food industry. However, little is known regarding how phytosterol crystallisation can be controlled, despite solubilised phytosterols having improved bioaccessibility. This study investigates phytosterol crystallisation in bulk milk fat and in model dairy emulsion systems at two average droplet sizes, 1.0 and 0.2 mu m. The effect of lecithin and monoacylglycerol addition on phytosterol crystallisation for both emulsion and bulk systems was also evaluated. Results demonstrated that lecithin and monoacylglycerols enrichment into the bulk system minimised phytosterol crystallisation. However, in emulsions, phytosterol crystallisation was mainly influenced by decreasing the droplet size. Smaller emulsion droplets containing lecithin showed the greatest potential for decreasing phytosterol crystallisation and had improved physicochemical stability. This information can be employed by the functional food industry to minimise phytosterol crystallisation and possibly improve bioaccessibility.

AB The effect of sourdough amount and storage time on starch digestibility and estimated glycemic index (eGI) of tef bread was investigated. The rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) of 0-30% sourdough fresh tef breads ranged from 49 to 58, 16 to 29 and 20 to 26 g/100 g starch, respectively. Storage of tef breads up to 5 days decreased the RDS by more than 2-fold while SDS and RS increased by 2 and 3 fold, respectively. The eGI for fresh and stored breads ranged from 39 to 89. Addition of sourdough increased the eGI of fresh breads while no uniform pattern was seen in the stored breads. As the storage time increased, all the breads showed a decrease in eGI. In vivo study is necessary to further investigate the effect of sourdough on GI of tef bread.

AB Effects of pectin with different molecular weight (Mw) on gelatinization behavior, textural properties, retrogradation, and in vitro digestibility of corn starch (CS) were investigated. The pectin addition led to the decrease of peak, setback, and final viscosities of CS, and a further decrease was provided with the pectin of high Mw, whereas the pasting temperature was increased. The syneresis of starch gel during freeze-thaw process was reduced by the addition of pectin. High Mw pectin significantly lowered the hardness of the starch gel from 238.9 and 350.2 N to 222.7 and 318.5 N after 7 and 14 days storage (P < 0.05), respectively. Compared with the retrograded CS alone, the relative crystallinity of starch-pectin mixtures significantly decreased (P < 0.05), but the crystal type of starch remained unchanged. A significant increase was observed in both the proportion of slowly digestible starch and resistant starch for retrograded starch-pectin mixtures.

AB Spirulina platensis is a high-nutrient blue-green alga with a long history as a food supplement. In this study, the mixed fermentation of Spirulina with Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus subtilis was investigated using random-centroid optimization to improve deodorization of off-flavor and hydrolysis of protein. Fermented Spirulina with the maximum total viable counts of both organisms achieved best sensory characteristics and degree of proteolysis among those with different maximum biomass. The mixed fermentation noticeably reduced the volatile compounds of Spirulina, and yielded the highest relative contents (>85%) of acetoin and other odorants collectively producing a creamy aroma. Approximately one-third of the Spirulina proteins were hydrolyzed, yielding over 16% polypeptides and increasing the ratio of essential amino acids to total free amino acids to 1.5-fold compared with unfermented Spirulina. Fermentation with B. subtilis and L. plantarum effectively improved the odor and protein availability of Spirulina.

AB Hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) roes were used to produce a salted fermented (jeotgal-like) roe product at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The impact of the fermentation temperature on the microbiological status, proximate analysis, acidity, colour, fatty acid profile and cholesterol content were determined over a 4-week fermentation period. Total bacterial count and total LAB (expressed as log CFU) increased with fermentation time (p < 0.001). Fermentation temperature did not affect the proximate analysis, but fermentation time increased both the ash content and decreased the protein and moisture contents in the roe (p < 0.001, for all). Products produced at 25 degrees C had a lighter colour (p < 0.001) compared to products produced at 4 degrees C. Fermentation did not affect the roe fatty acid profile, but cholesterol content in the roe was reduced (p < 0.001) at both fermentation temperatures. Results suggest that fermentation can be a feasible approach to reduce cholesterol levels in fish roe.

AB The goal of this study was to compare anthocyanin extraction from Arbutus unedo L. fruits, by using two techniques assisted by different energy sources, heat and ultrasound. In order to obtain the conditions that maximize anthocyanin extraction, a response surface methodology was applied using the circumscribed central composite design of three variables with five levels. Three anthocyanin compounds were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS, being cyanidin-3-glucoside the main molecule. Heat assisted extraction proved to be the most effective method at 5 min, 90 degrees C and 80% of ethanol, yielding 51.2% of extract, with a total anthocyanin content of 382.4 mu g/g dried fruit, and 744.6 mu g/g extract. These response values were slightly improved by studying the solid/liquid effect at the optimal conditions in dose-response format, showing steady extraction values from 5 to 40 g/L. Results show the possibility of using A. unedo fruits as a source of anthocyanin compounds for industrial applications.

AB This study was aimed to verify the regional traceability of Agaricus bisporus mushroom using unique delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, and delta S-34 features combined with chemometric approaches. Ten cultivars from 15 mushroom farms in six regions of Korea were measured their isotopic signatures by stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, and delta S-34 values were significantly different among mushrooms collected from six cultivation regions (P < 0.05). Multi-dimensional plots including the delta N-15 and delta S-34 values demonstrated clear regional discrimination of the Saedo and Saehan cultivars produced from Buyeo, Nonsan, Eumseong, Boryeong, or Gyeongju. Partial least-squares discriminate analysis models showed good discrimination for Saedo (R-x(2)=0.798 and Q(2)=0.563) and Saehan (R-x(2)=0.819 and Q(2)=0.894). These preliminary results can extend knowledge of regional isotope signatures in A. bisporus mushroom produced in Korea, contributing to accurate geographical authenticity with potential broader applications for the international mushroom market.

AB Antioxidant peptides from Pinctada fucata are ubiquitous in nature and can be utilized as ingredients in cosmetics or functional foods to positively regulate oxidative species in the human body against oxidation. Here, mutated peptides and a homologous series of peptides were designed and prepared, based on the original peptide sequence of an antioxidant peptide from Pinctada fucata meat (PFMAP), to better understand the structural relationships, including primary structure, spatial conformation and activity. The results showed that the antioxidant activity factors in order of importance were spatial conformation, amino acid sequence, amino acid position, amino acid composition, peptide chain length and degree of side-chain amino acid glycosylation. Moreover, this protocol had incomparable advantages in purity, speed and cost of preparing polypeptides, relative to enzymatic hydrolysis or chemosynthesis methods. This study also supplies test data information and a theoretical basis for the higher-value application of polypeptides from marine sources.

AB Gas cell stabilization in dough by its aqueous phase constituents is arguably more important in non-wheat than in wheat dough due to weaker protein networks in the former. Dough liquor (DL), a model for the dough aqueous phase, was isolated from fermented wheat, rye, barley, and oat doughs by ultracentrifugation. DL composition (protein, lipid, arabinoxylan, beta-glucan) and air/water interfacial functionality [foaming, viscosity, surface tension, surface dilatational modulus (E)] were related to bread quality. Poor foaming and low E of wheat DL were ascribed to lipids and proteins co-occurring at the interface. Nonetheless, the presence of a gluten network resulted in high-quality wheaten breads. Homogeneous and heterogeneous crumb structures of rye and barley breads, respectively, were attributed to high and low E values of their respective DLs. High lipid content and low surface tension of oat DL indicated a lipid-dominated interface, which may explain the heterogeneous crumb structure of oat breads.

AB Ethoxylated aliphatic surfactants belonging to the Genapol and Tergitol series were assessed as extraction systems of isoflavones. They showed good extraction properties when compared with different solvents, the Genapol X-080 exhibiting the best performance. Available commercial isoflavone pills were used, as a starting simple matrix, to determine the parameters that affect the extraction procedure. The temperature and the surfactant concentration showed to be factors that favored significantly the extraction performance. The application of optimized variables (Genapol X-080 11% m/m, pH 4.5; extraction temperature of 54 degrees C and extraction time of 60 min) on soybean flour (natural) allowed extracting 3.237 +/- 0.173 mg of isoflavone per gram of treated flour. This result was three times what it was for methanol under identical conditions. Extraction with these micellar systems represents a sustainable alternative methodology for industrial purposes due to its low cost, biodegradability, non-toxicity and easy scaling up.

AB Natural sweeteners, such as stevia and thaumatin, exert their sweet taste by specifically binding to sweet taste receptors. However, the molecular basis of their sweetening power remains to be ascertained. In the present study, we built a comparative model of the hT1R2 and hT1R3 subunits in order to characterize their interactions with natural, non-caloric sweeteners - from glycosylated terpenoids to sweet proteins - at the molecular level. The binding free energy between hT1R2-hT1R3 and sweeteners of different families shows a strong correlation with their sweetness intensity for both, small sweeteners (r = -0.89) and sweet proteins (r = -0.97). The correlation is further improved and generalized throughout all families of sweeteners evaluated, when EC50 values are used instead of relative intensities (r = -0.91). Altogether, these results contribute to a better understanding of the sweetness perception of these sweeteners, and promote the use of docking for better prediction of resulting sweetness.

AB There are both soluble and insoluble-bound forms of phenolics in tea-leaf products. In order to increase total soluble phenolics contents, guava leaves tea (GLT) was first fermented with Monascus anka and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then hydrolyzed with complex enzymes. The changes in phenolics profiles, antioxidant activities and inhibitory effect on a-glucosidase in processed GLT were investigated. Compared with the un-fermented GLT, fermentation and complex enzymatic processing (FE) significantly increased the total phenolics, total flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol contents by 2.1, 2.0, 13.0 and 6.8 times, respectively. After the FE, a major proportion of phenolics existed in the soluble form. Quercetin was released in the highest amount among different phenolics. In addition, soluble phenolic extracts from GLT following FE exhibited a highest antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase. The paper suggested an improved method for processing GLT into high-value products rich in phenolics and flavonoids aglycones with enhanced health benefits.

AB A reliable solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure using reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticle (rGO/Au) composite as sorbent was proposed for purification and enrichment of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)), aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL), beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL), zearalanone (ZAN), alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL) and beta-zearalanol (beta-ZAL) in milk. Main parameters affecting the performance of SPE procedure were thoroughly investigated. The optimized conditions included 2% acetonitrile in water as the loading solution, 5% methanol in water as the washing solution, and methanol/acetonitrile/formic acid (50/49/1, v/v/v) as the elution solvent. Satisfactory linearity (R-2 >= 0.992), high sensitivity (limit of quantification in the range of 0.02-0.18 ng mL(-1)), adequate recovery (70.2-111.2%), and acceptable precision (RSD, 2.0-14.9%) were obtained when the optimal sample pretreatment protocol was combined with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. The applicability of the validated method was further verified in real milk samples.

AB It has been suggested that the addition of flavonols (i.e. white grape skins) improves and stabilizes the color of red wines. However, it has been shown that flavonol glycosides produce a mouth-drying and mouth-coating sensation at very low threshold concentrations. Moreover, the addition of polysaccharides to wines is a practice addressed to improve the smoothness and roundness and correct excessive astringency, so we have studied the effect of the addition of yeast mannoproteins (MP) on the interaction between quercetin 3-glucoside and human salivary peptides. Sensory analysis showed the first evidence of the mannoprotein smoothing effect when the flavonol is added to wine. Additionally, MP/SP/polyphenol interactions were studied using fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry. Results obtained indicate not only the existence of interactions between mannoproteins and flavonols but also between mannoproteins and salivary proteins (SP), suggesting a possible formation of protein/polyphenol/polysaccharide ternary complex.

AB It is hypothesized that rapeseed lecithins may have different emulsifying and antioxidant properties in delivering fish oil compared to soy lecithin based on previous studies. The results showed that in vitro antioxidant activities of rapeseed lecithins were stronger than those of soy lecithin. Emulsions stabilized by rapeseed based lecithins and DATEM were stable over 3 months at 4 degrees C, whereas the creaming of emulsions containing soy lecithin started immediately after its preparation. Zeta-potential of rapeseed lecithins was higher than soy lecithin and DATEM, which partially contributed to the emulsion stability. Although the particle sizes of emulsions prepared by rapeseed lecithins increased after 14 days storage, no creaming was observed. Lipid oxidation as indicated by TBARS values suggested that DATEM was the most unfavorable, followed by soy lecithin. It is concluded that rapeseed lecithins are better than soy lecithin and DATEM in terms of emulsion stability and antioxidant capability, respectively.

AB The optimum harvest time for 'Nanguo' pears lasts for only 20 days. Refrigeration is a common technique used to extend the fruit supply. However, with low-temperature storage, the proper aroma of the pear is lost when it matures during shelf-life at room temperature. In this study, we investigated the ability of low-temperature conditioning (LTC) to regulate aroma esters of 'Nanguo' pears, and identified the key genes in the ethylene signal transduction pathway based on RNA-seq analysis. LTC caused higher ethylene production and effectively alleviated the loss of aroma-related esters in 'Nanguo' pears during refrigeration and during the subsequent shelf-life at room temperature. Furthermore, the expression levels of PuERS1, PuEIN4, PuEIN2, and PuERF were increased under LTC treatment. Thus, we speculate that the alleviation effect of LTC on fruit aroma esters is closely related to ethylene signal transduction, including up-regulated expression of PuERS1, PuEIN4, PuEIN2, and PuERF.

AB The mechanism of the thermal degradation and the toxicity of the thermal degradation products of agar were studied using TG/DTA, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was found that the thermal degradation of agar is a single-step reaction, the thermal degradation temperature (T-0, T-p, T-f) increases with increasing gel strength (P) and the influence of P on the thermal degradation rate is modest. The thermal degradation of agar is an exothermic reaction, and the activation energy of the reaction increases with increasing P. In the thermal degradation, agar is first decomposed into 3,6-anhydropyran galactopyranose and galactopyranose, then 3,6-anhydropyran galactopyranose, and finally furyl hydroxymethyl ketone, through loop opening, dehydration and hydrogen transfer. Galactopyranose follows three degradation pathways, and its final degradation products are 3,4-atrosan, D-allose, furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde. Of the degradation products, furyl hydroxymethyl ketone, furfural, and 5(hydroxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde show some toxicity to humans.

AB A new combined methodology for obtaining relations between starch molecular structure and digestion kinetics of starch-based foods is illustrated using published data on cooked rice. Digestibility data are treated with the logarithm of slopes method, giving region(s) where first-order loss kinetics are applicable; accurate values for the rate parameters are obtained by non-linear least-squares. A new method is developed to find independent structural variables for whole and enzymatically-debranched starches. Chain-length distributions of amylose and amylopectin are fitted with models using biologically-meaningful parameters, including accounting for SEC band broadening. While slower digestion rate usually means higher residual starch, this is not always so; both digestion parameters must be considered separately. The treatment shows that digestion kinetics depend on amylose content and also amylose molecular fine structure: the amount of shorter amylose chains and total amylose molecular size. The new combined data-treatment methodology is applicable to a wide range of food systems.

AB tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) losses and the residual levels of 2-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TBBQ) in tripalmitin at different heating temperatures with or without reflux over various time intervals were investigated. Heating at 120 degrees C resulted in the slowest TBHQ loss and the highest TBBQ levels (52.61-62.93 mu g/mL). The highest TBBQ concentrations (111.73-164.67 mu g/mL) at 5 and 8 h and residual concentrations of 10.23-46.95 mu g/mL during heating at 170 degrees C over 24 h were observed. Furthermore, the potential cytotoxicity of TBBQ to RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated with the MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 staining test, and flow cytometry analysis. Results indicate that TBBQ dose-and time-dependently decreased the growth of cells and inhibited DNA synthesis by regulating the S/G2 transition. The TBBQ concentration giving 50% inhibition in RAW 264.7 cells was 10.71 mu g/mL. This threshold value is lower than the residual level of TBBQ in oil, indicating the necessity for concerns over the safety of fried food in terms of TBBQ residues.

AB This investigation focuses on the use of chitosan treatment simulating a bentonite fining in order to detect any modification of the wine haze potential by simultaneously evaluating the secondary effects on untargeted fixed and volatile compounds. A significant removal of chitinases was observed after fining an aromatic white wine with 1 g/L of a fungoid chitosan. Even if the more stable thaumatin like protein fractions were not significantly affected, the heat stability of the fined chitosan wine samples were highly improved in the 55-62 degrees C range. Among the secondary effects of a fining treatment, a reduction of tartaric acid, malic acid, potassium and iron was showed. All the free terpenols with the exception of alpha-terpineol were reduced in significant amounts, whilst the glycosylated forms and the fermentative aroma compounds were not affected by a 1 g/L chitosan addition.

AB A partially purified proteolytic extract prepared from Maclura pomifera latex was employed in hydrolyzing a soybean-protein isolate (4.2 mg/mL). The hydrolysis-product formation, monitored by tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamyde-gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, indicated that after 10 min of reaction the main soybean proteins disappeared. The maximum degree of hydrolysis was 36.2% after a 180-min digestion. The 90-min hydrolysate presented an IC50 of 31.6 +/- 0.2 mu g/mL, and a trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of 157.6 and 176.9 mu moles TE per g of peptide determined by two different methods. Analysis by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), followed by the application of bioinformatics tools, enabled the deduction of fourteen theoretical peptide sequences containing antioxidant amino acids at > 60%, none of which sequences had been previously reported as antioxidants. Finally, we consider that this 90-min hydrolysate would constitute a promising ingredient in the manufacture of functional foods.

AB Our objective was to develop a robust system for anthocyanin-based color intensification, with high-encapsulation capacity and improved stability of the encapsulated natural colorant. Catechin was used to modulate the copigmentation and encapsulation of anthocyanins in counter-ionic polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) composed of chondroitin sulfate and chitosan. Results showed that catechin copigmentation significantly intensified red color of formulations both with and without encapsulation in PECs and improved the anthocyanin encapsulation efficiency by forming additional dense network through hydrogen bonding. A series of stability assays revealed that anthocyanin stabilizing effect of system depended on the formulated pH and adding order of catechin. The strongest retaining capacity of anthocyanin was observed when catechin was copigmented with anthocyanin directly in PECs at pH 3.3, while the coated layer of catechin covered on PECs would be more effective at pH 4.0 and 5.0. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this delivery system works for anthocyanins from different sources.

AB Hydrolysis of the proteins from cod bone was performed using flavourzyme and trypsin. The nutritional properties of hydrolysates by flavourzyme (HF) and trypsin (HT) were investigated. By comparison, HF exhibits a better degree of hydrolysates (DH) and nitrogen recovery (NR) than HT. The protein content of extract is 97.39% and had a good nutritional value due to the high protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of 0.95 for adults. The content of total amino acids is 942.55 mg/g. The free amino acids content of hydrolysates derived from flavourzyme is 136.82 mg/g after hydrolyzing 3 h, while 17.12 mg/g of such hydrolysates was obtained by using trypsin. The main flavor compounds are alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids and alkanes. The molecular weight of predominant peptides ranged from 1000 to 3000 Da in both enzymatic hydrolysates. This study provided a theoretical basis to the preparation of nutritional components with attracting flavor in functional food industry.

AB Ozone is a strong oxidant and has different food applications to ensure food safety. Ozone treatment is considered an eco-friendly and cost-effective food processing technique. In this mini-review, the impact of ozone treatment on the composition (e.g., mycotoxins) and physicochemical properties of components (e.g., starch and protein) of different food grains (e.g., wheat, rice and maize) is summarised. The rheology, color, storage, and germination capacity of the grains/flours affected by ozone are reviewed. The quality attributes (e.g., texture) of food products (e.g., bread, noodle, and cake) made from ozone treated cereals are also examined. It becomes evident that ozone has great potential to improve the functionalities of grain products while ensuring food safety.

AB Chelation of iron and zinc in wheat as phytates lowers their bio-accessibility. Steeping and germination (15 degrees C, 120 h) lowered phytate content from 0.96% to only 0.81% of initial dry matter. A multifactorial experiment in which (steeped/germinated) wheat was subjected to different time (2-24 h), temperature (20-80 degrees C) and pH (2.0-8.0) conditions showed that hydrothermal processing of germinated (15 degrees C, 120 h) wheat at 50 degrees C and pH 3.8 for 24 h reduced phytate content by 95%. X-ray absorption near-edge structure imaging showed that it indeed abolished chelation of iron to phytate. It also proved that iron was oxidized during steeping, germination and hydrothermal processing. It was further shown that zinc and iron bio-accessibility were respectively 3 and 5% in wheat and 27 and 37% in hydrothermally processed wheat. Thus, hydrothermal processing of (germinated) wheat paves the way for increasing elemental bio-accessibility in whole grain-based products.

AB Oenococcus oeni (O. oeni) induces malolactic fermentation to improve wine quality. However, the molecular basis of mechanisms involved in its freeze-drying resistance remains unclear. In this work, O. oeni SD-2a without freeze-drying (No-FD), with freeze-drying (FD) and freeze-drying with monosodium glutamate (MSG) (FD-MSG) were investigated. Flow cytometry results showed severe cell damage in FD cells and less membrane transmissibility in FD-MSG cells. Meanwhile, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were detected in FD and FD-MSG cells by scanning electron microscopy. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that varying proteins were involved in carbon, lipid and nucleic acids metabolism, stress response, oxidoreductase activity and signal sensing. Among the identified proteins, the highlighted proteins were those involved in polysaccharides production and signal sensing for freeze-drying resistance and cyclopropane fatty acid metabolism for MSG addition.

AB Non-traditional wild rice flakes were analysed for chemical composition, vitamin B compounds, a-tocopherol, mineral and trace elements. Dietary intakes of vitamins, minerals and trace elements were evaluated using FAO/WHO and Institute of Medicine regulations. Wild rice flakes proved to be significant contributors of pyridoxine, pantothenic and folic acids, niacin, thiamine, chromium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc, copper, molybdenum and iron to essential dietary intakes values. Toxic dietary intake values for aluminium, cadmium, tin and mercury were less than 33%, which complies the limits for adults set by FAO/WHO for toxic elements intake related to the body weight of 65 kg for females and 80 kg for males taking 100 g of flakes as a portion. However, concentrations of Hg reaching between 3.67 and 12.20 mu g/100 g in flakes exceeded the average Hg value of 0.27-1.90 mu g/100 g in cereals consumed in the EU. It has to be respected in the future.

AB Fresh-cut strawberries were subjected to pulsed light treatments (4, 8, 12 and 16 J.cm(-2)) combined with a stabilizing dip. Quality changes and antioxidant properties were evaluated for 14 days at 5 degrees C. The treatments delayed fungal for the studied period. Surface color of treated fresh-cut strawberries was preserved in both internal and external surfaces. Doses of 4 and 8 J.cm(-2) reduced softening incidence over storage. No significant differences between the total phenolic contents of untreated and treated fresh-cut strawberries were observed during storage. Vitamin C and total anthocyanin contents of the samples treated at low energy doses were maintained, whereas those of slices treated at the highest energy dose decreased between 20 and 30%, respectively. On the other hand, initial antioxidant capacity was better kept in all samples during storage regardless the applied dose. Hence, 4 and 8 J.cm(-2) were the most effective treatments for maintaining quality and antioxidant properties of fresh-cut strawberries.
   Industrial relevance: Fresh-cut strawberries may be sold as a highly convenient, healthy and fully edible product. However, processing and packaging conditions need to ensure the maintenance of their quality characteristics and content of bioactive compounds. This study provides scientific evidence regarding the beneficial effects of pulsed light treatments combined with a quality-stabilizing dip for extending the shelf-life of fresh-cut fruit. These combined treatments may be economically viable at industrial level because of their low energy requirements and reduced treatment time.

AB In this study, fatty acid compositions, physiochemical properties, and antioxidant activities of eight varieties of kiwifruit seed oil (KSO) in China were comparatively investigated. All varieties of KSO were rich in unsaturated fatty acid (UFA), especially linolenic acid. Different varieties of KSO showed subtle differences in physicochemical characteristics; e.g., density (0.88-0.091 mg/mL), refractive index (1.4803-1.4823), acid value (3.21-3.99 mg KOH/g oil), iodine value (177.22-202.75 g I/100 g oil), and peroxide value (7.23-14.75 mM/kg oil). Different varieties of KSO demonstrated different radical scavenging capacities for DPPH% (IC50 = 25.7-35.1 mg/mL), HO% (IC50 = 0.93-1.26 mg/mL), ORAC (1.26-1.99 mM Trolox/kg), and FRAP (3.30-132.30 mg Trolox/kg). Principal component analysis indicated the variety "Hongyang" to have a higher content of UFA and better antioxidant capacity than other varieties. Furthermore, comet assay verified that KSO can protect mice lymphocytes against oxidative DNA damage. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for the bioactivity of KSO as a potential dietary supplement.

AB Resistant starch has been studied extensively for its hypoglycemic activity, while its underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the hypoglycemic effect of different doses of lotus seed resistant starch (LSRS) supplementation on type 2 diabetic mice and elucidated the molecular basis of its hypoglycemic effect. LSRS supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose level by 16.0%-33.6%, recovered serum insulin level by 25.0%-39.0% and improved lipid metabolism disorder in the diabetic mice. The genome-wide expression patterns in pancreatic tissue were analyzed, and 511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The analysis results of gene ontology (GO) functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways indicated that the protective effect of LSRS supplementation was most likely driven by modulating expression levels of various key factors involved in insulin secretion, insulin signal transmission, cell apoptosis, antioxidant activity and p53 signaling pathways.

AB Organic amaranth starch (Amaranthus caudatus) was studied after heat-moisture treatment (HMT) using different moisture contents and different times. The starch extracted by the aqueous method presented low lipid and protein content. After HMT, an increase in the thermal stability was identified. The onset and peak temperatures were higher with an increase in moisture content and the times used in the modification. The gelatinisation enthalpy varied due to the heterogeneity of the crystals formed after the structural reorganisation caused by HMT. The relative crystallinity was lower for the physically modified starches. An increase in the pasting temperature was accompanied by a decrease in the viscosity, setback and breakdown, which were proportional to the moisture and time used. The morphology of the HMT-modified samples was not altered; however, agglomerations were noted. Low levels of dispersion homogeneity and suspension stability were observed for the modified samples due to the strong presence of agglomerates.

AB The effects of cold storage (0 degrees C, 0-8 days) and salts (NaCl, 0.5-5%; NaNO2, 50-150 mg/kg) on the formation of protein-bound N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and N-epsilon-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL) in raw and subsequently commercially sterilized (121 degrees C, 10 min) pork were investigated. Based upon two-factor analysis of variance (alpha = 0.05), there was no significant interaction effect between salts and storage time on the levels of CML and CEL in raw or sterile pork; salts and storage time did not significantly affect the amounts of CML and CEL in raw pork. However, in sterile pork, 1.5-5% NaCl treatments led to an average of 7.5-52.6% increase in CML, while NaNO2 resulted in 25.4-37.1% and 21.4-23.4% reduction in CML and CEL, respectively; raw pork stored for 8 days led to 82.5% increase of CML and 32.6% increase of CEL in the sterile products (n = 30), as compared to those without cold storage.

AB A fully automated focused infrared lightwave ashing sample preparation system was proposed and applied to the pretreatment of volatile arsenic, cadmium and lead in plant foods prior to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) determination. All the steps of ashing pretreatment were automatically accomplished within forty minutes. Gold-plated infrared quartz tubes produced focused infrared to supply a rapid heating. Ozone was used to accelerate sample carbonization. A cool trap was used to capture volatile arsenic, cadmium and lead. Three certified plant food reference materials were determined. The recoveries of the three elements were between 90% and 107%. Five real plant foods were analyzed by the proposed method and microwave digestion. The results showed no significant difference.

AB As many studies are exploring the association between ingestion of bioactive compounds and decreased risk of non-communicable diseases, the scientific community continues to show considerable interest in these compounds. In addition, as many non-nutrients with putative health benefits are reducing agents, hydrogen donors, singlet oxygen quenchers or metal chelators, measurement of antioxidant activity using in vitro assays has become very popular over recent decades. Measuring concentrations of total phenolics, flavonoids, and other compound (sub) classes using UV/Vis spectrophotometry offers a rapid chemical index, but chromatographic techniques are necessary to establish structure-activity. For bioactive purposes, in vivo models are required or, at the very least, methods that employ distinct mechanisms of action (i.e., single electron transfer, transition metal chelating ability, and hydrogen atom transfer). In this regard, better understanding and application of in vitro screening methods should help design of future research studies on 'bioactive compounds'.

AB The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NOD-like receptors, NLRs) can regulate the innate immune process and is an important part of inflammatory body. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach to identify a novel NLRP gene in Apostichopus japonicus. We designated the gene as AjNLRP10. The full-length of AjNLRP10 is 4509 bp. The putative open reading frame comprising 3489 bp encodes a polypeptide with 1162 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular mass of AjNLRP10 is 132.87 kDa and its theoretical pI is 5.60. AjNLRP10 comprises a signal peptide with two Ig superfamily (IgSF) domains and a NACHT [NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein), CIITA (MHC class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserina) and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)] domain. Spatial distribution expression analysis detected AjNLRP10 in all of the tissues tested, but with higher expression in the coelomocytes, medium expression in the intestine and respiratory tree, and slightly weaker expression in the body wall, tube feet, and longitudinal muscle. The expression levels of AjNLRP10 in the respiratory tree and intestines of sea cucumbers with skin ulceration syndrome were increased by 4-fold and 2.7-fold compared with those in healthy sea cucumbers, respectively. We investigated expression profiles of AjCasepase-1 (Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1) and AjMMP37 (mitochondrial protein-37) after AjNLRP10 knock-down and discovered that AjCasepase-1 was raised by 2.60-fold and AjMMP37 was raised by 3.84-fold. The study showed that AjNLRP10 has inhibitory effect in the immune process. In conclusion, this study showed that the AjNLRP10 protein found in the sea cucumber involved with the innate immune responses against bacterial infection. It has a similar structure and biological function to that in other organisms, where it appears to be involved with these results provide insights into the innate immune mechanism in the sea cucumber as well as suggesting new strategies for disease prevention, molecular therapy, and the development of novel drugs for sea cucumbers.

AB Objective: To screen the methylated genes for early diagnosis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) prediction in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.
   Methods: Differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) of PCa were screened out from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Combined with TCGA RNA sequencing data and clinical information, the DMCs associated genes with different expression and related to BCR were selected as candidate genes. Then, the expression level of the best candidate gene ZNF154 was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, the prognosis potential of the hypermethylation gene ZNF154 was assessed by Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 87 candidate genes were screened out. Compared to benign prostate (BP) tissues, ZNF154 has three hypermethylation sites (cg03234186, cg12506930, cg26465391) in the promoter region in PCa tissues. qRT-PCR results showed that ZNF154 expression level was reduced in PCa tissues than in BP tissues (P = 0.004). Besides, the ZNF154 methylation level was negatively correlated with mRNA expression (r = - 0.766, P < 0.001), and was highly cancer-specific in PCa (area under the curves (AUCs) = 90.030%). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed ZNF154 methylation level was associated with BCR (P = 0.005), and ZNF154 could be an independent factor for BCR prediction in PCa by using univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis (P = 0.035, HR = 8.218).
   Conclusions: 87 PCa specific genes were obtained. Further analysis gave the evidence that ZNF154 can be used as a specific maker for PCa diagnosis. Hypermethylation level of ZNF154 lead to gene expression inhibition and function loss, which contribute to the development and poor outcomes in PCa. In addition, the mean methylation level of ZNF154 can be used as an independent risk factor to predict BCR.

AB Polymorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is a member of the pleomorphic adenoma gene family. PLAG family of proteins as a nuclear transcription factor mainly play a role in regulating a variety of important genes in the body. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the PLAG1 polymorphism with growth traits in 566 cattle. A novel 19-bp indel mutation was identified in the PLAG1 by sequencing pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq) and agarose gel electrophoresis methods. The PCR products of PLAG1 exhibited 3 genotypes and 2 alleles: 142 bp (denoted as W) and 123 by (denoted as D). Genotype WW and allele W were predominant in the studied populations. In addition, the 19-bp indel was significantly associated with the growth traits in cattle breeds, with the hip width and rump length of Pinan cattle (P < 0.05), heart girth and cannon bone circumference of Xianan cattle (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), as well as the heart girth, hip width, hucklebone width, rump length, height at sacrum and chest depth of the Jiaxian cattle (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that the Indel marker of PLAG1 gene can be used as candidate molecular markers for the breeding in cattle.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in female worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play imperative roles in cancer cell initiation and progression. Recently, aberrantly expressed LINC01296 was observed in several malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, its clinical significance and exact effects on BC is still unclear. In this work, the clinical value of LINC01296 was evaluated in patients with BC. Additionally, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion capacities were detected after silencing of LINC01296. Furthermore, the xenograft experiment was used to confirm the in vitro results. As a result, LINC01296 is up-regulated in both BC tissue samples and cells. Up-regulated LINC01296 is correlated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage of patients with BC. Additionally, Cox regression analysis confirmed LINC01296 as an independent prognostic indicator for patients with BC. For the part of functional assays, silencing of LINC01296 inhibited BC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Also, cell apoptosis was enhanced after LINC01296 silenced. Moreover, cell migration and invasion potential were both abrogated in the si-LINC01296 groups. Collectively, LINC01296 may function as a potential prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for patients with BC.

AB Coronary artery disease (CAD) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common complex disease. To date, genetic causes for atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. It has recently been proposed that low frequency and rare genetic variants may be the main causes. Mitochondria] sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, function as critical regulators of mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative stress and cell survival. We speculated that altered SIRT5 level resulting from DNA sequence variants (DSVs) within SIRT5 gene regulatory regions may contribute to the CAD and AMI development. In this study, the SIRT5 gene promoter was genetically and functionally analyzed in large cohorts of AMI patients (n = 381) and healthy controls (n = 391). A total of eleven DSVs and SNPs were found. Two novel heterozygous DSVs (g.13574131C > A and g.13574287G > C) and three heterozygous SNPs [g.13573450A > G (rs573515169), g.13574110G > A (rs2804924) and g.13574259G > C (rs112443954)] were identified only in AMI patients. The DSVs and SNPs significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of the SIRT5 gene promoter in both HEK-293 and H9c2 cells (P < 0.05). Further electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that the SNPs significantly affected the binding of transcription factors. In contrast, the DSVs and SNPs found only in controls or in both AMI patients and controls did not significantly change the SIRT5 gene promoter activity (P > 0.05). Therefore, our data suggested that the DSVs and SNPs identified in AMI patients may change SIRT5 level by affecting activity of SIRT5 gene promoter, contributing to the AMI development as a risk factor.

AB Biosynthesis of isoprenoids (MEP Pathway) in apicoplast has an important role during the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium, as it is the sole pathway to provide the major isoprene units required as metabolic precursor for various housekeeping activities. With the intensifying need to identify a novel therapeutic drug target against Plasmodium, the MEP pathway and its components are considered as potential therapeutic targets, due to the difference in the isoprenoid synthesis route (MVA) functional in the host cells. While few major components have already been studied from this pathway for their potential as a drug target, IspD (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidyltransferase) enzyme, the enzyme catalyzing the third step of the pathway has only been tested against a synthetic compound from Malaria box called MMV008138, which also has not shown adequate inhibitory activity against P. vivax IspD. In the present study, to validate the potential of PvIspD as a drug target, various antimicrobial agents were screened for their inhibition possibilities, using in-vitro High Throughput Screening (HTS) technique. Shortlisted antimicrobial drug molecules like Cefepime, Tunicamycin and Rifampicin were further validated by in-vitro biochemical enzyme inhibition assays where they showed activity at nanomolar concentrations suggesting them or their derivatives as prospective future antimalarials. This study also confirmed the in-vivo expression of PvIspD protein during asexual stages by sub-cellular localization in apicoplast and explores the importance of the IspD enzyme in the development of new therapeutics.

AB Purpose: Long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to regulate glucose homeostasis and insulin synthesis and secretion. However, the association of genetic variants of lncRNAs and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been evaluated. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the association between H19 rs217727 and H19 rs3741219 variants and MEG3 rs7158663 polymorphism with T2D susceptibility.
   Materials and methods: The study population consists of 969 subjects including 496 T2D patients and 473 nondiabetic age and sex-matched controls. The H19 and MEG3 variants genotyping were performed by PCR-RFLP method.
   Results: Our results revealed that the T allele of rs217727 was more frequent in T2D group compared with controls (P = 0.007, OR = 1.1, 95% CI:1.02-1.18). Moreover, the rs217727-TT genotype was significantly associated with T2D after adjustment for age, BMI and lipid levels (P = 0.041, OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.01-2.32). However, no significant difference was detected for allele or genotype frequencies of H19 rs3741219 between T2D and controls (P = 0.71). Furthermore, the findings showed that the AA genotype of MEG3 rs7158663 was associated with significantly increased risks of T2D compared with the GG genotype (P = 0.026, OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07-2.99). The results remained significance after analysis by logistic regression (P = 0.033, Adjusted OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.04-2.84). Finally, bioinformatics analysis showed that these SNPs could alter local RNA folding structure and also the miRNA-IncRNA interactions.
   Conclusions: Our findings provided the evidence of significant association between H19 rs217727-TT and MEG3 rs7158663-AA genotypes with T2D susceptibility.

AB Aberrantly microRNAs (miRs) expression is reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and development in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MiR-340 had been identified to be downregulated in NSCLC in the previous study. However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-340 involved in NSCLC progression still needed to be well known. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-340 expression was notably down-regulated in NSCLC tissues compared to matched adjacent noncancerous lung tissues by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. Lower miR-340 expression positively related to lymph node metastasis, larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro assays, we demonstrated that upregulation of miR-340 expression suppressed cell proliferation ability. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-340 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated (3'UTR) region of CDK4 mRNA. Over-expression of miR-340 suppressed cell proliferation by regulating CDK4 expression in NSCLC cells. Additionally, we showed that increased miR-340 expression promoted the expression of cell proliferation related protein CDK6 expression, but decreasing the P15 and P21 expression. In vivo, we verified that miR-340 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth by regulating CDK4 expression. Therefore, these findings revealed miR-340 functions as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC cells and may provide a potential target of NSCLC treatment.

AB Myelocytomatosis (MYC) transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. In cell cultures, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can improve the production of taxol, which is a complex terpenoid compound with an intense antitumor activity. However, the functions of MYC genes in Taxus sp. (yew trees) remain poorly known. Based on Taxus sp. transcriptome changes induced by MeJA, a TcMYC gene was isolated in a previous study. Here, we further characterized the TcMYC TF encoded by that gene and four other yew MYC TFs previously obtained. Three yew MYC TFs had the typical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-MYC _N region, but the other two MYC did not, although all five presented the bHLH domain. TcMYC was localized to the nuclei, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the yew MYC TFs were closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MYC1/2 and maize R protein. The yeast one-hybrid assay showed that TcMYC binds the G-box of the promoter of taxane 5 alpha-hydroxylase. Transcript levels of TcMYC revealed that TcMYC was highly expressed in xylem and leaves, and up-regulated by drought and high-salinity stresses. Coronatine (COR) has recently been used as a new elicitor to improve the production of taxol in cell cultures; TcMYC was strongly expressed at 2 and 4 h after COR treatment, but decreased at 12 and 24 h. Overall, the results obtained here provide new insights into the potential regulatory roles of MYC TFs on taxol biosynthesis in yew trees.

AB Congenital cataract is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. In this study, we examined a five-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant nuclear congenital cataracts by whole exome sequencing. A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.199T > A, p.(Tyr67Asn) in CRYGS was identified in this family. The p. (Tyr67Asn) substitution was predicted to decrease the local hydrophobicity and affect the three-dimensional structure of gamma S-crystallin, and resulted in a portion of mutant protein translocation from the cytoplasm to cell membrane.

AB Myosin phosphatase is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of actomyosin contractility, comprised of a regulatory subunit (Mypt1), and a catalytic subunit (PP1). Zebrafish has become an ideal model organism for the study of the genetic and cell physiological role of the myosin phosphatase in morphogenesis and embryonic development. We identified and characterized a novel splice variant of Mypt1 (ppp1r12a-tv202) from zebrafish, which is widely expressed during early embryonic development. Importantly, mutant alleles and antisense morpholinos that have been used to demonstrate the important role of Mypt1 in early development, not only disrupt the longer splice variants, but also tv202. The protein product of ppp1r12a-tv202 (Mypt1-202) contains the PP1-binding N-terminus, but lacks the regulatory C-terminus, which contains two highly conserved inhibitory phosphorylation sites. We observed that the protein product of tv202 assembled a constitutively active myosin phosphatase uninhibited by kinases such as Zipk. Thus, we propose that Mypt1-202 plays an important role in maintaining baseline M1c2 dephosphorylation and actomyosin relaxation during early zebrafish development.

AB Four new complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from the two superfamilies Ocypodoidea and Grapsoidea were sequenced, which represented Uca (Gelasimus) borealis (Ocypodidae: Ucinae), Dotilla wichmani (Dotillidae), Metopograpsus quadridentatus (Grapsidae: Grapsinae), and Gaetice depressus (Varunidae: Gaeticinae). All of the mitogenomes shared the complete set of 37 mitochondrial genes. Mitogenome lengths were 15,659, 15,600, 15,517, and 16,288 bp, respectively, with A + T contents of 69.41%, 68.46%, 70.30%, and 72.96%, respectively. Comparative genomic analyses suggested that they exhibited different genomic rearrangements. In particular, G. depressus shared a major rearrangement pattern present in Eriocheir crabs, while the remainder shared the brachyuran ground genomic rearrangement patterns. Phylomitogenomic inferences provided new evidence for the strongly supported nesting of Thoracotremata within Heterotremata clades. A close phylogenetic relationship was observed between Varunidae and Macrophthalmidae crabs, and between Dotillidae and Grapsidae crabs, which was consistent with mitochondrial genomic rearrangement similarities. Altogether, these results suggest the presence of reciprocal paraphyly for Ocypodoidea and Grapsoidea.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in regulating various biological processes at the post-transcription level. Accumulating evidence suggests that hypoxia caused by acute myocardial infarction induces cardiomyocyte damage including apoptosis. Previous studies regarding the miRNAome in H9c2 cells under hypoxia have shown that hypoxia modulates miRNA expression in H9c2 cells, including miR-532-5p. We therefore investigated whether miR-532-5p has a potential function in the cardiomyocyte response to hypoxia. In the present study, we found that miR-532-5p, which was down-regulated in hypoxia-exposed H9c2 cells and the myocardium of acute myocardial infarction rats, alleviated hypoxia-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis. Additionally, we identified PDCD4 as the direct target of miR-532-5p, which partly elucidates the anti-apoptotic mechanism of miR-532-5p. In summary, this study revealed that miR-532-5p has cardioprotective effects against hypoxia-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells.

AB Background & aim: Oral mucosal melanoma (OMM) is a kind of malignancy with extremely rare morbidity. It exhibits a poorer biological behavior and clinical outcome compared with cutaneous melanoma. lncRNAs are endogenous cellular RNA transcripts with no protein-coding potential and are associated with oncogenesis through cis- or trans-acting mechanisms. Despite increased evidence that proved lncRNAs have vital roles in tumorigenesis of mucosal melanoma, little is known about their functions in the progress of lymph node dissemination of OMM.
   Method: Here, we constructed a lncRNA and mRNA microarray using six metastatic lymph nodes and paired-matched non-metastatic lymph nodes. Then, we performed RT-PCR to validate the microarray data both in primary and metastases. We further constructed lncRNA and mRNA co-expressing networks and analyzed the biological functions by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses for dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs. Cis- and trans-regulation analysis were also performed to explore the specific mechanism of lncRNAs in OMM.
   Result Our results showed that 570 lncRNAs were upregulated with 292 lncRNAs downregulated in the metastatic OMM tissues. The results of RT-PCR were consistent with our microarray dataset both in primary and metastases. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses indicated that they play an important role in the melanin biosynthetic process, new growing cell tip and lysosomes in metastatic OMM. In the cis-regulation analysis, we observed metastasis-associated gene, PLEKHA5, the cis gene of lnc-AEBP2-1_1 and lnc-AEBP2-2_1, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), the cis gene of SAMMSON_3, SAMMSON_5 and lnc-MITF-5_1. In the trans-regulation analysis, CTBP2 and SUZ12 regulated lncRNA expression in the core TF-lncRNA-gene network.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that lncRNAs may be involved in the metastasis of OMM, and further investigation is needed to focus on the biological functions and the underlining molecular mechanisms exerted by these dysregulated lncRNAs in OMM.

AB With the advent of recent advances in molecular techniques and whole genome sequencing, we have come to know that the non -coding landscape (including non-coding RNAs, tRNAs and even telomeres) plays a major role in the regulation of cellular processes. Furthermore, the deregulation of this landscape has been found to contribute to and even bring about the pathogenesis of a large number of diseases. One of such diseases is diabetes mellitus (type 2 specifically) whose incidence rate and global burden is constantly increasing. Nutrition has been proven to be a key player in the development, onset and control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, non coding DNA based molecular markers are emerging as biomarkers of T2D, susceptibility, and perhaps dietary supplements can modulate non -coding DNA based markers expression and function in T2D management. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the developmental origins and genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, how each component of the non -coding landscape contributes to the development and progression of the disease and finally we discuss how dietary interventions modulate the non -coding landscape in T2D.

AB Aim: To determine the possible association between polymorphisms of DNA repair genes, including XRCC1 Arg194Tryp, Arg280His, and Arg399Glu, APE1 Asp148Glu, and NEIL2 Arg257Leu, and the risk of developing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Methods: A total of 264 subjects were recruited in this retrospective case-control study and were categorized into four groups: 88 control subjects (CR), 53 chronic hepatitis C patients (CHC), 36 liver cirrhotic patients (LC), and 87 HCC patients. The XRCC1 Arg194Tryp, Arg280His, and Arg399Glu polymorphisms were detected using PCR-RFLP, while real-time PCR was used to genotype APE1 Asp148Glu and NEIL2 Arg257Leu.
   Results: Our data revealed that, compared with the healthy controls, for those subjects with the XRCC1 Arg194Trp genotype, the risk of developing CHC, LC, and HCC was increased by 6.66- (odds ratio (OR) = 6.667; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.244-13.701; P > 0.01), 3.85- (OR = 3.852; 95% CI = 1.797-8.256; P > 0.01), and 2.14-fold (OR = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.13-4.06; P > 0.05), respectively. There was no association between the risk of HCC development and the XRCC1 Arg280His or XRCC1 Arg399Gln genotypes. Moreover, the analysis showed a lack of association between APE1 Asp148Glu and the risk of HCC development. The analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that the HCC patients with the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism were 2.9 fold more likely to have hepatic lesions in both hepatic lobes (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.15-7.29). Notably, in the HCC patients, the prevalence of the APE1 polymorphism in the males was four times higher than that in the females (OR = 4; 95% CI = 1.129-14.175; P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that the XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism could be a risk factor for HCV-related HCC development in Egypt.

AB Insertional activity of transposable elements (TEs) has had a major impact on the human genome; approximately one-half to two-thirds of the genome sequence is likely to be derived from TE insertions. Several families of human TEs - primarily Alu, L1 and SVA - continue to actively transpose, thereby generating insertional polymorphisms among individual genomes. The impact that TE insertions have on their human hosts' fitness, and accordingly the role that natural selection plays in shaping patterns of TE polymorphisms among populations, have yet to be systematically evaluated using whole genome sequence data. We present here a population genomic study of the effects of natural selection on human genetic variation that results from the recent activity of TEs. We developed a genome-wide scan for selection on human TE polymorphisms and applied it to a dataset of 14,384 locus-specific TE insertions characterized for 1511 individuals from 15 populations. Our TE selection scan looks for anomalously high population-specific TE insertion allele frequencies that are consistent with the action of positive (adaptive) selection. To control for the effects of demographic history, we compared the observed patterns of population-specific TE insertion allele frequencies to a neutral evolutionary model generated using time forward simulation of TE insertion allele frequencies among human population groups. This approach uncovered seven cases of polymorphic TE insertions that appear to have increased in frequency within specific human populations owing to the effects of positive selection. Five of the seven putatively selected TE insertions map to tissue-specific enhancers, and two cases correspond to expression quantitative trait loci that are associated with inter-individual gene regulatory differences. This study represents the first report of recent, local adaptation acting on polymorphic human TEs.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide and leads to a great many deaths each year. However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate colorectal cancer development and progression remain elusive. Here we identified an uncharacteristic long noncoding RNA TMEM75 that was upregulated in colorectal cancer compared to non-tumor tissues. We found that TMEM75 expression levels are positively correlated with advanced clinical stage. TMEM75 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CaCo2 and HCT116 cells in vitro. Moreover, TMEM75 silence delayed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, TMEM75 was demonstrated to initiate the expression of transcription factor SIM2. We also found that the expression of SIM2 was upregulated and positively correlated that of TMEM75 in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SIM2 rescued TMEM75 depletion-induced inhibition on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in colorectal cancer. Altogether, our findings indicated that TMEM75 functions as an oncogene relying on activation of SIM2 in colorectal cancer for the first time.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with increasing incidence worldwide. Accumulating evidence indicated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) behave as a novel class of transcription products during multiple cancer processes. Specifically, hsa_circ_0001649 has been reported to be down-regulated in several cancers. However, its clinical significance and functional roles in PDAC is still unknown. RT-qPCR was carried out to measure the expression of hsa_circ_0001649 in PDAC tissue samples and cell lines. Additionally, the correlation between hsa_circ_0001649 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed. The prognostic role of hsa_circ_0001649 was explored by Cox regression analysis. The potential effects of hsa_circ_0001649 in PDAC cells were evaluated in vitro including cell proliferation, colony-forming ability and apoptosis. As a result, hsa_circ_0001649 was abnormally decreased in PDAC tissues and cells, and this down-regulation was correlated with tumor stage and differentiation grade in PDAC patients. Hsa_circ_0001649 could serve as an independent prognostic factor for PDAC patients after surgery. What's more, increased hsa_circ_0001649 caused tumor suppressive effects via reducing cell proliferation, colony-forming ability and promoting cell apoptosis in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells. Collectively, the results illustrated that hsa_circ_0001649 may play a tumor suppressor role in PDAC and offer a potential therapeutic target for treating this fatal disease.

AB Objective to find the Calycosin glycoside (CG) potential anti-inflammatory effect. The anti-inflammatory activity of CG was evaluated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells, and the IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and PGE2 level were measured by ELISA; NO levels in the culture media were determined using the Griess reaction. The iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expressions were measured by qRT-PCR and the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, 65, ERK, JNK, and p38 was determined by western blotting. The CG could markedly inhibit the productions of NO and PGE(2) and markedly inhibit the productions of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6. CG could suppress mRNA expression of iNOS, COX-2 and protein phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, p65, ERK, JNK, and p38 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that CG exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity through the NF-kappa B and MAPK signal pathway, and as a potential therapeutic agent against inflammatory diseases.

AB MiR-361-5p has been reported to be dysregulated in several types of cancers. However, the function of miR-3615p in gastric cancer (GC) is still not clear. In our present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of miR-361-5p in the mobility of GC and its potential mechanism. We found that miR-361-5p was significantly decreased in GC cell lines and tumor tissues. Decreased miR-361-5p expression was correlated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of miR-361-5p inhibited cell proliferation and mobility through suppressing the expression of MMP-3, MMP-9 and VEGF. Moreover, the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin was increased while the expression of mesenchymal marker (Snail, N-cadherin, bcatenin) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway related proteins (TCF4, Cyclin-D1, c-Myc) was increased by overexpression of miR-361-5p, indicating that overexpression of miR-361-5p suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in GC cells. In order to further verify our conjecture that miR-3615p mimic inhibited cell mobility through suppressing EMT via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in GC, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator LiC1 was used in this study. Our data showed that activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by LiCI counteracted the regulating roles of miR-361-5p mimic through promoting EMT and cell mobility. In addition, TCF4 was knockdown and overexpressed in GC cells, and the results convinced the involvement of Wnt pathway in the regulation of EMT. Finally, results from in vivo experiments suggested that overexpression of miR-361-5p suppressed tumor growth and the expression of VEGF markedly through inhibiting EMT via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in GC nude mice. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that miR-361-5p suppressed cell mobility in GC through the inhibition of EMT via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Our findings indicated that miR-361-5p could be a promising therapeutic target for GC treatment.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, multifactorial metabolic disease, and the number of patients with T2DM has continued to increase in recent years. Large-scale proteomic studies on animal models of T2DM are of great importance to understand the pathophysiology of T2DM. Therefore, in our study, Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were used for proteomic analysis of skeletal muscles from T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama mini-pig models induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. In our proteomic analysis, a total of 1646 proteins and 13 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by iTRAQ-mass spectrometry, and 6 differentially expressed proteins were validated by PRM. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most DEPs were extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and participated in several biological processes, such as negative regulation of JAK-STAT cascade, negative regulation of STAT cascade, roundabout signaling pathway and peptide cross-linking via chondroitin 4-sulfate glycosaminoglycan, and the molecular functions of roundabout binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, heparin binding, sulfur compound binding, collagen binding, and kinase inhibitor activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in 14 pathways, including human disease pathways, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, signaling molecules and interaction pathways, and the cellular process pathways associated with phagosomes and focal adhesion. In conclusion, the proteomics based on iTRAQ and PRM in T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama minipig models showed that changes in amino acid metabolism, inflammation-associated pathways and the impaired function and environment of extracellular matrix are risk factors associated with increased pathogenesis of T2DM in Bama mini-pig.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that lacks effective targeted therapeutics strategy and has poor prognosis. Targeting androgen receptor (AR) in TNBC is thought to be a promising approach. We hypothesized that AR, functioning as a transcription factor, controls cell behavior via regulating the expression of microRNA molecules (miRNAs). The expression of 84 breast cancer-specific miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly invasive TNBC model system, was investigated using PCR arrays following treatment of cells with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The expression of 33 miRNAs was changed by more than 2 folds including miR-328-3p, which was up-regulated by 13 folds. Transfection of cells with either miR-328-3p mimic or anti-sense molecules decreased cell motility. DHT-mediated effect on the expression and function of CD44, a target of miR328-3p, was investigated. CD44 expression and cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid (HA) were down-regulated when cells were treated with DHT or transfection with a miR-328-3p mimic. On the other hand, the AR antagonist, bicalutamide, or transfection of cells with miR-328-3p anti-sense molecules had the opposite effect. Cells transfected with miR-328-3p anti-sense molecules reduced the negative effect of DHT on CD44 expression and cell adhesion to HA. In addition, DHT further reduced the expression of CD44 and cell adhesion to HA in cells transfected with miR-328-3p mimic. These results strongly suggest that miRNAs can mediate AR regulation of breast cancer cells and that AR controls the expression of CD44 via miRNA-dependent and independent mechanisms.

AB Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) contain cardiac stem cell subpopulations and are introduced as useful source for cardiac differentiation and therapy. Furthermore, research has highlighted miRNAs important role in various biological processes and cardiogenesis. Here, we intended to investigate the effect of hsa-miR-497 (miR-497) on TGF beta signaling pathway genes expression during the process of CDCs differentiation to cardiomyocytes. CDCs were successfully differentiated to the cardiac-like cells. In this study, we found that after cardiac differentiation induction, miR-497 expression was significantly decreased. Computational miRNA target prediction analyses revealed that TGF beta signaling pathway is a possible target of miR-497. Therefore, miR-497 was overexpressed in CDCs before the induction of differentiation. TGF beta 1, TGF beta R1, TGF beta R2, and SMAD3 genes expression level was decreased after miR-497 overexpression. Also, immunocytochemistry and cell morphology analysis indicated that miR-497 overexpression affecting cardiac differentiation process. Finally, direct interaction of miR-497 with 3'-UTR sequence of TGF beta R1 was supported through dual luciferase assay, consistent with miR-497 reported negative effect on SMAD3 expression. Accordingly, here a model of miR-497 involvement in regulation of TGF beta signaling pathway is introduced in which, side branches of TGF beta signaling pathway downregulate miR-497 to ensure upregulation of TGF beta R1 and TGF beta R2 and finally stronger TGF beta signaling.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the major pathogens causing acute viral hepatitis. The infectious particle consists of an RNA genome and capsid proteins. The 7.2 kb genome encodes three open reading frames (ORF) and ORF2 is translated into the capsid protein. The knowledge of structure and function of the ORF2 protein is essential for understanding the evolution and life cycle of HEV. However, biophysical research in this respect remains limited due to technical challenges. We have carried out a series of computational analysis on HEV ORF2. We have identified 144 conserved sites among the 660 amino acid (AA) residues. 43 models based on the previously proposed reference sequences and a cell culture adapted infectious clone were successfully built by 3D protein structure prediction and refinement. Structure alignment of domains revealed structural conservation of the S and M domains, but to a lesser extent of the P domain. Moreover, molecular docking has predicted distinct binding affinities of a monoclonal antibody towards ORF2 across different genotypes. Thus, we have expanded the information on ORF2 at both sequence and structure levels. These findings may help to better understand the evolution and life cycle of HEV, but also facilitate the development of genetically engineered vaccines or antibodies.

AB Background: The present study has been aimed to identify molecular dynamics of pancreatic transcription factors (pTFs) during events of directed trans-differentiation of human hepatic progenitor cells (hHPCs) into insulin producing cells (InPCs) within bioengineered humanized neoorgan. The study demonstrates applicability of acellularized whole splenic scaffold (ASOS) to generate insulin producing humanized transplantable neoorgan through activation of pancreatic transcription factors.
   Methods: An efficient acellularization process was developed for xenogeneic rat spleen using change in different gradients of reagents perfusion through splenic artery for varying time points. The acellularized xenogeneic spleen scaffold was characterized thoroughly for preservation of extra-cellular matrix and retention of organ specific vasculature and mechanical properties. Further scaffolds were sterilized and repopulated with hHPCs which were triggered using a stage wise induction with growth factors and hyperglycemic challenge for trans-differentiation into InPCs. Dynamics of pTFs alone or simultaneously during induction process was identified using gene expression analysis and immunological staining.
   Results: The cells within the engineered neoorgan respond to growth factors and extrinsic hyperglycemic challenge and generate large number of InPCs under controlled dynamic regulation of pTFs. Highly controlled regulation of pTFs generates higher percentage of Nkx-6.1 + /C-peptide + cells within the engineered splenic scaffolds. Generation of high percentage of insulin and C-peptide positive cells in three-dimensional organ architecture responded better to hyperglycemic stimuli and produced higher quantity of insulin than 2D-culture system.
   Conclusion: The present study provides a novel platform for designing effective regenerative strategies using whole organ scaffolds to control hyperglycemia under tight regulation of pTFs using humanized neoorgan system.

AB Background: The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases is uprising in countries like Iran. Genetic predisposing elements play prominent role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In this study we studied the role of autophagy genes like IRGM (Immunity related GTPase M) and ATG16L1 (Autophagy related 16 like 1) in the pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease in Iranian patients.
   Methods: One hundred thirty-eight patients and 99 normal controls were recruited in this study. Polymorphisms in -1644 and -308 upstream of IRGM gene were studied by PCR-sequencing and 20 kb CNVdel/insertion was studied by specific PCR. Rs10065171, rs4958847 in IRGM gene and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 were studied by Taqman genotyping assays.
   Results: None of the so-called predisposing alleles of IRGM gene predispose Iranians to Crohn's disease while the prevalence of some of them like CNV deletion was higher in normal controls. Surprisingly all the so-called predisposing alleles in IRGM were linked to each other (especially rs4958847 with rs10065172 and polymorphisms in -308 region with rs4958847). Patients harboring A allele in rs4958847 site showed higher ratio of fibrostenotic type of disease while in patients with C/T genotype in rs4958847, colonic involvement was seen more frequently. G allele in ATG16L1 was associated with Crohn's disease though it was not associated with any phenotypic manifestation.
   Conclusion: In our study the association of ATG16L1 to Crohn's disease in Iranian patients was confirmed while it was shown that the studied polymorphisms in IRGM was not associated with Crohn's disease. Therefore in order to have a better picture about the genetics of Crohn's disease in Iranian patients, it is recommended to study other clinically effective polymorphisms in IRGM and ATG16L1 in addition to other genes which are responsible for the process of autophagy.

AB Background: Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The study found that CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene affects the risk of coronary heart disease, but the relationship with hypertension is unclear. The aim of this research is to explore the association between CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene and hypertension in Chinese Han population.
   Methods: Genotypes at 11 CHD-relevant SNPs were determined in 350 Hypertension patients and 483 controls in Chinese Han population using chi(2) test, genetic model analysis and haplotype analysis.
   Results: In the allele model, CXCL12 rs1065297 "G" allele, CXCL12 rs4948878 "G" allele and CXCL12 rs10793538 "T" allele were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.53, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.51, p = 0.004; rs10793538: OR = 0.58, p = 0.005). CNNM2 rs12413409 "A" allele and CNNM2 rs11191514 "T" allele were also associated with reduced risk of hypertension (rs12413409: OR = 0.71, p = 0.003; rs11191514: OR = 0.70, p = 0.002). Further stratified analysis by sex and age found that CXCL12, CNNM2 gene also influence the risk of hypertension.
   Model analysis found that CXCL12 rs1093538 TA-TT genotype was associated with decreased risk of hypertension in the dominant model (OR = 0.57, p = 0.0015); Log-additive model revealed that rs1065297 and rs4948878 in CXCL12 gene have a potential association with essential hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.54, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.52, p = 0.0038). For CNNM2 gene, rs12413409 GA-AA genotype and rs11191514 CT-TT genotype was associated with reduced risk of hypertension in the dominant model (rs12413409: OR = 0.64, p = 0.012; rs11191514: OR = 0.63, p = 0.0082).
   CXCL12 "GCGCCGT" and CNNM2 "ATAG" haplotype were associated with reduced risk of hypertension with 0.57-fold and 0.75-fold.
   Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that CXCL12, CNNM2 gene influence the risk of hypertension in Chinese Han population.

AB The prostate gland is one of the last internal organs to deteriorate during human decomposition; however, this phenomenon is still mysterious. Gene expression in antemortem cases has been widely studied and a majority of the analyses concentrate on discovering basic physiological processes. The question of "What happens to gene expression after a human dies?" is a novel and emerging topic. Thanatotranscriptome (thanatos-, Greek for death) involves research on mRNA transcript abundances and gene expression in human tissues after death. Our previous studies have shown that RNA is a suitable and stable molecule in postmortem liver samples up to two days. Consequently, we hypothesized that there are also measurable and significant differences in mRNA transcript abundances in prostate tissues from human remains. In the current study, the goal was to identify apoptotic molecular markers (i.e., pro- and/or anti-apoptosis genes) that provide accurate gene expression profiles regarding the time of death.
   Tissue samples were removed by a medical examiner from the prostate of five cadavers during autopsy. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized and the concentration was determined. The cDNA was reacted in apoptosis-related gene expression profiling by human PCR Array. The PCR Array results showed that at 38 h after death, a majority of the genes for apoptosis induction and positive regulation (i.e., caspases) were over-expressed more than at five days. The expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as BAG1, BCL2, and negative regulator of apoptosis, XIAP, was significantly elevated in a time-dependent manner. However, pro-apoptotic gene expression such as TP53 and TNFSF10 was not significantly upregulated.
   Therefore, postmortem prostate cells counteract programmed cell death with its anti-apoptotic machinery; yet as time progresses, pro-apoptotic mechanisms dominate. In conclusion, our study implies that over-expression of genes in male reproductive organs still occurs during decomposition, which may play substantial roles in forensic research and clinical application. These findings demonstrate that there is still active postmortem gene expression; however, our future research question will be, "When does gene expression terminate after death?"

AB Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases, constituting an independent risk factor for many diseases. Our study aimed to evaluate the association between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genetic polymorphism and hypertension, and to provide evidence for the etiology of hypertension. Case-control studies of ApoE polymorphism and hypertension, which were included in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, WanFang, Vip, and CNKI information databases, were selected and evaluated according to criteria of inclusion and exclusion. Eligible data were extracted and pooled, and were analyzed and assessed using Stata 12.0. Randomeffect models were used when heterogeneity existed in between-study, and fixed-effect models were applied otherwise.
   A total of 28 studies that consisted of 5898 cases with hypertension and 7518 controls were selected. Alleles and genotypes of ApoE between cases and controls were compared. For ApoE alleles, we observed the contrast of ApoE epsilon 2 versus epsilon 3 allele yielded a pooled OR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87-1.11; P = 0.823), whereas the contrast of epsilon 4 versus epsilon 3 allele yielded a pooled OR of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.50-2.54; P < 0.001). For ApoE genotypes, compared with epsilon 3/epsilon 3 genotype, genotypes (epsilon 2/epsilon 2 and epsilon 2/epsilon 3) showed a possible association with hypertension (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.99; P = 0.033), and genotypes (epsilon 3/epsilon 4 and epsilon 4/epsilon 4) had a 2.08-fold risk of developing hypertension (OR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.58-2.74; P < 0.001). There is the association between ApoE polymorphism and hypertension: the genotypes carrying epsilon 2 allele may be a protective factor, and the ApoE epsilon 4 allele and the genotypes carrying epsilon 4 allele may be risk factors for hypertension.

AB Polysaccharides obtained from Momordica charantia have been shown to exert a hypoglycemic effect, thereby improving glucose metabolism. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. Herein, RNA-seq was utilized to obtain whole transcriptomes from the livers of SD rats with type 2 diabetes (DM) and type 2 diabetic rats treated with M. charantia polysaccharides (DMCPIIa). In total, 44,752,508-52,585,920 uniquely mapped reads were obtained, covering 85.54% of the annotated transcripts and representing 12,857 mRNA transcripts. Following analytical analysis, 17 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, false discovery rate q < 0.05) were identified in the DMCPIIa group relative to the DM group. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated that 17 differently expressed genes were enriched in specific biological processes mainly relating to glucose metabolism and fat metabolism (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a subset of the differential genes was selected for validation via real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Collectively, the integrated analysis of differential gene expression, data obtained herein and the examination of previously reported quantitative trait loci, and genome-wide association studies has suggested that pdk4, hsd11 beta, msmo1, rbp4 and fads2 may serve as promising candidates for the modulation of type 2 diabetes.

AB In the current study, a sample population of Northern Iranians was selected to investigate the association of K121Q, rs1799774, rs7754561, and rs997509 ENPP1 gene variants and their haplotypes with T2DM. Genomic DNAs of 978 samples were extracted by Salting Out standard technique and then genotyped by the TaqMan assay. The results show significant differences between study groups for K121Q (p = 0.0004) under a Dominant and rs7754561 (p = 0.002) under a co-dominant hereditary model. Based on allele frequency, there was a significant difference between two study groups at K121Q and rs7754561 variants (p = 0.010 and p = 0.01, respectively). There was no evidence for an association between ENPP1 haplotypes and overall risk of T2DM. Genotype-phenotype sub-analyses showed no significant relationship of four studied polymorphisms with age, gender, FBS, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Homology modeling and molecular docking of ENPP1 in K173 and Q173 models with ATP, AMP, and 2'3'-cGAMP as ligands revealed that all ligands had a more binding affinity to Lys173 protein model, and 2'3'-cGAMP had a higher affinity to both ENPP1 protein models compared to ATP and AMP. These findings suggest that ENPP1 gene variants may have a potential impact on the occurrence of T2DM in Northern Iranians.

AB To obtain a better understanding of the mitochondrial genome in Perlodidae and the phylogeny of Perloidea, we sequenced two perlodid mitochondrial genomes and present comparative analyses in the family Perlodidae. Our results show that genome organization, base composition, codon usage and non-coding and overlapping regions, the sequences of mitochondrial transcription termination factor (DmTTF) and structural elements in control region were conserved in Perlodidae. The unique non-coding regions in COI-trnL2 and traL2-COII were present in Perlodidae but were incomplete or absent from other stoneflies, and we also discuss the conservative property of the sequences between trnE and trnF, trnS1 and ND1. The secondary structure of tRNAs showed that the trnK, trnP, trnS1 and trnW were identical and the trnS1 could not be folded into typical secondary structure due to its absence of DHU arm. Phylogenetic implications supported that Chloroperlidae is a sister group to Perlodidae and the Perlidae is a sister group to the Glade Chloroperlidae + Perlodidae. This study contributes to understanding the comparative mitogenomic analysis of Perlodidae and phylogenetic relationships within the Perloidea.

AB Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, presenting as several diverse clinical and histologic varieties and it is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death in Chinese women. SPC24 is an important component of the mitotic checkpoint machinery and its carcinogenic roles have been shown in several cancers, including anaplastic thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and osteosarcoma. However, the role of SPC24 in breast cancer is still unclear. Here, we show SPC24 is highly expressed in breast cancer compared with the normal tissues. In addition, we observe that SPC24 knockdown can lead to attenuated cell growth, increased cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Consistent with the breast cancer cell results, the in vivo growth of the SPC24-knocking down cells was significantly inhibited. Interestingly, molecular analysis indicates that SPC24 regulates PI3K/AKT kinase pathway, indicating the important of SPC24 for clinical treatment. In aggregate, our results provide an oncogenic functionality of SPC24 in breast cancer progression.

AB Panicle architecture is an important component of agronomic trait in rice, which is also a key ingredient that could influence yield and quality of rice. In the panicle growth and development process, there are a series of complicated molecular and cellular events which are regulated by many interlinking genes. In this study, to explore the potential mechanism and identify genes and pathways involved in the formation of rice panicle, we compared the transcriptional profile of rice panicles (NIL-GW8 and NIL-gw8(Amol)) at three different stages of panicle development: In5 (formation of higher-order branches), In6 (differentiation of glumes) and In7 (differentiation of floral organs). A range of 40.5 to 54.1 million clean reads was aligned to 31,209 genes in our RNA-Seq analysis. In addition, we investigated transcriptomic changes between the two rice lines during different stages. A total of 726, 1121 and 2584 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at stages 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Based on an impact analysis of the DEGs, we hypothesize that MADS-box gene family, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein and various transcription factors may be involved in regulation of panicle development. Further, we also explored the functional properties of DEGs by gene ontology analysis, and the results showed that different numbers of DEGs genes were associated with 53 GO groups. In KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, many DEGs related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormone signal transduction, suggesting their important roles during panicle development. This study provides the first examination of changes in gene expression between different panicle development stages in rice. Our results of transcriptomic characterization provide important information to elucidate the complex molecular and cellular events about the panicle formation in rice or other cereal crops. Also, the findings will be helpful for the further identification of the genes related to panicle development.

AB Objective: The inhibition of Aluminum (AD-induced root tip cell elongation is a major cause of plant root elongation suppression. The inhibition of root tip cell elongation is caused by a disruption of cell wall component metabolism, growth signaling, or cellular damage. The aim of this study was to identify the proteins involved in the metabolism of the root cell wall components under Al stress in the Al-tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar ET8.
   Methods: Differentially expressed proteins of Al-tolerant wheat roots were screened via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Furthermore, their expression changes were detected via RT-PCR analysis. The contents of major components of the cell wall and their changes in metabolic enzyme activities were also investigated.
   Results: A total of 97 differentially expressed proteins from Al-tolerant wheat roots were screened and nine of these 97 proteins were root cell wall component related. The known nucleic acid sequences of proteins were 14-3-3 protein, the plasm membrane (PM) H+-ATPase, phospholipase D, peroxidase, and glycosyltransferase. For 14-3-3 protein, phospholipase D and peroxidase, the protein expression and mRNA expression were consistent with Al-treatment; however, for H+-ATPase and glycosyltransferase, the protein expression and mRNA expression were inconsistent under Al-stress. Furthermore, both cellulase activity and callase activity were down-regulated by Al stress, while the phenylalanineammonialyase (PAL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and peroxidase (POD) activities were up-regulated. Furthermore, the PM H+-ATPase activity was decreased in response to Al stress. In addition, the contents of callose, cellulose, lignin, and H2O2 varied significantly.
   Conclusions: The cell wall components, relative metabolism enzymes activity, and gene expression also changed followed by protein expression changed in response to Al stress. The results suggest that Al stress leads to marked variations in metabolic enzyme activity, carbohydrate content, followed by changes of root cell components in wheat roots.

AB Wnt16 is a major Wnt ligand involved in the regulation of postnatal bone homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that Wnt16 promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, suggesting that this molecule could be targeted for therapeutic interventions to treat bone thinning disorders such as osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt16 regulates bone metabolism is not yet fully understood. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt16 promotes bone formation and to identify the target genes regulated by Wnt16 in osteoblasts, we treated calvarial osteoblasts purified from C57B1/6 mice with recombinant Wnt16 and profiled the gene expression changes by RNA-seq at 24 h post-treatment. We also compared gene expression profiles of Wnt16-treated osteoblasts to canonical Wnt3a- and non-canonical Wnt5a-treated osteoblasts. This study identified 576 genes differentially expressed in Wnt16-treated osteoblasts compared to sham-treated controls; these included several members of Wnt pathway (Wnt2b, Wnt7b, Wnt11, Axin2, Sfrp2, Sfrp4, FzdS etc.) and TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway (Bmp7, Inhba, Inhbb, Tgfb2 etc.). Wnt16 also regulated a large number of genes with known bone phenotypes. We also found that about 37% (215/576) of the Wnt16 targets overlapped with Wnt3a targets and similar to 15% (86/576) overlapped with Wnt5a targets, suggesting that Wnt16 activates both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling targets in osteoblasts. Transcription factor binding motif enrichment analysis in the promoter regions of Wnt16 targets identified noncanonical Wnt/JNK pathway activated transcription factors Fosl2 and Fosl1 as two of the most significantly enriched transcription factors associated with genes activated by Wnt16 while Mef2c was the most significantly enriched transcription factor associated with genes repressed by Wnt16. We also found that a large number of Mef2c targets overlapped with genes down-regulated by Wnt16 and Mef2c itself was transcriptionally repressed by Wnt16 suggesting that Mef2c plays a role in Wnt16-mediated transcriptional regulation.

AB Among ectothermic reptiles, the order Squamata has adapted most successfully to the terrestrial environment. However, the physiological background of this success remains unknown. Since the regulation of energy metabolism provides an important insight into terrestrial adaption by ectothermic animals, we focused on proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs). In the process of cloning proglucagon mRNA in geckos, we identified several novel proglucagon (PG) cDNA isoforms. They were tissue-specifically and strongly expressed in the pancreas and small intestine of the geckos, suggesting their biological relevance. Therefore, in order to clarify whether these novel cDNA isoforms are phylogenetically conserved, we performed the additional molecular characterization of proglucagon cDNAs from several representative species of the Squamata and Testudine Glade and examined the expression of proglucagon mRNAs in the small intestine and pancreas.
   In the present study, a total of 7 proglucagon cDNA isoforms were identified and divided into two groups (Classes A and B) based on the 3'-UTR sequence of each isoform. The longest isoform of each group (named PGA, and PG-B-1, respectively) had the same molecular characteristics as those previously reported from chickens and reptiles, namely, PG-A and PG-B. Other 5 isoforms were novel-type cDNAs, and were the products of exon skipping (named PG-A(2), PG-A(2s), PG-B-2, PG-B-2s, and PG-B-3). Some of these isoforms coded for only one peptide hormone (GLP-1 or GLP-2). This is the first identification of single hormone-encoding proglucagon cDNAs in vertebrates. Moreover, an expression analysis of these isoforms revealed that single hormone-encoding proglucagon mRNAs were predominantly expressed with tissue and lineage specificities in the reptile Glade.
   Collectively, the present results suggest an independent regulatory system for GLP-1 and GLP-2 secretion and indicate the plasticity of proglucagon genes in expressing different isoforms in different tissues in Squamata. These results also provide insights into the plastic energy metabolic system of Squamata in accordance with various habitats in the terrestrial environment, supporting their successful prosperity.

AB A novel xylanase gene (PbXyn10A) from Paenibacillus barengoltzii was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. PbXyn10A had an open reading frame of 3,063 bp, and its deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity of 72% with a xylanase from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus. The recombinant xylanase (PbXyn10A) was purified and biochemically characterized. PbXyn10A was most active at pH 6.5 and 60 degrees C, respectively. It exhibited strict substrate specificity towards birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan and oat-spelt xylan, with Km values of 2.19, 2.04 and 2.51 mg/mL, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed xylan to yield mainly xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with degree of polymerization 2-4. A new strategy for XOS production from corncobs pretreated by steam explosion using acidic electrolyzed water, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was developed. The highest XOS yield of 75% (based on xylan in raw corncobs) was achieved. This is the first report on a xylanase from Paenibacillus barengoltzii.

AB Pistachio roasting before oil extraction increases consumer preference but may cause changes in the oil composition. In this work, the effect of different roasting conditions on the physical parameters, oxidative stability, and pigment composition of pistachio oil extracted by pressure was studied. Density value of pistachio oil was reduced with severe roasting conditions (125 degrees C), while viscosity increased slightly. This adverse effect was compensated by a significant increase in both oxidative stability and, especially, in the content of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. Pistachio roasting temperature had a clear impact on the color of the pistachio oils, changing from yellow in oils from raw or minimally roasted pistachios (50-75 degrees C) to brilliant green in oils from pistachios subjected to higher temperature treatments (100-125 degrees C). An increase in temperature favored the pigment transfer to the oil. The green oils had a total pigment content between 2.3 and 4 times higher than the yellow oils.

AB Celiac disease (CD) develops in genetically susceptible individuals as a result of ingesting gluten-forming proteins found in cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) and barley (Hordeum sativum L.). There are claims that breeding practices have changed wheat protein chemistry over the years and this has resulted in modern wheat being more antigenic in terms of CD as opposed to historical wheat. The aim of this study was to detect and quantify celiac-disease-initiating peptides of alpha-gliadin proteins in historical and modern spring wheat cultivars. The results indicate that immunogenic epitopes are detected in both historical and modern spring wheat cultivars irrespective of release year. Quantitation indicated that the amount of immunogenic epitopes glia-alpha 9 (PFPQPQLPY) and glia-alpha 20 (FRPQQPYPQ), and total alpha-gliadin varied randomly across the cultivars that were analyzed, suggesting there is no association between cultivar release year and amounts of immunogenic epitopes and alpha-gliadin.

AB Ferritin is characterized by a shell-like structure and a reversible self-assembly property. In this study, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) was applied to red bean seed ferritin (RBF) to prepare an ACP-treated RBF (ACPF). Results indicated that the ACP treatment retained the shell-like structure of ferritin but reduced the alpha-helix/beta sheet contents and thermal stability. Iron oxidative deposition and release activities were also markedly changed. The ACPF could be disassembled at pH 4.0 and then assembled into an intact ferritin cage when pH was increased to 7.0, which was a more benign transition condition than that of the traditional method (pH 2.0/7.0 transition). By using this assembly routine, curcumin was successfully encapsulated within the ACPF with a size distribution of 12 nm. Moreover, the encapsulation ratio of curcumin in the ACPF reached 12.7% (w/w). This finding can be used to expand the application of ACP and improve the functionalization of the ferritin.

AB The thermo-active serine peptidase aqualysin 1 (Aq1) of Thermus aquaticus was applied in bread making to study the relative contribution of thermoset gluten to bread crumb texture. Aq1 is active between 30 degrees C and 90 degrees C with an optimum activity temperature of around 65 degrees C. It is inhibited by wheat endogenous serine peptidase inhibitors during dough mixing and fermentation and starts hydrolyzing gluten proteins during baking above 80 degrees C when the enzyme is no longer inhibited and most of the starch is gelatinized and contributes to structure formation. Aq1 activity reduced the molecular weight of gluten proteins and significantly increased their extractability in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium. While it had no impact on the specific bread volume and only limited impact on hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, resilience and chewiness, it impacted bread crumb coherence. We conclude that starch has a greater impact on crumb texture than thermoset gluten.

AB Coffee is globally one of the most widely consumed beverages. Due to the high economic importance for the countries that produce, export and import it, its purity and detection of external impurities have been constant concern. In some cases, visual inspection is unreliable in roasted ground coffee because of resemblance in color and the texture of the cheapest fillers. The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of employing Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for determination of coffee adulteration with chickpea, corn and wheat. For this purpose, LIBS spectra was evaluated with chemometrics methods for classification and quantification of the adulteration ratio. Coefficient of determination and limit of detection values for chickpea, corn and wheat adulteration with Coffee arabica were found as 0.996, 0.995, 0.995 and 0.56%, 0.52% and 0.45%, respectively. With LIBS, prevention of unfair competition, protection of consumers and determination of coffee quality can be achieved.

Compared with AAD, IRD slowed down the increase in yellowness, water uptake and volume expansion ratio of brown rice by 47.9%, 41.0% and 37.9% after four months of storage, and decreased the temperature range and enthalpy of gelatinization, the peak and breakdown viscosities. These changes might due to the higher stabilization effect of IRD on the microstructure and thermal properties of proteins and starch granules than AAD. IRD is an effective method to improve storage stability of brown rice.

AB The absence of gluten in gluten-free flours presents a challenge to their application in baking. Enzymatic modification of the protein and polysaccharides may result in a network that mimics gluten. In the current study, the effects of laccase on the rheological properties of amadumbe dough were investigated. Thiol and total phenolic contents of dough decreased by up to 28% and 93%, respectively, as laccase activity was increased (0-3 U/g flour). Both G' and G '' of laccase-treated dough increased significantly due to laccase-catalysed cross-linking of proteins and polysaccharides esterified with phenolics, as demonstrated by relevant model reactions. Tan delta decreased with increase in laccase activity indicating an increase in the elastic character of the dough. The improvement in dough viscoelasticity may enable the retention of adequate carbon dioxide during proofing and production of more acceptable gluten-free bread.

AB An innovative approach of high hydrostatic pressure was used to prepare lotus seed amylose-fatty acid complexes. The objective of this study was to investigate their structure and thermal properties. WAXD pattern of amylose changed from B-type to B-and V6-type hybrid polymorphs, and its relative crystallinity increased upon the addition of fatty acids. Carboxyl group observed by FTIR indicates the formation of complexes. SAXS was performed to measure the lamellar structure of complexes. The complexes were more compact and had lower amounts of amorphous regions compared with amylose controls. Entrapped fatty acids, higher melting temperature, and enthalpy change of complexes but not of the controls were detected by DSC. The distribution of fatty acid molecules in the complex matrix was estimated through NMR. Under different pressures, the complexes exhibited dissimilar characteristics with the increase in aliphatic chain length, as observed by WAXD, FTIR, DSC and NMR.

AB The complex coacervation of pea protein isolate (PPI) with commercial pectic polysaccharides [high methoxy citrus pectin (P90, 90 representing DE), apple pectin (P78) sugar beet pectin (P62), low methoxy citrus pectin (P29)] of different degrees of esterification (DE) [and galacturonic acid content (GalA)] and blockiness (DB), was investigated. The maximum amount of coacervates formed at a biopolymer weight mixing ratio of 4: 1 for all PPI-pectin mixtures, with the exception of PPI-P29 where maximum coacervation occurred at the 10: 1 mixing ratio. The pH at which maximum interactions occurred was pH 3.4-3.5 (PPI: P90/P78) and 3.7-3.8 (PPI: P62/P29). PPI complexed with pectins with high levels of DE (low levels of GalA) and DB displayed greater interactions at optimal mixing conditions compared to pectin having lower levels of esterification and blockiness. The addition of P78 to PPI greatly increased protein solubility at pH 4.5.

AB This study reports the effects of addition of mushroom powder on the nutritional properties, predictive in vitro glycaemic response and antioxidant potential of durum wheat pasta. Addition of the mushroom powder enriched the pasta as a source of protein, and soluble and insoluble dietary fibre compared with durum wheat semolina. Incorporation of mushroom powder significantly decreased the extent of starch degradation and the area under the curve (AUC) of reducing sugars released during digestion, while the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities of samples increased. A mutual inhibition system between the degree of starch gelatinisation and antioxidant capacity of the pasta samples was observed. These results suggest that mushroom powder could be incorporated into fresh semolina pasta, conferring healthier characteristics, namely lowering the potential glycaemic response and improving antioxidant capacity of the pasta.

AB An authentication procedure for differentiating between organic and non-organic cattle production on the basis of analysis of serum samples has been developed. For this purpose, the concentrations of fourteen mineral elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, I, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn) in 522 serum samples from cows (341 from organic farms and 181 from non-organic farms), determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, were used. The chemical information provided by serum analysis was employed to construct different pattern recognition classification models that predict the origin of each sample: organic or non-organic class. Among all classification procedures considered, the best results were obtained with the decision tree C5.0, Random Forest and AdaBoost neural networks, with hit levels close to 90% for both production types. The proposed method, involving analysis of serum samples, provided rapid, accurate in vivo classification of cattle according to organic and non-organic production type.

AB This study was carried out to develop an UHPLC-MS/MS analytical procedure, to determinate all isomers and isoforms of crocins of 42 saffron samples, with different origin, age and dried using different process conditions.
   A preliminary experimental design was applied to optimize the extraction of crocins; UHPLC-MS/MS conditions were set to obtain the best analytical performances in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. The optimised conditions allowed to determine ten crocins; their amount in samples was significantly different and affected by process, age and origin. Drying conditions influenced the crocins pattern and this was particularly evidenced in the more recently produced samples, with a clear separation between mild and high thermally treated samples. Principal Component Analysis of all crocins data allowed to discriminate samples based on origin (Italy vs. other countries) and age.
   Results confirm the feasibility of the use of crocins pattern as marker of quality and traceability of saffron.

AB To evaluate the effect of electron beam (EB) irradiation on IgG binding capacity and conformation of tropomyosin in shrimp (Solenocera melantho), shrimp meat was irradiated with different doses (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 kGy) of EB. IgG binding capacity of TM from shrimp meat was detected by western blot and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The conformation of TM was analyzed with circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results showed that there was a significant decrease in IgG binding capacity of TM from shrimp meat treated with EB irradiation, with the most significant effect observed at 7 kGy. At this dose, the IgG binding capacity of TM decreased by 59% when compared to the control group. The structural changes were consistent with changes in IgG binding capacity of TM. It was concluded that EB irradiation can reduce the immunoreactivity of shrimp TM by altering its structure.

AB During Champagne or sparkling wine tasting, gas-phase CO2 and volatile organic compounds invade the headspace above glasses, thus progressively modifying the chemical space perceived by the consumer. Gas-phase CO2 in excess can even cause a very unpleasant tingling sensation perturbing both ortho-and retronasal olfactory perception. Monitoring as accurately as possible the level of gas-phase CO2 above glasses is therefore a challenge of importance aimed at better understanding the close relationship between the release of CO2 and a collection of various tasting parameters. Here, the concentration of CO2 found in the headspace of champagne glasses served under multivariate conditions was accurately monitored, all along the 10 min following pouring, through a new combined approach by a CO2-Diode Laser Sensor and micro-gas chromatography. Our results show the strong impact of various tasting conditions (volume dispensed, intensity of effervescence, and glass shape) on the release of gas-phase CO2 above the champagne surface.

AB Emerging evidence suggests that aristolochic acids (AA) produced naturally by a common weed Aristolochia clematitis in the cultivation fields is contaminating the food products in Balkan Peninsula and acting as the etiological agent in the development of Balkan endemic nephropathy. In this study, we investigated the combined use of natural anti-oxidative "food additives" and different cooking methods to find a solution for the widespread contamination of AA in food products. The results indicated that the addition of healthy dietary supplements (such as cysteine, glutathione, ascorbic acid, citric acid and magnesium) during cooking, is a highly efficient method in lowering the concentration of AA in the final food products. Because previous observation indicated one of the toxicological mechanisms by which AA exert its toxicity is to induce oxidative stress in internal organs, it is anticipated that these added anti-oxidants will also help to attenuate the nephrotoxicity of AA.

AB A simple mild process to remove phospholipids in soy protein isolate has been developed. The method includes two steps: A 5% soy protein isolate solution is concurrently treated with 0.5-1.5 mu kat phospholipase A(2)/g protein and 10 mmol/l beta-cyclodextrin for 4 h at 43 degrees C, pH 8.0; secondly, soy protein is separated from the treated solution by precipitating at pH 4.5. The treatment removed more than 92% of the off-flavour precursors in SPI. Comparing alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins, alpha-cyclodextrin was more effective (> 95% removal of precursors) than beta-cyclodextrin, while gamma-cyclodextrin essentially had no effect. Under accelerated storage conditions at 45 degrees C for 90 days, the rate of hexanal production in the treated SPI was 12-times slower than that in the untreated SPI. The treatment lowered the thermal denaturation temperature and enthalpy of denaturation of soy proteins but not its solubility, indicating that the treatment caused some structural changes in soy proteins.

AB Climate effects on crop quality at the molecular level are not well-understood. Gas and liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry were used to measure changes of hundreds of compounds in tea at different elevations in Yunnan Province, China. Some increased in concentration while others decreased by 100's of percent. Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis revealed compounds exhibiting analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-stress, and cardioprotective properties statistically (p = 0.003) differentiated high from low elevation tea. Also, sweet, floral, honey-like notes were higher in concentration in the former while the latter displayed grassy, hay-like aroma. In addition, multivariate analysis of variance showed low elevation tea had statistically (p = 0.0062) higher concentrations of caffeine, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and catechin; all bitter compounds. Although volatiles represent a small fraction of the total mass, this is the first comprehensive report illustrating how normal variations in temperature, 5 degrees C, due to elevational effects impact tea quality.

AB Common Dimension (ComDim) chemometrics method for multi-block data analysis was employed to evaluate the impact of different added salts and ripening times on physicochemical, color, dynamic low amplitude oscillatory rheology, texture profile, and molecular structure (fluorescence and MIR spectroscopies) of five Cantal-type cheeses. Firstly, Independent Components Analysis (ICA) was applied separately on fluorescence and MIR spectra in order to extract the relevant signal source and the associated proportions related to molecular structure characteristics. ComDim was then applied on the 31 data tables corresponding to the proportion of ICA signals obtained for spectral methods and the global analysis of cheeses by the other techniques. The ComDim results indicated that generally cheeses made with 50% NaCl or with 75: 25% NaCl/KCl exhibit the equivalent characteristics in structural, textural, meltability and color properties. The proposed methodology demonstrates the applicability of ComDim for the characterization of samples when different techniques describe the same samples.

AB A hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system (380-1000 nm) was investigated for non-invasively estimating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in ready-to-eat sausages during 5 days storage at 35 degrees C. A set of pretreated combinations were carried out on preprocessing the spectra to improve the performance of partial least squares regression (PLSR). According to the regression coefficient values, ten important wavelengths (385, 390, 395, 505, 580, 670, 745, 780, 855, and 955 nm) were selected in this study. PLSR models developed using full wavelengths and optimal wavelengths showed the prediction coefficient of determination (r(p)(2)) up to 0.8324 and 0.8606, respectively. The concentration and location of the ATP content in sausages were for the first time displayed via chemical imaging developed by R statistics. Combining HSI and multivariate analysis can quantify and visualize ATP dynamic changes during storage and a great potential in the processed meat industry for real-time inspection.

AB The accumulation of organic selenium (Se) in grains is helpful in understanding its bioaccessibility in various Se-enriched rice cultivars after soil selenite treatments. In the present study conducted with two rice cultivars, the organic Se as well as the glutelin-derived Se and the selenomethionine (SeMet) percentage in grains increased with soil Se levels. The available Se that was detected in the forms of SeMet (similar to 40%) and selenite (similar to 12%) accounted for more than 50% of the total Se in grains, and no significant differences were observed between the two rice cultivars (P > 0.05). Simulated gastrointestinal digestion showed that the digested grain SeMet increased with the soil Se treatment levels, whereas there were minimal changes in the percentages of selenite in the grain. Furthermore, approximately half of the available SeMet was derived from the grain glutelin. These results suggest that the non-glutelin-derived Se in rice should be further studied.

AB Methylenecyclcopropylglycine (MCPG) and hypoglycin A (HGA) are naturally occurring amino acids found in various soapberry (Sapindaceae) fruits. These toxins have been linked to illnesses worldwide and were recently implicated in Asian outbreaks of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy. In a previous joint agricultural and public health investigation, we developed an analytical method capable of evaluating MCPG and HGA concentrations in soapberry fruit arils as well as a clinical method for the urinary metabolites of the toxins. Since the initial soapberry method only analyzed the aril portion of the fruit, we present here the extension of the method to include the fruit seed matrix. This work is the first method to quantitate both MCPG and HGA concentrations in the seeds of soapberry fruit, including those collected during a public health investigation. Further, this is the first quantitation of HGA in litchi seeds as well as both toxins in mamoncillo and longan seeds.

AB INCOGARR is a thematic network recently approved to be financially supported by the Ibero-American Program of Science and Technology for Development (CYTED). The objectives of this Network are the design and evaluation of an efficient and feasible anti-tick vaccine candidate from the technical and economical points of view and also sharing experiences in the immunological control of ticks as part of an Integrated Control Program. The Network consists of seven laboratories and one company from six countries. The first meeting of the Network took place with the representation of each laboratory involved. In the meeting, general and specific objectives and activities of the Network were discussed and it was a very nice example of international collaboration to address an unsolved worldwide topic on tick control in which laboratories with different competencies and expertise join their efforts in a common goal.

AB Objectives: We aimed to describe direct medical costs of annual RSV-associated hospitalisation in the first year of life.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study in Lyon, France (2012-2016). A case was defined as a laboratory confirmed RSV-infection with hospitalisation in the first year of life. Hospital costs were estimated based on the French version of Diagnosis Related Groups.
   Results: Overall, 350 cases in 21,930 children were identified. Incidence of RSV-associated hospitalisation in the first year of life per 1000 births was 14.5 (95% CI 13.4-15.6). Related direct medical annual costs were 364,269 (sic), mostly attributed to children born during the RSV season (231,959 (sic)) and children born premature (108,673 (sic)).
   Conclusion: Medical costs for RSV-associated hospitalisation of newborns are higher for children born premature or born during the RSV season. Prioritised targeting of those groups may facilitate a costefficient strategy for the national prevention program. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This systematic review provides an overview of the current clinical trials investigating therapeutic vaccines for HPV+ head and neck cancer and discusses the future directions of therapeutic vaccine therapy.
   Materials and methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and clinicaltrials.gov for clinical trials involving therapeutic vaccines. We included studies initiated between 2000 and 2018 with patients diagnosed with HPV+ head and neck cancer and extracted data concerning type of vaccine therapy, adverse events, immunogenicity and clinical outcome measures (e.g. tumour response, progression-free survival and overall survival).
   Results: We identified 11 studies (n = 376 patients) initiated between year 2005 and 2017. Four studies (n = 34) presented preliminary results in patients with incurable, recurrent loco-regional or distant metastatic disease indicating a positive immune response with 74% (n = 25/34 patients) having elevated antibody levels, IFN-gamma and/or T-cell response. Five studies presented data on the vaccines' safety profile, demonstrating predominantly grade 1 and 2 toxicity. Three studies evaluated the clinical outcome one study showed no complete or partial response, one study demonstrated stable disease as the best tumour response in 64% (n = 9/14 patients) and one study showed a 33% overall response rate: one patient with a complete response and seven patients with a partial response.
   Conclusions: Treatment with therapeutic vaccines is a promising and seemingly safe strategy for patients with HPV+ head and neck cancer. However, there are not enough data to draw any further conclusions and clinical outcome measures and tumour responses to the vaccines are still missing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cholera, a diarrheal disease primarily affecting vulnerable populations in developing countries, is estimated to cause disease in more than 2.5 million people and kill almost 100,000 annually. An oral cholera vaccine (OCV) has been available globally since 2001; the demand for this vaccine from affected countries has however been very low, due to various factors including vaccine price and mode of administration. The low demand for the vaccine and limited commercial incentives to invest in research and development of vaccines for developing country markets has kept the global supply of OCVs down. Since 1999, the International Vaccine Institute has been committed to make safe, effective and affordable OCVs accessible. Through a variety of partnerships with collaborators in Sweden, Vietnam, India and South Korea, and with public and private funding, IVI facilitated development and production of two affordable and WHO-prequalified OCVs and together with other stakeholders accelerated the introduction of these vaccines for the global public-sector market.

AB Routine immunization of infants with conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive Hib disease; however changes in the epidemiology of H. influenzae disease have occurred. We describe the epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae disease and the characterization of isolates collected in Italy between 2012 and 2016.
   Trends in the overall incidence of invasive H. influenzae disease were calculated. Isolates were characterized by PCR capsular genotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, ampicillin resistance-associated gene sequencing and MLST. Trends in incidence by serotype and serotype-specific distribution were estimated using multiple imputation of missing data.
   The overall incidence of invasive H. influenzae disease increased 22.5% yearly (from 0.11/100,000 in 2012 to 0.24/100,000 in 2016). Most cases (82.0%) were due to non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi). An increasing trend in NTHi disease burden was estimated; the highest rise was among infants <12 months (40.8% annual increase). Invasive Hib disease showed a fluctuating trend with a clear increase in 2016, while we found an increasing trend for disease due to non-Hib capsulated serotypes in the elderly (32.9% annual increase). Ampicillin resistance mediated by either beta-lactamase or altered penicillin-binding proteins 3 (PBP3) increased. In spite of genetic diversity of NTHi, sequence types (STs) associated with ampicillin resistance status were identified (ST103/ST106 linked to beta-lactamase production and ST14 linked to a specific PBP3 substitution pattern). The increasing trend in invasive NTHi disease in infants is of concern underlying the need for the development of a future vaccine against NTHi. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A candidate hand, foot, and mouth disease vaccine comprising of human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) virus-like particles (VLPs) was tested in rabbits to evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine. The rabbits received more than double the full human dose and one additional dose according to the n + 1 recommended scheme. The three doses were given mixed with Alhydrogel adjuvant as intramuscular (IM) injections. Vaccinations were well-tolerated, with no indication of overt toxicity in any parameter observed. An EV-A71 specific immune response in the form of antibodies that specifically reacted with the virus capsid proteins VP1 and VP0, the complete VLP, and EV-A71 viruses of different subgenotypes to that of the vaccine could be demonstrated. A boosting effect in the form of higher EV-A71 specific antibody titers was observed after the subsequent doses, and these enhanced titers were shown to be statistically significant in one-way ANOVA analyses. Fortnightly intramuscular administration of EV-A71 VLP vaccine did not result in any test article-related changes in immunotoxicity as defined by increased serum IL-6, and in general IL-6 concentrations remained below the lower limit of quantitation for the majority of animals throughout the study. Although increased indicators of inflammation at the injection site were observed in animals sacrificed immediately after the last vaccination, these largely reversed at the end of the recovery phase. No findings suggestive of systemic or delayed toxicity were recorded in this independently conducted study. In conclusion, repeated IM administration of the EV-A71 VLP vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and immunogenic, supporting the clinical development of the vaccine.

AB Background: Most studies on immunocastration currently focused on male animals. However, immunization of male animals does not completely inhibit sexual behavior and fertility. This study aimed to compare the immunocastration effect of KISS1 DNA vaccines encoding different lengths of kisspeptins in female rats for effective castration effects on both male and female rats.
   Methods: Fifteen female rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in T1 group or T2 group was orally given respectively KISS1-54 or KISS1-10 DNA vaccines with fused tPA signal peptide, and the control group (Group C) was orally administered with empty vector vaccine, at a dose of 5 x 10(9) CFU/rat at weeks 0, 3 and 6 of the study. Blood samples were collected by retroorbital bleeding before primary immunization and at weeks 3 and 9 after primary immunization.
   Results: Both KISS1-54 and KISS1-10 DNA vaccines induced the body's humoral immune response, and the anti-kisspeptin antibody titres in the T1 group were significantly higher than that in T2 and C groups (p < 0.05). The rats in T1 group has lower serum kisspeptin and estradiol levels than those in T2 and C groups and smaller litter size of rats than those in the control group after mating (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between T2 and C groups. The levels of KISS1 and GPR54 mRNA in the hypothalamus and ovaries of the T1 group were significantly lower than that in control group. However, the levels of KISS1 mRNA in the T2 group were significantly lower than that in the control group only in ovaries (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The oral KISS1-54 DNA vaccine with fused tPA signal peptide was more effective than that KISS1-10 DNA vaccine in suppressing fertility of female rats. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Chlamydial infections are spread worldwide and a vaccine is needed to control this pathogen. The goals of this study were to determine if the delivery of an adjuvant associated to the antigen, via a derivatized amphipol, and adjuvant combinations improve vaccine protection.
   Methods: A novel approach, trapping the Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) native MOMP (nMOMP) with amphipols (A8-35), bearing a covalently conjugated peptide (EP67), was used. Adjuvants incorporated were: EP67 either conjugated to A8-35, which was used to trap nMOMP (nMOMP/EP67-A8-35), or free as a control, added to nMOMP/A8-35 complexes (nMOMP/A8-35+EP67); Montanide ISA 720 to enhance humoral responses, and CpG-1826 to elicit robust cell-mediated immunity (CMI). BALB/c mice were immunized by mucosal and systemic routes. Intranasal immunization with live Cm was used as positive control and three negative controls were included. Mice were challenged intranasally with Cm and changes in body weight, lungs weight and number of Cm-inclusion forming units (IFU) recovered from the lungs were evaluated to establish protection. To assess local responses levels of IFN-gamma and Cm-specific IgA were determined in lungs' supernatants.
   Results: Structural assays demonstrated that nMOMP secondary structure and thermal stability were maintained when A8-35 was covalently modified. Mice vaccinated with nMOMP/EP67-A8-35 were better protected than animals immunized with nMOMP/A8-35+EP67. Addition of Montanide enhanced Th2 responses and improved protection. Including CpG-1826 further broadened, intensified and switched to Th1-biased immune responses. With delivery of nMOMP and the three adjuvants, as determined by changes in body weight, lungs weight and number of IFU recovered from lungs, protection at 10 days post-challenge was equivalent to that induced by immunization with live Cm.
   Conclusions: Covalent association of EP67 to A8-35, used to keep nMOMP water-soluble, improves protection over that conferred by free EP67. Adjuvant combinations including EP67+Montanide+CpG-1826, by broadening and intensifying cellular and humoral immune responses, further enhanced protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of whole body radiation exposure early in life on influenza vaccination immune responses much later in life. A total of 292 volunteers recruited from the cohort members of ongoing Adult Health Study (AHS) of Japanese atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors completed this observational study spanning two influenza seasons (2011-2012 and 2012-2013). Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to and three weeks after vaccination. Serum 'hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were measured as well as concentrations of 25 cytokines and chemokines in culture supernatant from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with and without in vitro stimulation with influenza vaccine. We found that influenza vaccination modestly enhanced serum HAI titers in this unique cohort of elderly subjects, with seroprotection ranging from 18 to 48% for specific antigen/season combinations. Twelve percent of subjects were seroprotected against all three vaccine antigens postvaccination. Males were generally more likely to be seroprotected for one or more antigens postvaccination, with no differences in vaccine responses based on age at vaccination or radiation exposure in early life. These results show that early life exposure to ionizing radiation does not prevent responses of elderly A-bomb survivors to seasonal influenza vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive analysis of sequence variation was carried out comparing the fusion (F) protein of human respiratory syncytial viruses (hRSV) from antigenic groups A and B with the prototype sequence of the A2 strain, also belonging to antigenic group A. The limited number of full bovine RSV F sequences available were included, as well as an extensive set of F sequences from the related human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The results were analysed in the context of the recently determined three dimensional F protein structures, with antigenic sites mapped to these. Although a high degree of sequence conservation in hRSV F exists, and sequence changes did not correlate with location of antigenic sites, preferential accumulation of amino acid changes in certain antigenic sites was noted. When the analysis was extended to hMPV F, a high number of changes was noticed, in agreement with the limited degree of sequence conservation. However, some conserved regions were noted, which may account for the limited number of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies described between hRSV F and hMPV F. These results provide information about the degree of sequence and antigenic variation currently found in the F protein of circulating viruses. They highlight the importance of establishing a baseline dataset to monitor for future changes that might evolve should preventative immunological measures be made widely available.

AB Background: Measuring vaccine effectiveness (VE) relies on the use of observational study designs. However, achieving robust estimates of direct and indirect VE is frequently compromised by bias, particularly when using syndromic diagnoses of low-specificity.
   Methods: In order to mitigate confounding between the measured outcome and vaccine uptake, we developed a method to balance comparator populations using individual-level propensity scoring derived from the vaccine-exposed population, and applied it to the unexposed comparator population. Indirect VE was estimated by comparing the unvaccinated vaccine-exposed group with a propensity score-simulated unvaccinated, unexposed group. Direct VE was derived by removing indirect VE from the overall VE.
   We applied this method to an evaluation of the effectiveness of infant rotavirus vaccination in the UK. Using a general practice cohort of 45,259 live births between May 2010 and December 2015, we calculated indirect and direct VE against consultations for acute gastroenteritis using conventional and vaccination-propensity adjustment comparator populations.
   Results: The overall VE during the rotavirus-season (January-May) calculated using mixed-effects Cox regression was 30% [95% confidence intervals (95% CI: 25,35%)]. Use of conventional comparator populations resulted in implausible VE estimates -14% (95% CI: -41,7%) for direct and 29% (95% CI: 14,42%) for indirect effects. Applying our alternative method, direct VE was 26% (95% CI: 1,45%) and indirect VE was 8% (95% CI: -19,29%).
   Conclusions: Estimating VE using propensity score simulated comparator populations, particularly for studies using routine health data with syndromic, low-specificity endpoints will aid accurate measurement of the broader public health impact of a vaccine programme.

TI Assessing the effectiveness of high-dose influenza vaccine in preventing
   hospitalization among seniors, and observations on the limitations of
   effectiveness study design
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article

ID OLDER-ADULTS; EFFICACY; IMMUNOGENICITY; CHILDREN; FRAILTY; SAFETY; AGE
AB Background: The availability of high-dose (HD) influenza vaccine for seniors should decrease influenza-related hospitalization. Studies to date show a range of mostly moderate increased HD vaccine effectiveness (VE). While a 'healthy vaccinee' phenomenon can inflate VE, for influenza and particularly an HD vaccine targeted at frailer adults, an 'at-risk vaccinee' bias may deflate VE estimates. We assessed senior HD vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization by linking immunization registry records to hospitalizations. We also examined whether adding strata typically ignored in case-control matching schemas, such as residence areas, exact age, and provider biases, would increase VE.
   Methods: For the 2016-17 influenza season in the Portland metropolitan area, the differential VE for the HD vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza hospitalization was assessed by a nested series of models across matching strata. For an exact match for high-dose and standard-dose seniors, matching elements included exact age, gender, residence type, race-ethnicity, provider bias, and residence area (zipcode).
   Results: As a first step, a simple aggregate comparison of influenza-related hospitalization risk showed no added HD effectiveness. For the nested models, adding strata increased VE. In the final model, among 23,712 matched pairs of HD to SD vaccinated seniors, the HD vaccine was 30.7% (95%CI: 8-48%) more effective in preventing influenza-related hospitalization.
   Conclusion: For this study, the high-dose influenza vaccine provided superior protection for seniors against influenza hospitalization. Including matching elements as exact year of age and residence zipcode all added to the calculation of VE. As a warning, non-matched or overly simple matched VE study designs may substantially under-estimate VE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: In 2015 in Quebec, Canada, the passive vaccine adverse event reporting system detected an increase in large local reactions associated with vaccines recommended at the 18-month visit. This followed changes to the pediatric vaccine schedule to include hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertusis-inactivated polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B vaccine (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HB, Infanrix-hexa (R), GSK) and quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV, ProQuad (R), Merck) as 18-month booster doses.
   Objectives: To determine if the excess of large local reactions was caused by a specific vaccine or their co-administration in the same limb or during the same visit.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted among cases born between January 2012 and April 2015 with a large local reaction following MMR +/- V or DTaP-IPV-Hib +/- HB vaccines administered between 16 and 23 months of age. Controls were randomly selected from the provincial medicare database among children born during the same period.
   Results: Our analysis included 96 cases and 494 controls vaccinated with MMRV or DTaP-IPV-Hib +/- HB vaccines. Among the 96 cases, 46% had a cellulitis and 54% had an injection site reaction extending beyond the nearest joint and/or lasting >= 4 days. Among the 39 cases who were immunized in different limbs, 77% of the large local reactions were located at the Infanrix-hexa (R) site, 5% at the DTaP-IPV-Hib site and 18% at the ProQuad (R) site. Large local reactions were significantly more frequent with Infanrix-hexa (R) than with DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine (OR 5.9 95% CI: 1.4-25.7). Administration of ProQuad (R) and Infanrix-hexa (R) in the same limb did not increase the risk of large local reactions.
   Conclusion: This investigation suggested that most large local reactions were causally associated with the Infanrix-hexa (R) vaccine and that the risk was not greater when ProQuad (R) and Infanrix-hexa (R) were administered in the same limb. Given the improved vaccine coverage for hepatitis B, benefit-risk analysis likely still favours ongoing use of Infanrix-hexa (R) with informed parental consent. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter jejuni (CJ), and Shigella sp. are major causes of bacterial diarrhea worldwide, but there are no licensed vaccines against any of these pathogens. Most current approaches to ETEC vaccines are based on recombinant proteins that are involved in virulence, particularly adhesins. In contrast, approaches to Shigella and CJ vaccines have included conjugate vaccines in which Shigella lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or CJ capsule polysaccharides are chemically conjugated to proteins. We have explored the feasibility of developing a multi-pathogen vaccine by using ETEC proteins as conjugating partners for CJ and Shigella polysaccharides. We synthesized three vaccines in which two CJ polysaccharides were conjugated to two recombinant ETEC adhesins based on CFA/I (CfaEB) and CS6 (CssBA), and LPS from Shigella flexneri was also conjugated to CfaEB. The vaccines were immunogenic in mice as monovalent, bivalent and trivalent formulations. Importantly, functional antibodies capable of inducing hemaglutination inhibition (HAI) of a CFA/I expressing ETEC strain were induced in all vaccines containing CfaEB. These data suggest that conjugate vaccines could be a platform for a multipathogen, multi-serotype vaccine against the three major causes of diarrheal disease worldwide. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cryptosporidium spp. is a zoonotic intracellular protozoan and a significant cause of diarrhoea in humans and animals worldwide. This parasite can cause high morbidity in immunocompromised people and children in developing countries, livestock being the main reservoir. This study was aimed at performing preliminary tests on Swiss albino weaned mice (ICR) to evaluate the humoral immune response induced against peptides derived from Cryptosporidium parvum CP15 (15 kDa sporozoite surface antigen) and CSL (circumsporozoite-like antigen) proteins. Peptides were identified and characterised using bioinformatics tools and were chemically synthesised. The antibody response was determined and the neutralising effect of antibodies was measured in cell culture. Despite all peptides studied here were capable of stimulating antibody production, neutralising antibodies were detected for just two of the CP15-derived ones. Additional studies aimed at evaluating further the potential of such peptides as vaccine candidates are thus recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: As Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a range of congenital anomalies, pregnant women may be a target population for vaccination in future outbreaks. Their inclusion in vaccine trials is critical to ensure safe and effective vaccines in pregnancy. Though many vaccine candidates are in development, pregnant women's willingness to participate in Zika virus vaccine research is unknown. This study aims to describe pregnant women's attitudes toward Zika virus vaccine research participation, as well as perceived barriers to and facilitators of enrollment.
   Methods: Pregnant and recently postpartum women (n = 128) attending prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital completed surveys querying their willingness to participate in four hypothetical Zika virus vaccine trials and their motivations for participation. Demographics, information on prior Zika virus exposure, and vaccine acceptance were collected.
   Results: Most women (77%) accepted participation in at least one hypothetical Zika virus vaccine trial, and women were significantly more likely to accept prospective enrollment in an inactivated vaccine trial compared to a live-attenuated vaccine trial (p-value <0.0001) or a nucleic acid-based vaccine trial (p-value <0.0444). Important motivators for participation included evidence from research with pregnant and non-pregnant people, a desire to protect the baby from Zika, perceptions of vaccine safety, and provider recommendation.
   Conclusions: A majority of women in this cohort were willing to participate in a Zika virus vaccine trial while pregnant, however, differences in acceptance exist between vaccine platforms. The high value placed on evidence by participants highlights the importance of gathering and communicating pregnancy-specific data to potential research participants and their providers. Women's motivations for accepting research participation during pregnancy are important to inform the Zika virus vaccine research agenda, candidate prioritization, and trial design.

AB Cellular and humoral immune responses to tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td) were assessed in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed Italian military personnel who received multiple concomitant vaccines. Td-specific antibodies and T-lymphocytes were measured in individuals with one (group-1) and more than one (group-2) Td boosters. A third group (group-3), who received several vaccines, but not Td, was studied to verify the hypothesis of the polyclonal B-cell activation as mechanism for antibody persistence. The antibody response to Td toxoids was higher in group-1, who showed lower baseline antibody levels, than in group-2 subjects. The antibody response to tetanus was higher than to diphtheria toxoid in both groups. No correlation between antibody and cellular response, and no interference in the response to Td by co-administration of different vaccines were observed. HLA-DRB1*01 allele was detected at significant higher frequency in subjects unable to double the baseline anti-diphtheria antibody levels after the vaccination. Anti-tetanus and diphtheria antibodies half-lives were assessed and the long-lasting persistence above the threshold for protection (0.1 Itliml) was estimated in over 65 and 20 years, respectively. No significant increase of anti-diphtheria antibodies was observed in consequence of polyclonal B-cell activation.
   This study emphasizes the duration of Td vaccination-induced seroprotection, suggesting that re-vaccination should probably be performed at intervals longer than 10 years. No reciprocal interference by concomitantly administered vaccines has been observed. HLA-DRB1 *01 allele was significantly associated with anti-diphtheria defective response. Finally, this study does not confirm that anti-diphtheria antibody levels are maintained by polyclonal B-cell activation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Inequalities in childhood vaccination timing and completion in London
SO VACCINE

DT Article
DE Vaccine coverage; Timing; Late; Inequalities; Ethnicity; Deprivation
ID TIMELINESS; COVERAGE
AB The UK primary vaccination course includes vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP/IPV/Hib) and is scheduled at ages four, 8 and 12 weeks, followed by a 'preschool booster' at age three years four months. Vaccine coverage is generally measured at age one, two and five years. In addition to high coverage, vaccination should be timely to maximise population protection.
   Vaccination histories for 315,381 children born March 2001 to April 2010 were extracted from Child Health Information Systems in nine London health service areas and grouped into first and fifth birthday cohorts. We assessed timeliness of receipt of DTaP/IPV/Hib and drop-out rates by ethnicity, deprivation and area.
   Most children received their first, second and third doses on time at two, three, and four months. Among children completing by one year and after adjusting for deprivation and health area, compared with White-British children, Somali and Bangladeshi children were less likely to have received three doses of DTaP/IPV/Hib by six months of age (-11% and -5% respectively). Differences in timeliness by deprivation and health area existed, but were smaller. Compared with White-British children, children of Polish, Somali and Caribbean ethnicities were less likely to return for preschool booster, with a drop-out rate at least 7% higher in these groups. Within the fifth birthday cohort, only 2.3% of children who were completely unvaccinated (575/25,095) at age one year were fully vaccinated by age five. Higher proportions of partially vaccinated (one or two doses) children at age one year went on to be fully vaccinated by age five ((836/3213) 26.0% and (3565/6076) 58.7% respectively).
   These inequalities suggest that tailored approaches may be required to target specific groups with regards to improving vaccine uptake. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Global efforts to adequately monitor safety of new vaccines for pregnant women in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are needed. The Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in pregnancy (GAIA) project recently published case definitions based on levels of diagnostic certainty for pregnancy- and neonatal outcomes and maternal vaccination. As a preliminary step to assessing the applicability of these definitions in LMICs, WHO selected sites and conducted a feasibility assessment to evaluate their ability to identify and classify selected outcomes (preterm birth, neonatal death, neonatal invasive bloodstream infection (NI-BSI), stillbirth) and maternal vaccination.
   Methods: Candidate sites were initially screened using a questionnaire. For each outcome, eligible sites were asked to retrospectively identify and collect information for three individuals born in 2016. Subsequently, outcomes were classified by level of diagnostic certainty.
   Results: Fifty-one sites (15 countries) were screened; 32 of them (9 countries) participated in the assessment and identified 315 subjects with the outcomes of interest. Twenty-four sites (8 countries) identified at least one subject per outcome and agreed to continue participating. The majority (80%) of preterm births, neonatal deaths, and NI-BSI subjects, but only 50% of stillbirths, could be assessed for diagnostic certainty. The main reasons for not classifying stillbirths were insufficient information to distinguish between antepartum and intrapartum stillbirth (29%); or that not all data for one subject fit into a single level of diagnostic certainty (35%). Forty-nine percent of mothers were considered vaccinated, 6% notvaccinated, and vaccination status could not be assessed in 44% of them.
   Discussion: GAIA case definitions for four neonatal outcomes and maternal vaccination were successfully piloted in 24 sentinel sites across four WHO regions. Our assessment found that modification of the stillbirth definition could help avoid potential misclassification. Vaccine safety monitoring in LMICs will benefit from systematic recording of all vaccinations during pregnancy. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a high incidence of adenovirus (AdV) infection in humans due to the presence of more than 60 types of human adenoviruses (HAdVs). The majority of individuals are exposed to one or more HAdV types early in their lives, leading to the development of AdV type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Similarly, immunization or gene therapy with AdV vectors leads to immune responses to the AdV vector. This 'vector immunity' is a concern for AdV vector-based applications for vaccines or gene therapy, especially when the repeated administration of a vector is required. The objective of this investigation was to establish whether AdV neutralizing antibody titers decline sufficiently in a year to permit annual vaccination with the same AdV vector. Naive or human adenoviral vector group C, type 5 (HAdV-05)-primed mice were mock-inoculated (with PBS) or inoculated i.m. with 10(8) PFU of either HAd-GFP [HAdV-05 vector expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)] to mimic the conditions for the first inoculation with an AdV vector-based vaccine. At 1, 3, 6, and 10 months post-HAd-GFP inoculation, naive- or HAdV-primed animals were vaccinated i.m. with 10(8) PFU of HAd-H5HA [HAdV-05 vector expressing hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 influenza virus]. There was a significant continual decrease in vector immunity titers with time, thereby leading to significant continual increases in the levels of HA-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, significant improvement in protection efficacy against challenge with an antigenically heterologous H5N1 virus was observed in HAdV-primed animals at 6 months and onwards. These results indicate that the annual immunization with the same AdV vector may be effective due to a significant decline in vector immunity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Virus-like particles (VLPs) have become a hot topic in modern vaccine research because of its safety, facile production, and immune properties. To further enhance the immune effect of VLPs, we synthesized and used gold-star nanoparticles (AuSNs) as adjuvant for vaccine. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) VLPs as target antigen were combined with AuSNs. The FMD VLPs-AuSNs complex was characterized through sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, ultraviolet light absorption, and morphological measurement analyses. Result indicated that the FMD VLPs-AuSNs complex is nontoxic in different cell lines. AuSNs can effectively promote the entry of FMD VLPs into cells and improve macrophages activation when combined with FMD VLPs compared with FMD VLPs alone. Further animal vaccination and challenge tests revealed that the specific immune response and protection rate of AuSNs adjuvant group is higher than that of conventional mineral oil (ISA206) adjuvant group. AuSNs can effectively improve the immune protection effects of FMD VLPs vaccines, and exhibit potential as a new adjuvant for other vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the most common type implicated as the etiological agent that causes cervical cancer. The marketed prophylactic vaccines against HPV infection are composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from the recombinant major capsid protein L1. Elicitation of functional and neutralizing antibodies by vaccination is the mode of action by which the vaccines prevent the viral infection. In this study, a panel of murine mAbs against HPV16 L1 were generated and comprehensively characterized with respect to their mapping to the epitope spectrum on the viral capsid. These mAbs were categorized into five epitope bins by two different methods based on the pairwise cross-inhibition and competition with human polyclonal antibodies. In addition, a preliminary demonstration of the spatial relationship of the epitopes recognized by these mAbs was performed using a cross-blocking assay with a well-characterized human mAb, 26D1. Interestingly, two mAbs recognizing different epitopes were found to act synergistically in the pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA). To facilitate cross-lab and cross-study comparison, the international standard (IS) serum 05/134 was used to calibrate the mAbs as well as the human serum samples from the HPV16/18 vaccine recipients. The neutralizing mAbs, particularly those that recognizing immunodominant epitopes, would be useful in developing epitope-specific assays for monitoring the vaccine production process and for serological assessment.

   KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: The Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (Standards), revised in 2014, emphasize that adult-care providers assess vaccination status of adult patients at every visit, recommend vaccination, administer needed vaccines or refer to a vaccinating provider, and document vaccinations administered in state local immunization information systems (IIS). Providers report numerous systems- and provider-level barriers to vaccinating adults, such as billing, payment issues, lower prioritization of vaccines due to competing demands, and lack of information about the use and utility of IIS. Barriers to vaccination result in missed opportunities to vaccinate adults and contribute to low vaccination coverage. Clinicians' (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) and pharmacists' reported barriers to assessment, recommendation, administration, referral, and documentation, provider vaccination practices, and perceptions regarding their adult patients' attitudes toward vaccines were evaluated.
   Methods: Data from non-probability-based Internet panel surveys of U.S. clinicians (n = 1714) and pharmacists (n = 261) conducted in February-March 2017 were analyzed using SUDAAN. Weighted proportion of reported barriers to assessment, recommendation, administration, referral, and documentation in IIS were calculated.
   Results: High percentages (70.0%-97.4%) of clinicians and pharmacists reported they routinely assessed, recommended, administered, and/or referred adults for vaccination. Among those who administered vaccines, 31.6% clinicians' and 38.4% pharmacists' submitted records to IIS. Reported barriers included: (a) assessment barriers: vaccination of adults is not within their scope of practice, inadequate reimbursement for vaccinations; (b) administration barriers: lack of staff to manage/administer vaccines, absence of necessary vaccine storage and handling equipment and provisions; and (c) documentation barriers: unaware if state/city has IIS that includes adults or not sure how their electronic system would link to IIS.
   Conclusion: Although many clinicians and pharmacists reported implementing most of the individual components of the Standards, with the exception of IIS use, there are discrepancies in providers' reported actual practices and their beliefs/perceptions, and barriers to vaccinating adults remain.

AB Background: In order to completely eradicate polio caused by wild poliovirus infection as well as vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP), Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) should be developed to meet the requirements for biosafety and affordable strategy in the developing countries.
   Method: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety among infants aged 2 months (60-90 days) receiving five different vaccination regimens: the test groups (A, B, and C) received three doses of sIPV with high, medium, and low D antigen content, respectively, on the month 0, 1, 2 schedule; two control groups (D and E) received three doses of conventional IPV (cIPV) or sIPV (CAMS), respectively, on the same schedule as that of test groups. Serum samples were collected immediately before the 1st dose and 30 days after the 3rd dose vaccination to assess the immunogenicity. Adverse events occurring within 30 days after each dose were collected to assess the safety.
   Results: After three doses, seroconversion rates in groups A-E were 100%, 98.2%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, for type 1; 99.1%, 100%, 98.1%, 100%, and 97.1%, respectively, for type 2; and 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 99.0%, respectively, for type 3. The seropositive rates (>= 1:8) of groups A-E for all types were nearly 100%. The GMT5 in the target dose group (group B) were 4635, 342, and 2218 for type 1-3, respectively. The most common injection-site and systemic adverse reactions were swelling and fever respectively. The swelling (4.2%, P = 0.0075) and fever (58.3%, P = 0.0188) frequency of group A were statistically significantly higher than any other groups.
   Conclusion: The test sIPV generally demonstrated good safety and immunogenicity. The medium-D antigen dose would be a preferred choice for the further phase III clinical trial in consideration of its high immunogenicity for all serotypes and the satisfying tolerance.

TI Communication-based interventions for increasing influenza vaccination
   rates among Aboriginal children: A randomised controlled trial
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Vaccination; Aboriginal; Children; Influenza; Letter; Pamphlet
AB Background: In Australia, the influenza vaccine is funded for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter referred to as Aboriginal) children aged 6 months to <5 years old. In Victoria, only 2% of Aboriginal children are vaccinated against influenza.
   Objective: To evaluate whether sending a letter or sending a pamphlet directly to parents/guardians would improve influenza vaccine uptake amongst Aboriginal identified children.
   Design: The study involved a multi-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial with two intervention groups and one control group.
   Participants & setting: Participants included parents or guardians of Victorian children (aged 6 months to <5 years) who identified as Aboriginal. Households (n = 5534) were randomised (using a random number generator) to receive either a personalised letter (n = 1845), a pamphlet (n = 1845), or no direct communication (control) (n = 1844). The letter and the pamphlet were designed using the INSPIRE framework - a set of behaviour change techniques for action-oriented communication.
   Main outcome measure: The proportion of households where all eligible children received the influenza vaccine between 2 May 2017 and 1 September 2017.
   Results: The control group's vaccination rate was 4.4%, higher than previous years. The pamphlet group achieved a similar vaccination rate (4.5%). The letter group's vaccination rate of 5.9% was significantly higher than the control group [chi(2) (1, n = 3689) = 4.33, p = .037].
   Conclusions: Sending a personalised letter directly to parents/guardians was an effective strategy for increasing influenza vaccination among Aboriginal children. The ineffectiveness of the pamphlet may be due to the lack of personalisation and the authority associated with the letter. Additional research is required to understand participant responses to the material. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: In 2013, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb published an overview of reports of long-lasting fatigue following bivalent HPV-vaccination (2vHPV). After an update of this overview in 2015, concerns regarding the safety of 2vHPV was picked up by the media, which led to further reports of long-lasting fatigue. Therefore, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) investigated a possible association between HPV-vaccination and long-term fatigue.
   Methods: In this retrospective cohort study conducted in the Integrated Primary Care Information database, we investigated the occurrence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fatigue >= 6 months and 36 months in all girls born in 1991-2000 during the follow-up period January 1st 2007-December 31st 2014 (2007-2008 pre-vaccination and 2009-2014 post-vaccination). Patients with certain fatigue >= 6 m were asked for consent to link their primary care information with vaccination data. Incidence rates per 10,000 person years (PY) for 12-16-year-old girls were compared between pre- and post-HPVvaccine era. A self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis was performed using consenting vaccinated cases. A primary high-risk period of 12 months after each dose was defined.
   Results: The cohort consisted of 69,429 12-16-year-old girls accounting for 2758 PY pre-vaccination and 57,214 PY post-vaccination. Differences between pre- and post-vaccination incidences (CFS: 3.6 (95% CI 0.5-25.7)/10,000 PY and 0.9 (0.4-2.1); certain fatigue >= 6 m: 7.3 (1.8-29.0) and 19.4 (16.1-23.4); certain fatigue 3-6 m: 0.0 and 16.6 (13.6-20.3), respectively) were not statistically significant. SCCS analyses in 16 consenting vaccinated cases resulted in an age-adjusted RR of 0.62 (95%Cl 0.07-5.49).
   Conclusions: Fatigue >= 6 m and 3-6 m was frequently found among adolescent girls, but CFS was rarely diagnosed. No statistically significant increased incidence rates were found post-vaccination compared to similar age groups of girls pre-vaccination. The SCCS analysis included a low number of cases but revealed no elevated risk of certain fatigue >= 6 m in the high-risk period. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects pigs of all ages by invading villous epithelial cells of the small intestine causing severe diarrhea with high mortality rate in suckling piglets. Mucosal immunity is believed to play an important role in PEDV control and mucosal delivery of vaccines induces mucosal immunity more efficiently than parenteral vaccination. In this study, coated PEDV-loaded microspheres with the size range of 700-900 mu m in diameter were developed by centrifugal granulation-fluidized bed coating and demonstrated as an effective oral delivery system to protect PEDV antigens against the complex gastrointestinal environment by detecting the live virus particles in microspheres after the simulated gastric fluid treatment and the PEDV RNA in fecal swabs collected from all weaned piglets (100%) orally inoculated with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres. Weaned piglets orally immunized with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres developed higher levels of PEDV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) in their sera and saliva than those negative control groups (p < 0.001 or p < 0.01). Furthermore, neutralization assays demonstrated that serum antibodies in coated PEDV-loaded microspheres groups could significantly inhibit virus infection in Vero cells, compared to PEDV only group (p < 0.05). Overall, our results indicate that the coated PEDV-loaded microspheres might serve as an effective way to induce PEDV-specific mucosal immunity in pigs against PEDV. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Herpes zoster; Complications; Costs; Immunocompromised
ID BURDEN; POPULATION
AB Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful dermatomal rash caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. The incidence of HZ is increased for immunocompromised (IC) individuals. The objective of this study is to assess the healthcare costs incurred by IC individuals who develop HZ with or without associated complications. We conducted a retrospective case-control study across the US over a 5-year period, based on health insurance claims data for individuals aged >= 50 years identified as IC by disease or immunosuppressive treatment. A cohort of 30,107 IC individuals who experienced HZ was matched to a cohort of 113,875 IC individuals without HZ. Average all-cause healthcare costs over 18 months were calculated and compared between IC individuals with and without HZ. In addition, the costs of HZ in IC individuals with HZ-related complications were compared to the costs of those with uncomplicated HZ. During the year following HZ onset, IC individuals with HZ had on average total unadjusted costs that were US$3879 higher than the controls. After adjusting costs, controlling for comorbidities and healthcare costs before the onset of HZ, the average annual costs for HZ cases and controls without HZ were similar. HZ-related complications led to increases in average adjusted annual costs compared to uncomplicated HZ ranging from US$612 for eye complications to US$4535 for neurologic complications. In conclusion, in IC individuals, episodes of HZ lead to substantially increased unadjusted annual healthcare costs. HZ-related complications add considerably to adjusted annual healthcare costs compared to uncomplicated HZ. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Methods: We used Medicaid and commercial claims data in Kansas from 2013, 2014, and 2015 to identify HPV and MenACWY vaccinations among sixth and seventh graders receiving a Tdap booster. Rates of concomitant vaccinations were calculated at the state and county level, and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of concomitant vaccination.
   Results: Of sixth and seventh graders in Kansas receiving their required Tdap booster, 53-82% failed to receive a concomitant HPV vaccine and 36-47% failed to receive a concomitant MenACWY vaccine from 2013 to 2015. Rates of concomitant vaccinations varied more than four-fold across counties. Female gender, younger age, and Medicaid (versus commercial insurance) were positively associated with concomitant vaccination; concomitant vaccination rates increased from 2013 to 2015 (p < 0.001). Of children continuously enrolled in Medicaid from 2013 to 2015, who did not receive concomitant vaccination in 2013, 72.3% and 68.6% remained unvaccinated against HPV and MenACWY, respectively by the end of 2015.
   Conclusions: Failure to get a concomitant vaccination at the time of their Tdap booster identifies children at high risk of not getting immunized in the ensuing 2-3 years. 'Back to school' programs focusing only on school-required vaccinations could have negative impacts on overall vaccination rates. Tracking rates of concomitant vaccination might be useful in supporting quality assessment and improvement efforts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acquired antibodies directed towards antigens expressed on the surface of merozoites and infected erythrocytes play an important role in protective immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major parasite component of the infected erythrocyte surface, has been implicated in malaria pathology, parasite sequestration and host immune evasion. However, the extent to which unique PfEMP1 domains interact with host immune response remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to comprehensively understand the naturally acquired antibody responses targeting different Duffy binding-like (DBL), and Cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR) domains in a Ugandan cohort. Consequently, we created a protein library consisting of full-length DBL (n = 163) and CIDR (n = 108) domains derived from 62-var genes based on 3D7 genome. The proteins were expressed by a wheat germ cell-free system; a system that yields plasmodial proteins that are comparatively soluble, intact, biologically active and immunoreactive to human sera. Our findings suggest that all PfEMP1 DBL and CIDR domains, regardless of PfEMP1 group, are targets of naturally acquired immunity. The breadth of the immune response expands with children's age. We concurrently identified 10 DBL and 8 CIDR domains whose antibody responses were associated with reduced risk to symptomatic malaria in the Ugandan children cohort. This study highlights that only a restricted set of specific domains are essential for eliciting naturally acquired protective immunity in malaria. In light of current data, tandem domains in PfEMP1 s PF3D7_0700100 and PF3D7_0425800 (DC4) are recommended for extensive evaluation in larger population cohorts to further assess their potential as alternative targets for malaria vaccine development.

AB Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is a surface exposed, highly immunogenic protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Its N-terminal alpha-helical domain (al-ID) elicits protective antibody in humans and animals that can protect mice from fatal infections with pneumococci and can be detected in vitro with opsonophagocytosis assays. The proline-rich domain (PRD) in the center of the PspA sequence can also elicit protection. This study revealed that although the sequence of PRD was diverse, PRD from different pneumococcal isolates contained many shared elements. The inferred amino acid sequences of 123 such PRDs, which were analyzed by assembly and alignment-free (AAF) approaches, formed three PRD groups. Of these sequences, 45 were classified as Group 1, 19 were classified as Group 2, and 59 were classified as Group 3. All Group 3 sequences contained a highly conserved 22-amino acid non-proline block (NPB). A significant polymorphism was observed, however, at a single amino acid position within NPB. Each of the three PRD groups had characteristic patterns of short amino acid repeats, with most of the repeats being found in more than one PRD group. One of these repeats, PKPEQP as well as the NPB were previously shown to elicit protective antibodies in mice. In this study, we found that sera from 12 healthy human adult volunteers contained antibodies to all three PRD groups. This suggested that a PspA-containing vaccine containing carefully selected PRDs and od-IDs could redundantly cover the known diversity of PspA. Such an approach might reduce the chances of PspA variants escaping a PspA vaccine's immunity. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human rotavirus vaccine Rotarix (R) (G1P[8]) has shown broad cross protection against homotypic and heterotypic Wa-like human rotavirus strains among children worldwide. This vaccine, however, appears to induce slightly less or non-consistent protection against DS-1 like rotavirus P[4] strains in some settings. In addition, children who are secretor or Lewis-negative and are vaccinated with Rotarix (R) often experience breakthrough infection with P[6] strains. By contrast, P[6] strains infect all children, irrespective of their secretor or Lewis status. In the present study, we report successful adaptation of a DS-1 like human rotavirus G9P[6] strain (CDC-6) to high growth in Vero cells and identify sequence changes that may be critical for enhanced growth in vitro and attenuation in vivo. This human G9P[6] strain could serve as a promising new and potential low-cost vaccine candidate for global use, particularly in targeted population with secretor or Lewis-negative status and high prevalent DS-1 like P[6] strains.

AB Despite the importance of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance, little is known about the costs of monitoring disease. We used Comprehensive Multi-Year Plans for Immunization (cMYPs) - developed by countries following guidelines from the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund - to estimate expenditures on VPD surveillance at the country level in 2015 US Dollars (USD) in 63 low- and middle-income countries. To evaluate the reliability of cMYP estimates, we also compared cMYP data with findings from previous research studies and assessed whether countries explicitly budgeted for major categories of surveillance activities in their plans for immunization. According to our analysis of cMYPs, countries spent an annual median of $406,108 on VPD surveillance ($0.04 per capita and $1.47 per infant), with reported expenditures ranging from $1,098 (Kiribati) to $21,644,770 (Nigeria). However, the majority of countries failed to explicitly mention several key categories of surveillance activities in their plans, especially laboratory-related surveillance activities. Our results show a large amount of variation in surveillance expenditures (total, per capita, and per infant) between countries and provide insights to improve costing guidelines and practices.

ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; VACCINES
AB The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (GVAP) aims to extend the full benefit of vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases to all individuals. More than halfway through the Decade of Vaccines, countries classified as Middle-Income by the World Bank struggle to achieve several GVAP targets. Countries transitioning from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, represent a key sub-group of Middle Income Countries.
   Through a review of available literature on the subject, this study documents the lack of comparative analyses on immunization system performance in countries transitioning from Gavi support. Despite increased emphasis on the importance of programmatic sustainability beyond financing through the Gavi 2016-2020 Strategy and availability of data, existing literature has predominantly documented challenges related to domestic financing of immunization.
   This study complements a review of current literature with an analysis of country assessments conducted by immunization partners since 2011, in an effort to document programmatic challenges related to decision-making for immunization policy, delivery of services, and access to affordable and timely supply in Gavi transitioning countries.
   In light of the findings, we suggest continued systematic compilation of country performance data beyond financing to inform policy-making, in particular for: (i) development of a more nuanced theory of change towards sustainable immunization programmes and (ii) measurement of progress and key areas for attention and investment.

AB MenB-FHbp (Trumenba (R) ; bivalent rLP2086) is a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine containing 2 variants of the recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (FHbp) antigen. The expression of FHbp, an outer membrane protein, is not restricted to serogroup B strains of Neisseria meningitidis (MenB). This study investigated whether antibodies elicited by MenB-FHbp vaccination also protect against non-MenB strains. Immunological responses were assessed in serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBAs) with non-MenB disease-causing test strains from Europe, Africa, and the United States. Importantly, FHbp variant distribution varies among meningococcal serogroups; therefore, strains that code for serogroup-specific prevalent variants (ie, representative of the 2 antigenically distinct FHbp subfamilies, designated subfamily A and subfamily B) and with moderate levels of FHbp surface expression were selected for testing by hSBA. After 2 or 3 doses of MenB-FHbp, 53% to 100% of individuals had bactericidal responses (hSBA titers >= 1:8) against meningococcal serogroup C, W, Y, and X strains, and 20% to 28% had bactericidal responses against serogroup A strains; in fact, these bactericidal responses elicited by MenB-FHbp antibodies against non-MenB strains, including strains associated with emerging disease, were greater than the serological correlate of protection for meningococcal disease (ie, hSBA titers >= 1:4). This is in comparison to a quadrivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, MCV4 (Menactra (R), targeting meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y), which elicited bactericidal responses of 90% to 97% against the serogroup A, C, W, and Y strains and had no activity against serogroup X. Together, these results provide clinical evidence that MenB-FHbp may protect against meningococcal disease regardless of serogroup. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Pneumococcal disease remains a public health priority in adults. Safety and immunogenicity of 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) containing 13 serotypes included in 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) was evaluated in adults >= 50 years old (NCT01513551).
   Methods: 691 adults received one dose of PCV15, PCV13, or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and were followed 14 days for safety. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were measured immediately prior and 1-month postvaccination.
   Results: Safety profiles were comparable across vaccination groups. PCV15 induced comparable levels of IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs to PCV13 and PPV23 for shared serotypes. Serotype-specific antibodies were numerically higher among recipients of PCV15 than PCV13 and PPV23 for 7 and 12 shared serotypes, respectively; and lower for 4 and 1 serotype(s), respectively. PCV15 induced higher IgG and OPA antibodies than PCV13 or PPV23 for serotypes unique to PCV15 (22F and 33F not in PCV13; 6A not in PPV23).
   Conclusions: PCV15 displayed an acceptable safety profile and induced IgG and OPA to all 15 serotypes included in the vaccine, at levels comparable to PCV13 and PPV23 for shared serotypes with these vaccines.

AB Background: Pediatric use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) has been associated with significant decrease in disease burden. However, disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes has increased. Safety and immunogenicity of 15-valent PCV (PCV15) containing serotypes included in 13-valent PCV (PCV13) plus serotypes 22F and 33F were evaluated in infants (NCT01215188).
   Methods: Infants received adjuvanted PCV15, nonadjuvanted PCV15, or PCV13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. Safety was monitored for 14 days after each dose. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were measured at postdose-3, predose-4, and postdose-4.
   Results: Safety profiles were comparable across vaccination groups. At postdose-3, both PCV15 formulations were non-inferior to PCV13 for 10 of 13 shared serotypes but failed non-inferiority for 3 serotypes (6A, 6B, and 19A) based on proportion of subjects achieving IgG GMC >= 0.35 mu g/mL. Adjuvanted PCV15 and nonadjuvanted PCV15 were non-inferior to PCV13 for 11 and 8 shared serotypes, respectively, based on postdose 3 comparisons of GMC ratios. PCV15 induced higher antibodies to serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F than PCV13.
   Conclusions: PCV15 displayed acceptable safety profile and induced IgG and OPA to all 15 vaccine serotypes at levels comparable to PCV13 for 10 of 13 shared serotypes.

AB Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers have demonstrated their potentials in optimizing chemotherapeutics and anticancer efficacy. In this study, a mixed micelle system (THSP) was prepared by combining reduction-sensitive hyaluronic acid-poly(lactide) (HA-ss-PLA) conjugates and D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), with objective to achieve multiple functionalities of selective intracellular rapid release, active targeting capability and multidrug resistance reversal. The mixed micelle possessed desirable particle diameter of 124.32 nm and high entrapment efficiency at 87.97%. Importantly, the THSP mixed micelles demonstrated good stability in systemic circulation and rapidly released PTX in intracellular reductive environment. In vitro cellular uptake study and cytotoxicity assay indicated that the mixed micelles effectively increased drug accumulation in A549 cells and Taxol resistant A549/Taxol cells, and inhibited growth of tumor cells. In addition, the redox-responsive THSP micelles preferentially accumulated to the tumor site and improved anticancer drug activity in vivo, with a TIR of 69.08%. It was concluded that redox-sensitive mixed micelles THSP provided a potential vehicle for efficient anticancer drug delivery and enhancement in treating MDR tumor in the future.

AB Subunit vaccine formulations are often produced as liquid dispersions through complicated processes. It is desirable, however, to have simple, cheap and up-scalable methods to produce nanoparticulate subunit vaccines in powder form. Here, a simple single-step spray drying process for production of powder cubosome precursors with the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the adjuvant Quil-A is presented. The cubosomes were characterized in vitro and evaluated in vivo by subcutaneous and oral administration for their potential as a vaccine formulation. Hydrated cubosomes had average particle size of 257 +/- 8 nm and zeta potential of -18.0 +/- 0.6 mV. The powder contained 10.6 +/- 0.7% w/w OVA prior to hydration, of which 65 +/- 1% was released within the first 20 min in 9.5 mM PBS at pH 7.3, with the remaining OVA gradually released over the following 24 h. Immunization with cubosomes resulted in significantly stronger antigen-specific serum IgG responses (p < 0.01), CD8(+) T cell expansion (p < 0.0001) and target T cell killing compared to controls when given s.c., and was ineffective orally. This study shows that spray drying is a suitable method for producing nanoparticulate vaccine formulations in dry powder form.

AB A carrier-free and reduction-degradable Janus prodrug, termed as CPT-SS-GEM, was fabricated by redox-sensitive disulfide bond linked gemcitabine and camptothecin. This amphiphilic prodrug showed high drug loading capacity, 42.6% of CPT and 32.2% of GEM, respectively. Benefiting from its amphiphilic property, CPT-SS-GEM prodrug could self-assemble into Janus nano-prodrug in water without aid of any excipient. The morphology of the nano-prodrug was spherical particle confirmed by TEM. The rapid drug release from the nano-prodrug proceeded in a reduction-dependent manner, more than 90% of the native CPT and GEM were released in the mimic microenvironment of tumor cells (pH 6.5 PBS containing 2 mM DTT) within a period of 3 h. The concurrent and ratio-metric release of CPT and GEM endowed the Janus nano-prodrug CPT-SS-GEM with pronounced in vitro synergistic antiproliferative effect in multiple cancer cell lines when the inhibition rate of cancer cell proliferation exceeded 50%, including A549, NCI-H460, HCT116, HT-29, and MCF-7/ADR. The combination index values showed as followings, 1.04-0.4 (A549), 0.24-0.60 (NCI-H460), 0.42-0.16 (HCT116), 1.98-0.15 (HT-29), 0.36-0.19 (MCF-7/ADR). Taken together, the carrier-free, redox-sensitive Janus nano-prodrug CPT-SSGEM is a promising candidate as synergistic combination of chemotherapeutics.

AB The self-assembly process of amphiphilic molecules into solvents results in different mesophases, such as inverse cubic and hexagonal that both belong to the wider category of lyotropic liquid crystals. The above mesophases can be further exploited upon the formation of liquid crystalline nanoparticles, cubosomes and hexosomes respectively, which may be utilized as drug delivery nanosystems, exhibiting major advantages. In the present study, liquid crystalline nanoparticles were prepared and evaluated in terms of morphology and physicochemical behavior. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of the different formulation parameters, as well as the effect of the different microenvironmental factors (temperature, ionic strength, pH, serum proteins presence) on their behavior. The physicochemical behavior and the morphology of the systems were investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), cryogenic-Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM), fluorescence spectroscopy and a gamut of light scattering techniques. The formulation process was proved to influence strictly the physicochemical behavior of the prepared nanosystems. They presented colloidal stability over time and upon ionic strength increase, but they were affected by the presence of proteins and presented reversible structure alterations upon temperature increase. Their morphological structure and internal microenvironment, reflected by micropolarity and microfluidity, were also influenced by the formulation parameters.

AB The objective of our study was to develop a transdermal patch of 4-benzylpiperidine and to evaluate its in vitro transdermal permeation profile. Appropriate pressure sensitive adhesives and additives were selected based on solubility and slide crystallization studies. Release liners and backing membranes were selected based on their ability to peel without leaving a residue and their affinity to formulation respectively. Drug-in-adhesive patches developed were investigate for their in vitro drug permeation over 48 h across dermatomed human skin using Franz diffusion cells. Silicone based pressure sensitive adhesive along with colloidal silicon dioxide as viscosity builder, fluoropolymer coated membranes as the release liner and polyester based membranes as backing were chosen to develop a drug in silicone adhesive patch. Polyisobutylene adhesive based patch was developed with drug in polyisobutylene adhesive, along with oleic acid and oleyl alcohol as permeation enhancers, polyester for the release liner and polyethylene as backing. Among the patches developed, polyisobutylene adhesive based patch with higher drug concentration exhibited superior transdermal permeation (1608.5 +/- 53.4 mu g/cm(2) over 48 h). The final patch was further tested for uniformity in coat weight, shear strength, tack and peel adhesion.

AB Gemcitabine is widely used for anticancer therapy. However, its short blood circulation time and poor stability greatly impair its application. To solve this problem, we prepared a poly (c-glutamic acid)-g-methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-gemcitabine conjugate (L-Gem) with a 14.3 wt% drug-loading content. L-Gem showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity towards 4T1, LLC, MIA PaCa-2 and A2780 in vitro. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies indicated that L-Gem had remarkably enhanced blood stability, prolonged blood circulation time and greatly improved selective tumor distribution compared with free gemcitabine. The area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity [AUC((0-infinity ))] of L-Gem in plasma was 43-fold higher than that of free gemcitabine. The AUC((0-infinity )) of the inactive metabolite, 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine in the L-Gem group was similar to 20% of that observed in the free gemcitabine group. The drug tumor accumulation ratio in the L-Gem group relative to the free gemcitabine group was 9.9 at 36 h, while the tumor AUC ratio was 15.8. Testing on Balb/C mice bearing the 4T1 tumor further demonstrated that L-Gem had significantly higher anticancer efficacy than free gemcitabine in vivo. These findings indicated that L-Gem has great potential for cancer treatment.

AB Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide that exhibits mucoadhesive properties which allow it to adhere to mucosal tissues. In this work, we explored chemical modification of chitosan through its reaction with methacrylic anhydride to synthesise methacrylated derivative with the aim to improve its mucoadhesive properties. The reaction products were characterised using H-1 NMR, FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. H-1 NMR and ninhydrin test were used to quantify the degree of methacrylation of chitosan. Turbidimetric analysis of the effect of pH on aqueous solubility of the polymers revealed that the highly methacrylated derivative remained turbid and its turbidity did not change from pH 3 to 9. However, solutions of native chitosan and its derivative with low methacrylation remained transparent at pH 6.5 and exhibited a rapid increase in turbidity at pH > 6.5. The mucoadhesive properties of chitosan and its methacrylated derivatives were evaluated using flow-through method combined with fluorescent microscopy with fluorescein sodium as a model drug. The retention of these polymers was evaluated on porcine bladder mucosa in vitro. The methacrylated derivatives exhibited greater ability to retain fluorescein sodium on the bladder mucosa compared to the parent chitosan. Toxicological studies using MTT assay with UMUC3 bladder cells show no significant differences in toxicity between chitosan and its methacrylated derivatives suggesting good biocompatibility of these novel mucoadhesive polymers.

AB Solid dispersions (SDs) represent an important formulation technique to achieve supersaturation in gastro-intestinal fluids and to enhance absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Extensive research was leading to a rather good understanding of SDs in the dry state, whereas the complex interactions in aqueous medium are still challenging to analyze. This paper introduces a fluorescence quenching approach together with size-exclusion chromatography to study drug and polymer interactions that emerge from SDs release testing in aqueous colloidal phase. Celecoxib was used as a model drug as it is poorly water-soluble and also exhibits native fluorescence so that quenching experiments were enabled. Different pharmaceutical polymers were evaluated by the (modified) Stern-Volmer model, which was complemented by further bulk analytics. Drug accessibility by the quencher and its affinity to celecoxib were studied in physical mixtures as well as with in SDs. The obtained differences enabled important molecular insights into the different formulations. Knowledge of relevant drug-polymer interactions and the amount of drug embedded into polymer aggregates in the aqueous phase is of high relevance for understanding of SD performance. The novel fluorescence quenching approach is highly promising for future research and it can provide guidance in early formulation development of native fluorescent compounds.

AB Stimuli-responsive nano-drug delivery systems can optimize antibiotic delivery to infection sites. Identifying novel lipids for pH responsive delivery to acidic conditions of infection sites will enhance the performance of nano-drug delivery systems. The aim of the present investigation was to synthesize and characterize a biosafe novel pH-responsive lipid for vancomycin delivery to acidic conditions of infection sites. A pH-responsive solid lipid, N-(2-morpholinoethyl) oleamide (NMEO) was synthesized and used to prepare vancomycin (VCM)-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (VCM_NMEO SLNs). The particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP) and entrapment efficiency (EE) of the formulation were 302.8 +/- 0.12 nm, 0.23 +/- 0.03, -6.27 +/- 0.017 mV and 81.18 +/- 0.57% respectively. The study revealed that drug release and antibacterial activity were significantly greater at pH 6.0 than at pH 7.4, while the in silico studies exposed the molecular mechanisms for improved stability and drug release. Moreover, the reduction of MRSA load was 4.14 times greater (p < 0.05) in the skin of VCM_NMEO SLNs treated mice than that of bare VCM treated specimens. Thus, this study confirmed that NMEO can successfully be used to formulate pH-responsive SLNs with potential to enhance the treatment of bacterial infections.

AB Thermosensitive liposomes grafted with cholesterol-conjugated poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide mono/dilactate) (chol-pHPMAlac) have been developed for heat-induced release of doxorubicin (DOX). These liposomes release DOX completely during mild hyperthermia, but their interaction with blood cells and cancer cells has not been studied. Following intravenous administration, liposomes may interact with plasma proteins and various types of cells (e.g., endothelial cells, platelets, and macrophages), which would reduce their disposition in the tumor stroma. Interaction between liposomes and platelets may further cause platelet activation and thrombosis, which could lead to vascular occlusion and thromboembolic complications. The aim was to investigate DOX release kinetics in the presence of serum, stability, in vitro uptake by and toxicity to cancer cells and somatic cells, and platelet activating potential of the chol-pHPMAlac liposomes. DOX release was determined spectrofluorometrically. Liposome stability was determined in buffer and serum by dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Association with/uptake by and toxicity of empty liposomes to AML-12, HepG2 (both hepatocyte-derived cancer cells), RAW 264.7 (macrophages), and HUVEC (endothelial) cells was assayed in vitro. Platelet activation was determined by analysis of P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding. DOPE:EPC liposomes (diameter = 135 nm) grafted with 5% chol-pHPMAlac (cloud point (CP) = 16 degrees C; M-n = 8.5 kDa) released less than 10% DOX at 37 degrees C in 30 min, whereas complete release took place at 47 degrees C or higher within 10 min. The size of these liposomes remained stable in buffer and serum during 24 h at 37 degrees C. Fluorescently labeled but DOX-lacking chol-pHPMAlac-liposomes exhibited poor association with/uptake by all cells under investigation, were not cytotoxic, and did not activate platelets in both buffered solution and whole blood. In conclusion, thermosensitive chol-pHPMAlac-grafted liposomes rapidly release DOX during mild hyperthermia. The liposomes are stable in a physiological milieu, are not taken up by cells that are encountered in an in vivo setting, and are non-antagonistic towards platelets. Chol-pHPMAlac-grafted liposomes are therefore good candidates for DOX delivery to tumors and temperature-triggered release in tumor stroma.

AB Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) is an excellent polymeric carrier for melt extrusion amorphous solid dispersion. However, its pH-dependent solubility limits its application, especially for narrow absorption window drugs. The current study proposed a novel dual approach of foam extrusion and microenvironmental pH modulation to overcome this limitation. Sodium bicarbonate was used as a blowing agent and the remaining sodium carbonate acted as an internal pH modifier. Compared with conventional extrusion, foam extrusion dramatically lowered the extrudate physical strength (breaking force and hardness decreased by 20-fold; breaking energy and deformation energy decreased by > 30-fold). Milling efficiency of foam extrudate was largely improved compared with that of conventional extrudates, demonstrating smaller particle size, larger specific surface area, and ability to pass through a smaller milling screen. The foam extrudate could generate a supersaturation concentration up to 8-fold higher than the solubility of the pure drug. It also significantly enhanced drug dissolution in a two-step biorelevant medium (p < 0.05). This novel approach improved both manufacturing processability and dissolution of HPMCAS-based solid dispersions.

ID NANOPARTICLES; LYOPHILIZATION; STABILIZATION; TREHALOSE; TOXICITY;

AB Maintaining colloidal stability of nanoparticles in suspensions is a major challenge. Therefore, freeze-drying (lyophilization) is recently proposed to preserve colloidal stability of nanoparticles through maintaining them in a solid state. However, freeze-drying would itself induce nanoparticle aggregation unless proper formulation with a careful selection of cryoprotectants is considered. Herein, we evaluate the colloidal stability of gold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated with a rituximab as a model monoclonal antibody upon freeze-drying in the presence of various cryoprotectants (mannitol, trehalose and sucrose). Aggregation-induced optical responses of GNRs were used as a sensitive tool to follow nanoparticle aggregation. In the absence of cryoprotectants, rituximab-conjugated GNRs aggregate irreversibly while evaluated cryoprotectants exhibit a significant protective effect. Maximal colloidal stability of GNRs is observed in the presence of trehalose while mannitol results in best cake formation in terms of shape and integrity. A combination of trehalose and mannitol produces a lyophilized product with satisfactory GNR colloidal stability and cake shape. Moreover, we show that freeze-dried rituximab-conjugated GNRs in presence of proper cryoprotectants maintain typical binding to lymphoma tissues as confirmed via immunohistochemistry assay.

AB Lidocaine's (Lido) low water solubility and negligible tissue uptake limit its bioavailability when applied to the skin. Nanoparticulate systems would help address these issues; therefore, lidocaine inclusion complexes with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were prepared and the effect of MCM41 surface functionalization with positively charged amino-propyl groups on the molecule properties studied. It is expected that positively charged nanoparticles can improve lidocaine permeation into the skin. The complexes were prepared in different lidocaine/MSNs ratios (3/1, 2/1, 1/1) and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provided detailed information regarding the molecular interaction of lidocaine with the inorganic surface. The optimized lidocaine-loaded MSNs (1/1) were used for in vitro release studies using dialysis membrane and ex vivo permeation studies by Franz diffusion cell.
   Higher drug release and skin permeation were observed for the functionalized complex over pure lidocaine and Lido/MCM41 which can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged lido/MCM41-NH2 and negatively charged skin membrane cells. Therefore, MCM41-NH2 exhibited superiority over MCM41 and the free drug, suggesting the significance of functionalization in lidocaine dermal delivery.

AB The objective of this work was to investigate and profoundly characterize low-energy nanoemulsions as multifunctional carriers, with slight reference to dermal administration. An evidence-based approach was offered for deepening the knowledge on their formation via spontaneous emulsification. Curcumin, a compound of natural origin, potentially powerful therapeutic, was chosen as a model API. Due to curcumin's demanding properties (instability, poor solubility, low permeability), its potentials remain unreached. Low-energy nanoemulsions were considered carriers capable of overcoming imposed obstacles. Formulation consisting of Polysorbate 80 and soybean lecithin as stabilizers (9:1, 10%), medium-chain triglycerides as the oil phase (10%) and ultrapure water was selected for curcumin incorporation in 3 different concentrations (1, 2 and 3 mg/mL). Physicochemical stability was demonstrated during 3 months of monitoring (mean droplet size: 111.3-146.8 nm; PDI < 0.2; pH: 4.73-5.73). Curcumin's release from developed vehicles followed Higuchi's kinetics. DPPH (IC50 = 0.1187 mg/ mL) and FRAP (1.19 +/- 0.02 mmol/g) assays confirmed that curcumin acts as a potent antioxidant through different mechanisms, with no alterations after incorporation in the formulation. High biocompatibility in line with antigenotoxic activity of curcumin-loaded formulations (protective and reparative) was estimated through Comet assay. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to fully characterize developed systems, directing them to more concrete application possibilities.

AB In this study, a biodegradable implant composed of poly(lactide co-glycolide) (PLGA) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was fabricated by mold method and used to impede the colon cancer via the local sustained release of 5-FU after transplanting into the peritoneal cavity. To optimize the 5-FU-implant, different factors such type of polymer, polymer-drug ratio, hydrophilic additives and organic solvents were investigated based on in vitro 5-FU release behavior. The optimized 5-FU-implant was subjected to evaluate the capacity of sustained release of 5-FU in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution of 5-FU-implant were also tested in vivo after grafting into the peritoneal cavity in rat. Moreover, different doses of 5-FU-implants were compared against 5-FU injection for their antitumor activity in colon cancer model in nude mice and for their safety in health rat. The results revealed that the optimized 5-FU-implant possessed excellent sustained release of 5-FU for 2 week and no burst release were observed in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacokinetic behavior showed that higher concentration of 5-FU was found in peritoneal fluid when compared to plasma, which resulted in significantly improving antitumor activity as well as decreasing the side effect. It was proved that the 5-FU-implant was more efficacious and much safer than 5-FU bolus injection, which would be also used to overcome the reoccurrence of colon cancer after surgery.

AB Drug development is a long process which requires careful evaluation of the drug substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient, API), drug product (tablet, capsule etc.) and the bioperformance (both pre-clinical and clinical) before testing the efficacy of the final dosage form. The earliest assessment of a new drug substance requires an understanding of the safety and clinical performance (Phase 1) wherein faster processes (like on-site formulation strategy) have been set in place for quick clinical read-outs. One key gap that exists in this early assessment is the ability to evaluate modified release drug products. Here, an additive manufacturing approach is used to prepare polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) capsule shells using 3D printing (3DP), where the shells can be filled with either a solid or a liquid vehicle containing the API. In this work we demonstrate how we can delay the release of the API from the printed capsules allowing us to evaluate regional absorption in pre-clinical studies. By using 3DP, a new method to provide a series of release profiles is demonstrated, where the induction time of a delayed burst release is controlled by the wall thicknesses of printed capsules. New hanging baskets were also designed and 3D printed for the dissolution tests to better understand the rupturing of these capsules in an USP 2 dissolution apparatus. By controlling the wall thickness of the capsule, the induction time of drug release can be controlled from 12 to 198 min. This wide range of induction times demonstrated with this 3DP strategy is not currently available in a commercially available oral drug product form. Varying the induction times to the drug release to interrogate different regions of the GI tract is exhibited in vivo (beagle dogs) and initial analysis suggested a good in vitro/in vivo relationship (IVIVR).

AB The study aimed at investigating the potential of spray drying method for encapsulation of protein drugs into solid lipid microparticles (MP) and evaluating effects of excipients on encapsulation and release of protein from MP. After transformation of model protein insulin to insulin-phospholipid complex, it was dissolved together with lipid excipients in organic solvent, which was spray-dried to form solid lipid MP. Polymeric MP with D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) were prepared similarly. Around 90% of insulin was encapsulated in glycerol monostearate MP and glycerol distearate MP, whereas the encapsulation efficiency was 60% and 35% for tristearate (TG18) MP and tribehenate (TG22) MP, respectively. The secondary structure of insulin in the spraydried MP was substantially similar to that of the insulin control solution, suggesting that only minor alterations occurred during the spray drying process. Sustained release of insulin was observed from both TG18 MP and TG22 MP. The burst release of insulin from TG18 MP and TG22 MP was around 30% and 10%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that from PLGA MP (40%). In conclusion, spray drying a solution containing both lipids and protein-phospholipid complex is a promising method for encapsulating protein into solid lipid MP, which can be used for sustained delivery of protein drugs.

AB Bifidobacteria are predominant microorganisms in the intestinal flora, but at the same time represent a subdominant group of the vaginal microbiota. For this reason, oral administration of these probiotic bacteria can provide beneficial effect for both intestinal and urogenital ecosystems.
   The first aim of this study was to WA the strain Bifidobacterium breve BC204, isolated from a vaginal swab of a healthy woman, for its capability to adhere to human cells, to survive to gastric acids and bile salts and to exert antimicrobial activities. The second aim of the work was to develop an oral formulation able to guarantee bacterial survival during storage and administration, thus favouring intestinal and vaginal colonization. B. breve BC204 was encapsulated by spray-drying and subsequently formulated in time-dependent erodible tablets.
   B. breve BC204 showed good ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells and moderate ability to resist to gastrointestinal stress. Moreover, it exerted a strong antimicrobial activity against urogenital and enteric pathogens. Microencapsulation followed by tablet production allowed high loading and survival of B. breve BC204, associated to a delayed release and mucoadhesive ability. These characteristics are required to achieve appropriate amount and persistence of viable microbial cells in the treatment site.

AB Etilefrine hydrochloride (ET-HCl) is used in the treatment of hypotension. Dosage forms of orally administered tablets and parenteral injections are clinically available, but exhibit unfavorable characteristics, including cardiac toxicity, headaches, and damage at the injection site for the parenteral dosage form, and initially high plasma levels, fast elimination, and first-pass effects for its oral administration. Therefore, the buccal application of ET-HCl was herein investigated as an alternative to conventional administration routes. I.v., intragastric, and buccal administration were performed using rats, and absorption features were compared. Buccal application at open conditions for 1 h exhibited absolute bioavailability of more than 20%, while the intragastric administration gave much lower bioavailability ( < 10%). The drug residue and drug distribution in the oral mucosa were investigated in order to clarify drug transfer behaviors. In the application of ET-HCl solution using a cotton ball, higher plasma concentrations and their maintenance at higher levels were achieved at 10 mg/kg than at 2.5 mg/kg. In addition, absorption was greater with a longer application (4h) than with a shorter application (1 h). Etilefrine (ET) was rapidly absorbed using aqueous buffer of pH 9.5 as the solvent. Open application was appropriate for achieving and maintaining higher plasma levels. Thus, in the buccal application of ET-HCl aqueous droplets, a wide distribution throughout the mucosal surface is important for achieving rapid absorption and the maintenance of plasma levels. These findings suggested that the buccal application should be feasible administration of ET-HCl.

AB [6]-Shogaol, an alkylphenol compound purified from the root and stem of ginger (Zingiber officinale), has attracted considerable interest due to its potential anticancer, antioxidative and antirheumatic properties. However, the oral bioavailability of [6]-shogaol has been severely limited because of its poor solubility. In this study, a significant quantity of high-purity [6]-shogaol (yield: 3.6%; purity: 98.65%) was extracted and encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) via high-pressure homogenization (encapsulation efficiency: 87.67%) to improve its solubility and oral bioavailability. The resulting [6]-shogaol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SSLNs) were stable, homogeneous and well-dispersed. Its mean particle size and zeta potential were 73.56 +/- 5.62 nm and -15.2 +/- 1.3 mV, respectively. Importantly, the in vitro release profile and in vivo oral bioavailability of SSLNs were significantly improved compared with the free drug. Furthermore, the SSLNs could remarkably lower the uric acid level via inhibiting the activity of xanthine oxidase and reduce the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in the hyperuricemia/gouty arthritis rat model, when compared to the free [6]-shogaol. Collectively, SLNs could serve as a promising drug delivery system to improve the oral bioavailability of [6]-shogaol for effective treatment of gouty arthritis.

AB The aim of this study was to develop roflumilast dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations by spray drying using hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) and to determine their suitability for pulmonary delivery. Different feed solution concentrations, solvent systems and spray drying parameters were used to obtain the formulations which were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, particle size distribution, bulk and tapped density, specific surface area, dynamic vapour sorption, in vitro deposition properties using a Next Generation Impactor (NGI) and transepithelial permeability. Microparticles spray dried from ethanol were wrinkled and amorphous, exhibiting high glass transition temperatures while those from methanol:n-butyl acetate consisted of irregularly shaped porous particles partially crystalline. All formulations presented low density, particle size and residual solvent content exhibiting high depositon in the lower stages of the NGI. Mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) were in the range of 3.32-4.49 mu m with high fine particle fractions (FPF < 5 mu m). Stability studies demonstrated no significant modifications in the solid-state nature and in the aerolisation performance of the selected formulation which presented a P-app of 8.73 x 10(-6) +/- 4.70 x 10(-7) cm/s. The developed roflumilast DPI formulations have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of lung diseases.

AB Exosomes have been extensively explored as delivery vehicles due to low immunogenicity, efficient cargo delivery, and possibly intrinsic homing capacity. However, therapeutic application of exosomes is hampered by structural complexity and lack of efficient techniques for isolation and drug loading. Liposomes represent one of the most successful therapeutic nanocarriers, but are frequently criticized by short blood circulation and inefficient intracellular drug delivery. In this circumstance, a promising strategy is to facilitate a positive feedback between two fields. Herein, exosome-mimicking liposomes were formulated with DOPC/SM/Chol/DOPS/DOPE (21/17.5/30/14/17.5, mol/mol), and harnessed for delivery of VEGF siRNA to A549 and HUVEC cells. Compared with Lipo 2000 and DOTAP liposomes, exosome-mimicking liposomes exhibited less than four-fold cytotoxicity but higher storage stability and anti-serum aggregation effect. Exosome-mimicking liposomes appeared to enter A549 cells through membrane fusion, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis, while enter HUVEC through caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which revealed that the uptake pathway was dependent on cell types. Notably, exosome-mimicking liposomes exhibited significantly higher cellular uptake and silencing efficiency than PC-Chol liposomes ( > three-fold), suggesting the unique lipid composition did enhance the intracellular delivery efficiency of exosome-mimicking liposomes to a significantly greater extent. However, it still remained far from satisfactory delivery as compared to cationic Lipo 2000 and DOTAP liposomes, which warranted further improvement in future research. This study may encourage further pursuit of more exosome-mimicking delivery vehicles with higher efficiency and biocompatibility.

AB The lungs have potential as a means of systemic drug delivery of macromolecules. Systemic delivery requires crossing of the air-blood barrier, however with molecular size-dependent limitations in lung absorption of large molecules. Systemic availability after inhalation can be improved by absorption enhancers, such as bile salts. Enhancers may potentially interfere with the different constituents of the lungs, e.g. the lung surfactant lining the alveoli or the lung epithelium. We used two in vitro models to investigate the potential effects of bile salts on lung surfactant function (with the constrained drop surfactometer) and on the epithelium in the proximal airways (with the MucilAir (TM) cell system), respectively. In addition, we measured direct effects on respiration in mice inhaling bile salt aerosols. The bile salts inhibited lung surfactant function at different dose levels, however they did not affect the integrity of ciliated cells at the tested doses. Furthermore, the bile salt aerosols induced changes in the breathing pattern of mice indicative of pulmonary irritation. The bile salts were ranked according to potency in vitro for surfactant function disruption and in vivo for induction of pulmonary irritation. The ranking was the same, suggesting a correlation between the interference with lung surfactant and the respiratory response.

AB The clinical and commercial development of polymeric sub-micron size formulations based on poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) particles is hampered by the challenges related to their good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant, scale-up production without affecting the formulation specifications. Continuous process technologies enable large-scale production without changing the process or formulation parameters by increasing the operation time. Here, we explore three well-established process technologies regarding continuity for the large-scale production of sub-micron size PLGA particles developed at the lab scale using a batch method. We demonstrate optimization of critical process and formulation parameters for high-shear mixing, high-pressure homogenization and microfluidics technologies to obtain PLGA particles with a mean diameter of 150-250 nm and a small polydispersity index (PDI, <= 0.2). The most influential parameters on the particle size distribution are discussed for each technique with a critical evaluation of their suitability for GMP production. Although each technique can provide particles in the desired size range, high-shear mixing is found to be particularly promising due to the availability of GMP-ready equipment and large throughput of production. Overall, our results will be of great guidance for establishing continuous process technologies for the GMP-compliant, large-scale production of sub-micron size PLGA particles, facilitating their commercial and clinical development.

AB The main purpose of this study was to develop gastroretentive tablets with floating and swelling properties for once-daily administration of pregabalin. The non-effervescent floating and swelling tablets were prepared using wet granulation and compaction, which are widely used and easily accessible. All formulations showed sustained release patterns and maintained buoyancy for over 24 h. The amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and crospovidone were found to be critical factors affecting in vitro dissolution and floating properties of the prepared tablets. The optimized tablets containing 300 mg of pregabalin started to float within 3 min and swelled above 12.8 mm, the reported pyloric sphincter diameter during the fed state, in all dimensions including length, width, and thickness. In vivo results in beagle dogs indicated that the optimized formulations are suitable as once-daily dosage forms, and dose proportionality was observed in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg. Additionally, the dogs administered with the formulation having poor in vitro gastroretentive properties showed highly variable and reduced extent of absorption, signifying the necessity of the gastroretentive drug delivery system. In conclusion, the developed non-effervescent floating tablets are promising candidates for once-daily delivery of pregabalin.

AB Clinical use of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3) as an anticancer agent is currently limited by the requirement of supraphysiological doses and associated hypercalcemia. Nanoencapsulation of calcitriol is a strategy to overcome these drawbacks, allowing reduced administrated doses and/or frequency, while retaining the therapeutic activity towards cancer cells. For this purpose, we investigated the impact of calcitriol encapsulation on its antiproliferative activity and optimized formulation parameters with that respect.
   Calcitriol-loaded polymeric nanoparticles with different polymer:oil ratios were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method. Nanoparticles had similar mean size (200 nm) and EE (85%) whereas their release profile strongly depended on formulation parameters. Antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of formulated calcitriol were evaluated in vitro using human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and showed that calcitriol-induced cell growth inhibition was closely related to its release kinetics. For the most suitable formulation, a sustained cell growth inhibition was observed over 10 days compared to free form.
   Advantages of calcitriol encapsulation and the role of formulation parameters on its biological activity in vitro were demonstrated. Selected nanoparticle formulation is a promising calcitriol delivery system ensuring a prolonged anticancer activity that could improve its therapeutic efficiency.

AB This paper presents the measurement and analysis of the residence time distribution (RTD) of a tamping-pin capsule filling machine. The tamping speed and the amount of material inside the powder bowl proved to have a significant effect on the RTD. Various inserts into the powder bowl that reduce the volume and alter mixing and transport in the bowl were experimentally investigated. To obtain the RTD, a tracer-based measurement method was applied and a sophisticated data processing strategy was developed. The tracer-based method also allowed investigations of stagnant zones in the powder bowl, another important aspect in continuous manufacturing (CM). The suitability of tracer material was assessed based on a detailed characterization of bulk and tracer material. Characteristic parameters of the RTD were extracted and compared, proposing a systematic strategy for selection of a suitable insert.

AB To overcome the mucus layer and cell membrane barrier, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) exhibiting negative zeta potential, switching to positive values when having reached the cell membrane is a promising approach. Accordingly, a novel conjugate was synthesized by covalent attachment of phosphotyrosine to octadecylamine, which was incorporated into SEDDS. Generated system presented an average diameter of 32 nm and zeta potential of around -12 mV when being diluted 1:100 in 100 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ZnCl2. Incubation of SEDDS with isolated intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) resulting in enzymatic cleavage of phosphate ester moiety caused a shift in zeta potential up to + 5.3 mV. As nontoxicity of the developed SEDDS diluted 1:1000 in 25 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 5% glucose was observed on Caco-2 cells by employing resazurin assay, this system may provide an inspiring strategy for future zeta potential changing drug delivery systems to master the mucus and membrane barrier.

AB The human vitreous humour is a complex gel structure whose composition and physical properties can vary considerably from person to person and also change with age. To date, the viscoelastic properties of the human vitreous gel has not been thoroughly investigated and despite many years of intensive research, an ideal vitreous substitute remains a challenge. Understanding the physical structure and properties of the vitreous is of fundamental and therapeutic interest, providing a clear insight into diffusion and transport of administered ophthalmic drug molecules into the vitreous. A number of mammalian surrogates, mainly bovine, porcine and ovine vitreous humours have been used in the literature as a means of studying ophthalmic drug transport and diffusion. In this study, the mechanical, physical and rheological properties of ovine, porcine, and bovine surrogates were investigated and compared to human vitreous. In addition, a bespoke Franz cell construct was used to compare the diffusion of a model drug (fluorescein) through vitreous samples. Despite the similarly in rheological properties between bovine, porcine and human vitreous samples, diffusion of fluorescein through the different vitreous samples revealed great differences in values of steady-state flux and diffusion coefficient. In addition, a first-generation vitreous mimic, composed of 4.5 mg/mL hyaluronic acid with complex viscosity of 0.3 +/- 0.01 Pa has been evaluated and was demonstrated to be a better mimic of the human vitreous than the mammalian samples investigated.

AB Measurement of particle size and size distribution of complex drug products exhibiting complex rheological behaviors can be challenging as these properties may be beyond the theoretical assumptions of the measurement technique. Herein cyclosporine (CsA) ophthalmic emulsion was selected as a model complex system, and an indepth assessment of particle size was performed using five fundamentally different particle sizing techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), laser diffraction (LD), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and 2-dimensional diffusion ordered spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance (2D DOSY-NMR). The effect of various viscosity modifying and stabilizing excipients in the emulsions was assessed using four types of CsA formulations, i.e., 1) no viscosity modifying excipients, 2) carbomer copolymer type A (CCA), 3) Carbopol 1342, or 4) hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HMPC). In general, the variability of reported particle size increased, and is not as accurate, for emulsions dispersed in a non-Newtonian fluid and at higher emulsion concentrations. This effect was reduced in part by diluting the samples to lower volume fraction and a more Newtonian regime. To address the concern that sample dilution prior to measurement may induce physical instability in the emulsions, NTA was used to monitor average size at dilutions of up to 1:50,000. The size was found to remain constant and independent of the presence or type of stabilizer used. Cryo-TEM further confirmed that dilution did not alter particle size or morphology. Of the five evaluated techniques, Cryo-TEM and 2D DOSY NMR did not require dilution for measurement. The overestimate in DLS size measurements for certain CsA formulations was attributed to complex dispersant rheological behavior, particle-particle interactions, multiple light scattering events, and/or scattering interference from the polymers, which can be overcome by either testing under dilutions or by selecting one of the techniques less impacted by the interference of polymer.

AB Topical delivery of siRNA is challenging task due to complex barrier property of stratum corneum and cationic lipid based carriers have been widely explored for this purpose due to improved permeation through skin. For gene delivery application, dendrimers are considered as efficient carrier due to their cationic nature and well-defined surface groups. However, they are not well explored for topical delivery. This work compares the suitability of PAMAM dendrimer with DOTAP liposome for topical delivery of siRNA against TNF-alpha. The particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of dendriplex were 99.80 +/- 1.80 nm, 13.40 +/- 4.84 mV and 98.72 +/- 2.02% whereas for lipoplex were 174.80 +/- 0.80 nm, 29.96 +/- 0.51 mV and 94.99 +/- 5.01% respectively. Both the formulations were stable in serum and in the presence of RNAse. TNF-alpha is inflammatory cytokine, hence the in vivo efficacy of developed formulations was determined using psoriatic plaque model. Results suggested improved phenotypic and histopathological features and reduced levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-17 and IL-22 for dendriplex and lipoplex treated groups in comparison to Imiquimod treated group. These findings suggest that dendrimer can be a potential carrier for topical gene delivery.

AB Efflux transporters function as vacuum cleaners of xenobiotics and therefore they hinder drugs to reach their targets at effective enough concentrations. Efflux pump inhibitors can be used to improve the cell accumulation of drugs, however all the current inhibitors lack selectivity towards cancer cells. L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which is expressed in many types of cancer cells can be utilized to target inhibitors of efflux transporters to these cells by converting the inhibitors into LAT1-utilizing prodrugs. In this study, we prepared 5 LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of an efflux pump inhibitor, probenecid (PRB). All novel compounds were transported into human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) mainly via LAT1. The compounds also interacted with either multiresistant proteins (MRPs), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and increased significantly (3-4-fold) the cellular accumulation of anti-cancer agent vinblastine (VBL). Consequently, this improved the anti-proliferative efficacy of VBL by decreasing the cell growth after 72 h from 100% (VBL treatment alone) to 48-75% (combination treatment). However, the same phenomenon was not seen with other chemotherapeutic, methotrexate (MTX). Therefore, the chemotherapeutics need to be selected carefully based on their uptake mechanism to the combinations with LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of efflux pump inhibitors to defeat effectively the multidrug resistance (MDR) of chemotherapy.

AB Phenytoin sodium (PS) is a narrow therapeutic index drug that dictates maintenance of narrow plasma concentration of the drug. This requires a good quality product that meets regulatory specifications throughout shelf-life as well as during the usage period. Quality of the drug product may change if not develop in a scientific fashion which may have ramifications on clinical outcome. The focus of the study was to understand the effect of process variables and storage conditions on the disproportionation and phase transformation of the drug, and dissolution of extended-release capsules of PS. Four formulations were prepared to contain either powder blend or granules of PS with commonly used excipients. The granules were prepared in a high shear mixture by granulating with water, ethanol or mixture thereof. The capsules were stored in pharmacy vials for 4-weeks at 40 degrees C/75% RH and 30 degrees C/65% RH. Formulations were characterized by spectroscopies (FTIR, NIR, and chemical imaging), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), dissolution and assay. Granules filled capsule did not meet USP dissolution specifications and there was a significant decrease in dissolution on exposure to stability conditions. Dissolution decreased from 77.56 +/- 3.83% to 42.34 +/- 4.31%, and 63.96 +/- 6.12 to 46.53 +/- 2.91 in physical mixture and water granulated formulations, respectively, after four weeks exposure at 40 degrees C/75% RH. Spectroscopic (NIR, FTIR, and chemical imaging) data indicated disproportionation of the drug during the storage period. Moreover, XRPD data explained a decrease in dissolution in the initial granules filled capsules as well as temperature and humidity exposed samples. It indicated the phase transformation of the drug and/or excipients, disproportionation and/or interactions. These changes further accelerated on exposure to stability conditions. In conclusion, our studies indicated the significant effect of process variables and stability conditions on the critical quality attributes of PS extended-release capsule that has the potential impact on the clinical performance of the product.

AB This work investigates the impact of vaginal ring size and drug loading on the in vitro release, safety, ease of fit, and pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus macaques of matrix-type silicone elastomer vaginal rings containing a combination of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine and the protease inhibitor darunavir. Drug-free and drug-loaded vaginal rings having three different geometries were manufactured by reaction injection molding. In vitro drug release was assessed using both a solvent/water mixture and a vaginal fluid simulant. Macaques fitted with drug-free vaginal rings for 28 days were assessed by colposcopy, cytological evaluation of cervico-vaginal lavage and histological evaluation of tissue after ring removal. The 20 x 4.5 mm combination ring, deemed most appropriate for vaginal fit and comfort in the macaques, was evaluated for pharmacokinetics over 28 days. Substantial differences were observed in the in vitro release profiles between the three ring sizes. However, these differences were not manifest in vivo, where measured drug concentrations after 20 x 4.5 mm ring use were not significantly different from those reported previously with a 25 x 6 mm ring. These results suggest that ring placement and fit is an important species-specific study parameter that should be optimised prior to pharmacokinetic testing.

Mucoadhesive films were manufactured using different polymers such as ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as well as carboxymethyl cellulose. Buccal films were evaluated in regards of mucoadhesiveness, swelling and physico-chemical properties. Furthermore rheological measurement and adhesion study were carried out on the buccal porcine mucosa. Moreover, allantoin as humectant was incorporated and trans-mucosal water loss was determined. The results showed that physico-chemical, buccal adhesive and swelling properties varied depending on the composition of the polymers. The findings indicated films containing allantoin to be suitable for buccal application. In completion, adhesive films are appropriate and promising formulations in the treatment of various disease in the intraoral cavity.

AB Different types of biodegradable nanoparticles (NP) have been studied as nasal mucosa cell delivery systems. These nanoparticles need to strongly interact with mucosa cells to deliver their payload. However, only a few simultaneous comparisons have been made and it is therefore difficult to determine the best candidate. Here we compared 5 types of nanoparticles with different surface charge (anionic or cationic) and various inner compositions as potential vectors: cationic and anionic liposomes, cationic and anionic PLGA (Poly Lactic co-Glycolic Acid) NP and porous and cationic maltodextrin NP (cationic surface with an anionic lipid core: NPL). We first quantified their nasal residence time after nasal administration in mice using in vivo live imaging and NPL showed the longest residence time. In vitro endocytosis on mucosal cells (airway epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells) using labeled nanoparticles were performed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Among the 5 nanoparticles, NPL were taken up to the greatest extent by the 3 different cell lines and the endocytosis mechanisms were characterized. Taken together, we observed that the nanoparticles' cationic surface charge is insufficient to improve mucosal residence time and cellular uptake and that the NPL are the best candidates to interact with airway mucosal cells.

ID HARD GELATIN CAPSULES; FUTURE
AB Continuous production of pharmaceuticals requires traceability from the raw material to the final dosage form. With that regard, understanding the residence time distribution (RTD) of the whole process and its unit operations is crucial. This work describes a structured approach to characterizing and modelling of RTDs in a continuous blender and a tamping pin capsule filling machine, including insights into data processing. The parametrized RTD models were interconnected to model a continuous direct capsule-filling process, showing the batch transition as well as the propagation of a 2 min feed disturbance throughout the process. Various control strategies were investigated in-silico, aiding in the selection of optimal material diversion point to minimize the material waste. Additionally, the RTD models can facilitate process design and optimization. In this work, adaptions to the capsule filling machine were made and their influence on the RTD was examined to achieve an optimal machine setup.

AB Carbamazepine is a valuable pharmacological agent prescribed in treatment of epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia. Poor bioavailability, successive dose adjustments and reported long term toxic effects are the main hurdles associated with carbamazepine oral administration. Bees wax containing NLC formulations were developed using high shear homogenization/sonication technique to overcome drug limitations. Formulations were successfully produced and evaluated for both in vitro and in vivo assessments. Results showed particles in nanometric range with negative surface charge and satisfying encapsulation efficiencies (from 93.1 +/- 7.6 to 95.7 +/- 5.6%). In vitro release studies revealed biphasic pattern and faster release was accompanied with higher bees wax concentration. Interaction between drug and NLC components was assessed using infrared and thermal analysis. Using validated chromatographic analytical method, selected formulation showed good pharmacokinetic profile depriving from plasma fluctuation with 2.27-fold and 1.83-fold improved bioavailability compared to conventional drug suspension and Tegretol (TM) suspension respectively. It also showed stronger anticonvulsant activity, with respect to conventional drug suspension, in terms of seizure latency, frequency and duration. Toxicity studies revealed undetectable liver or testicular toxicity in biochemical, histological and immunohistochemical investigations verifying its superiority above other investigated formulations. Collectively, results indicate potential suitability of NLC system to effectively and safely deliver carbamazepine orally.

AB Daptomycin (DAP) is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with potential clinical application in orthopedic infections caused by staphylococci. However, it failed to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus in vitro, in intracellular infection studies, as well as in vivo in an experimental model of implant-associated biofilm infections. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of DAP encapsulated in poly(methyl methacrylate)-Eudragit (PMMA-EUD) microparticles (DAP-MPs) on intracellular S. aureus was evaluated in human osteoblast cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Encapsulated DAP was able to reduce the amount of intracellular S. aureus by 73% compared to blank microparticles (MPs). Then, the advantage of treating with DAP-MPs versus free DAP was evaluated in a murine model of implant-associated biofilm infection. Free DAP showed a > 3 log(10) decrease in planktonic and adherent bacteria but failed to eradicate adherent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), whereas DAP-MPs showed a clearance of planktonic MRSA, significantly reduced adherent MRSA by more than 3 log(10) and cured the infection in 60%. This was linked to the prolonged higher DAP concentration within the tissue cage fluid compared to free DAP. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for the high intracellular and in vivo anti-biofilm efficacy of DAP-MPs to target staphylococcal infections.

AB The success of non-viral vectors based on cationic niosomes for retinal gene delivery applications depends on the ability to achieve persistent and high levels of transgene expression, ideally from a single administration. In this work, we studied the effect of the non-ionic surfactant component of niosomes in their transfection efficiency in rat retina. For that purpose, three niosome formulations that only differed in the non-ionic tensioactives were elaborated. Niosomes contained: cationic lipid 1,2-di O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA), helper lipid squalene and polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80 or polysorbate 85. Niosomes and corresponding nioplexes were fully characterized in terms of size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, morphology and ability to protect and release DNA. In vitro experiments were carried out to evaluate transfection efficiency, cell viability and intracellular trafficking pathways of the formulations. Nioplexes based on polysorbate 20 niosomes were the most efficient transfecting retinal cells in vitro. Moreover, subretinal and intravitreal administration of those nioplexes in vivo showed also high levels of transgene expression in rat retinas. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of polysorbate 20 in cationic niosomes enhances retinal gene delivery. Thus, this formulation emerges as a potential non-viral candidate to efficiently transfer specific therapeutic genes into the eye for biomedical purposes.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health burden. The emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and drug resistance has complicated global TB control. Pulmonary delivery of drugs using dry powder inhalers (DPI) is an emerging approach to treat TB. In comparison with the conventional pulmonary delivery for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), TB requires high dose delivery to the lung. However, high dose delivery depends on the successful design of the inhaler device and the formulation of highly aerosolizable powders. Particle engineering techniques play an important role in the development of high dose dry powder formulations. This review focuses on the development of high dose dry powder formulations for TB treatment with background information on the challenges of the current treatment of TB and the potential for pulmonary delivery. Particle engineering techniques with a particular focus on the spray drying and a summary of the developed dry powder formulations using different techniques are also discussed.

AB In recent years, the preparation of valuable drug delivery systems (DDS) from self-assembled amphiphilic copolymers has attracted much attention since these nanomaterials provide new opportunities to solve problems such as the lack of solubility in water of lipophilic drugs, improve their bioavailability, prolong their circulation time and decrease the side effects associated with their administration. In the current study two types of biocompatible pH-responsive nanoparticles derived from poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) have been used as drug nano-carriers, being one of them core cross-linked to circumvent their instability upon dilution in human fluids. The present paper deals with the optimization of the loading process of the labile, hydrophobic and highly active anticancer drug, Camptothecin (CPT) into the nanoparticles with regard to four independent variables: CPT/polymer ratio, sonication, temperature and loading time. Forty experiments were carried out and a Box-Behnken experimental design was used to evaluate the significance of the independent variables related to encapsulation efficiency and drug retention capacity. The enhanced drug loading and encapsulation efficiency values (58% and > 92%, respectively) of CPT were achieved by the core cross-linked NPs in 2 h at 32 degrees C at CPT/polymer ratio 1.5:1 w/w and 14 min of sonication. The optimized CPT-loaded NPs were studied by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy, and an increase in size of the loaded-NP compared to the unloaded counterparts was found. Other twenty experiments were conducted to study the enability to retain CPT into the conjugates at different ionic strength values and times. The stability studies demonstrated that the core crosslinked nanocarriers displayed an excellent drug retention capacity ( > 90%) at 25 degrees C for 15 days in every ionic-strength environments whereas the non-cross-linked ones were more stable at physiological ionic strength. The optimized systems proved to be a major step forward to encapsulate and retain CPT in the NP nuclei, what makes them ideal devices to control the delivery of CPT upon the triggered acidic conditions of solid tumors.

AB Mirena (R) is long-acting (5 years) contraceptive intrauterine device. It is composed of a hollow cylindrical drug reservoir (containing Levonorgestrel and polydimethylsiloxane), which is covered with a release rate controlling silicone membrane. This structure presents a manufacturing challenge and to date, there have been no literature reports on the manufacturing, product design and quality evaluation of these hollow cylindrical intrauterine devices. It is vital to develop a reproducible and robust manufacturing process for these long-acting intrauterine devices or systems to obtain an understanding the in vitro and in vivo performance of such drug-device combinations. In this study, a twin-syringe method with a customized mold was developed to manufacture hollow cylindrical polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based levonorgestrel intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs). Different mold materials, curing temperatures and times were screened to fabricate PDMS-drug reservoirs with good quality characteristics (easy demolding, good appearance and appropriate physicochemical characteristics). The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs were covered with the release rate controlling membrane to fabricate the LNG-IUSs. Physicochemical characterization (drug content and content uniformity, powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the PDMS-drug reservoirs with different drug loadings (10%, 25% and 50% w/w) was conducted. Real-time in vitro drug release testing of LNG-IUSs with different drug loading was performed in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl) at 37 degrees C using a water bath shaker rotating at 100 rpm. The prepared PDMS-drug reservoirs demonstrated good and reproducible quality characteristics including appearance (smooth surfaces), targeted drug loading and good drug content uniformity in the PDMS matrix. The PXRD showed that the crystallinity of the API was maintained inside the PDMS matrix. DSC, TGA and FTIR confirmed the structure of the drug and the PDMS, indicating no interaction between the drug and the PDMS matrix in the prepared LNGIUSs. Real-time in vitro drug release from the LNG-IUSs with different drug loadings showed zero-order release kinetics, and the drug release rate (based on daily release percentage) was inversely proportional to the drug loading.

AB Due to their role in immune responses, the skin dendritic cells (i.e. epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells) have become of great interest to researchers in the past decades. A dermal administration of allergens could target these professional antigen-presenting cells directly and build up immunotolerance. Additionally, many of the adverse side effects, which are seen in the current state of the art specific immunotherapy routes, could be avoided.
   Therefore, in this study a penetration enhancing microemulsion was developed and its physicochemical properties were determined under several storage conditions. The influence of different preservatives on the microemulsion stability was observed. We examined epidermal penetration of Alexa Fluor-647 labelled beevenom phospholipase A2 (Api m 1) using the Franz diffusion cell set up and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. First results of an in-vivo Api m 1-allergic mouse model indicated the protective efficacy of dermal AIT with our newly developed microemulsion.
   Summarily, the developed microemulsion is a suitable, stable drug delivery system for the topical administration of proteogenic allergens into the epidermis and is able to reach dendritic cells in the skin.

AB Periodontitis is a local inflammatory disease initiated by bacteria accumulation and results in cytokine mediated alveolar bone resorption and tissue destruction. In this study, the effect of locally delivered atorvastatin (2% w/v) containing chitosan formulations in the treatment of periodontitis was evaluated in rats with ligature induced periodontitis. The levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 were measured after treatment with formulations. Histomorphometric analysis included the measurements of the area of alveolar bone and the distance between cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and connective tissue attachment to tooth. Inflammatory and osteoclastic activity scores were given semiquantitatively. Following the administration of atorvastatin, release of pro-inflammatory (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2) cytokines was found to decrease, with a significant alveolar bone healing, when compared to that of control. The anti-inflammatory effect was observed to enhance in presence of chitosan. These findings suggest that chitosan based delivery system for a statin group drug, atorvastatin is a promising for the treatment of periodontal disease.

AB With the current transformation of the pharmaceutical industry towards continuous manufacturing, there is an inherent need to embrace this concept already during the early stages of drug formulation. Therefore, this research paper investigated the feasibility of using miniaturized forced feeders on a high-speed rotary tablet press with the intention of downscaling the tableting process. Forced feeders with a reduced volume (up to 46% compared to the conventional two-compartment forced feeder) were designed by either sealing one compartment (i.e. R&D1) or lowering of the compartment height (i.e. R&D2). These feed frame designs were thoroughly analysed in combination with two paddle types over a wide range of process-settings (i.e. tableting speed, paddle speed, direction of paddle rotation, overfill-level). A poorly flowing model powder (i.e. MCC 101) was deliberately selected as challenging formulation. Empirical modelling of feed frame R&D1 revealed a positive impact on the die-filling variability when the radial curved cuboid paddles rotated in counterclockwise direction at high paddle speed. Moreover, a strong resemblance between the R&D2 feed frame and the conventional forced feeder was observed during multivariate data analysis, indicating that this miniaturized type could be used during downscaling studies of the conventional tableting process. The potential of this forced feeder was acknowledged by the similar trends in die-filling variability with respect to varying process settings, when a design-of-experiments (DOE) was performing including feed frame type as a qualitative factor. Overall, it was concluded that both types of miniaturized forced feeders can be used on a high-speed rotary tablet press when lower material consumption rates are desired while the R&D2 feed frame bears the highest predictability regarding the diefilling uniformity in the conventional larger two-compartment forced feeder.

AB Objective: Some parents are hesitant about vaccines and yet still vaccinate their children. Vaccine behaviours are not fixed and parents who are concerned but nonetheless adherent to standard schedules could switch to an unconventional schedule, delaying or cherry-picking vaccines. There is a need to better understand vaccine hesitancy in specific contexts, acknowledging cultural and geographical variation, to ensure interventions targeting hesitancy are well directed and received.
   Methods: To identify the behaviours, knowledge and attitudes of 'hesitant compliers' in Perth, Western Australia, nine one-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with vaccinating parents of children (<5 years) who were identified as being hesitant. Interview transcripts were analysed qualitatively and themes developed inductively, following a constructivist paradigm.
   Results: Parents saw vaccination as important for themselves and their community, despite their limited knowledge of vaccine preventable diseases. Parents reported concerns about potential side effects, and worried about the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and seasonal influenza vaccines. Concerned about the role of anti-vaccination information in the community, some sought to isolate themselves from parents who did not vaccinate, although others were concerned that this could entrench non-vaccinators' behaviours. Parents' views were all underlaid by two pivotal 'vaccine-related events' that had occurred in the community: the severe injury of a baby from seasonal influenza vaccination in 2010, and the death of a baby from whooping cough in 2015.
   Conclusions: Parents interpreted pivotal vaccine-related events in the community as requiring them to take personal responsibility for vaccine decisions. Their reports of continued vaccine fears (evident in international studies in recent decades) demonstrate that vaccine scares have long lasting effects. With vaccine rates high and stable, current strategies appear to be have little impact on addressing parental vaccine concerns. Further research is required to determine the prevalence of hesitancy amongst vaccinating parents and identify critical points for intervention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Public confidence in immunization is critical to maintaining high vaccine-coverage rates needed to protect individuals and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases. Recent attention has been placed on factors influencing confidence in vaccination in the US and globally, but comprehensive understanding of what drives or hinders confidence in childhood vaccination is yet to be reached. As such, assessing parents' confidence in childhood vaccination and the ways in which educational materials affect confidence is needed.
   Objective: We sought to (1) learn how mothers who are hesitant about vaccination characterize confidence in health-related products for young children, including the recommended vaccines; (2) gain insights on what influences vaccine confidence beliefs; and (3) assess whether short, education materials affect parental confidence in childhood vaccinations.
   Methods: Eight moderator-lead focus groups (n = 61), stratified by socioeconomic status, were undertaken with mothers of children 5 years of age of less who are hesitant about vaccines. Four of the groups were held in the Philadelphia, PA area and four were held in the San Francisco/Oakland, CA area. Three educational material pairs, each consisting of a 2-3 min video and an infographic poster about an immunization-related topic, were reviewed and assessed for influence on confidence.
   Results: Qualitative data analysis was used to identify overarching themes across the focus groups. Themes, insights, and illustrative quotes were identified and provided for each of the major discussion areas: primary health concerns for young children; confidence beliefs and perceptions, including for recommended vaccines; facilitators and barriers to confidence; and reactions to the educational materials.
   Conclusions: Results provide helpful insights into how mothers who are hesitant about vaccines perceive confidence in childhood vaccines and health-related products, suggestions for how to improve confidence, and support for the value and use of short videos as part of vaccination education efforts. Findings can aid those developing vaccination education materials and resources designed to foster vaccine confidence. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Maternal and childhood vaccine decision-making begins prenatally. Amongst pregnant Australian women we aimed to ascertain vaccine information received, maternal immunisation uptake and attitudes and concerns regarding childhood vaccination. We also aimed to determine any correlation between a) intentions and concerns regarding childhood vaccination, (b) concerns about pregnancy vaccination, (c) socioeconomic status (SES) and (d) uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy and routine vaccines during childhood.
   Methods: Women attending public antenatal clinics were recruited in three Australian states. Surveys were completed on iPads. Follow-up phone surveys were done three to six months post delivery, and infant vaccination status obtained via the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR).
   Results: Between October 2015 and March 2016, 975 (82%) of 1184 mothers consented and 406 (42%) agreed to a follow up survey, post delivery. First-time mothers (445; 49%) had significantly more vaccine concerns in pregnancy and only 73% had made a decision about childhood vaccination compared to 89% of mothers with existing children (p-value < 0.001). 66% of mothers reported receiving enough information during pregnancy on childhood vaccination. In the post delivery survey, 46% and 82% of mothers reported receiving pregnancy influenza and pertussis vaccines respectively. The mother's degree of vaccine hesitancy and two attitudinal factors were correlated with vaccine uptake post delivery. There was no association between reported maternal vaccine uptake or SES and childhood vaccine uptake.
   Conclusion: First time mothers are more vaccine hesitant and undecided about childhood vaccination, and only two thirds of all mothers believed they received enough information during pregnancy. New interventions to improve both education and communication on childhood and maternal vaccines, delivered by midwives and obstetricians in the Australian public hospital system, may reduce vaccine hesitancy for all mothers in pregnancy and post delivery, particularly first-time mothers.

AB Introduction: The SKAI (Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation) project aims to develop effective communication tools to support primary health care providers' consultations with parents who may be hesitant about vaccinating their children.
   Aim: This study explored parents' communication needs using a qualitative design.
   Methods: Parents of at least one child less than five years old were recruited from two major cities and a regional town known for high prevalence of vaccine objection. Focus groups of parents who held similar vaccination attitudes and intentions were convened to discuss experiences of vaccination consultations and explore their communication needs, including preferences. Draft written communication support tools were used to stimulate discussion and gauge acceptability of the tools.
   Results: Important differences in communication needs between group types emerged. The least hesitant parent groups reported feeling reassured upon reading resources designed to address commonly observed concerns about vaccination. As hesitancy of the group members increased, so did their accounts of the volume and detail of information they required. Trust appeared to be related to apparent or perceived transparency. More hesitant groups displayed increased sensitivity and resistance to persuasive language forms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A reactive campaign using two doses of Shanchol Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) was implemented in 2016 in the Lake Chilwa Region (Malawi) targeting fish dependent communities. Three strategies for the second vaccine dose delivery (including delivery by a community leader and self-administration) were used to facilitate vaccine access.
   This assessment collected vaccine perceptions and opinions about the OCV campaign of 313 study participants, including: fishermen, fish traders, farmers, community leaders, and one health and one NGO officer. Socio-demographic surveys were conducted, In Depth Interviews and Focus Group Discussions were conducted before and during the campaign.
   Some fishermen perceived the traditional delivery strategy as reliable but less practical. Delivery by traditional leaders was acceptable for some participants while others worried about traditional leaders not being trained to deliver vaccines or beneficiaries taking doses on their own. A slight majority of beneficiaries considered the self-administration strategy practical while some beneficiaries worried about storing vials outside of the cold chain or losing vials. During the campaign, a majority of participants preferred receiving oral vaccines instead of injections given ease of intake and lack of pain. OCV was perceived as efficacious and safe. However, a lack of information on how sero-protection may be delayed and the degree of sero-protection led to loss of trust in vaccine potency among some participants who witnessed cholera cases among vaccinated individuals.
   OCV campaign implementation requires accompanying communication on protective levels, less than 100% vaccine efficacy, delays in onset of sero-protection, and out of cold chain storage. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: While planning an immunization campaign in settings where public health interventions are subject to politically motivated resistance, designing context-based social mobilization strategies is critical to ensure community acceptability. In preparation for an Oral Cholera Vaccine campaign implemented in Nampula, Mozambique, in November 2016, we assessed potential barriers and levers for vaccine acceptability.
   Methods: Questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions, as well as observations, were conducted before the campaign. The participants included central and district level government informants (national immunization program, logistics officers, public health directors, and others), community leaders and representatives, and community members.
   Results: During previous well chlorination interventions, some government representatives and health agents were attacked, because they were believed to be responsible for spreading cholera instead of purifying the wells. Politically motivated resistance to cholera interventions resurfaced when an OCV campaign was considered. Respondents also reported vaccine hesitancy related to experiences of problems during school-based vaccine introduction, rumors related to vaccine safety, and negative experiences following routine childhood immunization. Despite major suspicions associated with the OCV campaign, respondents' perceived vulnerability to cholera and its perceived severity seem to override potential anticipated OCV vaccine hesitancy.
   Discussion: Potential hesitancy towards the OCV campaign is grounded in global insecurity, social disequilibrium, and perceived institutional negligence, which reinforces a representation of estrangement from the central government, triggering suspicions on its intentions in implementing the OCV campaign. Recommendations include a strong involvement of community leaders, which is important for successful social mobilization; representatives of different political parties should be equally involved in social mobilization efforts, before and during campaigns; and public health officials should promote other planned interventions to mitigate the lack of trust associated with perceived institutional negligence. Successful past initiatives include public intake of purified water or newly introduced medication by social mobilizers, teachers or credible leaders. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The Flu vaccine is the most effective measure to prevent influenza. Yet, vaccination rates remain at sub-optimal levels, with 10%-29% coverage rates in the general population of the EU. As mistrust in vaccines has increased, effective strategies are needed and one is communication. The aim of this research is to identify vaccination recommendations of the health ministries in 5 European Member States and to investigate the communication strategies used.
   Methods: Two methods were employed in this study. A review of flu vaccination recommendations in the European Union and five Members States (Austria, Germany, Malta, Ireland and United Kingdom). Next a content analysis was conducted of flu vaccination communication in those six contexts.
   Results and discussion: All countries recommend flu vaccination as a primary protection tool, but they differed in their recommendations for various target audiences. Channels for communication included seven websites and 42 other materials. The main messages used were gained framed promoting protection, either for oneself, family or patients. Most communications provided basic information replying on providing facts and knowledge about the flu and the benefits of vaccination. No information on the development of the communication or its effects were found.
   Conclusion: Communicating flu vaccination as a protective tool is common across countries and is consistent with the benefits of vaccination. Furthermore, the communications in the countries were not consistent with their recommendations. As the recommendations vary across and within countries, communication becomes a challenge. They should, at a minimum, be consistent with EU and country specific recommendations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Identification of preliminary core outcome domains for communication

AB Background: Communication interventions for childhood vaccination are promising strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, but current research is limited by the outcomes measured. Most studies measure only vaccination-related outcomes, with minimal consideration of vaccine hesitancy-relevant intermediate outcomes. This impedes understanding of which interventions or elements are effective.
   It is also unknown which outcomes are important to the range of stakeholders affected by vaccine hesitancy. Outcome selection shapes the evidence base, informing future interventions and trials, and should reflect stakeholder priorities.
   Therefore, our aim was to identify which outcome domains (i.e. broad outcome categories) are most important to different stakeholders, identifying preliminary core outcome domains to inform evaluation of three common vaccination communication types: (i) communication to inform or educate, (ii) remind or recall, and (iii) enhance community ownership.
   Methods: We conducted a two-stage online Delphi survey, involving four stakeholder groups: parents or community members, healthcare providers, researchers, and government or non-governmental organisation representatives. Participants rated the importance of eight outcome domains for each of the three communication types. They also rated specific outcomes within one domain ("attitudes or beliefs") and provided feedback about the survey.
   Results: Collectively, stakeholder groups prioritised outcome domains differently when considering the effects of different communication types. For communication that aims to (i) inform or educate, the most important outcome domain is "knowledge or understanding"; for (ii) reminder communication, "vaccination status and behaviours"; and for (iii) community engagement communication, "community participation". All stakeholder groups rated most outcome domains as very important or critical. The highest rated specific outcome within the "attitudes or beliefs" domain was "trust".
   Conclusion: This Delphi survey expands the field of core outcomes research and identifies preliminary core outcome domains for measuring the effects of communication about childhood vaccination. The findings support the argument that vaccination communication is not a single homogenous intervention - it has a range of purposes, and vaccination communication evaluators should select outcomes accordingly.

This has important consequences, because shifting focus to encompass the process of communicating, and not just on the content of content message being conveyed; opens the possibility of greater insight and understanding regarding the conversation health care workers have with those who are vaccine hesitant, creating increased chances of acceptance.

TI Midwives' attitudes, beliefs and concerns about childhood vaccination: A
   review of the global literature
SO VACCINE

ID IMMUNIZATION; VACCINES; CARE; PARENTS; MMR
AB Vaccine hesitancy in industrialised countries is an area of concern. Health professionals play a significant role in parental vaccination decisions, however, to date the role of midwives has not been widely explored. This review sought to describe the attitudes and communication practices of midwives in developed countries towards childhood vaccines.
   Medline, Cinahl, Psychlnfo, Embase and the grey literature were searched. Inclusion criteria were qualitative and quantitative studies reporting midwives' beliefs, attitudes and communication practices toward childhood vaccination.
   The search returned 366 articles, of which 359 were excluded by abstract. Two additional articles were identified from the grey literature and references, resulting in nine studies from five countries included in the review.
   Across the studies, the majority of midwives supported vaccination, although a spectrum of beliefs and concerns emerged. A minority expressed reservations about the scientific justification for vaccination, which focussed on what is not yet known rather than mistrust of current evidence. Most midwives felt that vaccines were safe; a minority were unsure, or believed they were unsafe. The majority of midwives agreed that childhood vaccines are necessary. Among those who expressed doubt, a commonly held opinion was that vaccine preventable diseases such as measles are relatively benign and didn't warrant vaccination against them. Finally, the midwifery model of care was shown to focus on providing individualised care, with parental choice being placed at a premium.
   The midwifery model care appears to differ in approach from others, possibly due to a difference in the underpinning philosophies. Research is needed to understand how midwives see vaccination, and why there appears to be a spectrum of views on the subject. This information will inform the development of resources tailored to the midwifery model of care, supporting midwives in advocating for childhood vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Motors of influenza vaccination uptake and vaccination advocacy in
   healthcare workers: Development and validation of two short scales

LA English

   vaccines; Workplace motivation
ID BEHAVIOR; MMR
AB Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an important priority group for vaccination against influenza, yet, flu vaccine uptake remains low among them. Psychosocial studies of HCWs' decisions to get vaccinated have commonly drawn on subjective expected utility models to assess predictors of vaccination, assuming HCWs' choices result from a rational information-weighing process. By contrast, we recast those decisions as a commitment to vaccination and we aimed to understand why HCWs may want to (rather than believe they need to) get vaccinated against the flu. This article outlines the development and validation of a 9-item measure of cognitive empowerment towards flu vaccination (MoVac-flu scale) and an 11-item measure of cognitive empowerment towards vaccination advocacy. Both scales were administered to 784 frontline NHS HCWs with direct patient contact between June 2014 and July 2015. The scales exhibited excellent reliability and a clear unidimensional factor structure. An examination of the nomological network of the cognitive empowerment construct in relation to HCWs' vaccination against the flu revealed that this construct was distinct from traditional measures of risk perception and the strongest predictor of HCWs' decisions to vaccinate. Similarly, cognitive empowerment in relation to vaccination advocacy was a strong predictor of HCWs' engagement with vaccination advocacy. These findings suggest that the cognitive empowerment construct has important implications for advancing our understanding of HCWs' decisions to vaccinate as well as their advocacy behavior.

AB Background: Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent and control the health and economic burden caused by seasonal influenza. Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a crucial role in vaccine acceptance and advocacy for their patients. This study explored the drivers of HCWs' vaccine acceptance and advocacy in six European countries.
   Methods: Healthcare workers (mainly general practitioners, specialist physicians, and nurses) voluntarily completed a questionnaire in Bulgaria (N = 485), Czech Republic (N = 518), Kosovo (N = 466), Poland (N = 772), Romania (N = 155), and the United Kingdom (N = 80). Twelve-item scales were used to analyse sentiment clusters for influenza vaccination acceptance and engagement with vaccination advocacy. Past vaccination behaviour and patient recommendation were also evaluated. All data were included in a single analysis.
   Results: For vaccination acceptance, the main cluster (engaged sentiment: 68%) showed strong positive attitudes for influenza vaccination. A second cluster (hesitant sentiment: 32%) showed more neutral attitudes. Cluster membership was predicted by country of origin and age. The odds ratio for past vaccination in the engaged cluster was 39.6 (95% CI 12.21-128.56) although this varied between countries. For vaccination advocacy, the main cluster (confident sentiment: 73%) showed strong positive attitudes towards advocacy; a second cluster (diffident sentiment: 27%) showed neutral attitudes. Cluster membership was predicted by country of origin, age and profession, with specialist physicians being the least likely to belong to the confident sentiment cluster. HCWs characterised by confident advocacy sentiments were also more likely recommend flu vaccination. Again, this association was moderated by country of origin.
   Conclusions: These data show that there is room to improve both vaccination acceptance and advocacy rates in European HCWs, which would be expected to lead to higher rates of HCW vaccination. Benefits that could be expected from such an outcome are improved advocacy and better control of morbidity and mortality related to seasonal influenza infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although vaccination uptake is high in most countries, pockets of sub-optimal coverage remain posing a threat to individual and population immunity. Increasingly, the term 'vaccine hesitancy' is being used by experts and commentators to explain sub-optimal vaccination coverage. We contend that using this term to explain all partial or non-immunisation risks generating solutions that are a poor match for the problem in a particular community or population. We propose more precision in the term 'vaccine hesitancy' is needed particularly since much under-vaccination arises from factors related to access or pragmatics. Only with clear terminology can we begin to understand where the problem lies, measure it accurately and develop appropriate interventions.

AB Background: Despite almost three decades of the Universal Immunization Program in India, a little more than half the children aged 12-23 months receive the full schedule of routine vaccinations. We examined socio-demographic factors associated with partial-vaccination and non-vaccination and the reasons for non-vaccination among Indian children during 1998 and 2008.
   Methods: Data from three consecutive, nationally-representative, District Level Household and Facility Surveys (1998-99, 2002-04 and 2007-08) were pooled. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify individual and household level socio-demographic variables associated with the child's vaccination status. The mother's reported reasons for non-vaccination were analyzed qualitatively, adapting from a previously published framework.
   Results: The pooled dataset contained information on 178,473 children 12-23 months of age; 53%, 32% and 15% were fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. Compared with the 1998-1999 survey, children in the 2007-2008 survey were less likely to be unvaccinated (Adjusted Prevalence Odds Ratio (aPOR): 0.92, 95%CI = 0.86-0.98) but more likely to be partially vaccinated (aPOR: 1.58, 95%Cl = 1.52-1.65). Vaccination status was inversely associated with female gender, Muslim religion, lower caste, urban residence and maternal characteristics such as lower educational attainment, non-institutional delivery, fewer antenatal care visits and non-receipt of maternal tetanus vaccination. The mother's reported reasons for non-vaccination indicated gaps in awareness, acceptance and affordability (financial and non-financial costs) related to routine vaccinations.
   Conclusions: Persisting socio-demographic disparities related to partial-vaccination and nonvaccination were associated with important childhood, maternal and household characteristics. Further research investigating the causal pathways through which maternal and social characteristics influence decision-making for childhood vaccinations is needed to improve uptake of routine vaccination in India. Also, efforts to increase uptake should address parental fears related to vaccination to improve trust in government health services as part of ongoing social mobilization and communication strategies.

AB Background: Five hundred thousand children under the age of 5 die from vaccine preventable diseases in India every year. More than just improving coverage, increasing timeliness of immunizations is critical to ensuring infant health in the first year of life. Novel, culturally appropriate community engagement strategies are worth exploring to close the immunization gap. In our study, a digital NFC (Near Field Communication) pendant worn on black thread and voice call reminder system was tested for the effectiveness in improving DTP3 adherence within 2 monthly camps from DTP1 administration.
   Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which 96 village health camps were randomized to 3 arms: NFC sticker, NFC pendant, and NFC pendant with voice call reminder in local dialect. Randomization was done across 5 blocks in the Udaipur District serviced by Seva Mandir from August 2015 to April 2016.
   Results: In terms of our three primary outcomes related to DTP3 adherence, point estimates show conflicting results. Two outcomes presented adherence in the control. DTP3 completion within two camps after DTP1 showed higher adherence in the Control (Sticker) (74.2%) arm compared to the Pendant (67.2%) and Pendant and Voice arms (69.3%). Likewise, the estimate for DTP3 completion within 180 days of birth in the Control (Sticker) (69.4%) arm was higher than estimates in the Pendant (57.4%) and Pendant and Voice arms (58.7%). However, one outcome displayed higher adherence in the intervention. DTP3 completion within two months from the time of registration was higher in the Pendant (37.7%) and Pendant and Voice arms (38.7%) compared to the Control (Sticker) arm (27.4%). In all primary outcomes, differences in adherence were statistically insignificant both before and after controlling for confounding factors. In terms of secondary outcomes, our results suggest that providing a necklace generated significant community discussion (H = 8.8796, df = 2, p = .0118), had strong satisfaction among users (chi 2=26.039, df = 4, p < .0001), and resulted in increased visibility within families (grandmothers: chi 2=34.023, df = 2, p < .0001, fathers: chi 2 = 34.588, df = 2, p < .0001).
   Conclusion: Neither the NFC necklace nor the necklace with additional voice call reminders in the local dialect directly resulted in an increase in infant immunization timeliness through DTP3, the primary outcome. Still our process outcomes suggest that our culturally symbolic necklace has potential to be an assistive tool in immunization campaigns. Follow-on work will seek to examine whether positive behavior change towards vaccines can be fostered with earlier engagement of this platform beginning in the prenatal stage, under a continuum of care framework.

AB Peroxidasin (PXDN) facilitates peroxidative reactions via utilisation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and has been shown to crosslink collagen IV through sulfilimine bond formation in the presence of hypohalous acids. Aberrant PXDN expression has been associated with kidney fibrosis, cancer, congenital eye defects and various cardiovascular disorders. Since PXDN expression is modified by H2O2, we hypothesized that a major antioxidant response transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), may regulate PXDN expression. PXDN expression in response to H2O2 and the Nrf2-specific inducers, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and sulforaphane (SFN), was determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy, in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were used to investigate the regulation of PXDN by Nrf2. We observed elevated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased PXDN protein expression in response to H2O2, tBHQ and SFN, in both cell lines. We found that Nrf2 binds to and increases luciferase reporter gene expression from the PXDN promoter via a putative Nrf2-binding site. In summary, we show that PXDN is a novel target of the redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. This finding further highlights the role of PXDN in redox-related processes and compliments the currently understood pathophysiological functions of PXDN.

AB Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon in which epithelial cells lose their cell to cell adhesion and detach from the base of the membrane. EMT is a fundamental process which occurs during tumor progression and metastasis. Cancer genomics is a complex network which involves a variety of factors such as transcription factors (TFs), coding genes and microRNAs (miRs). Both TFs and miRs are trans-regulatory elements that crosstalk. Due to a wide range of targets, TF-miR interaction provides a feedback or feedforward loop and cross-gene regulation consequently. In this review, we focused on the structure and function of two TF families involved in EMT, zinc finger and beta helix loop helix and p53. Subsequently we analyzed recent findings on TF-miR interaction in EMT.

AB RNA-Seq was applied to capture the transcriptome of the leaf and root of non-treated and salinity-treated chrysanthemum cv. 'Jinba' plants. A total of 206,868 unigenes of mean length 849 nt and of N50 length 1363 nt was identified; of these about 64% ( > 132,000) could be functionally assigned. Depending on the severity of the salinity stress, differential transcription was observed for genes encoding proteins involved in osmotic adjust. ment, in ion transport, in reactive oxygen species scavenging and in the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. The root stress response was dominated by the up-regulation of genes involved in ion transport, while that of the leaf reflected the plant's effort to make osmotic adjustments and to regulate Ca2+ transport. An array of known transcription factors (WRKY, AP2/ERF, MYB, bHLH and NAC) were differentially transcribed.

AB Sex steroid hormones play an important role in mediating physiological responses and developmental processes through their receptors across all vertebrates. Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) is a critically endangered reptile species unique to China. In this study, we have cloned one of the sex steroid hormone receptor genes, androgen receptor (AR) from the brain of Chinese alligator for the first time. The full-length AR cDNA is 2717 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 722 amino acids. Amino acid alignment analyses indicated that the ARs exhibit highly conserved functional domains. Especially, the P-box and D-box, which are essential to ensure that receptor binding to the androgen response elements, are completely conserved in selected species. Using the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), the spatial expression of four receptor mRNAs in all newborn brain tissues and temporal expression of them in the cerebrum during the embryonic development in Chinese alligators were investigated. The results of qPCR showed ubiquitous expression of the four receptor mRNAs in all newborn brain tissues examined and significant changes in the expression levels of these receptor mRNAs in the embryonic development. These results suggest that sex steroid hormones might play an important role in the regulation of complex neuroendocrine activities in newborn Chinese alligator. Furthermore, these data provide an important foundation for further studies on endocrinology and molecular biology of non-mammalian sex steroid hormone receptors.

AB Cannabinoids are secondary natural products from the plant Cannabis sativa L. Therapeutic indications of cannabinoids currently comprise a significant area of medicinal research. We have expressed the Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS) and cannabidiolic acid synthase (CBDAS) recombinantly in Komagataella phaffii and could detect eight different products with a cannabinoid scaffold after conversion of the precursor cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). Besides five products remaining to be identified, both enzymes were forming three major cannabinoids of C. sativa - Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabichromenic acid (CBCA). In pursuit of improved enzyme properties for a biotechnological cannabinoid production, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the glycosylation pattern, the C-terminal berberine-bridge-enzyme (BBE) domain, the active site and the product specificity of both enzymes. The THCAS variant T_N89Q+N499Q (lacking two glycosylation sites) exerted about two-fold increased activity compared to wild-type enzyme. Variant T_H494C+R532C (additional disulfide bridge) exerted about 1.7-fold increased activity compared to wild-type enzyme and a shifted temperature optimum from 52 degrees C to 57 degrees C. We generated two CBDAS variants, C_S116A and C_A414V, with 2.8 and 3.3-fold increased catalytic activities for CBDA production. C_A414V additionally showed a broadened pH spectrum and a 19-fold increased catalytic activity for THCA production. These studies lay the groundwork for further research as well as biotechnological cannabinoid production.

AB CRISPR-Cpf1 is a type V CRISPR system that has recently been exploited for genome engineering purposes. Compared to the well-known Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system, the effector protein Cpf1 recognizes T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) instead of G-rich PAM (used by CRISPR-Cas9), which could offer a substantial expansion of the existing genetic toolbox for genome editing. In this study, we report the implementation of the Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1 (AsCpf1) for markerless genome engineering in Clostridium beijerinckii, a prominent species for biosolvent production through the well-known Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) pathway. A lactose inducible promoter was used to control the expression of AsCpf1 to decrease its toxicity, while a constitutive small RNA promoter was employed to drive the expression of pre-crRNA. A One-Step-Assembly (OSA) approach was employed to construct the CRISPR-Cpf1-based vector in one single step, which simplified and streamlined the plasmid construction process. Using the customized CRISPR-Cpf1 system, we successfully deleted spo0A and pta genes in C. beijerinckii, with an editing efficiency of up to 100%. Altogether, our results demonstrated the easy programmability and high efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system for versatile genome engineering purposes. This study provides valuable guidance and essential references for repurposing the CRISPR-Cpf1 system for genome engineering in other microorganisms.

AB A Rhizobium-related bacterium (Rhizobium sp. VsBac-Y9) is a symbiont living with the dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungus Veronaeopsis simplex Y34. Co-inoculation of Rhizobium sp. VsBac-Y9 with V. simplex Y34 improves the fungal colonization of tomato roots, resulting in a significant increase in aboveground biomass. This study sequenced the complete genome of this V. simplex-helper bacterium using the PacBio and Illumina MiSeq platforms. Hybrid assembly using SPAdes outputted a circular chromosome, a linear chromid, and a circular plasmid for a total genome 5,321,211 bp in size with a G+C content of 59.2%. Analysis of concatenated housekeeping genes (atpD-dnaK-groEL-lepA-recA-rpoB-thrE) and calculation of average nucleotide identity, showed that VsBac-Y9 was affiliated with the species Agrobacterium pusense (syn. Rhizobium pusense). Genome analysis revealed that A. pusense VsBac-Y9 contains a series of genes responsible for the host interactions with both fungus and plant. Such genomic information will provide new insights into developing co-inoculants of endophytic fungus and its symbiotic bacterium in future agricultural innovation.

AB Quantum dots are important fluorescent semiconductor nano-crystals with distinguished electrical and optical properties and have gained great interest in many fields. The chemical and physical synthetic methods are usually not favorable for biological application due to high energy-consumption procedure and residual toxic chemicals. The development of novel "green" routes to prepare bio-compatible cadmium sulfide quantum dots constitutes a promising substituted approach. We used the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor for the biosynthesis of cadmium sulfide quantum dots taking account of the adsorption property of this fungus. Multiple physical characterizations involving scanning electron microscope (SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermo-gravimetric (TG), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed surface, optical and thermal characteristics, crystalline nature, size and shape distributions of the nanoparticles. This study provided a suitable and efficient approach to synthesize stable biocompatible cadmium sulfide quantum dots using the fungus Trametes versicolor with great potentials in the biological and biomedical researches.

AB Bacillus subtilis is well known as both a model organism and as a microbial cell factory. Simple and scarless gene modification is a desirable tool for basic research and industrial applications of B. subtilis. It has been demonstrated that naturally competent strains of B. subtilis can uptake multiple different DNA molecules, a phenomenon called co-transformation. Here, we describe a co-transformation-based method for generating unmarked mutants of B. subtilis. The PCR product containing the desired mutant allele is introduced into B. subtilis through co-transformation of the plasmid pUS20, which harbours a spectinomycin-resistant marker (Spcr). The target mutation is acquired by screening transformants for integration of pUS20 by resistance to spectinomycin. Due to its unstable replication in B. subtilis, pUS20 is easily cured from transformants in the absence of spectinomycin. This method allows for point mutation delivery at frequencies of approximately 30%. Deletions and insertions of long DNA fragments can also be carried out efficiently using this method. Moreover, this method is also successful in Bacillus velezensis, indicating that it may be extended to other Bacillus species that can form natural competence.

AB Within this study the mediated detoxification of spent sulphite liquor via laccase from Trametes versicolor was analysed and optimised using an in-situ NMR-spectroscopy method. The enzymatic degradation kinetic was optimised using the degradation rate of aromatic compounds as indirect parameter. Via response surface methodology the impact of the temperature, the pH and the enzyme concentration was analysed and the conditions were optimised focusing on optimal detoxification. The results of the statistical calculation revealed a valid statistical model for the optimal impact on the aromatic degradation with a temperature of 31 degrees C, a pH of 6 and a laccase concentrations of 179 U g(-1) dry matter of spent sulphite liquor. By using these conditions 88.73% of aromatic compounds could be degraded.

AB The CRISPR/Cas9 system has enabled efficient modification of genes in a variety of cellular systems for studying phenotypic effects of genetic perturbations. However, with this technology comes the inherent risk of generating off-target effects (OTEs) in addition to the desired modifications. As such, it can be difficult to conclusively determine that the observed phenotypic changes are in fact due to the intended modification of the target gene and not from random mutations elsewhere in the genome. In addition, biological variations observed within cultured cells or laboratory animals can also confound results and need to be addressed. In this article, we review potential sources of experimental and biological variation as well as propose experimental options to minimize and control OTEs and other variations in CRISPR genome editing experiments for exploratory research applications. Confirmation of on-target KO effect by orthogonal approaches is also discussed.

AB Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with more than two double bonds and length of carbon chain 18-22 must be taken in the diet to prevent diseases and imbalances caused by their deficiency. Terrestrial sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids are limited to only a few plant species whose large-scale cultivation is not possible and the production of their seeds and oil is ineffective. The complete biosynthetic pathway of fatty acids is known in organisms, including plants. After the first gene encoding the enzyme catalysing the initial steps of PUFA biosynthesis (omega-3 desaturase, Delta 6-desaturase) were isolated, isolation of other genes encoding relevant enzymes of the PUFA pathway from different donor organisms followed. Genetic transformations of model plants by the desaturase-and elongase-encoding genes opened the way for the genetic engineering of oilseed crop species. Some of the developed transgenic plants produced PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Seed oils extracted from them were similar to fish oil. Tools of the synthetic biology can be applied in modifications of the PUFA pathway and also in overcoming of limitations when the gene and its expression product are absent in the pathway. Such progress in cereals (barley, wheat, maize) has been made only recently, when the first successful modifications of the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA pathways succeeded. This review focuses on genetic modifications of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway in cereals in relation to the status reached in model plants and oilseed crops.

AB Additive manufacturing has a great potential for creating hard tissue substitutes, such as bone and cartilage, or soft tissues, such as vascular and skin grafts. This study is a pilot study for 3D printing of a new material mixture potentially used as a tubular substitute for urethra replacement. This new mixture is a blend of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).
   The basic aspect that affects the 3D printing process is correct material preparation and setting of 3D printer parameters.
   Selection of material and printing parameters depend on printing technology. The printing technology affects material behavior during printing process. The goal of preprocessing and 3D printing process is to provide stabile conditions during manufacturing to obtain usable printed samples.
   The study deals with preparation of material before 3D printing - material drying. Moisture in material affects material degradation and viscosity during printing. According to this, it is necessary to verify recommended drying parameters. Verification was performed by printing strand samples from dried and non-dried material and also by calculating and comparing respective viscosities that change in time. Printed strand clearly show that non-dried material degrades in less than 10 min, what leads to inappropriate application in short-time printing. Dried material shows significant stability and degrades slightly during selected time span. For metrological verification of material stability two sample types were designed and manufactured - a cubic sample which represents basic scaffold structures and a tubular one that serves as urethra substitution. Obtained results showed appropriate usability of selected technology and printing parameters for PLA / PHB material blend.

AB Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Because Wnt signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, we have investigated the circulating and local levels of the Wnt antagonist protein, Secreted Frizzled Related Protein (sFRP) 3, in osteosarcoma patients. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of 67 osteosarcoma and age-matched non-diseased control sera showed that sFPR3 protein levels were significantly lower in osteosarcoma than in normal. Analysis of tumor and adjacent normal tissues (9 pairs) from osteosarcoma patients showed a decrease in sFRP3 expression in 5 out of 9 tumor samples compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarray revealed a significant decrease in sFRP3 levels in tumor compared to normal bone. RNA sequencing analysis in osteosarcoma cells shows suppression of sFRP3 and concomitant expression of multiple Wnt family members mediating canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling. Taken together, our findings show that the systemic and local levels of sFRP3 protein are downregulated in osteosarcoma and sFRP3 levels could be explored further in the diagnosis and the care of osteosarcoma patients.

AB The bird mitogenome is generally considered to have a conservative genome size, consistent gene content, and similar gene order. As more mitogenomes are sequenced, mitochondrial (mt) gene rearrangements have been frequently identified among diverse birds. Within two genera (Bubo and Strix) of typical owls (Strigidae, Strigiformes), the rearrangement of the mt gene has been a subject of debate. In the current study, we first sequenced the whole mitogenomes of S. uralensis and B. scandiaca and resequenced the entire mitogenome of B. bubo. By combining our data with previously sequenced mitogenomes in Strigidae, we examined the mt gene rearrangements in the family and attempted to reconstruct the evolutionary progression of these rearrangements. The mitogenomes were then used to review the phylogenies of Strigidae. Most mitogenomes exhibited the ancestral gene order (A) in Strigidae. The ancestral gene order in the previously published mitogenome of B. bubo was found to be incorrect. We determined the mt gene order (the duplicate tRNA(Th)(r)-CR, B) and discovered two additional mt gene orders (the duplicate tRNA(Glu-L)-CR and CR, C and D) in the Bubo and Strix genera. Gene order B was likely derived from A by a tandem duplication of the region spanning from tRNA(Th)(r) to CR. The other two modified gene orders, C and D, were likely derived from B by further degenerations or deletions of one copy of specific duplicated genes. We also preliminarily reconstructed the evolutionary progression of mt gene rearrangements and discussed maintenance of the duplicated CR in the genera. Additionally, the phylogenetic trees based on the mitogenomes supported the division of Strigidae into three subfamilies: Ninoxinae + (Surniinae + Striginae). Within the Striginae Glade, the four genera formed a phylogenetic relationship: Otus + (Asio + (Bubo + Strix)). This suggests that Otus firstly diverges in their evolutionary history, and Bubo and Strix show a close relationship. B. bubo, B. blakistoni and B. scandiaca form a Glade should be considered members of the same genus. The well-supported topology obtained in our Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of Strigid mitogenomes suggests that these genomes are informative for constructing phylogenetic relationships.

AB SURF1 is an assembly factor of mitochondrial complex IV, and its mutations are the primary cause of Leigh syndrome in infants. To date, over 100 SURF1 mutations have been reported worldwide, but the spectrum of the SURF1 mutations in China remains unclear. Here, using next-generation sequencing targeting mitochondrial protein-coding sequences, we sequenced 178 patients suspected to have mitochondrial diseases. Fifteen SURF1 mutations were identified in 12 Leigh syndrome patients, of which three, c.465_466delAA, c.532A > T, and c.826_827ins AGCATCTGCAGTACATCG, were newly described. The percentage of SURF1 frameshift mutations (6/28, 21.4%) we detected in Chinese population is higher than other studies (21/106, 19.8%) with different populations, however, the percentage of missense mutations is lower in this study than others (4/28, 14.3% VS. 25/106, 23.6%). Since complex IV can be detected in cells carrying missense mutations (3/8) but not in cells carrying null mutations (0/4) by using cell model-based complementation assay, our results indicate that SURF1 mutations may be associated with worse clinical outcome in Chinese patients than other populations. However, studies with larger sample size are needed to verify this conclusion. Additionally, we found that the frameshift mutations resulting in protein truncation closer to the C-terminus are not associated with better disease prognosis. Lastly, we found that determining the levels of complex IV assembly using cell models or lymphocyte analysis rather than invasive muscle and skin fibroblast biopsy, may help predict disease progression in Leigh syndrome patients.

AB Previous studies have shown that miR-200a is markedly deregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and PD. Furthermore, studies have shown the key role of miR-200a on expression of SIRT1 and apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a/SIRT1 axis should have a crucial role in apoptosis of dopaminergic (DA)neurons. In this study, human SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP+ and expression of miR-200a, SIRT1 and its target genes were assessed. Our results confirmed that expression of miR-200a significantly up-regulated during treating of human SH-SY5Y cells with MPP+ in order to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis. Additionally, transcript level of SIRT1 in these cells showed significant down-regulation confirming that SIRT1 is indeed decreased due to miR-200a up-regulation during apoptosis. Moreover, expression of P53, FOX01 and BCL2 were modulated. In this study, we indicated that miR-200a/SIRT1 axis directly correlates with apoptosis and P53 signaling pathway. In conclusion, miR-200a and its target gene, SIRT1, may exert a possible role in induction of apoptosis in DA neurons through regulating P53, apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathways.

AB The regulation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation code is indispensable for the cell as any disturbance in this has been associated with many pathologic conditions, like cancer. The SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase 2 (KMT2) family of histone methyltransferases was the first to be identified as writers of H3K4 methylation. In mammals, seven members of the KMT2 family are responsible for carrying out the bulk of H3K4 methylation. Recent studies documented alterations in various histone methylases in human cancer, which were associated with therapeutic and prognostic potential. Notwithstanding, no report has documented the role of KMT2 family of histone methyltransferases in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Therefore, we examined the expression profile of all the seven KMT2 family members of histone methyltransferases in ccRCC with the aim to establish their role as prognostic or therapeutic targets. Real-time PCR was employed to study the expression of KMT2 family genes using specific primers in 50 cases of ccRCC. The mRNA levels were correlated with stage, grade, and metastasis of the tumor. Among seven genes, KMT2G was significantly up-regulated in higher stages of the tumor as compared to low stage tumors (p = 0.017). Similarly, KMT2G levels were higher in the metastatic tumor (p = 0.027). Additionally, some of the KMT2G target genes were found to be up-regulated in metastatic tumors as compared to non-metastatic. ROC curve indicated KMT2G as a good marker for discriminating metastatic tumors from non-metastatic tumors (AUC = 0.738). Thus, we conclude that KMT2G histone methyltransferase could be a good prognostic marker for ccRCC. Additionally, KMT2G can also serve as a therapeutic target for ccRCC.

AB Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a member of the cold shock domain protein superfamily and is involved in development, environmental stresses and DNA oxidative damage in many organisms. However, the precise functions of YB-1 are still not well understood in various insects, including bees. In the current study, we identified a YB-1 gene in Apis cerana cerana (AccYB-1). The predicted cis-acting elements in the promoter sequence of AccYB-1 indicated its possible roles in development and stress responses. AccYB-1 expression was higher in one-day-old larvae and dark-eyed pupae than in other development stages. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that the mRNA level of AccYB-1 was higher in the thorax and midgut than in other tissues. The results from real-time PCR showed that AccYB-1 was induced by many environmental stresses. Silencing AccYB-1 downregulated the transcriptional level of some growth- and development-related genes and antioxidant genes and decreased the enzyme activities of several antioxidant-related enzymes, further indicating a possible function of AccYB-1 in growth, development and stress responses. Taken together, our findings suggest that AccYB-1 may play an indispensable role in growth and development and environmental stress responses in Apis cerana cerana. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the role of YB-1 in bees.

AB WIP (WASP interacting protein) together with N-WASP (neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) regulates actin polymerization that is crucial for invadopodia and filopodia formation. Recently, we reported the WIP interaction with ITSN1 which is highly implicated in endo-/exocytosis, apoptosis, mitogenic signaling and cytoskeleton rearrangements. Here we demonstrate that the WIP/ITSN1 complex is involved in the transferrin receptor recycling and partially co-localizes with a marker of the fast recycling endosomes, RAB4. Moreover, ITSN1 recruits WIP to RAB4-positive vesicles upon overexpression. Our data indicate that WIP enhances the interaction of N-WASP with ITSN1 and promotes ITSN1/beta-actin association. Moreover, the WIP/ITSN1-L complex facilitates formation of filopodia-like protrusions in MCF-7 cells. Thus, WIP/ITSN1 complex is involved in the cellular vesicle trafficking and actin-dependent membrane processes.

AB Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a pivotal cellular event in liver fibrosis. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular pathways that are involved in these processes is essential to generate new therapies for liver fibrosis. Greater knowledge of the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in liver fibrosis could improve understanding of the liver fibrosis pathogenesis. The aim of this review is to describe the present knowledge about the Wnt signaling pathway, which significantly participates in liver fibrosis and HSC activation, and look ahead on new perspectives of Wnt signaling pathway research. Moreover, we will discuss the different interactions with Wnt signaling pathway-regulated liver fibrosis. The Wnt signaling pathway modulates several important aspects of function, including cell proliferation, activation and differentiation. Targeting the Wnt signaling pathway can be a promising direction in liver fibrosis treatment. We discuss new perspectives of Wnt signaling pathway activation in liver fibrosis. For example, antagonist to Wnt and Wnt ligands could inhibit liver fibrosis by regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. These findings identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potentially important for therapeutic targets in liver fibrosis. Future studies are needed in order to find safer and more effective Wnt-based drugs.

AB Intrinsic host susceptibility to viral infections plays a major role in determining infection severity in different individuals. In human influenza virus infections, multiple genetic association studies have identified specific human gene variants that might contribute to enhanced susceptibility or resistance to influenza Recent studies suggested, the rs12252 T > C polymorphism in the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene might be associated with susceptibility to severe influenza. However, the studies reported conflicting and inconclusive results. To resolve the controversy, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the role of the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism in influenza susceptibility and severity, including twelve studies published before February 19, 2018 with a total 16,263 subjects (1836 influenza cases and 14,427 controls). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the strength of the association. Our results indicated increased risk of both severe and mild influenza in subjects carrying the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism in the allele contrast C vs. T: OR (severe) = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.23-2.33, P = 0.001, and OR (mild) = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.13-1.87, P = 0.004. Similar results were obtained in the homozygote comparison and dominant model. Stratified analyses by ethnicity revealed increased risk of severe influenza in both the White and East Asian populations, but significant association with mild influenza was found only in the White population. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests a significant association between the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism and the risk of influenza in both the White and East Asian populations.

AB Centromere protein I (CENPI),an important member of centromere protein family, has been suggest to serve as a oncogene in breast cancer, but the clinical significance and biological function of CENPI in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. In our results, we found CENPI was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cells, and associated with clinical stage, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and differentiation in CRC patients. However, there was no significant association between CENPI protein expression and overall survival time in colon cancer patients and rectal cancer patients through analyzing TCGA survival data. Moreover, CENPI mRNA and protein were increased in metastatic lymph nodes compared with primary CRC tissues. Down-regulation of CENPI expression suppresses CRC cell migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition process. In conclusion, CENPI is overexpressed in CRC and functions as oncogene in modulating CRC cell migration, invasion and EMT process.

AB Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignant neoplasm in teenagers and young adults. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) is considered as an oncogene in osteosarcoma. However, the mechanism of TUG1 in regulating osteosarcoma has not been fully understood. We aimed to investigate whether the metabolic alteration is involved in the effect of TUG1 on osteosarcoma cells. Herein, we found that TUG1 was overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells compared with the normal osteoblastic cell line. Knockdown of TUG1 inhibited glucose consumption, lactate production and cell viability of osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression of TUG1 induced cell viability, whereas the induction was attenuated by 2-DG. The aberrant expression of TUG1 markedly affected the expression of hexokinase-2 (HK2). Knockdown of HK2 weakened the effect of TUG1 overexpression on glycolysis in osteosarcoma cells. We concluded that glycolysis was involved in the effect of TUG1 on cell viability of osteosarcoma cells. HK2 might be an important molecule by which TUG1 affected the glycolysis.

AB This study included 161 patients: 92 patients had type 1 diabetes (T1D) while 69 patients had a combination of T1D and autoimmune thyroiditis, the so-called autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant (APS3v). Those patients, as well as 93 controls, were typed for HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 genes to assess their possible contribution to the development/protection of T1D with/without autoimmune thyroiditis. Both HLA-DRB1*04 and -DRB1*03 frequencies were significantly higher among T1D and APS3v patients than in controls. The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*11 and -DRB1*15 were lower among T1D patients, while HLA-DRB1*07 and -DRB1*11 occurred significantly less frequently among APS3v patients in comparison to controls. HLA-DQB1*03:01 and -DQB1*03:02 were associated with a higher risk of developing T1D and APS3v; HLA-DQB1*02 was significantly more present among APS3v patients while HLA-DQB1*03:03 was observed with a significantly lower frequency only among T1D patients. HLA-DRB1*03 similar to DQB1*02 and HLA-DRB1*04 similar to DQB1*03:02 were associated with both diseases. The higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*03/DRB1"03 among APS3v patients was the only significant difference in genotype frequency when compared to T1D patients, while high risk (HLA-DRB1*03/DRB1*04) and medium risk genotypes for T1D (HLA-DRB1*04/DRB1*04) occurred with similar frequencies in both patient groups. Although some of the results point toward shared genetic susceptibility of T1D and APS3v, observed differences in both susceptible/protective HLA profiles indicate the necessity of further studies in order to elucidate the pathogenesis of these diseases.

AB Beta-thalassemia (beta-thalassemia) is a globally genetic diseases, and is most prevalent in the Middle East, particularly in Iran. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are the best ways to managing it, and to prevent new community cases from emerging. We report on a simple method for rapid detection of the worst beta-thalassemia point mutation in Iran (IVS-II-1 G > A), using a nano-based ligation assay, this was performed using probes with labeled magnetic nanoparticles and quantum dots. After optimizing the technique, 50 DNA samples were genotyped with this method. We found a frequency of 72% for IVSII-1 (G(>)A) mutation (42% heterozygote, and 30% mutant homozygote) with a highly sensitive nano-based ligation genotyping system, offering excellent sensitivity and specificity for point mutation detection; it has been demonstrated to be inaccurate, sensitive, cost-effective, and rapid technique for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.

AB Background: Serum folate is important in clinical researches and DNA synthesis and methylation. Some loci and genes that are associated with folate levels had been detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such as rs1801133 in MTHFR and rs1979277 in SHMT1. Nevertheless, only a small part of variants has been clearly identified for serum folate. Hence, we conducted a GWAS to discover new inherited susceptibility and gene-environment interactions on serum folate concentration.
   Materials and methods: In a healthy Chinese population of 1999 men, genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmnil-Quad BeadChip. Serum folate levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), pathway enrichment analysis and statistical analysis were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Statistic Package for Social Science (SPSS).
   Results: We validated that rs1801133 in MTHFR was significantly involved in serum folate (P = 4.21 x 10(-19)). Surprisingly, we discovered three novel loci rs3782886, rs671, and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with folate serum folate levels in the male population studied (P = 2.17 x 10(-7), P = 3.60 x 10(-7), P = 3.99 x 10(-7), respectively) after adjusting for population stratification, BMI and age. Men with the AA genotype had significantly higher serum folate levels compared with men with the GG/AG genotype. But we found ALDH2 gene mutation no relation to part of environmental factors on serum folate levels.
   Conclusion: In a male Chinese population, genome-wide association study discovered that three novel SNPs rs3782886, rs671 and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with serum folate levels.

TI Characterization of expression and alternative splicing of the gene

AB Cadherin-like and PC-esterase domain containing 1 (CPED1) is an uncharacterized gene with no known function. Human genome wide association studies (GWAS) for bone mineral density (BMD) have repeatedly identified a significant locus on Chromosome 7 that contains the gene CPED1, but it remains unclear if this gene could be causative. While an open reading frame for this gene has been predicted, there has been no systematic exploration of expression or alternate splicing for CPED1 in humans or mice.Using mouse models, we demonstrate that Cped1 is alternately spliced whereby transcripts are generated with exon 3 or exons 16 and 17 removed. In calvarial-derived pre-osteoblasts, Cped1 utilizes the predicted promoter upstream of exon 1 as well as alternate promoters upstream of exon 3 and exon 12.Lastly, we have determined that some transcripts terminate at the end of exon 10 and therefore do not contain the cadherin like and the PC esterase domains.Together, these data suggest that multiple protein products may be produced by this gene, with some products either lacking or containing both the predicted functional domains. Our data provide a framework upon which future functional studies will be built to understand the role of this gene in bone biology.

AB Lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins are a family of carbohydrate-binding modules and are generally regarded as chitin- and peptidoglycan-binding proteins. In the present study, a novel LysM-containing protein, designated as ChLysM, was cloned and identified in a marine mollusk, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The full-length cDNA of ChLysM consists of 1129 bp, with an open reading frame of 861 bp encoding a 286 amino acid polypeptide. The deduced protein had a calculated molecular mass of 32.66 kDa and a pI of 8.16. SMART analysis indicated that ChLysM has one Lysin motif and a transmembrane region in the C-terminal residues. Tissue distribution analysis of ChLysM revealed high expression in gills and hemocytes. The upregulated transcripts of ChLysM in response to bacterial challenge suggest that ChLysM is involved in innate immunity against pathogen infection. The recombinant protein of ChLysM was found to bind to various kinds of peptidoglycans from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as binding strongly to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, ChLysM displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. haemolyticus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Vibrio alginolyticus). Collectively, these results indicate that ChLysM is a pattern recognition molecule with bacterial growth-inhibiting activity in immune defense of C. hongkongensis.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) is a sort of endogenous similar to 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs, and it can regulate a variety of biological events. We found the miR-378 may involve in regulating the muscle development of sheep during our previous research. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-378 regulating myoblast proliferation is still unclear. In this research, we predicted that BMP2 (Bone morphogenetic protein 2) was the target gene of miR-378 and the BMP-Smad signal pathway that BMP2 participated in playing an important role in the muscle development. Therefore, we tried to determine whether miR-378 influence myoblast proliferation of sheep through the BMP-Smad signal pathway. The results indicated that inhibit BMP-Smad signal pathway by interfering Smad4 to promote proliferation of sheep myoblasts; promote BMP-Smad signal pathway by interfering Smad7 to inhibit proliferation of sheep myoblasts; over-expression miR-378 promotes BMP-Smad signal pathway and myoblast proliferation in sheep; interfering miR-378 inhibits BMP-Smad signal pathway and myoblast proliferation in sheep. However, when both of which functioned at the myoblast, miR-378 could not fully depend on BMP-Smad signal pathway to regulate myoblast proliferation. In sum, both miR-378 and BMP-Smad can influence the proliferation of myoblast, but miR-378 does not target the 3' UTR of sheep BMP2.

AB Long-Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a class of non-coding endogenous RNAs contributing to numerous biological processes. LeERF1 is a tomato ethylene response factor (ERF) near the end of the ethylene signal transduction pathway. To identify lncRNAs in tomato and elucidate their roles in ethylene signaling, deep sequencing was deployed in over-expression and repression LeERF1 transgenic and control tomato fruits. A total of 397 lncRNAs were identified, including 169 tomato lncRNAs that had not previously been identified. Among these, 12 were differentially expressed between the transgenic and control tomato fruits. Numerous lncRNA target genes were identified including many associated with ethylene signaling including auxin response factors and auxin-induced proteins, F-box proteins, ERFs and MADS-box proteins. In addition, two lncRNAs were found to be the precursor of three miRNAs and four lncRNAs could be targeted by five miRNAs. We propose a regulatory model highlighting the relationships between lncRNAs and their targets involved in ethylene signal transduction which establishes a foundation for addressing the role of LncRNAs in ethylene response.

AB Ribosome: machinery in control of messenger RNA's (mRNAs) and several ribosomal proteins are in the small and large subunit of the ribosome. Various aspects of ribosomal proteins have related to cell growth, cell cycle, and diseases. Ribosomal protein L10A (RpL10A) in shrimp and fruit fly has been demonstrated to play a role in oogenesis. Interestingly, deletion RpL10A gene (RpL10Ab(-/-)) germ line clone of the fruit fly showed a loss of follicle cells surrounding the egg chamber, but nurse cells appeared normal. This phenotype is reminiscent of insulin receptor mutants (InR-/-). In contrast, over-expression of RpL10A in the eyes of the fruit flies resulted in abnormal ommatidia with a loss of red pigment in the center of the eyes. In this study, the abnormal rearrangements of nuclei and lack of cell membranes in those eyes were demonstrated. Furthermore, the expression of InR gene and the InR protein were extensively increased as determined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In addition, some insulin signaling mediators were also detected. The Akt and FOXO proteins were highly phosphorylated in the RpL10A over-expressed mutant. The results revealed that RpL10A induced over-expression of the insulin receptor and consequently activated in insulin signaling pathway which affects cell proliferation and we suggest RpL10A stimulates cell proliferation via the insulin signaling pathway.

AB Aims: This study was performed to investigate the effect of PD-L1 polymorphisms on the susceptibility and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese Han population.
   Methods: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PD-L1 gene, including rs2297136 (C > T), rs4143815 (C > G), rs2890658 (A > C) and rs17718883 (C > G) were examined in 225 HCC patients and 200 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
   Results: Data revealed that the rs2297136 (C > T) SNP TT (p = 0.03) and rs4143815 (C > G) SNP GG genotypes (p < 0.001) were associated with significantly increased risks of HCC. No association was found between rs2890658 (A > C) SNP and HCC risk and this risk was significantly decreased in individuals with the rs17718883 SNP CG + GG genotype (p < 0.001). The rs2297136 (C > T) SNP CC + CT genotypes, the rs4143815 (C > G) CC genotype and the rs2890658 (A > C) AA genotype were associated with increased overall survival compared to their counterpart allelic genotypes (p < 0.001). The rs2890658 (A > C) SNP had no impact on the risk and prognosis of HCC (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that three functional polymorphisms (rs2297136, rs4143815 and rs17718883) of the PD-L1 gene were associated with HCC risk and prognosis, suggesting that genetic variants of PD-L1 polymorphisms might be a possible prognostic marker for the prediction of HCC risk and development. Validation by a larger prospective study from a more diverse ethnic population is needed to confirm these findings.

AB Gene therapy has the potential for treating retinal diseases, and we have been developing delivery vehicles and expression vectors for this purpose. In this short communication, we describe the generation of tools for both in vitro studies of the disease mechanism and for in vivo testing of therapeutic approaches. We have cloned the PDE6 beta gene and also recreated the same mutation present in the rd10 mouse using an optimized plasmid vector. To allow visual detection, we have also generated, through site-directed mutagenesis, plasmids expressing the normal and mutated PDE6 beta gene fused with the GFP gene. Next, we have transfected retinal pigment epithelium cells with the different vectors and detected the protein expression of both the normal and mutated PDE6 beta. With this work we have created gene therapy tools for in vitro and in vivo studies of retinal disease-causing mutations, namely for the PDE6 beta, implicated in retinitis pigmentosa.

AB With the isolation and identification of efficient azo-dye degradation bacteria, bioaugmentation with specific microbial strains has now become an effective strategy to promote the bioremediation of azo dye. However, Azo dye wastewater discharged at high temperature restricted the extensive application of the known mesophilic azoreducing microorganisms. Here we present the complete genome sequence of a bacterium capable of reducing azo dye under thermophilic condition, Novibacillus thermophiles SG-1 (=KCTC 33118(T) =CGMCC 1.12363(T)). The complete genome of strain SG-1 contains a circular chromosome of 3,629,225 bp with a G + C content of 50.44%. Genome analysis revealed that strain SG-1 possessed genes encoding riboflavin biosynthesis protein that would secrete riboflavin, which could act as electron shuttles to transport the electrons to extracellular azo dye in decolorization process. HPLC analysis showed that the concentration of riboflavin increased from 0.01 mu M to 0.255 mu M with the growth of strain SG-1 under azo dye reduction. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis further demonstrated that the gene encoding riboflavin biosynthesis protein would be involved in the azo dye decolorization. The results from this study would be beneficial to research the mechanism of anaerobic reduction of azo dye under thermophilic conditions.

AB Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Since tumor cells exhibit low immunogenicity and can induce several mechanisms of tolerance, the use of monoclonal antibodies or other immunomodulators, targeting costimulation of T cells may mediate the inhibition of immunosuppressive mechanisms, favouring immune surveillance and enhancing the detection and elimination of tumor cells. We developed a new in vitro assay, based on flow cytometry, which allows exploring the therapeutic potential of tumor-derived immunomodulatory lineages, enhancing anti-tumor response. We generated tumor-derived cells that simultaneously co-express eGFP and one immunomodulatory molecule (OX40L, 4-1BBL or GM-CSF). These genetically modified tumor-derived cells are irradiated and then incubated with primary T cells to evaluate the killing activity, which can be estimated by a decrease in the eGFP positive cells. The results have shown correlation with in vivo experiments. This model may contribute to the development of high-throughput assays for the screening of immunomodulators and a reduction in the use of experimental animals.

AB The eukaryotic microorganism Ustilago maydis is currently being developed as an alternative protein expression platform. Protein fusion with an unconventionally secreted chitinase mediates export of heterologous proteins. The unique feature of this pathway is the circumvention of N-glycosylation. Different heterologous proteins could already be secreted via this novel mechanism in their active state. However, the system still suffers from low yields mainly attributed to the degradation of exported recombinant proteins by proteases. Here, we combined optimization steps on the level of cultivation conditions and strain engineering to further improve the system. Using the Respiration Activity Monitoring System we discovered that a pH drop during prolonged incubation results in loss of activity and degradation of the target protein. This problem can be reduced by buffering the cultivation medium. However, we still observed significant proteolysis even in buffered cultures. Hence, we revisited strain engineering to reduce the proteolytic activity. Secreted proteases were discovered using mass spectrometry. Then, genes for three identified proteases of a serine-carboxypeptidase family were deleted in an existing quintuple protease deletion mutant. This further diminished proteolytic activity and target protein degradation. The two approaches overall strongly improved the stability of heterologous proteins in this fungal system.

AB Optically pure hydroxy amino acids show several bioactivities and are valuable building blocks for the pharmaceutical industry. Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation or sulfoxidation of L-amino acids with high regio- and stereoselectivity. While several beta-and gamma-specific enzymes have been described, only one delta-specific hydroxylase has been reported so far. Based on its similarity to the known L-leucine 5-hydroxylase from Nostoc punctiforme, an open reading frame from the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis was identified as putative L-leucine dioxygenase (AvLDO). Here we report the cloning and characterization of this dioxygenase. The enzyme showed a high preference for acidic conditions and moderate reaction temperatures. AvLDO catalyzed the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of several aliphatic amino acids in delta-position. In case of the sulfoxidation of L-methionine, AvLDO produced the opposite diastereomer than isoleucine dioxygenase. AvLDO is thus an interesting addition to the toolbox of Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. On the genomic DNA of Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, the avldo gene is located on a gene cluster involved (2S,4S)-4-methylproline biosynthesis, which is contained in bioactive peptides often found from cyanobacteria. This fact suggests the metabolic functional role of this amino acid dioxygenase in cyanobacteria.

Here we describe the design, assembly and performance of a novel flow-through device with immobilized genetically modified yeast cells that produce a fluorescent protein upon stimulation with diclofenac whose intensity is then detected by fluorescence microscopy. Although other devices employing immobilized cells for the detection of various analytes have already been described before, as novelty our system allows safe enclosure of the sensor cells, and thus, to obtain fluorescent signals that are not falsified by a loss of cells. Furthermore, the yeast cells are prevented from being released into the environment. Despite the safe containment, the immobilized reporter cells are accessible to nutrients and analytes. They thus have both the ability to grow and respond to the analyte. Both in cell culture medium and standardized synthetic wastewater, we are able to differentiate between diclofenac concentrations in a range from 10 to 100 mu M. As particularly interesting feature, we show that only the biologically active fraction of diclofenac is detected. Nowadays, contamination of wastewater with diclofenac and other pharmaceutical residues is becoming a severe problem. Our investigations may pave the way for an easy-to-use and cost-efficient wastewater monitoring method.

AB VEGF165b has been shown to be an effective anti-cancer agent; however, its short half-life limits further application in the clinical field. The development of a mutant VEGF165b with a prolonged half-life is urgently needed for its future application. A mutant VEGF165b was generated by inactivation of its plasmin cleavage site. The mutant and native VEGF165b proteins without purification tags were expressed via the Pichia pastoris expression system followed by purification with a HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography column through optimization of the purification conditions. Furthermore, its binding affinity with VEGF Receptors and its functions in vitro and in vivo were examined. Results showed that the half-life of mutant VEGF165b increased to approximately 10 times (Intravenous), 9.1 times (Intraperitoneal) and 5.4 times (Subcutaneous) greater than that of VEGF165b, and the mutation did not cause significant alteration of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 binding affinity. Mutant VEGF165b inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs in vitro, similar to the native VEGF165b. In a mouse melanoma model, mutant VEGF165b exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity in comparison with its native counterpart. These results indicate that the mutant VEGF165b had a prolonged half-life and retained the anti-angiogenic activity of the native VEGF165b, suggesting that this novel mutant VEGF165b may be a stronger anti-cancer agent.

AB The outdoor production of marine microalgae biomass in pilot scale flat panels photobioreactors, under not sterile conditions and using centrate as nutrients source, was studied. Experiments were performed modifying the centrate percentage, dilution rate and orientation of the photobioreactors. The strain Geitlerinema sp. was that one prevailing independently of the culture conditions. The higher productivity of 47.7 g(biomass)m(-2).day(-1) dry weight and photosynthetic efficiency of 2.8%, was achieved when using 20% centrate and a dilution rate of 0.3 day(-1), whatever the orientation of the reactor, maximal nutrient removal capacities of 82%, 85% and 100% for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus being obtained. Under non-optimal conditions up to 80% of the nitrogen and 60% of the phosphorus were lost by stripping and precipitation, respectively. Carbohydrates was the major component of the biomass followed by proteins and lipids. These results support the possibility to produce microalgae biomass below 0.59 (sic)/kg, useful to produce biofertilizers and animal feed.

AB To this date, a number of different Gypsophila species from the family of Caryophyllaceae were phytochemically characterized and tested for diverse pharmacological effects. With Gypsophila elegans M. Bieb., we investigated a scarcely explored Gypsophila species, providing a number of potential transfection enhancing triterpene saponins, and so-called sapofection agents. So far triterpene saponins have not been isolated in Gypsophila elegans M. Bieb. Crude extracts from roots and seeds, as well as each purification step were tested for delivery modulation of gene-loaded nanoplexes into neuroblastoma cells. The application of the bioassay guided isolation strategy enabled the assessment of the most active Gypsophila compound, the bisdesmosidic triterpene saponin gypsophilosid A. Gypsophilosid A was isolated by chromatographic techniques, and characterized by electro-spray mass spectrometry and intense NMR-spectroscopy, using a variety of 1D and 2D-NMR experiments such as HSQC, HMBC, HQQC, TOCSY and NOESY. In neuroblastoma cells, gypsophilosid A increased the transfection efficiency of gene-nanoplexes up to 80% compared to 2% in the control group without saponin. Our results proved the successful applicability of the implemented methods to detect, isolate and identify saponins, which are biochemically active in terms of transfection.

AB Carbide slag is an industrial waste generated from ethylene gas production in chlor-alkali plants. Here, a novel system coupling calcium looping and CaO/Ca(OH)(2) thermochemical heat storage using carbide slag were proposed to simultaneously capture CO2 and store heat. For CaO/Ca(OH)(2) thermochemical heat storage, the hydration/dehydration performance of original carbide slag and carbide slag that experienced calcium looping cycles for CO2 capture was investigated. The performances of the two types of carbide slag with and without chlorine were compared. The dehydration conversions of carbide slag improved with the increase of dehydration temperature. The chlorine content has no apparent effect on the hydration/dehydration performance of original carbide slag. However, for CO2 capture, carbide slag with high chlorine content shows lower carbonation conversion than that of carbide slag without chlorine. The hydration/dehydration conversions of carbide slag that experienced CO2 capture cycles are lower than those of original carbide slag. For carbide slag with chlorine, the hydration conversion can be improved by more than one CO2 capture cycle. Therefore, carbide slag that experienced various CO2 capture cycles is still suitable to be used in CaO/Ca(OH)(2) thermochemical heat storage although calcium looping has an adverse effect on the hydration/dehydration performance of carbide slag.

AB The assessment of wind energy potential at sites of interest requires reliable estimates of the statistical characteristics of wind speed. A probability density function (pdf) is usually fitted to short-term observed local wind speed data. It is common for wind speed data to present bimodal distributions for which conventional one-component pdfs are not appropriate. Mixture distributions represent an appropriate alternative to model such wind speed data. Homogeneous mixture distributions remain rarely used in the field of wind energy assessment while heterogeneous mixture models have only been developed recently. The present work aims to investigate the potential of homogeneous and heterogeneous mixture distributions to model wind speed data in a northern environment. A total of ten two-component mixture models including mixtures of gamma, Weibull, Gumbel and truncated normal are evaluated in the present study. The estimation of the parameter of the mixture models are obtained with the least-squares (LS) and the maximum likelihood (ML) methods. The optimization of the objective functions related to these estimation methods is carried out with a genetic algorithm that is more adapted to mixture distributions. The case study of the province of Quebec (Canada), a Northern region with an enormous potential for wind energy production, is investigated in the present work. A total of 83 stations with long data records and providing a good coverage of the territory of the province are selected. To identify the most appropriate one-component distribution for the selected stations, the newly proposed method of L-moment ratio diagram (MRD) is used. The advantages of this approach are that it is simple to apply and it allows an easy comparison of the fit of several pdfs for several stations on a single diagram. One-component distributions are compared with the selected mixture distributions based on model selection criteria. Results show that mixture distributions often provide better fit than conventional one-component distributions for the study area. It was also observed that the ML method outperforms the LS method and that the mixture model combining two Gumbel distributions using ML is the overall best model.

AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system is one of the important technologies for waste heat utilization with mid-to-low temperatures. Compared to the steam Rankine cycle (SRC) system, the fluctuation of the condensation temperature due to seasonal and meteorological factors has a more significant effect on the performance of ORC systems since the temperature difference between evaporation and condensation is relatively smaller. In this paper, supercritical ORC thermodynamic models under design and off-design conditions are established. The condenser is divided into pre-cooling section and condensation section. The simulation results show that the net output power and thermal efficiency decrease with the rise of cooling water inlet temperature in the condenser. It is found that the effect of higher and lower cooling water inlet temperature compared to the design condition on the system performance is asymmetric. In addition, considering the meteorological parameters, the optimal design condensation temperatures of ORC system in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are about 30-34 degrees C, 34-38 degrees C and 38-42 degrees C individually. Present results on the suitable design condensation temperature can provide reference for the practical application and optimization of ORC systems.

AB An updated model of the solar spectrum splitting photovoltaic cell-thermoelectric generator system is used to derive the analytical expression of the systemic efficiency. The cutoff energy of the system, cell voltage, and dimensionless current of the thermoelectric generator are optimized. Particularly, the influences of the area ratio of the collector to photovoltaic cell on the performance of the spectrum splitting system are discussed in detail. The maximum efficiencies of the spectrum splitting system are calculated for given solar concentration factors. The results obtained are compared with those of the single photovoltaic cell with the same solar concentration factor. It is found that the maximum efficiency of the system can be further improved when the area ratio is optimized. The expressions of the upper and lower bounds of the optimized area ratio are derived. The spectrum splitting system can more efficiently harvest the full solar spectrum than the single photovoltaic cell, especially at low solar concentration factors. For example, when solar concentration factors are, respectively, equal to 30 and 100, the maximum efficiencies of the spectrum splitting system attain 39.5% and 40.2% and increase approximately 2.67% and 2.19%, compared to those of the single photovoltaic cell.

AB Savonius water turbine is a popular turbine that can be used for energy extraction from free stream flows in rivers or manmade channels and also from tidal and ocean currents. The present study aims at developing a new combined lift-drag (CLD) based blade design for a conventional two-bladed Savonius water turbine. The semicircular blade is replaced with a straight blade section starting from the turbine axis and ending with an airfoil blade section at the leading edge. The blade lengths are adjusted within the overall diameter of an established conventional Savonius water turbine, taken from available literature. This innovative design is considered as the base model. The base model is then gradually modified and optimized using ANSYS Fluent 14 CFD software by considering design parameters - gap width ratio and overlap ratio. The evolved optimal design is then further studied for two more turbine diameters, one of which is taken from another prominent literature. All the performance analyses are carried out through flow physics study of the turbines. It has been found that the maximum coefficient of power (C-p) obtained for the CLD Savonius turbine is 0.284 obtained at a tip speed ratio 0.6 for an overall turbine diameter 260 mm, gap width ratio 8.45%, and overlap ratio 46.9%. The contributions of the individual blade sections on the CLD turbine performance have also been appreciated. Finally, the CLD design is compared with an established Savonius turbine design to highlight the significant importance of the present design.

AB The aim of this study is to enhance the performance of a geothermal-based organic Rankine cycle by proposing two novel systems in which some part of the waste heat is recovered employing thermoelectric generator for power and/or hydrogen production (using proton exchange membrane electrolyzer). Accordingly, two novel systems are proposed and analyzed along with the basic organic Rankine cycle (configuration (a)). In the first proposed system, some part of the waste heat is recovered by employing thermoelectric generator (configuration (b)), while in the second one the additional power generated by thermoelectric generator is used in the proton exchange membrane electrolyzer for hydrogen production (configuration (c)). The performances of the proposed systems are investigated and compared with that of the basic cycle from energy, exergy and exergoeconomic viewpoints and are optimized using genetic algorithm via a multi-objective optimization strategy. The results indicate that, at the best solution point obtained from multi-objective optimization, the exergy efficiencies of the proposed systems (configurations (b) and (c)) are higher than that of the basic organic Rankine cycle by 21.9% and 12.7%, respectively. Furthermore, another interesting result is found which reveals that the specific product cost for the proposed configurations (b) and (c) is lower than that for the basic organic Rankine cycle, despite the higher total cost rate for the proposed configurations.

AB The replacement of coals by less environmentally hazardous coal-water slurries with and without petrochemicals is often discussed with an emphasis on quite a long list of advantages of composite fuels. In this research, we perform a compound analysis of the main prospects of switching from coal to slurries containing coal and oil processing waste. The main focus is on comparing a group of parameters to produce the same amount of heat from the combustion of coals and high-potential fuels. The compound analysis includes fuel consumption, the most hazardous anthropogenic emissions (sulfur and nitrogen oxides), the mass of the ash residue, the cost of components as well as their properties and concentrations. The numerical values of the relative efficiency factor of fuels based on municipal and industrial wastes vary in a wide range from 2 to 165. The best results are shown by the slurries based on flotation wastes (filter cakes) of coking and nonbaking coals (ranks C and N). For them, the aggregated criterion indicators are 70-90% higher than for the respective coals. A forecast has been made on the amount of energy that can be generated using fuels from wastes. According to our forecast, the waste-based fuels under study may be used to generate 773 TWh of energy annually.

AB In this paper, we report a hybrid generator to harness energy from low-frequency ambient vibrations. The generator is designed with a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) patch, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) patch, a spring-mass system and an amplitude limiter. The spring-mass system receives energy from excitations and applies forces to the piezoelectric element and the triboelectric layers. The unique amplitude limiter is deliberately introduced into the system, not only achieving the desired frequency up-conversion effect, but also boosting the voltage responses significantly. The limiter also causes hardening nonlinearity and dynamic bifurcation triggering superharmonic resonance so that the generator resonates at a frequency of about 3 Hz. Furthermore, the proposed PEH adopts the strong compressive operation mode, and employs a truss mechanism to effectively amplify the impact forces. In experiments, open-circuit voltages are 58.4 V from PEH and 60 V from TENG under an excitation of 1.0 g at resonance. The hybridized generator is capable of achieving a maximum power of 19.6 mW from the two sources with matched impedances. The working bandwidths of the PEH and the TENG reach up to 5.39 Hz and 7.25 Hz, respectively, out of our targeted frequency domain [2.5 Hz, 10 Hz] due to the multiple resonances and nonlinearity. In the applications to charge capacitors, the high saturation voltage and relatively short charging time validate the effectiveness of our power management technique. Furthermore, the generator proves to be able to effectively scavenge energy from human body motions and charge a capacitor of 4.7 mu F to 7.6 V in around 50 s, which indicates a great potential of practical applications in wearable devices.

AB Global hydropower growth continues to accelerate with 25% of total capacity installed in just the last 10 years. This accelerating expansion and the important storage facility hydropower means it is increasingly important to understand the reasons for operational failures. This is a challenge because the major reason for failures involves the complex interaction of hydraulic, mechanical and electric subsystems. Historically, reliability modelling has been split in two directions, focusing on different sub-systems, and has not yet been unified. Here these approaches are unified with a novel expression of unbalanced forces. This model with operational data are validated and the important modes of oscillation in the shaft are identified. Finally, the mechanism of the first-order oscillation mode exciting a second-order mode is presented. This integrated and accurate mathematical model is a major advance in the diagnosis and prediction of failures in hydropower operation.

AB Metal hydride (MH) is an attractive alternative for thermochemical heat storage. This study proposes an optimal design methodology for MH heat storage reactors (MHHSRs), integrating the optimal design principle (ODP) and a new design procedure. Based on the optimal design methodology, the design of the powder bed with helical heat transfer fluid (HTF) tube is conducted via numerical simulation. A mathematical model is established for the thermal coupling between the powder bed and the HTF tube. The gravimetric exergy-output rate (GEOR) is adopted to evaluate the overall discharging performance. First, the helical HTF tube is optimized and improved based on the ODP, which increase the GEOR from 198.4 to 255.4 W kg(-1). The optimal helical diameter is 30 mm and the optimal improved structure is determined as a U-shaped double helical tube. Then, the structural improvement of the reaction bed is supplemented, achieving reductions of material and energy consumption by 12.2% and 11%, respectively. The final design of the powder bed with helical tube based on optimal design methodology improves the GEOR from 198.4 to 306.1 W kg(-1), which constitutes a significant increase of 54.3%. This optimal design methodology is validated and efficiently guides the design of advanced MHHSRs.

AB A three dimensional (CFD) model is applied to investigate the effect of geometry designs and dimensions of the flow field on the performance of PEM fuel cells with an area of 5.1 x 5.1 cm(2) and composed of 25 channels. Three designs including serpentine, interdigitated and parallel with six channel to rib width ratios defined as (eta = channel width/rib width) have been analyzed. In order to keep the area of the cell and number of channels constant, when the width of the channel increases the width of the ribs decreases and vice versa for a comparative purpose. At high operating voltage, the geometric designs and channel to rib width ratios have little influence on cell performance while at low operating voltage, it affects considerably the cell performance. The PEM fuel cell with serpentine designs has better performance. It increases by 4.6% and 39.1% compared to interdigitated and parallel, respectively. Moreover, decreasing channel width and increasing rib width improve cell performance. It increases up to 120% for serpentine, 45% for interdigitated and 23% for parallel when channel to rib width ratio decreases from 2.66 to 0.25. The local transport phenomena have been also analyzed. The pressure drop and under rib convection increase with decreasing channel to rib width ratio, which results in high reactants speed under the ribs and more homogenous local transport phenomena in the catalysts layer; enhancing the net power density.

AB In this study, biochar was produced by co-pyrolysis of bio-oil distillation residue and bituminous coal under different induction temperature and gas flow rate in a tube furnace. Central composite design was introduced to explore the combined effects of experimental conditions on biochar. The physicochemical properties of biochar from different induction conditions were comprehensively evaluated by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy based on response surface methodology. The results showed that bituminous coal was beneficial to the increase in biochar yield, whereas temperature had the opposite effect and the effect of gas flow rate was not obvious. Moreover, C/O ratio increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and bio-oil distillation residue in feedstocks, while C/H ratio increased only with increasing temperature. Gas flow rate had a more pronounced descent effect on C/H compared with C/O. In addition, induction conditions caused a relative weakening of C=C stretching vibration and the relative enrichment of C-H in biochar. Bituminous coal, temperature and gas flow rate all contributed to the conversion of small aromatic rings of biochar to large aromatic rings during the co-pyrolysis process.

AB The energy storage in buildings is a significant means for an optimal management of thermal energy. The use of phase change materials in a building envelope can improve heat storage capacity and the thermal behavior of the wall. However, the small thermal conductivity of the phase change materials slows down the process of heat absorption and release. The present study suggests a new technical solution for improvement of thermal behavior of a phase change material plasterboards. It consists of perforating the panel with several small holes yielding a greater contact surface area with the surrounding air. This passive enhancement technique is implemented experimentally and numerically to check its performance. Results show that the perforated panels produces an augmentation in heat absorption and release. The average increase was 100% for heat absorption and 175% for heat release as compared to a standard panel without holes. In addition, a perforated panel with a given thickness can absorb heat as much as a standard panel three to four times thicker. Furthermore, it was found that the absorbed and released heat flux values have a direct relationship with the ratio of the panel thickness to the holes spacing.

AB In the current research, a gas turbine fueled by natural gas and integrated with the reversed Brayton cycle for cooling the intake air then evaporation was studied. The performance of the proposed cycle was assessed theoretically from energetic and environmental aspects. To achieve this, first a validation study has been performed based on temperature and emission analysis of a gas turbine model. Second, detailed energy analysis was conducted to identify the causes and locations of thermodynamic imperfection in terms of 1st and 2nd law efficiencies. Third, analytical relations for the theoretical measurement of two key emissions namely; Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxides were studied and applied. The effects of important influencing parameters such as the ambient temperature, ambient relative humidity, extracted mass rate and equivalence ratio on energy and environmental performance of the cycle was investigated. It was found that the proposed gas turbine cycle can bring down the emission levels to the regulatory standards (less than 35 ppm). It was also able to increase the power output by 31% with a slight drop in its efficiency. Therefore, the results of this research may be used to determine the range of operating parameters at which the gas turbine could be operated which can provide a considerable reduction in the emissions while maintaining a higher performance.

AB Liquefied natural gas releases large amounts of cold energy during the conventional regasification process. Currently, most studies have investigated the opportunities to utilize this waste cold for power cycles but few studies considered using this cold directly on other cold applications. In this paper, different cold recovery approaches are considered and compared depending on the energy carriers (i.e. electricity, liquid carbon dioxide, chilled water, liquid air/nitrogen and latent heat storage) used to support a few cold applications (i.e. air separation units, dry ice production, freezing and district cooling). Using different transportation methods, these energy carriers produced using the recovered cold as part or all of their energy input is coupled to these cold applications with different temperature requirements and located 5 km away from the regasification facilities. This paper investigates the change in overall exergy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions throughout the whole process from energy carrier generation to their consumption in the cold applications when the cold applications are coupled to different alternative energy carriers, compared with the baseline case. With the availability of these alternative energy carriers, conventional cold applications can be modified to reduce their dependency on electricity and improve their performance. The baseline setup has an overall exergy efficiency of approximate to 13% while using electricity generated by waste cold assisted power cycles as energy carrier yields overall exergy efficiency of approximate to 13.2%. Using alternative energy carriers charged with recovered cold, such as liquid carbon dioxide/water, latent heat thermal storage and liquid nitrogen, yields lower overall exergy efficiencies of approximate to 9.7%, 11.5% and 10.2%, respectively which is largely due to the temperature mismatch and thus large amount of exergy destructions during the heat exchange process. For the carbon dioxide emissions analysis, the baseline setup yields carbon dioxide emissions of approximate to 22.3 kTPA. Using electricity generated with waste cold assisted power cycle yields improvement on carbon dioxide emissions of approximate to 18.3% while those using alternative energy carriers yield improvements on carbon dioxide emissions of approximate to 38.0%, approximate to 37.0% and approximate to 6.0%, respectively.

AB With exhausting fossil fuels and increasing demand for heating and cooling, the effective utilization of renewable and waste energy sources becomes of increasing importance. Adsorption cooling driven by low temperature heat is an energy and environment saving alternative to the common compression systems. The performance of adsorption chillers strongly depends on the compliance of the adsorbent properties with the cycle operating conditions. In this paper, the comprehensive study of equilibrium and dynamics of water adsorption on a new efficient adsorbent of water vapour MOF-801 is performed to evaluate its feasibility for adsorption cooling. It was shown that at the adsorption temperature of 30 degrees C the MOF-801 provides the cooling effect at the evaporation temperature as low as 5 degrees C that indicates significant affinity to water vapour. On the other hand, it can be regenerated by low temperature heat at 80-85 degrees C. The uptake variation under the conditions of a typical adsorption cooling cycle reaches 0.21 g/g. Water adsorption on loose grains of MOF-801 occurs under grain-size insensitive mode when the adsorption rate is proportional to the (S/m)-ratio of the heat transfer surface S to the adsorbent mass m. The Specific Cooling Power equal to 2 kW/kg is measured at S/m = 6 m(2)/kg and 80% of reaching the equilibrium conversion, which is of high practical interest. Thus, the results obtained demonstrate the high potential of the working pair "MOF-801 - water" for adsorption cooling.

AB The majority of the available wind turbine emulators (WTEs) utilize the detailed electrical sub-systems, whereas the simplified models are considered for the other aspects. However, wind turbines (WTs) are complicated systems with different aspects that should be appropriately modeled for a realistic assessment. This paper presents a new wind turbine emulator which considers aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical aspects of the WTs. Some tests are performed to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of the emulator; then, the proposed emulator is used to analyze the tower shadow and yaw error effects which can produce power fluctuations and fatigue loads. In addition to tower shadow effect, the yaw error which has a more severe effect is studied in this paper considering the mechanical dynamics of the WT which were not considered in literature. The proposed emulator utilizes the AeroDyn and FAST software tools to model the aerodynamic and mechanical aspects of a WT considering the real electrical sub-systems. Moreover, the tower shadow and yaw error effects are modeled in simulation and the results are compared with the emulation results. The electrical sub-systems are modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink for simulation, whereas the real mechanically coupled induction motor-induction generator set is used for the emulator.

AB Parameter extraction of solar photovoltaic (PV) models is a typical complex nonlinear multivariable strongly coupled optimization problem. In this paper, an improved whale optimization algorithm (WOA), referred to as IWOA, is proposed to accurately extract the parameters of different PV models. The original WOA has good local exploitation ability, but it is likely to stagnate and suffer from premature convergence when dealing with complex multimodal problems. To conquer this concerning shortcoming, IWOA develops two prey searching strategies to effectively balance the local exploitation and global exploration, and thereby enhance the performance of WOA. Three benchmark test PV models including single diode, double diode and PV module models, and two practical PV power station models with more modules in the Guizhou Power Grid of China are employed to verify the performance of IWOA. The experimental and comparison results comprehensively demonstrate that IWOA is significantly better than the original WOA and three advanced variants of WOA, and is also highly competitive with the reported results of some recently-developed parameter extraction methods.

AB The increasing environmental concerns and the significant growth of the waste to energy market calls for innovative and flexible technology that can effectively process and convert municipal solid waste into fuels and power at high efficiencies. To ensure the technical and economic feasibility of new technology, a sound understanding of the characteristics of the integrated energy system is essential. In this work, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a waste to power and heat plant based on integrated intermediate pyrolysis and CHP (Pyro-CHP) system was performed. The overall plant CHP efficiency was found to be nearly 60% defined as heat and power output compared to feedstock fuel input. By using an established economic evaluation model, the capital investment of a 5 tonne per hour plant was calculated to be 27.64 pound million and the Levelised Cost of Electricity was 0.063 pound/kWh. This agrees the range of cost given by the UK government. To maximise project viability, technology developers should endeavour to seek ways to reduce the energy production cost. Particular attention should be given to the factors with the greatest influence on the profitability, such as feedstock cost (or gate fee for waste), maintaining plant availability, improving energy productivity and reducing capital cost.

AB Condensation of water vapor available in atmospheric air can be considered as a solution for water scarcity problem. In this paper, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of water production from humid air using thermoelectric coolers (TECs) is presented. The system consists of a number of thermoelectric coolers, a fan to supply the required air flow circulation, two cold and hot air channels, heat sinks and solar cells for powering the thermoelectric coolers and fan. Effects of various design parameters are investigated and discussed. The proposed design is optimized to get the maximum effectiveness which is defined as the amount of produced water per unit of energy consumption. Sensitivity analysis is used to find the optimum number of TECs, length of the channels and performance of the system at different temperatures. The resulting system is capable of producing 26 ml of water within 1 h from the air with 75% relative humidity and the temperature of 318 K by consuming only 20 W of electrical power. In addition, the annual performance and optimization of this device in three southern cities of Iran are presented based on hourly meteorological data. Finally, comparison of the present system with other air water generators indicates that the proposed design is the most energy efficient system among similar devices especially in high relative humidity.

AB As one of attractive technology of energy conservation, combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system has brought about widespread attention. However, the variability of users demand has limited the application of CCHP system. To ensure stable and efficient operation, the compressed air energy storage is considered to be integrated with CCHP system. A grid-connected CCHP system with compressed air energy storage (CAES) and hybrid refrigeration is proposed in this paper. The power from grid is stored in CAES at off-peak time and released at on-peak time. The hybrid refrigeration system including LiBr absorption chiller and electric compression refrigerator provides cooling load to users. A multi-objective assessment and optimization synthetically considering energy, economy and environment are presented. The multi-objective indicator used as objective function to optimize each component capacity of the proposed CCHP system. A sensitive analysis of key parameters and performance comparison with conventional CCHP system have been carried out. The results shows that when the capacity of gas turbine is 691 kW, the comprehensive performance of the proposed CCHP system is the optimal performance. The power price, natural gas price, compression ratio and turbine inlet temperature of CAES have great influence on the performance of the proposed CCHP system. Meanwhile, the multi-objective indicator's value of the proposed CCHP system is more than conventional CCHP system 4.85%.

AB Cell interaction is the main factor resulting in a shorter lifespan for multi-cell stacks than for a single fuel cell stack. To explain this mechanism, we propose a cell interaction phenomenon in which one cell experiences fuel starvation. A specific voltage distribution along the straight channel direction has been observed with an innovative multi-point monitoring method. This phenomenon also can be used for fuel starvation diagnosis. This study proposes an ingenious simplified two-chamber model to analyze the current and voltage redistribution mechanism under fuel starvation. The reliability of this model has been validated in this paper. The model shows that current convergence resulted by fuel starvation in one cell can lead to a concomitant local current convergence in nearby normal cells. Based on our calculation, > 85% of reaction current concentrates in the anode inlet region of the fuel-starved cell, resulting in a 70% current convergence in the two adjacent normal cells. A serious corrosion of the fuel-starved cell is observed in the post-mortem study. The faulty cell presents a 5 degrees contact angle decrease and a 28% ECSA loss. Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy results show that the decline of anode outlet regions' cathode catalyst layers are more serious. Some optimal strategies have been proposed to solve this problem.

AB This paper proposes a distributed energy management system-based algorithm to solve the optimal schedule of multiple combined heat and power systems in which exponential efficiencies of fuel cells are considered. To deal with the variation in fuel cell efficiencies, the proposed algorithm utilizes the alternating direction method of multipliers, consensus theory, and quadratic programming to solve the optimization problem with constant efficiencies. Then, the efficiency matching is checked iteratively to verify the obtained result. The optimization algorithm is constructed in a whole-day distributed form, such that all time slot variables can be solved simultaneously in a distributed way. With the help of this simultaneous solution method, operation of hot tanks and combined heat and power systems can be scheduled globally. The proposed algorithm is tested successfully with a test system having 4 combined heat and power systems, showing fast convergence in numerous simulations.

AB To comprehensively understand the impact of calcium looping (CaL) technology on a co-gasification of torrefied biomass and coal power plant, two kinds of proposed configurations (pre- and post-CaL), including a co-gasification system, a CaL system, and a combined heat and power system, are studied and compared with each other in the present work. In the CaL process, the kinetic modeling of the carbonation reaction and CaO sorption-enhanced water gas shift (SE-WGS) reaction are developed in a fast fluidized bed reactor (carbonator) to predict the performance of hydrogen production and CO2 capture. The influences of torrefied biomass blending ratios (BRs) and CaO to fuel mass flow rate ratios (CaO/F) on various performance indicators such as hydrogen enhancement factor, hydrogen thermal efficiency (HTE), CO2 capture efficiency, specific CO2 emissions, and overall system efficiency are evaluated. A comparison of pre- and post-CaL schemes reveals that the SE-WGS reaction has a markedly profound effect on the former, causing the hydrogen production and HTE to be higher than those in the latter, whereas the latter is much more conducive to CO2 capture and specific CO2 emissions. Under optimal operating conditions (BR = 40 wt%, CaO/F = 3.5), the values of CO2 capture efficiency and overall system efficiency of both schemes are higher than 90% and 50%, respectively. Overall, the pre-CaL case is suitable to design as a highly efficient co-generation of hydrogen production and electricity plant with low CO(2 )emissions, whereas the post-CaL case is recommended for a co-gasification power plant with nearly zero CO2 emissions.

AB The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is regarded as one of the most promising waste heat recovery technologies for electricity generation engines. Since the engine usually operates under different working conditions, it is important to research the part-load performance of the ORC. In order to reveal the effect factors of part-load performance, four different forms of ORCs are compared in the study with dynamic math models established in SIMULINK. They are the ORC applying low temperature working fluid R245fa with a medium heat transfer cycle, the ORCs with high temperature working fluid toluene heated directly by exhaust condensing at low pressure and high pressure, and the double-stage ORC. It is regarded that the more slowly the system output power decreases, the better part-load performance it has. Based on a comparison among the four systems, the effects of evaporating pressure, condensing condition, working fluid, and system structure on part-load performance are revealed in the work. Further, it is found that the system which best matches with the heat source not only performs well under the design conditions, but also has excellent part-load performance.

AB The booming developments of coastal/offshore renewable energies in recent years call for a powerful numerical code, ideally open-source packaged, to accelerate the researches in the spotlight. This paper presents such an efficient software package for evaluating the performance of floating renewable energy systems in the coastal and offshore regions. It aims to contribute an open-source effort in numerical simulations for ocean energy converters. Though computation of the free-surface effect in moderate depth region is extremely troublesome due to the singularities, the software package proposed in the present paper gives a satisfactory solution to keep the balance of accuracy and efficiency. In the present paper, the interface and structure of the package are introduced in detail so as to be well understood by the reader. Benchmark tests for various types of converters have confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of the package which can be incorporated easily with a frequency domain solver for efficient analysis. By contributing as one of the pioneer works in the open-source effort of evaluating the moderate-depth free-surface Green's function, with its advantages of a reliable accuracy and a relatively low cost, the authors are hoping that the publication of the present software package will promote the continuous researches in developing robust and reliable coastal and offshore renewable energy systems.

AB This paper presents an analysis of the application of an Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for power generation of a Brazilian FPSO (Floating Product Storage Offload). The peculiarity of this analysis is the investigation of power generation using low-temperature waste heat sources. Low-grade sources represent a significant amount of heat rejected on the platform. The primary production in the platform processes was evaluated using ASPEN-HYSYS (R) software v.8.6. The main sources of low-temperature residual heat were preliminarily identified, and the highest potential for energy recovery was: the heat rejected in the intercoolers and aftercoolers of the compression processes in the Main Compression Unit and the CO2 Compression Unit For the development of this study, a computational tool was elaborated in MATLAB (R) to evaluate the thermodynamic performance and to predict the design of the heat exchanger of the ORC. A multi-objective optimization was conducted to verify the ORC application at the established sources. The higher net power was obtained at Main Compression Unit heat recovery, operating with R245CB2 as working fluid. This application allows to generate up to 2063 kW with a heat transfer area of 2997 m(2), providing a 23.6% increase in exergy efficiency of the system. The results of this study suggest that the application of ORC cycles on FPSO platforms for heat recovery from low-temperature sources allows an essential increase in the energy and exergetic efficiency of the production processes of the platform. Although the ORC doesn't give a substantial increase in the supply of electricity, they contribute to less gas consumption in gas turbines. In this way, contributing to a significant reduction of GHG emissions.

AB Key features of hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stack operation are elucidated by examining its local thermodynamic states with an aid of three-dimensional numerical simulations. A high-fidelity physical model, which resolves the coupling between thermo-chemical reactions and heat and mass transport, is developed and validated. To elucidate important reactions and transport phenomena, local thermodynamic state variables of hydrocarbon-fueled operation are compared with those estimated by assuming pure-hydrogen-supplied operation. Results show that thermochemical reactions proceed at high rates through the thick anode support layer. This induces complete methane conversion as soon as it is introduced to the anode and thermochemical reaction zones concentrated in the vicinity of the fuel inlet. In spite of the fast reaction processes, hydrocarbon-fueled operation has the same electrical current density profile as pure-hydrogen-supplied operation, resulting from changing its local thermodynamic states. Given that the presence of carbon substances and thermochemical reactions, in hydrocarbon-fueled operation, local chemical and electrical conditions are substantially different from those of pure-hydrogen-supplied operation. A lower hydrogen concentration induces a higher concentration overpotential and decreases a reversible electrochemical potential. A lower exchange current density is offset by increasing an activation overpotential at a given applied current. All these reduce the overall cell voltage, as compared to pure-hydrogen-supplied operation. Variation of transport properties such as diffusivities and viscosities influences heat and mass transport such that substantial stresses can be imposed on cell materials. In addition, thermal conditions result in lower incoming-gas heating and a larger heat transfer rate to a neighboring repeating unit. A larger temperature gradient near the fuel inlet may also impose stresses cell materials. A lower power output, attributed to the electrochemical losses in a form of activation and concentration overpotentials, and materials degradation can be accompanied in hydrocarbon-fueled stack operation.

AB Biodiesel, in its neat or blended form with petrodiesel, is widely accepted alternative fuel for diesel engines. Although biodiesel is presumably associated with lower CO2, HC, and PMs emissions, it suffers from its own drawbacks including higher viscosity, lower volatility, lower heating value, and higher NOx, emissions. In order to address these shortcomings and to meet stringent emission norms, diesel/biodiesel additives have attracted more attention recently owing to their ability to improve engine performance and mitigate hazardous emissions. While discrete emissions analysis could provide useful information on environmental impacts associated with various fuel additives, decision-making on such basis would be very difficult or even impossible since different fuel additives may have different positive/negative effects on pollutants generated during combustion process. This issue becomes even more serious in multi-objective optimization studies due to the fact that considering all emission indices for finding a global optimal point would be very complex as a result of conflicting objectives. Moreover, exhaust gas emission analysis does not consider environmental impacts caused in fuel production process. Discrete emissions analysis also lacks weighting in decision-making procedure since the level and degree of harmfulness of pollutants may not be comparable. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been recognized as a valuable tool to address these challenges through systematical evaluation of potential environmental impacts of fuel additives. Accordingly, this paper was aimed at comprehensively reviewing and mechanistically discussing the effects of various diesel/biodiesel additives including metal-based, oxygenated, antioxidant, cold flow improver, lubricity improver, and cetane number improver additives as well as engine operating parameters like engine load, engine speed, EGR, and injection timing on both regulated and non-regulated emissions. Moreover, the environmental impacts of various diesel/biodiesel additives by incorporating an LCA approach was also critically discussed.

AB Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules and cells can transform solar radiation into electricity from both front and rear sides, unlike traditional solar technologies which can only generate power through the front face. This ability has shown to increase electric output with various levels of increment, depending on parameters such as distance to the ground, distance between modules, and albedo. This power gain characteristic versatility has attracted the industry, gaining both commercial and research interest. Measuring soiling effects in bifacial modules is an important milestone for the technology, since it is an important source of efficiency loss, thus relevant to the industry when evaluating and designing bifacial systems. In this work soiling rates are measured for bifacial minimodules and compared with traditional monofacial minimodules. The experiment was carried out for a period of two months in Santiago, Chile, measuring short circuit current of the minimodules along with the irradiance in the module plane and albedo. Also, a methodology is proposed to distinguish between soiling in the front and rear sides of bifacial modules, with which a mixed integer lineal problem is designed to obtain optimum cleaning frequency under different strategies and conditions for a period of three years, from 2014 to 2016. It is observed that soiling rate in the monofacial minimodule is 0.301%/day, meanwhile a rate of 0.236%/day was measured for the bifacial module. Also, a rate of 0.0394%/day was calculated for the rear side of the bifacial module, roughly 8.8 times smaller than the front side rate. Finally, several optimizations and simulations where performed to see the effects of soiling rate, albedo, rain, cleaning costs and strategy in cleaning frequency of both the front and rear sides of a bifacial PV system.

AB Biodiesel is renewable fuel produced from fats and oils. When compared to conventional diesel fuel, it has considerable environmental benefits. However, its extensive use is hindered by high cost of production, mainly due to cost of feedstock. Among the different biodiesel production routes, acid catalyzed transesterification enables to use feedstock with higher free fatty acid content (cheaper feedstock). The absence of soap formation while using acid as a catalyst also simplifies the downstream separation and purification processes. In this study, a homogeneous sulfuric acid catalyzed transesterification of acidic oil is designed into four process scenarios based on four different downstream process routes.
   The conceptual design and simulation of these process alternatives have been carried out using Super Pro and Aspen Plus software. These process models were used to evaluate the techno economic competitiveness of the four different scenarios. In the four process scenarios, all reactors for biodiesel production have been designed to have the same reaction conditions and the same amount of oil feedstock input. The difference of the scenarios was only on the arrangements and type of downstream process equipment required to get fuel grade biodiesel. The technical performances have been evaluated based on quality and quantity of products as well as the amount of biodiesel produced per feedstock consumed. The specific economic parameters considered were Unit Production Cost, NPV, IRR (after tax), and Payback time. The process scenario with ethanol recovery after catalyst neutralization and glycerol separation using decanting just before biodiesel purification has better technical and economic performances. Whereas the double reactor scenario shows much better technical performances with very low economic feasibility.

AB A two-step computational framework based on the combination of response surface methodology and multi-objective optimization is proposed to model the outlet-air state of desiccant wheels and subsequently optimize their operation. Regeneration temperature, surface area ratio, rotational speed, and wheel diameter are considered as decision parameters in the genetic algorithm. The central composite design and response surface methods have been employed to design experiments, establish predictive empirical models, and determine interactive effects of decision variables on response variables-process outlet temperature and humidity ratio. Several experiments have been performed to verify applicability of the proposed methodology and validate obtained results. A value of the coefficient of determination exceeding 0.95 demonstrates high reliability and accuracy of the modeling process involved in the proposed methodology. Results obtained demonstrate greater dominance of the surface area ratio compared to other decision variables in terms of their influence on response variables. After successful validation against experimental data, the developed models have been considered as a combination of two objective functions. A fast and elitist non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II-based optimization technique has been employed to simultaneously determine optimum values of decision variables. A Pareto-optimum front has been presented to select the best value of each decision parameter from available points of optimum operation, and a valuable equation for Pareto-optimal points has been deduced for each material to assist designers develop an optimum design of desiccant cooling systems.

AB Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of building energy has become an active research area in order to consider variations of input variables and identify key variables influencing building energy. When there is only limited information available for uncertainty of building inputs, a specific probability for a given variable cannot be defined. Then, it is necessary to develop alternative approaches to probabilistic uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for building energy. Therefore, this paper explores the application of the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence to conduct uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for buildings. The DST method is one of imprecise probability theories to allow combining uncertainty from different sources in terms of interval-valued probabilities in order to construct the belief and plausibility (two uncertainty measures) of system responses. The results indicate that the DST uncertainty analysis in combination with machine learning methods can provide fast and reliable information on uncertainty of building energy. It is recommended that at least two inherently different learning algorithms should be applied to provide robust simulation results of building energy. A spectrum of distributions should be implemented in global sensitivity analysis with the DST method because there are no specific distributions for intervals of input factors. Moreover, the stability of results from uncertainty and sensitivity analysis should be assessed when applying the DST method in building energy analysis.

AB A novel micro combustor embedded with high thermal conductivity material has been proposed for micro-thermophotovoltaic system application. The effect of the materials, which is graphite and nickel with widths 1 mm and 3 mm on the thermal and radiant performance of the new micro combustor, was experimentally and numerically investigated. It was found that high and uniform temperature distribution along the walls of the combustor was obtained by embedding graphite with width of 1 mm because of the enhanced heat transfer, which is desirable for the micro-thermophotovoltaic system. The available radiation energy increased from 4.6 W for the conventional combustor to 5.2 W for the novel combustor when the inlet velocity was 1.0 m/s and the hydrogen/oxygen equivalence ratio was 0.5 under the experimental conditions. The available radiation efficiency increased from 8.9% to 9.8% and the effect of the embedded material could be enhanced by increasing the chemical energy input. Based on the combustor and fuel in this study, the conditions for good thermal performance are graphite with width of 1 mm, inlet velocity of 1.0 m/s and 0.5 equivalence ratio of hydrogen/oxygen by considering the reliability and durability of the combustor.

AB Nowadays, power demand and supply of the power grid fluctuate constantly for the increasing proportion of the renewable energy. Improving the operation performance of the gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plant at part-load conditions is becoming a very critical problem. An innovative combined cycle solution, called backpressure adjustable gas turbine combined cycle (BAGTCC) with corresponding operation strategies, is proposed in this paper to improve off-design performance by adjusting turbine backpressure. The off-design calculation models of the combined cycle are built and their reliability is verified. The feasibility of this scheme is analyzed with the Mach number of the gas flow in turbine. Then, the part-load operation characteristics of the topping cycle, bottoming cycle and combined cycle of the GTCC and BAGTCC, operating with two different operation strategies respectively, are analyzed and compared. The simulation results show that, the proposed BAGTCC can broaden the load range, where turbine inlet temperature (TIT) maintains its design value, from 100-82.4% to 100-63.7%. The combined cycle efficiency has been improved significantly in that load range, up by 0-0.52 and 0-1.76 percentage points over the two conventional operation strategies respectively. Furthermore, this solution has the ability to adjust the power distribution of topping and bottoming cycle, which means that the heat-to-electric ratio can be adjusted when the bottoming cycle is involved in heating. The energy saving potential of BAGTCC can be increased by broadening the compressor flow adjustment range. In conclusion, backpressure regulating is an efficient method to improve the part-load efficiency of the GTCC.

AB Site selection is one of the critical steps in building photovoltaic power plants which influences electricity-generating capacity and socio-economic benefits in the future. It needs to consider many factors in site selection, such as climate, geology, and social acceptance, etc. Thus, photovoltaic power plants site selection is a complex problem of multiple-criteria decision-making. However, most of the previous studies consider less about the subjectivity and vagueness of decision-making information and assume that decision makers are totally rational without considering their psychological factors. To deal with the problem, a novel integrated method based on variable precision rough number, Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution and prospect theory is developed in this paper. Basically, the method includes two stages: one is determination of criteria weights based on variable precision rough number, and the other is selecting the most suitable photovoltaic power plant site with a prospect theory-based approach. The novel method integrates the advantage of variable precision rough number in flexibly dealing with vague information and the merit of prospect theory in manipulating decision maker's bounded rationality. Finally, a case study of a 10-megawatt photovoltaic power plant site selection in China is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB This study offers an efficient design method of flow channels of metallic bipolar plates (BPPs) to improve manufacturing technique of BPPs and maximize power density in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Stamped thin metallic BPPs with anticorrosive and conductive coating are promising candidates for replacing conventional carbon-based BPPs. Nevertheless, unlike carbon-based BPPs, the flow channel design of metallic BPPs should take into account not only the reaction efficiency, but also formability due to the possible rupture of the metallic channel during the micro-forming process. In our previous study, a forming limit model was first proposed to predict the maximum allowable channel height by the forming process. This study is conducted to further propose the method of the design and fabrication of metallic BPPs based on the numerical model. In order to determine channel geometry design from formability perspective, response surface method is utilized to build a formability model. Combining the formability model and reaction efficiency, flow field design for metallic BPPs (channel width of 0.9 mm, rib width of 0.9 mm, channel depth of 0.4 mm and radius of 0.15 mm) is proposed. Experiments on BPP fabrication and assembled 20-cell fuel cell testing are conducted to observe forming quality of micro channel and output performance on the real fuel cell. It is shown that the stamping force grows with increasing channel depth in a nonlinear manner and a blank holder is needed to eliminate the sheet wrinkle in the forming process. The uniformity of the voltage distribution in the 1000 W-class stack further proves the reliability of metallic BPPs designed by our method. The methodology developed is beneficial to the fabrication management of metallic BPPs and effective supplement to the channel design principle for PEM fuel cells.

AB To use high-temperature waste heat generated by diesel engines for onboard refrigeration of fishing vessels, an ammonia-based double-effect vapor absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed. Non-volatile ionic liquids are applied as absorbents in the double-effect absorption system. In comparison to systems using ammonia/water fluid, the complexity of the system can be reduced by preventing the use of rectification sections. In this study, a multi-scale method is implemented to study the proposed system, including molecular simulations (the Monte Carlo method) for computing vapor-liquid equilibrium properties at high temperatures and pressures, thermodynamic modeling of the double-effect absorption cycles, and system evaluations by considering practical integration. The Monte Carlo simulations provide reasonable vapor-liquid equilibrium predictions. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is found to be the best performing candidate among the investigated commercialized ionic liquids. In the proposed cycle, the best working fluid achieves a coefficient of performance of 1.1 at a cooling temperature of -5 degrees C, which is slightly higher than that obtained with generator-absorber cycles. Integrated with the exhaust gas from diesel engines, the cooling capacity of the system is sufficient to operate two refrigeration seawater plants for most of the engine operating modes in high-latitude areas. Thereby, the carbon emission of onboard refrigeration of the considered fishing vessel could be reduced by 1633.5 tons per year compared to the current practice. Diagrams of vapor pressures and enthalpies of the studied working fluids are provided as appendices.

AB This paper presents a new method for selecting a pump for large-power PV irrigation systems working at a variable frequency. This can have a significant impact since the traditional way of selecting the pump is based on maximizing the efficiency of pump in the duty point at a certain single operating frequency, which is not useful for PV irrigation systems working at a variable frequency. The proposed method starts by considering the pumps with H-Q curves with a high slope and the duty point in the right-hand third of the curve to assure a wide range of operating frequencies. Then, the efficiency within the whole range of frequencies is evaluated. An example of a performance comparison between the pumps selected with the new and traditional methods has been carried out. Results show that by using the new method, the yearly volume of water pumped increases by 7.2-21.0% and the pump efficiency by 4.3-5.3%. Finally, it is important to mention that the proposed method has already been implemented in the SISIFO tool, able to simulate PV irrigation systems.

AB This paper investigates a combined cooling and power system driven by geothermal energy for ice-making and hydrogen production. The proposed system combines geothermal flash cycle, Kalina cycle, ammonia-water absorption refrigeration cycle and electrolyser. The geothermal energy can be efficiently converted to storable hydrogen and ice. Based on mathematical model, some key parameters are analyzed to figure out their effect on the exergetic performance. An exergy destruction analysis for all components has been performed to find out the distribution of exergy inefficiency. The system exergetic efficiency is optimized by Jaya algorithm and Genetic algorithm and the optimization results are compared. According to the parametric analysis, the exergy efficiency decreases as the back pressure of steam turbine and the back pressure of ammonia-water turbine increase. The exergy efficiency could increase first and then decline, as flash pressure, ammonia-water turbine inlet pressure and ammonia mass fraction of basic solution increase. The optimization results show that the exergy efficiency reaches 23.59%, 25.06% and 26.25% when the geothermal water temperature is 150 degrees C, 160 degrees C and 170 degrees C. Jaya algorithm has highly precise optimization results.

AB The ever growing interest on solar energy has augmented large solar power parks in the contemporary time. Even though the most commonly used Total Cross Tie (TCT) interconnection scheme minimizes mismatch losses, shade occurrence in large PV arrays drastically reduces the power output and invokes multiple power peaks in the P-V characteristics. To counteract the multiple peak issue, PV arrays are reconfigured either via electrical or physical reconfiguration techniques. In this regard, physical relocation methods are proven to be efficient and economical in achieving better shade dispersion since, it neither demands complex switching arrangements or high end controllers for reconfiguration. Therefore, this paper introduces an innovative Competence Square (CS) technique for physical rearrangement of PV panels in a TCT interconnection scheme. The method devised is a one-time relocation technique that follows a unique number pattern for relocating the PV panels. Moreover, various test results elucidate the effectiveness of the CS technique in effectively dispersing the shade over the entire PV array. For validation, four typical shade cases are considered and the results are comprehensively compared with the recently proved TCT and Dominance Square (DS) techniques. In addition, the proposed method is computationally easy and is adaptable for PV arrays of any size. Overall, CS technique has showed its eminence in obtaining smoother output characteristics, better fill factor, power enhancement and increased energy savings.

AB Fast and accurate parameter extraction of fuel cells is crucial to the control and performance analysis of fuel cell power systems. Unfortunately, due to the multivariable and nonlinear features of fuel cell models, it is a difficult task to identify the parameters of the models. In this paper, we propose a decomposition technique, where the unknown parameters are divided into two groups: nonlinear and linear. The optimization techniques only need to optimize the nonlinear parameters, and then the linear parameters are determined based on the nonlinear ones. With the help of the decomposition technique, a generalized framework by using the nature-inspired optimization method is proposed to try to fast and accurately extract the parameters for different types of fuel cells. To test the performances of our approach, two widely used types of fuel cells are studied, i.e., proton exchange membrane fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cell. Extensive simulation tests with thirty-two instances are carried out for comparing our approach with existing approaches. The comparison demonstrates the efficiency of the decomposition technique. Moreover, the results show that our approach can not only significantly reduce the computational resources, but also yields high quality solutions.

AB Integrated systems consisted of solar energy and air source heat pump have been a hot research topic in recent decades due to their high efficiency and low environmental pollution. Recently, much attention has been paid to the performance characteristics of these systems, however, scarce of attention has been paid to indicate which kind of integrated systems have the optimal performance under different working conditions. For the integrated system of solar heating independently, the solar collectors have high heat-collecting temperature and high heat loss to ambient, so it has advantages in high solar radiation. For the integrated system of solar energy used for the low temperature heat source of heat pumps, the solar collectors have low heat-collecting temperature and low heat loss, so it has advantages in low solar radiation. But for the condition of medium solar radiation, both the above existing two types of systems may not be the optimal ones. Therefore, in this study, a novel integrated system was put forward for this condition. The characteristics and optimal working condition range of this novel system were comparatively studied by the simulation method. By comparison with the above existing two types of systems, the results proved that for most conditions of medium solar radiation, the novel system has the optimal performance, and its COP can be about 55% higher than that of the two types of existing systems when the outdoor temperature is - 25 degrees C. An I-T diagram was proposed in this study to quantificationally divide the optimal working condition ranges of the three types of systems. This study can effectively guide the selection of optimal systems under different working conditions.

AB Thermal storage is a key point for the development of concentrated solar power technologies. This article aims to develop a methodology for the optimization, from an economic point of view, of a Concentrated Solar Power plant with thermal storage. It addresses two original aspects: (1) it incorporates a thermochemical storage process; (2) it considers the integration of the power plants production in electricity SPOT markets that present strong price variations over the day, week, and seasons. The strategies of production defining the Storage/Storage-Production/Discharge phases must be optimized with regard to these variable prices. The relevant economic criteria is no more the usual Levelized Cost of Energy, but the Net Present Value, which considers also the revenues of the plant. The required optimization involves two sets of distinct variables which are optimized simultaneously: the physic variables of the thermochemical storage (defining its stored energy and its thermal power) and the operational/strategy variables, that define non-classic storage/production strategies adapted for the price curves. To take into account the time dependent feature of the problem, the notion of pre-scenarios is introduced, which allow to treat the problem, naturally formulated as an optimal control problem, under the classic setting of differentiable optimization. Under this scope, a solution for the optimal design problem of the plant is proposed. First results are presented for a Californian case. This first step highlights the improvement with respect to the classical production strategy (i.e. one storage discharge after sunset).

AB This paper presents an optimization approach for the production of syngas from biogas via tri-reforming. The optimization, formulated as a NLP problem, is performed for three syngas ratios according to the desired product: methanol, ethanol or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels. As a result, the optimal operating conditions and biogas composition are defined. For the production of ethanol, a biogas composed by a CH4:CO2 ratio of 0.52:0.48 is desired, requiring 0.035 mol of O-2 per mol of Biogas in the reformer. For the production of methanol and FT, biogas with the largest content of methane is suggested to be reformed with 0.275 mol O-2/mol biogas. The largest H-2:CO ratio required for methanol is achieved by feeding steam in a WGS reactor after the reformer. The syngas optimization study is completed by evaluating tri-reforming for the production of FT fuels from biogas via high and low temperature FT synthesis. The production cost for a plant fed with 12 MMm(3)/y of biogas results in $3/gal for biodiesel via HTFT and $1.7/gal via LTFT.

AB In this paper, an improved version of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is proposed to improve the exploration and the exploitation ability of the GWO algorithm. This improvement is performed through using the chaotic logistic map, the Opposition-Based Learning (OBL), the differential evolution(DE), and the disruption operator (DO). Where, the chaotic logistic map and the OBL are used to initialize the candidate solutions and these approaches avoid the drawbacks of the random population and increase the convergence of the algorithm. Then, the DE operators are combined with the GWO algorithm, in which, the DE operators work as a local search mechanism to improve the exploitation ability of the GWO through updating the population. Also, after updating the solutions by using a hybrid between the GWO and the DE, the DO is used to enhance the exploration ability, in which, the DO is used to maintain the diversity of the population. Therefore, the combinations with chaotic logistic map, OBL, DE, and DO, provide the GWO with tools to better balance between the exploration and the exploitation of the search space without affecting the computational time required for this task. The proposed algorithm, called COGWO2D, is compared with other seven algorithms through a set of experimental series that have been performed over two benchmark functions, the classical CEC2005, and the CEC2014. Also, the performance of the proposed algorithm to improve the classification of the galaxy images is evaluated, where it is used as a feature selection method. The aim of this experiment is to select the optimal subset of features from the extracted features of the galaxy images. The experimental results support the efficacy of the proposed approach to find the optimal solutions of the global optimization problem, as well as, increase the accuracy of the classification of the galaxy images.

AB Abnormal network traffic analysis through Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and visualization techniques has considerably become an important research topic to protect computer networks from intruders. It has been still challenging to design an accurate and a robust IDS with visualization capabilities to discover security threats due to the high volume of network traffic. This research work introduces and describes a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection system in presence of long-range independence data called benign outliers, using a neural projection architecture by a modified Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to not only detect attacks and anomalies accurately, but also provide visualized information and insights to end users. The proposed approach enables better analysis by merging the large amount of network traffic into an easy-to-understand 2D format and a simple user interaction. To show the performance and validate the proposed visualization-based IDS, it has been trained and tested over synthetic and real benchmarking datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AAGM and VPN-nonVPN) that are widely applied in this domain. The results of the conducted experimental study confirm the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A learnable search result diversification method

DT Review
DE Explicit search result diversification; Learning model; Markov random

AB Search result diversification is to tackle the ambiguous queries and multi-faced information needs. The search result diversification problem can be formalized as a balance between the relevance score and the diversity score. Most previous diversification models utilize a predefined function to calculate the diversity score. The values of parameters need to be tuned by manual experiments. It is time-consuming and hard to reach optimal result in diversity evaluation. Proposing a learnable approach to solve the above problems is a pressing task. Therefore we introduce a Learnable Search Result Diversification model called L-SRD. On this basis, we redefine the diversity function and derive our loss function as the likelihood loss of ground truth generation. Stochastic gradient descent algorithm is employed to optimize the values of parameters. Finally we derive our ranking function to generate the diverse list sequentially. Due to the learning model, the values of parameters are determined automatically and get optimally. The experiments on TREC web tracks show that our approach outperforms several existing diversification models significantly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Github, one of the largest social coding platforms, offers software developers the opportunity to engage in social activities relating to software development and to store or share their codes/projects with the wider community using the repositories. Analysis of data representing the social interactions of Github users can reveal a number of interesting features. In this paper, we analyze the data to understand user social influence on the platform. Specifically, we propose a Following-Star-Fork-Activity based approach to measure user influence in the Github developer social network. We first preprocess the Github data, and construct the social network. Then, we analyze user influence in the social network, in terms of popularity, centrality, content value, contribution and activity. Finally, we analyze the correlation of different user influence measures, and use Borda Count to comprehensively quantify user influence and verify the results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As one kind of typical network big data, social-information networks (such as Weibo and Twitter) include both the complex network structure among users and the rich microblog/tweets information published by users. Understanding the interplay of rich content and social relationships is potentially valuable to the fundamental network mining task, i.e. the link prediction. Although some of the link prediction methods have been proposed by combining topological and non-topological information simultaneously, the in-depth analysis of the rich content still being in a minority, and the rich content in the social-information networks is still underused in solving link prediction. In this paper, we approach the link prediction problem in social-information network by combining network structure and topic information which is extracted from users' rich content. We first define a kind of user-to-user topic inclusion degree (TID) based on the dissemination mechanism of the published content in the social-information networks, and then construct a TID-based sparse network. On the basis, we build a fusion probabilistic matrix factorization model which solves the link prediction problem by fusing the information of the original following/followed network and the TID-based network in a unified probabilistic matrix factorization framework. We conduct link prediction experiments on two types of real social-information network datasets, i.e. Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective in solving the link prediction problem in social-information networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Max-Sum diversity and the Max-Min diversity are two well-known optimization models to capture the notion of selecting a subset of diverse points from a given set. The resolution of their associated optimization problems provides solutions of different structures, in both cases with desirable characteristics. They have been extensively studied and we can find many metaheuristic methodologies, such as Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure, Tabu Search, Iterated Greedy, Variable Neighborhood Search, and Genetic algorithms applied to them to obtain high quality solutions. In this paper we solve the bi-objective problem in which both models are simultaneously optimized. No previous effort has been devoted to study the "combined problem" from a multi-objective perspective. In particular, we adapt the mono-objective methodologies applied to this problem to the resolution of the bi-objective problem, obtaining approximations to its efficient front. An empirical comparison discloses the best alternative to tackle this ATP-hard problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Planet bearing vibrations feature high complexity due to the intricate kinematics and multiple modulation effects. This leads to difficulty in planet bearing fault identification. In order to overcome this difficulty, a sparse classification framework based on dictionary learning is proposed. It operates directly on raw signals and is free from steps involved in conventional pattern identification such as feature design which requires prior expertise. First, a raw signal matrix is generated by partitioning the raw signal into segments, where each segment in all signal states has the same number of data points, and the length of the segment should guarantee that at least two adjacent fault impulses with the maximum interval can occur. Then, a dictionary initialized with the training sample set is learnt from the signal matrix, based on which the sparse representation is carried out afterwards. A dictionary learnt over signals under a certain state is best suited for signal reconstruction under the same state only but cannot recover signals well under other states. Inspired by this fact, sparse classification can be accomplished by comparing signal recovery errors over dictionaries under different states. The proposed method is validated using the experimental data of a planetary gearbox. Localized faults on the outer race, roller element and inner race of planet bearings are all identified successfully. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting the demand for a new product at early stages is crucial in determining successful product designs. However, the lack of market and consumer related data during the early stages make demand prediction incredibly difficult and unreliable, often underestimating or overestimating the product's demand. With increasing global competition and shortening product life-cycle, almost all the new products have some amount of commonality (differentiation) in their design which presents an opportunity to learn from the abundant data available from the predecessor product. In this work, we developed a novel integrated approach for demand prediction, utilizing weighted product differentiation index between the new and the predecessor products and the prior knowledge of the historical demand for the predecessor. The proposed integrated framework employs advanced machine learning algorithms to first model the non-linear and non-stationary relationship between market demand and product differentiation (thus the product design), which we refer as demand differentiation index (DDI) and then utilize this relationship for predicting the initial demand of the new product in early stages. We further propose DDI modified exponential weighted moving average, DDI-EWMA for product life-cycle demand prediction. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated using real data from the automobile industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phytosterols are effective in reducing plasma cholesterol. However, phytosterols in a free form have some disadvantages because they have a high melting point and a poor oil solubility, thereby limiting their practical application in foods. The present study was to establish a green and highly efficient method to synthesize phytosterol linolenate for the first time by employing Bronsted acidic ionic liquid (IL) as a catalyst in order to improve its oil solubility. The product was separated, analyzed and subsequently characterized using thin layer chromatography, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The conversion of phytosterols could reach above 96% in a very short time (30 min) under the following optimum conditions: 3% 1-butylsulfonate-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BSO(3)HMim]OTf) as a catalyst, 110 degrees C and 1: 1.75M ratio of phytosterols to ethyl linolenate. The present method demonstrated that [BSO(3)HMim]OTf would be a potential catalyst for phytosterol ester synthesis. Most importantly was that the oil solubility of phytosterol linolenate was much greater than its corresponding free phytosterols.

AB L-Theanine, the most abundant amino acid in tea, is widely believed to be associated with the tea taste, however, its contribution to the formation of tea aroma is still unknown. Volatiles were determined and nitrogen-containing compounds formed during manufacturing processes were quantified. Lower levels of total sugar and L-theanine were detected in the Oolong tea product undergoing full fire processing (FFOT) suggesting that L-theanine probably involved in the volatile formation during manufacturing processes. Methylpyrazine and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, two newly formed compounds in FFOT, together with other volatiles were successfully detected in a model thermal reaction of D-glucose and L-theanine (GT-MTR) but not detectable in thermal reactions with single D-glucose (G-MTR) or L-theanine (T-MTR). The concentration of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine increased significantly by adding additional L-theanine to 2nd roasted tea. Our study demonstrated that L-theanine, at least partly, contributed to the formation of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, a key roasted peanutty flavor in Oolong tea.

AB Herein, for the first time, thiol-functionalized mesoporous silica (mSiO(2)-SH) nanofibers with a spirally-curved twisted hexagonal morphology were synthesized via a simple one-pot protocol. 4-Mercaptophenylboronic acids (4-MPBA) were attached onto the mSiO(2)-SH nanofibers via disulfide bond, serving as boronate affinity sorbent to selectively capture brassinosteroids (BRs) from plant extract. The resulting BRs-MPBA derivatives were easily eluted from the sorbent by cleaving the disulfide bond, which was subsequently subjected to ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis. Thus, the in situ extraction/derivatization/desorption method coupled with UPLC-MS was established for the fast, sensitive and selective detection of BRs in plant tissues. Finally, based on the developed method, endogenous BRs were successfully detected in leaf of H. lupulus L., silique of A. thaliana, and panicle of O. sativa L.

AB A simple quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)-based method was developed for the analysis of endrin and its metabolite, delta-keto endrin, in five animal-derived food products (chicken, pork, beef, egg, and milk) using a gas chromatography-micro electron capture detector (GC-mu ECD). Samples were extracted with acidified acetonitrile, salted out with magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate, and finally purified with a dual layer solid-phase extraction cartridge (SPE) that contains both Supelclean ENVI-Carb (upper layer) and primary secondary amine (lower layer) SPE sorbents. A seven-point external calibration curve was constructed both for the solvent and matrix for both compounds. Good linearity was achieved for both analytes, with coefficients of determination (R-2) >= 0.9960. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.003 mg/kg, whereas the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.01 mg/kg, which were 10 times lower than the extraneous maximum residue limit (EMRL) designated by CODEX Alimentarius for the specified matrices. The method was validated via recovery performances in triplicates, with three fortification levels equivalent to LOQ, 2 x LOQ, and 10 x LOQ. The method provided excellent recoveries, ranging between 75.63 and 117.92%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) <= 8.52% for both analytes in various matrices. The developed method was successfully applied to monitor market samples collected from 20 different places throughout the Republic of Korea, and none of the tested analytes were found in the analyzed samples. Conclusively, we could propose that the current method can be used for routine analysis of endrin and d-keto endrin in any type of fatty food matrix.

AB Fluorosis is still a serious public health problem in China according to our field investigation. Current foodstuff drying methods were studied to evaluate the state of foodstuff contamination, including burning mixed coal (MC)/coal washing wastes (CWWs)/lump coal (LC)/fuelwood/ fine coal + fixing materials (FCFM)/CWWs + fixing materials (CFM) in open stove (OS), honeycomb briquettes (HB) in improved stove (IS), sun-drying. The results demonstrate that elemental contents of F, As, Cd, Cr and Pb in roasted grain were 1.19-40.65 times higher than limting standard. The comprehensive risk of different drying methods based on AHP-FCE is ranked in the order of: CWWs(OS) > MC(OS) > HB(IS) > CFM(OS) > FCFM(OS) > LC(OS) > Fuelwood (OS) > sun-drying. It exhibits obviously higher risk due to burning CWWs/MC in OS than other methods. Burning CFM/FCFM/fuelwood in OS may be an economic and relatively safe foodstuff drying methods.

AB Whey acerola-flavoured drink was subjected to Ohmic Heating (OH) under different operational conditions (45, 60, 80 V at 60 Hz and 10, 100, 1000 Hz with 25 V, 65 degrees C/30 min) and conventional pasteurization (65 degrees C/30 min). Bioactive compounds (total phenolics, DPPH, FRAP, ACE levels), fatty acid profile, volatile compounds (CG-MS), thermal behaviors (DSC) and water mobility (TD-NMR) were performed. Reduction of frequency (1000-10 Hz) resulted in a lower bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity of the samples, except for the DPPH values. Concerning the thermal behaviors, fatty acids profile and volatile compounds, different findings were observed as a function of the parameters used (voltage and frequency). In respect of TD-NMR parameters, OH led to a slightly reduction of the relaxation time when compared to the conventional treatment, suggesting more viscous beverages. Overall, OH may be interesting option to whey acerola-flavoured drink processing.

AB Physicochemical properties of starches from 5 different Korean cultivars of cowpea and mungbean were examined. Starch granules had elliptical to spherical granules. Volume median diameter of granules ranged from 17.0 mu m to 48.6 mu m, with a significantly larger median granule diameter in cowpea starches than mungbean starches. Apparent amylose content ranged from 35.7% to 38.5%. Among cowpea starches, Seowon had a higher molecular weight and longer amylopectin average chain length than other cultivars. Between mungbean starches, Sohyun had a lower amylose molecular weight but a longer amylopectin average chain length than Dahyun. The relative crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of cowpea starches were greater than those of mungbean starches. Okdang had higher peak and final viscosities than other cowpea starches, whereas two mungbean varieties showed similar values for pasting parameters. Seowon in the cowpea starches and Sohyun in mungbean starches had higher gel hardness than other cultivars.

AB Mashing is an enzymatic procedure for the extraction of sugars from malt. It has strong temperature dependence, so monitoring the sugar production is very important for optimization of the brewing process. In this work, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to monitor three different mashing programs. These all presented high concentrations of maltose and dextrin, enabling their differentiation according to the FTIR absorption bands at 991 and 1022 cm(-1), characteristic of maltose and dextrin, respectively. The absorption intensities of these bands were used to monitor the concentrations of the compounds during mashing, and the values were compared to HPLC data. Multivariate analysis of variance was applied to the FTIR absorption intensities in order to separate groups corresponding to the temperature steps of each mashing program. The results demonstrated that infrared absorption offers an alternative to the HPLC method for monitoring the mashing process.

AB Lipid oxidation of fish oil enriched cow milk and soy milk supplemented with rosemary extract stored at 2 degrees C was studied. Both peroxide value and volatile secondary lipid oxidation products were determined to monitor the progress of lipid oxidation. Rosemary extract inhibited lipid oxidation in fish oil enriched cow milk. In contrast, soy milk samples having much higher unsaturated fatty acid content showed higher lipid oxidation stability compared to cow milk. Reduction in the content of chlorogenic acid during storage suggested that this compound may contribute to the lipid oxidation stability of fish oil enriched soy milk product. Total carnosic acid and carnosol concentration declined much faster in soy milk than in cow milk. It is suggested from the results that food components could have significant impact on the fate of bioactive antioxidant compounds in a specific food product during storage.

AB Destabilization of UHT milk during its shelf life is mainly promoted by the residual proteolytic activity attributed to the psychrotrophic bacterial proteases and native milk proteases. In this study, we built skim UHT milk-based model systems to which either the major bacterial protease (AprX from Pseudomonas fluorescens), or the major native milk protease (plasmin) was added, to allow a direct comparison between the destabilization of skim UHT milk by both categories of enzymes. The physical and chemical properties were studied during 6 weeks. Our results showed AprX induced compact gels when almost all the kappa-casein was hydrolyzed and the degree of hydrolysis (DH) exceeded 1.3%. Plasmin induced soft gels when around 60% of both beta- and alpha(s1)-casein were hydrolyzed and the DH reached 2.1%. The knowledge gained from this study may be used for developing diagnostic tests for determining the protease responsible for UHT milk destabilisation.

AB This study demonstrates technological advances in preventing yolk gelation during freezing and thawing. Gelation negatively affects yolk functionality in food formulation. Preventing gelation using 10% salt or sugar limits the application of the yolk. Novel food additives were tested to prevent gelation induced by freezing. Significant reduction (p < 0.05) in gel hardness of frozen-thawed yolk (45 h freezing at - 20 degrees C) indicates that hydrolyzed carboxymethyl cellulose (HCMC), proline, and hydrolyzed egg white and yolk (HEW and HEY) are effective gelation inhibitors. The mechanisms in which these additives prevented gelation were further studied through measuring the changes in the amount of freezable water, lipoprotein particle size, and protein surface hydrophobicity. Overall, this study provides several alternatives of gelation inhibitor that have great potentials in replacing the use of salt or sugar in commercial operation of freezing egg yolk for shelf-life extension.

AB This work focused on the structural characterization of resistant starch from untreated (UL-RS), germinated (GL-RS), fermented (FL-RS), microwaved (ML-RS), conventionally cooked (CL-RS), and autoclaved (AL-RS) lentil seeds. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results showed that UL-RS, RL-RS, and GL-RS (Group A samples) exhibited higher values of M-w and (R-h) over bar than FL-RS, ML-RS, AL-RS (Group C samples), and CL-RS (Group B sample). In parallel with the SEC result, other structural characteristics followed similar trends, where Group C samples exhibited the lowest values of double helix content and crystallinity by C-13 NMR, and degree of order/double helix by FT-IR. Comparatively, Group A samples exhibited the opposite trends, and displayed large amorphous aggregates on their micrograph. The results are expected to provide information for better understanding the mechanism of resistant starch formation during different processing of lentil and to lay a theoretical foundation for the future study of their structure-function relationship.

AB A simple method of simultaneous determination of aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), strontium (Sr) and zinc (Zn) in brews of ground and soluble coffees was proposed. It relied on acidification of brews with HNO3 to 1.3 mol L-1 and their analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Precision of 0.1-9% and detection limits from 0.07 ng mL(-1) (Sr) to 3 ng mL(-1) (Ni) were achieved. Trueness of the method was verified by comparison of results with those achieved with wet digestion and by the recovery study, and was better than 5%. Additionally, chemical fractionation by tandem solid phase extraction with reverse-phase and strong cation-exchange extraction tubes was carried out. Differences in chemical fractionation patterns, particularly the residual fraction, was useful for differentiation of ground and soluble coffees by analysis of variance, principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis.

AB We aimed to simplify the enzymolysis process for flaxseed protein hydrolysates production as Maillard reaction products (MRPs) to generate different flavor characteristics. More than 50% activity of immobilized enzymes (Alcalase and Flavourzyme) was retained after repeated use. Subsequently, after five weeks, the activities of the immobilized enzymes were also observed to be higher after storage at 4 degrees C. The optimum conditions for production of flaxseed protein hydrolysates using sequential enzymatic hydrolysis were as follow: 3,000 U/g of Alcalase at 60 degrees C and pH 8.0 for 2 h and 120 U/g of Flavourzyme at 50 degrees C and pII 6.5 for 2 h. Partial least squares regression analysis revealed that resulting peptides with the molecular weight (MW) higher than 1,000 Da could improve the mouthfulness and stability in umami soup; whereas, peptides with MW of 128-1,000 Da mainly contributed to the generation of meat-like flavor compounds with a significant effect on umami taste and bitterness.

AB Effects of postharvest methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment on the contents of ascorbic acid and carotenoids, as well as the compositions and contents of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in cherry tomato fruits were investigated during 11 days of storage at room temperature (25 degrees C). The results showed that MeJA treatment significantly increased the contents of ascorbic acid and carotenoids, especially lycopene in postharvest cherry tomato fruits. Moreover, MeJA treatment improved the contents of carotenoids derived VOCs such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (MHO), while had no effect on firmness, sugars and titratable acidity. All above results suggested that the exogenous MeJA application is potential in enhancement of main health-promoting components and VOCs in postharvest cherry tomato fruits.

AB The microstructure of cooked gluten-free pasta depends on the ingredients used, and this microstructure affects the starch hydrolysis (SH), the release of phenolic compounds (PC) and their antioxidant capacity (AC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the SD and bioaccessibility of PC during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of gluten-free pasta and its relationship with the microstructure. The highest SH was during the intestinal phase (approximate to 60%), but pasta with the highest content of unripe plantain and chickpea presented the lowest release of PC (approximate to 60%). The insoluble dietary fibre could be responsible (approximate to 12.5%) for these effects. The cooked pasta showed high AC in the intestinal phase. Regions with gelatinized starch granules in a less dense protein network and other regions with intact or swollen granules surrounded by a protein network were observed. The starch digestion and bioaccessibility of PC were related to the structure of the matrix.

AB We investigated the impact of a fermented milk product on gut microbiota and their metabolism in 3 different conditions of the colon with a systemic viewpoint. An in vitro semi-continuous anaerobic cultivation was used to assess the colon compartment-specific influence of fermented milk, followed by a multiomics approach combining 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The microbiome profiling and metabolomic features were significantly different across three colon compartments and after fermented milk treatment. Integrative correlation analysis indicated that the alteration of butyrate-producing microbiota (Veillonella, Roseburia, Lachnospira, and Coprococcus) and some primary metabolites (butyrate, ethanol, lactate, and isobutyrate) in the treatment group had a strong association with the fermented milk microorganisms. Our findings suggested that fermented milk treatment significantly affected microbial population in an in vitro cultivation system as well as the colonic metabolome in different ways in each of colon compartment.

AB In the present study, core-shell Fe3O4 polydopamine nanoparticles were synthesized and used for the first time as an adsorbent for the vortex assisted magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction of copper from food samples. After elution, copper in the solutions was determined by FAAS. The adsorbent was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, and zeta potential measurements. Various parameters affecting the magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction were evaluated. The optimum pH and magnetic adsorbent amount were found to be 5 and 40 mg, respectively. Elution was made by 3 mL of 2 mol L-1 HNO3. The major advantage of the method is the fast equilibration during adsorption without the need for vortexing or shaking. The preconcentration factor and detection limit of the method were found to be 150 and 0.22 mg L-1, respectively. The precision (as RSD%) and adsorption capacity of the method were 3.7% and 28 mg g(-1), respectively. The method was successfully verified by analyzing four certified reference materials (SPS-WW1 Batch 114 Wastewater, TMDA-53.3 Lake water, BCR-482 Lichen and 1573a Tomato Leaves) and by addition/recovery tests of copper standard solution in organic baby food, muesli, macaroni, honey, and milk samples.

AB Domestic processing methods, such as boiling, significantly affect the glucosinolate content and the formation of breakdown products in Brassica vegetables. Here, we comprehensively describe the effect of aqueous heat treatment on the degradation and leaching kinetics of glucosinolates on the formation of their enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolysis and breakdown products. The results were correlated with the inactivation kinetics of myrosinase and epithiospecifier protein activity in the Brassica oleracea vegetables kohlrabi, white cabbage, and red cabbage. Short-term heating increased isothiocyanate formation due to inactivation of the epithiospecifier protein. Myrosinase was inactivated shortly after that. Boiling led to leaching of glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products into the boiling water. Heating to 99 degrees C resulted in thermally-induced glucosinolate breakdown and nitrile formation, both in vegetables and boiling water. Finally, kinetic modeling not only revealed differences in myrosinase inactivation among the vegetables, but also glucosinolate leaching and degradation kinetics differed between individual glucosinolates and vegetables.

AB A hybrid composite featuring an iron-based metal-organic framework Material of Institute Lavoisier-88(Fe) and graphene oxide (MIL-88(Fe)/GO) was synthesized and used as the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coating. The SPME fiber was prepared by covalent bonding of the MIL-88(Fe)/GO composite onto the stainless steel substrate. The fiber had a good durability and allowed > 100 replicate extractions. The developed method, which combined the (MIL-88(Fe)/GO coated fiber based SPME with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID), achieved low limits of detection (0.5-2.0 ng g(-1), S/N=3) and good linearity (r(2) > 0.994) for the phthalic acid esters (PAEs) from various vegetable oil samples. The repeatability and fiber-to-fiber reproducibility were in the range of 4.0-9.1% and 5.7-11.4%, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of PAEs from vegetable oil samples with good recoveries (83.1-104.1%) and satisfactory precisions (RSDs < 10.5%), indicating that the MIL-88(Fe)/GO hybrid composite is a good coating material for the SPME of PAEs.

AB Reliable data on polyphenol in teff, an increasingly important food crop, is currently lacking. This study investigated the structural and quantitative profile of soluble and bound polyphenols in white and brown teff grown in Ethiopia and USA using LC-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Thirty-four phenolic compounds (32 newly identified in teff), mostly flavones and phenolic acid derivatives, were characterized. Unusually high levels of flavones were present in both white (1398-2049 mu g/g), and brown (1720-1847 mu g/g) teff soluble fractions. Interestingly, white teff exclusively contained apigenin derivatives, whereas brown teff contained mainly luteolin derivatives, mostly di-C-linked-glycosides. Additionally, non-extractable procyanidins (condensed tannins)were detected in brown teff only. Phenolic acids (600-728 mu g/g) were mostly present in bound fractions, dominated by ferulic acid. Polyphenol profiles of Ethiopian and USA grown grains were similar. The high levels of the relatively rare flavones in teff may have important implications in chronic disease prevention.

AB Fish-oil (FO) was encapsulated with hydroxypropylcelullose (HPC) by conventional spray-drying with water (FO-water) and solvent spray-drying with ethanol (FO-EtOH), methanol (FO-MeOH) and acetone (FO-Acet) in order to study the effect of the solvent on the encapsulation efficiency (EE), microparticle properties and stability of FO during storage at 40 degrees C. Results showed that FO-Acet presented the highest EE of FO (92.0%), followed by FO-EtOH (80.4%), FO-MeOH (75.0%) and FO-water (71.1%). A decrease of the dielectric constant increased the EE of FO, promoting triglyceride-polymer interactions instead of oil-in-water emulsion retention. FO release profile in aqueous model was similar for all FO-microparticles, releasing only the surface FO, according to Higuchi model. Oxidative stability of FO significantly improved by spray-drying with MeOH, both in surface and encapsulated oil fractions. In conclusion, encapsulation of FO by solvent spray-drying can be proposed as an alternative technology for encapsulation of hydrophobic molecules.

AB The effects of steaming wheat kernels on lipolytic degradation of resulting whole flour was studied by quantifying enzyme activities and lipid degradation products during storage. Lipase, lipoxygenase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase activities were decreased by up to 81%, 63%, 22%, and 34%, respectively, as the time of steaming increased up to 90 s. Steaming had no effect on starch and gluten properties. Upon storage free fatty acids decreased with respect to time of steaming. Time of steaming did not affect lipid oxidation in flour; however, total carbonyls produced in dough made from stored flour were decreased with the increase in steaming duration. Thus, steaming wheat kernels prior to milling reduced lipase activity and consequently hydrolytic rancidity during storage without affecting starch and gluten fractions. Steam treatment did not affect oxidative rancidity in flour during storage, but did reduce oxidation once the flour was made into a dough.

AB The Gyeongsang Basin is the largest among the non-marine Cretaceous sedimentary basins in Korea and Japan, formed by sinistral strike-slip movement induced by the oblique subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate under the eastern Asian continental margin, and has an evolutionary history of about sixty million years. SHRIMP and LA-MC-ICPMS U-Pb analyses were performed on the detrital zircons separated from the constituent formations of the Gyeongsang Basin. We determined the maximum depositional ages of the four formations based on their ages of the youngest groups as follows; 118.0 +/- 2.6 Ma (n = 4) for the Hasandong Formation, 108.7 +/- 0.8 Ma (n = 11) for the Chilgok Formation, 106.0 +/- 0.2 Ma (n = 63) for the Silla Conglomerate, 105.4 +/- 0.4 Ma (n = 14) for the Haman Formation, and 99.9 +/- 0.7 Ma (n = 5) for the Jindong Formation, belonging to the period from Aptian to Cenomanian. The pre-Cretaceous detrital zircons of the lower to middle Gyeongsang Supergroup indicate their derivation from the Yeongnam Massif and the Okcheon Metamorphic Belt surrounding the Gyeongsang Basin. At around 115 Ma, as reflected as enhanced proportion of such ages in the detrital zircons and occurrence of farther inland igneous activities, the tectonic environment of Gyeongsang Basin changed to intra-arc due to the more active reestablishment of subduction-related igneous activity. However, the upper Gyeongsang Supergroup has a new age component of the mid-Permian, along with changes in the direction of paleocurrent flowing from the northeast and east, indicating sediment supply from SW Japan with rocks of that age. The changes in the direction of the paleocurrent flow seem to indicate that the center of igneous activity has moved in the direction of the subduction zone to the east. As the intensity of igneous activity continued to increase, the Gyeongsang Basin was closed by the filling of the basin by volcanic activity. The Cretaceous basins of the Korean Peninsula and southwest Japan show similar evolutionary histories, suggesting a type model of the creation and the evolution of basin around the continental margin subduction zone; creation of sedimentary basin by pull-apart or rifting in the backarc region, evolution to intra-arc basin by the landward progress of subduction-related igneous activity, and finally the closure of the basin due to the advent of highly enhanced igneous activity.

AB New paleoseismological and archaeoseismological data from the western Issyk-Kul basin of Kyrgyzstan (northern Tien Shan) provide new insights on active fault in the actively-deforming, basement-involved thrust system of Central Asia. Newly discovered fault scarps follow south-and north-dipping thrust faults which delineate the Kyrgyz and Kungey ranges bordering the Issyk-Kul basin. Motion on these faults generated earthquakes with magnitudes 6.2-7.6 and MSK-64 shaking intensities VIII-XI. Deformation observed in the zone of the Toguz-Bulak fault results from two Holocene earthquakes and another event that occurred about 8000 yr BP. Two more events, at 13,000 and 3000 yr BP, deformed the northeastern periphery of the Kyzyl-Ompul Uplift. Archaeoseismological research in the Northern Sary-Bulun settlement in the western periphery of the Boz-Barmak Uplift, revealed traces of another earthquake of MSK-64 shaking intensity I >= VIII dating back to the 12th Century. The obtained data correlates well with results of previous paleoseismological and archeoseismological studies. They show that in the northern Tien Shan there were clusters of strong earthquakes with ages of 14-13, 8, 4-3 ka ago and in the 11-12th centuries AD divided by periods of 4-5 ka. We infer that coseismic slip on these faults may have formed a tectonic dam at the edge of the basin through growth of the Boz-Barmalc Uplift, and this darn ultimately deflected the Chu River into its modern channel which bypasses the lake. Lacustrine sediments in the northeastern periclinal segment of the Boz-Barmak Uplift bear signatures of soft-sediment deformation structures (seismites) corresponding to seven M >= 5-5.5 (I >= VI-VII) earthquakes timed at about 20,000 yr BP.

AB The Jiaodong Peninsula has a complex evolution process in terms of its geological structure. The Tanlu fault zone, Penglai-Qixia fault system, Muping-Jimo fault zone, and Penglai-Weihai fault zone have a noticeable control effect on the seismic activity of the region. A number of medium-strong earthquakes occurred in the past, where Yantai coastal earthquakes are relatively concentrated, with a clustering phenomenon. The distribution law of the in situ stress field is analyzed based on 86 sets of measured data at depths from 109 m to 970 m after optimization in the Sanshandao gold mine of Laizhou, Xincheng gold mine of Laizhou, Linglong gold mine of Zhaoyuan, Pingdu, Qingdao, and Wendeng sub-areas of the region. The fault activity in accordance with the Coulomb friction failure criterion and relationship between the stress field and geological structures is discussed. The results indicate that the in situ stress state of the region is dominated by horizontal tectonic stresses. The stress regime is primarily dominated by the strike-slip regime within the range of the measured depths. The maximum horizontal principal stress is predominantly oriented in the NWW-SEE or near-EW direction, which is generally in agreement with the orientation interpreted by focal mechanism solutions and is basically consistent with those of the regional tectonic stress field generated from the movement of the surrounding tectonic plates. The stress state of the region is basically consistent with the crustal frictional strength range that is predicated using the Coulomb friction failure criterion, with a friction coefficient of 0.2-1.0.

AB This study has examined how the sedimentary processes in the prevalent non-deltaic coastal marine environments along the southeast coast of China have responded to sea-level change and other environmental drivers during the Holocene. Three sediment cores collected from a shallow marine embayment of the Lantau Island, Hong Kong, on the northern coast of the South China Sea, were analyzed. The results of particle size, total organic carbon content, organic carbon and nitrogen ratios, organic carbon stable isotope ratios, abundance of alkenones and radiocarbon dating of these cores have helped reconstruct the sedimentary history of this site. This history shares the similarity in sedimentary processes within the deltaic environment for the early Holocene, because palaeo-incised channels exist in both environments. The first 1500 years of deposition involved rapid channel infill caused by the rapidly rising sea level and strong monsoon-driven discharge. This was followed by a period of decelerated sedimentation under strong marine influence as the sea flooded the wide accommodation space in the subsequent two millennia. Major differences between the two environmental settings occur in the past 7000 years: vertical accretion was seen in the non-deltaic coastal environment, whilst lateral shoreline advance was the dominant process in the deltaic basin. The progressively slowing down in sedimentation rate in the non-deltaic site during the middle and late Holocene was caused by the reduced monsoon discharge, intensified disturbance from tropical cyclone activity and coastal currents.

AB The seismo-ionospheric density anomalies have been widely studied for last decades based on ground GPS and satellite in situ observations. In this paper, we analyze both ion density and ion velocity observed by the French satellite DEMETER before 49 earthquakes with M >= 6.5 in 2010. The results show that both ion density and ion velocity increase anomalously before the earthquakes. The differences before and after earthquakes are more significant with larger magnitude and shallower depth. The density variations have a positive correlation with the perpendicular velocity, which is related to the perpendicular electric field by E-perpendicular to = V perpendicular to B0 (B-0 is the back- ground geomagnetic field). The slopes of Delta N-i/N-i (in units of %) vs. V-perpendicular to (in units of m/s) ranges from 0.13 to 0.7. This suggests that the ion density variation is associated with the presence of ion velocity or electric field in the ionosphere. The observed peak perpendicular velocity can reach 300-1300 m/s before the earthquakes, corresponding to a perpendicular electric field E-perpendicular to approximate to 7.5-32.5 mV/m.

TI Contemporary sea level rise rates around Malaysia: Altimeter data
   optimization for assessing coastal impact
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Sea level rise; Satellite altimeter; Malaysian seas
AB The increase of anthropogenic activities has triggered global sea level rise to threaten many low-lying and unprotected coastal areas. Without measures, global sea levels will continue to rise at an accelerating rate in the 21st century. This paper quantifies sea level trends around the Malaysian seas using measurements from multiple altimeter missions over 1993-2015. Sea level anomalies (SLAs) are determined using data from the Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS) covering 8 altimeter missions. We use an enhanced processing strategy to optimize sea surface heights from RADS for the derivation of SLAs, including filtering, data gridding and moving average. Tidal height measurements at eight tide gauge stations around Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia are used to assess SLAs from altimetry. Our assessment results in similar patterns of SLAs, high correlation coefficients (> 0.9) and small (few cm) root mean square differences (RMSE) between SLAs from altimetry and tide gauges over the same period. Sea level trends are determined by the robust fit regression analysis for the SLA time series. Our result shows that sea level rise trends around Malaysia range from 3.27 +/- 0.12 mm yr(-1) off eastern Malaysia to 4.95 +/- 0.15 mm yr(-1) west of Malaysia. Over 1993-2015, the mean rising rate around Malaysia is 4.22 +/- 0.12 mm yr(-1), and the cumulative sea level rise is 0.05 m. This paper predicts the impact of such rising sea levels on environment, urban planning and climatology in the coastal areas of Malaysia.

AB To identify metasomatic overprints in the mantle xenoliths from the Tethys orogenic belt in NW Turkey, we report here in situ Li concentrations and isotopic compositions of olivine, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene along with major element compositions of minerals, and whole-rock trace element compositions of the mantle xenoliths composed of refractory harzburgites with subordinate lherzolites and one olivine-websterite. Their non-depleted whole-rock light rare earth element (LREE) patterns, enrichment in large ion lithophile elements and depletion of high field strength elements, imply subduction-related metasomatism, while the Y-depletion may indicate the derivation of the metasomatic melts/fluids from a garnet-bearing source. Minerals from all the xenoliths display homogeneous major element compositions, however they show large intra- and inter-mineral Li elemental and isotopic variations. The Li contents of olivines range from 1.45 to 2.81 ppm with large variations in delta Li-7 values (+ 1.2 to + 17.5 parts per thousand). The orthopyroxenes have variable Li contents (0.07-16.6 ppm) and delta Li-7 values (-71.6 to + 10.8960), with higher Li contents and lower delta(7) Li values in their cores. The clinopyroxenes show variable Li contents (2.16-22.0 ppm) and delta(7) Li values (-54.6 to + 1.9 parts per thousand), with commonly higher Li contents and lower delta Li-7 values in their cores. The Li-isotopic zonation observed in most pyroxene grains is most likely a recent overprint of subduction-related fluids. By contrast, olivines with fairly homogeneous low Li contents compared to pyroxenes appear to be less affected by the metasomatic melts/fluids. The correlation between delta Li-7 values and the forsterite contents of olivines, along with the preferential uptake of Li in pyroxenes, and the presence of light Li isotopic compositions in the cores of pyroxenes, indicate the influence of silicate melt-rock interaction. We interpret these results as evidence for a metasomatic overprint predating the zonation in the Tethys orogenic belt of NW Turkey. Thus, both the recent fluid metasomatism and earlier silicate melt metasomatism are strongly related with the successive subduction of the Tethyan oceanic plate.

AB A robust and efficient density-based finite volume method is developed for solving the six-equation single pressure system of two-phase flows at all speeds on hybrid unstructured grids. Unlike conventional approaches where an expensive exact Riemann solver is normally required for computing numerical fluxes at the two-phase interfaces in addition to AUSM-type fluxes for single-phase interfaces in order to maintain stability and robustness in cases involving interactions of strong pressure and void-fraction discontinuities, a volume-fraction coupling term for the AUSM(+)-up fluxes is introduced in this work to impart the required robustness without the need of the exact Riemann solver. The resulting method is significantly less expensive in regions where otherwise the Riemann solver would be invoked. A transformation from conservative variables to primitive variables is presented and the primitive variables are then solved in the implicit method in order for the current finite volume method to be able to solve, effectively and efficiently, low Mach number flows in traditional multiphase applications, which otherwise is a great challenge for the standard density-based algorithms. A number of benchmark test cases are presented to assess the performance and robustness of the developed finite volume method for both inviscid and viscous two-phase flow problems. The numerical results indicate that the current density-based method provides an attractive and viable alternative to its pressure-based counterpart for compressible two-phase flows at all speeds.

AB To compute the non-oscillating mutual interaction for a system with N points, the fast multipole method (FMM) has an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of points. Specifically, for Coulomb interaction, FMM can be constructed using either the spherical harmonic functions or the totally symmetric Cartesian tensors. In this paper, we will present that the efficiency of the Cartesian tensor based FMM for the Coulomb interaction can be significantly improved by implementing the traces of the Cartesian tensors in calculation to reduce the independent elements of the n-th rank totally symmetric Cartesian tensor from (n+ 1)(n + 2)/2 to 2n + 1. The computation complexity for the operations in FMM are analyzed and expressed as polynomials of the highest rank of the Cartesian tensors. For most operations, the complexity is reduced by one order. Numerical examples regarding the convergence and the efficiency of the new algorithm are demonstrated. A reduction of computation time up to 50% has been observed for moderate number of points and rank of tensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents constrained numerical optimization of high-order linearly and algebraically stable diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta methods. After satisfying the desired order conditions, undetermined coefficients are optimized with respect to objective functions which consider accuracy, stability, and computational cost. Constraints are applied during the optimization to enforce stability properties, to ensure a well-conditioned method, and to limit the domain of the abscissa. Two promising third-order methods are derived using this approach, labelled SDIRK[3,(1,2,2)](3)L_14 and SDIRK[3,1](4)L_SA_5. Both optimized schemes have a good balance of properties. The relative error norm of the latter, the L-2-norm scaled by a function of the number of implicit stages, is a factor of two smaller than comparable methods found in the literature. Variations on these methods are discussed relative to trade-offs in their accuracy and stability properties. A novel fifth-order scheme SDIRK[5,1](5)L_02 is derived with a significantly lower relative error norm than the comparable fifth-order A-stable reference method. In addition, the optimized scheme is L-stable. The accuracy and relative efficiency of the Runge-Kutta methods are verified through numerical simulation of van der Pol's equation, as well as numerical simulation of vortex shedding in the laminar wake of a circular cylinder, and in the turbulent wake of a NACA 0012 airfoil. These results demonstrate the value of numerical optimization for selecting undetermined coefficients in the construction of high-order Runge-Kutta methods with a balance between competing objectives.
