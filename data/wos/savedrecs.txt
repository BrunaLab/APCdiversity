AB Multilevel thresholding is one of the most popular approaches used for image segmentation. Several methods have been used to find the threshold values; however, metaheuristic (MH) methods achieve better results than the other classical methods. Nevertheless, each metaheuristic method has its limitation such as high computation; moreover, it can suffer from premature convergence when the level of the threshold increases. To solve this problem, there is a trend to hybridize the MH algorithms together; however, there are several MH algorithms that can be combined. Consequently, we need to seriously determine which combination and number of such algorithms must be combined. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent framework that provides experts with a tool for solving the problem through selecting a suitable number of swarm algorithms from eleven such algorithms. The proposed method, which is called swarm selection (SS), distributes the eleven algorithms into two groups, the first of which is called the control group and only contains the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The aim of the DE algorithm in the control group is to determine the best combination of the other ten algorithms in the second group. Meanwhile, the selected algorithms in the second group work together to find the optimal threshold values that maximize the Otsu function. A series of experiments have been performed on six test images using nine threshold levels. The performance of the proposed SS method is compared with the other three hybrid algorithms and two non-hybrid algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SS method outperforms the other image segmentation methods in terms of the performance measures, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity index (SSIM), fitness function value and computational time. In addition, by using this intelligent framework, experts performing applications that depend on image segmentation will save computational time in identifying suitable methods.

AB Background: Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders.
   Method: In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier.
   Results: Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naive Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

ID CONCEPT DRIFT
AB When concept drift is detected during classification in a data stream, a common remedy is to retrain a framework's classifier. However, this loses useful information if the classifier has learnt the current concept well, and this concept will recur again in the future. Some frameworks retain and reuse classifiers, but it can be time-consuming to select an appropriate classifier to reuse. These frameworks rarely match the accuracy of state-of-the-art ensemble approaches. For many data stream tasks, speed is important: fast, accurate frameworks are needed for time-dependent applications. We propose the Enhanced Concept Profiling Framework (ECPF), which aims to recognise recurring concepts and reuse a classifier trained previously, enabling accurate classification immediately following a drift. The novelty of ECPF is in how it uses similarity of classifications on new data, between a new classifier and existing classifiers, to quickly identify the best classifier to reuse. It always trains both a new classifier and a reused classifier, and retains the more accurate classifier when concept drift occurs. Finally, it creates a copy of reused classifiers, so a classifier well-suited for a recurring concept will not be impacted by being trained on a different concept. In our experiments, ECPF classifies significantly more accurately than a state-of-the-art classifier reuse framework (Diversity Pool) and a state-of-the-art ensemble technique (Adaptive Random Forest) on synthetic datasets with recurring concepts. It classifies real-world datasets five times faster than Diversity Pool, and six times faster than Adaptive Random Forest and is not significantly less accurate than either. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the lack of objective measures, the evaluation and prioritization of clustering methods is inherently challenging. Since their evaluation generally involves numerous criteria, it can be designed as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and using multiple data sets, the problem can be formulated as a group MCDM modeling.
   In this paper, a MCDM-based framework is proposed to evaluate and rank a number of clustering methods. The proposed approach employs three group MCDM algorithms and a Borda count method which leads to a comprehensive, robust framework capable of evaluating and ranking multiple clustering models on manifold data sets (cases). Moreover, we introduce a hybrid data clustering algorithm which combines a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with a K-means clustering algorithm. Finally, a clustering comparison with regard to both external and internal evaluation indicators is another contribution of this paper.
   Six clustering methods are compared based on five evaluation measures. The results of comparative experiments on ten data sets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid clustering method. More importantly, the experimental results vividly demonstrate the effectiveness of the group MCDM-based evaluation on clustering model selection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Weighted Superposition Attraction (WSA) is a swarm based metaheuristic algorithm that is lately proposed for solving continuous optimization problems. Performance of the WSA was comprehensively tested with numerous unconstrained/constrained optimization problems. Due to its reasonable performance on continuous optimization problems we were motivated to develop a combinatorial version of WSA. A new method is devised to handle combinatorial problems without requiring an indirect representation mechanism like random keys. A random walk procedure is integrated into the combinatoric WSA (cWSA) so as to improve its diversification capability. Additionally, opposition based learning is also integrated into cWSA to increase its performance further. Performance of cWSA is tested on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) and the Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP). The results of the extensive computational study point out the efficiency of the proposed cWSA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The goal of this work is the classification of Electronic Health Records using Natural Language Techniques. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) convey valuable clinical information, as diagnoses and patient conditions. We explore several Deep Learning classification models for assigning multiple ICD codes to clinical documents. Within the framework of data mining, the aim of multi-label classification is to associate each instance with a set of labels.
   Methods: The multi-label classification is typically carried out based on multiple independent classifiers, in the so-called binary relevance learning approach. Nevertheless, diseases tend to be co-related, independent classifiers are unable to model relationships and do not guarantee the consistency of the predicted label-set. To tackle this, we investigate three Neural Network architectures. We study models that are capable of capturing and modeling label dependencies on the output layer. Moreover, learning from data with low label-density is an inherent challenge in multi-label classification. Thorough experiments were conducted to assess each architecture under different scenarios, varying the language, amount of data and label-density.
   Results: The results showed that the Bi-GRU model outperform the DNN and both overcome the baseline (BLR). We observed better results with MIMIC than with Osakidetza corpus. Experimental results showed that as the label-density decreases the prediction task becomes harder. It seems that label-density is very much related to the learning ability of the neural networks and another important factor that affects the inference is the amount of training data.
   Conclusions: The contributions of this work are: (a) a comparison among three classification approaches based on Neural Networks on data sets in English and Spanish to cope with the multi-label classification problem and (b) the study of the impact of label-density in prediction capabilities in the multi-label context.

AB A prominent pathfinding challenge is the fast computation of path plans in large virtual terrain environments used in simulation systems. Based on a hierarchical approach for pathfinding and terrain representation, this work details the design, the implementation and the test of a quadtree-based structure in the irregular grid navigation map representation of large realistic virtual terrain environments. To achieve this goal, it is described how a hierarchical global A* pathfinding algorithm searches for a path in a coarse initial irregular grid structure then proceeding with the search in refined regions of interest where obstacles are found. Thus, the proposed solution presents as major contribution the enhanced quadtree-based map representation for pathfinding in large virtual terrains. The pathfinding response time of this solution is statistically compared with different hierarchical/non-hierarchical and regular/irregular terrain representation structures instantiated in the modeling of "small" realistic terrain scenarios. After these experiments, similar ones are developed in a massive (large) virtual terrain inserted into a real-life simulation system for the development of military tactical training exercises. The results show that the response time required to generate pathfinding results can be reduced when the proposed global pathfinding technique over the quadtree-based hierarchical and irregular navigation map representation of the large virtual terrain is explored in the development of simulation systems.

AB Since its introduction, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) has been widely used in a number of areas. The parameters in the model have an important influence on the performance of KELM. Therefore, model parameters must be properly adjusted before they can be put into practical use. This study proposes a new parameter learning strategy based on an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) strategy, in which a new hierarchical mechanism was established to improve the stochastic behavior, and exploration capability of grey wolves. In the proposed mechanism, random local search around the optimal grey wolf was introduced in Beta grey wolves, and random global search was introduced in Omega grey wolves. The effectiveness of IGWO strategy is first validated on 10 commonly used benchmark functions. Results have shown that the proposed IGWO can find good balance between exploration and exploitation. In addition, when IGWO is applied to solve the parameter adjustment problem of KELM model, it also provides better performance than other seven meta-heuristic algorithms in three practical applications, including students' second major selection, thyroid cancer diagnosis and financial stress prediction. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can serve as a good candidate tool for tuning the parameters of KELM, thus enabling the KELM model to achieve more promising results in practical applications.

AB As a result of the challenge posed by demographic aging and the important personal and medical costs associated to falls of elderly people, the study of automatic Fall Detection Systems (FDS) has gained significant research attention during the last decade. Due to the intrinsic difficulty of identifying falls with a deterministic or a simple threshold-based method, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and other machine learning strategies have been largely employed by the literature as the detection algorithms. This paper thoroughly revises and analyzes those papers in the literature that have proposed a FDS that is partly or entirely based on the use of an ANN. The study, which is focused on wearable devices (as they normally impose higher battery and computing restrictions), discusses the most recent trends in the application of neural architectures to the problem of automatic detection. In this regard, the analysis reveals that the related literature has normally emphasized the maximization of the detection performance, while disregarding some methodological, operative implementation-related issues of utmost importance for the assessment of the actual feasibility of these applications. In particular, the investigation shows that cross validating the detection methods with public benchmarking datasets is gaining importance in recent works. Conversely, the practical problems related to the use of wearables (consumption of power and computing resources, configuration and limitations of the sensing units and the wireless transmissions, etc.) are still normally disregarded.

AB The periodic vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is an important problem in the logistics field and involves finding the solutions to two sub-problems, namely (1) determining the optimal customer service mode; and (2) establishing the optimal vehicle routing schedule in accordance with the pre-determined customer service mode. However, existing solutions for the PVRP consider only the vehicle routing problem. In other words, they simply assume that the optimal customer service mode is known in advance. Accordingly, the present study proposes a dual particle swarm optimization (PSO) framework for solving both sub-problems simultaneously. In particular, a discrete PSO (DPSO) algorithm is applied on the first level, in the outer layer, to establish the optimal service mode for each customer, and a neural-like DPSO (NDPSO) is then applied in the inner layer to determine (1) the optimal assignment of the depot vehicles to the customers which are to be serviced each day based on the customer service mode established in the outer layer (i.e., the "customer-vehicle correspondence" problem), and (2) the sequence of customer visits to be paid by each vehicle each day (i.e., the "optimal vehicle routing" problem). For both PSOs, a sweep heuristic is applied to generate diverse initial solutions for the particle search process. In addition, an alternative depot savings algorithm is proposed to avoid the route crossing phenomenon inherent in conventional vehicle routing algorithms. The performance of the inner layer NDPSO is evaluated by comparing the solutions for six common PVRPs with the best known solutions (BKS) presented in the literature given a prior knowledge of the optimal customer service mode in every case. The performance of the NDPSO is further investigated with and without the alternative depot savings algorithm and with and without the use of a local search mechanism to enhance the quality of the PSO solutions, respectively. Finally, the feasibility of the full DPSO and NDPSO framework is confirmed by comparing the PVRP solutions with the BKS reported in previous studies. In general, the results confirm the validity of the proposed dual-PSO framework as a tool for finding optimal solutions to both the customer service mode problem and the optimal vehicle routing problem in typical PVRPs.

AB Pedestrian abnormal trajectory understanding based on video surveillance systems can improve public safety. However, manually identifying pedestrian abnormal trajectories is usually a prohibitive workload. The objective of this study is to propose an automatic method for understanding pedestrian abnormal trajectories. An improved sparse representation model, namely information entropy constrained trajectory representation method (IECTR), is developed for pedestrian trajectory classification. It aims to reduce the entropy for trajectory representation and to obtain superior analyzing results. In the proposed method, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is embedded in the expectation maximization (EM) method to iteratively obtain the selection probabilities and the sparse coefficients. In addition, the lower-bound sparser condition of L-p-minimization (0 < p < 1) is applied in the proposed method to guarantee salient solutions. In order to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method, classification experiments are conducted using five pedestrian trajectory datasets. The results show that the identification accuracy of the proposed method is superior to the compared methods, including naive Bayes classifier (NBC), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and typical sparse representationbased methods.

AB The standard Differential Evolution Algorithm (sDE) is a stochactic search method commonly used in evolutionary computing. The problem solving success of sDE is highly sensitive to the genetic operators used and the initial values of the parameters of these operators. Since a universal Differential Evolution Algorithm (uDE) is not sensitive to the structure and parameter values of the genetic operators used, it is parameter-free in practice and easier to control than sDE. uDE does not need a trial-and-error process when selecting the genetic operators and initial values of intrinsic parameter of related genetic operators to solve the problem, unlike the sDE. Therefore, the use and adaptation of a uDE to solve different types of numerical engineering problems is easy and time-consuming compared to sDE. in this paper, a new uDE, Bernstain-Search Differential Evolution Algorithm (BSD), is introduced. BSD is new and easily controllable, simple structured, non-recursive, highly efficient, fast and practically parameter-free uDE. BSD have a too feasible random crossover and mutation process and does not have a control-parameter setting process, contrary to sDE and its improved variants. In this paper, 30 benchmark problems of CEC'2014, 60 classic benchmark problems, image evolution problems for 12 test images and one Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) refinement problem were used in the experiments performed to investigate the problem solving success of BSD, statistically. Four tested methods (i.e., ABC, JADE, CUCKOO, WDE) were used in the conducted experiments. Problem solving successes of BSD and tested methods were statistically compared by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test piecewisely. Results obtained from the performed tests showed that in general, problem solving success of BSD is statistically better than the tested methods that have been used in this paper.

AB The automated diagnosis of control charts to detect faults is a problem studied by many researchers. In recent years, they have turned their attention to processes that do not fulfil the condition of having normally, identically and independently distributed (NIID) variables. With those processes, it is common to have one or more manipulatable variables that can affect the quality characteristic under investigation. The Engineering Process Control (EPC) approach is often used to minimise the variance around the target value of the monitored characteristic by adjusting the manipulatable variables. In this work, a control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) system was developed for processes adjusted by EPC (also known as SPC-EPC or feedback-control processes). This issue of identification of simple control chart patterns for feedback-control processes had previously not been studied. A Machine Learning algorithm was proposed to train a pattern recognition system. All the possible combinations of factors of the CCPR system were studied to determine the combination yielding the highest recognition accuracy, namely, using raw data as input, generating patterns with significance level alpha = 0.01, monitoring the output signal, and employing a Proportional Integrative Derivative (PID) controller and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. This combination yielded overall accuracies of 94.18% and 94.14% for the AR(1) and ARMA(1,1 ) models, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analytical games appear to be a promising tool to support KA. In fact, in this paper we describe how analytical games could be used for Knowledge Engineering of Bayesian networks, through the presentation of the case study of the Reliability Game. This game has been developed with the aim of collecting data on the impact of meta-knowledge about sources of information upon human Situational Assessment in a maritime context. In this paper we describe the computational model obtained from the dataset and how the card positions, which reflect a player belief, can be easily converted in subjective probabilities and used to learn latent constructs, such as the source reliability, by applying the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm.

AB TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a popular decision-making technique used to rank a discrete set of alternatives based on the premise that a good alternative should simultaneously have the shortest distance from a positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from a negative ideal solution. Sometimes, ambiguity or impreciseness in the decision information may lead a decision maker to raise questions about the robustness of the recommendation of a TOPSIS based decision-making model. To address the concerns of the decision maker, this paper therefore proposes a sensitivity and stability analysis framework to address the robustness of the recommendations and the different achievable targets set by the decision maker. Specifically, we analyze the effect of a change in the rating of an alternative under a criterion and determine the appropriate conditions to predict how the closeness coefficients change. Through this analysis, we investigate the minimal performance change that is required in an alternative's rating under a criterion to achieve a particular target set by decision maker when the rest of the decision information set remains unaltered. An algorithm is provided to find the set of criteria whereby changing a criterion of a alternative, it can obtain another alternative's rank. We investigate the behaviour of the closeness coefficient of an alternative when a criterion rating changes, and provide two algorithms to identify the upper and lower-rank achievable alternatives. Subsequently, we describe the rank reversal of a pair of alternatives and introduce the concept of a rank sensitive interval. A numerical example on university ranking is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the high costs to obtain human generated activity data and the ubiquitous similarities between activity modes, it can be more efficient to borrow information from existing activity recognition models than to collect more data to train a new model from scratch when only a few data are available for model training. The proposed few-shot human activity recognition method leverages a deep learning model for feature extraction and classification while knowledge transfer is performed in the manner of model parameter transfer. In order to alleviate negative transfer, a metric is proposed to measure cross-domain class-wise relevance so that knowledge of higher relevance is assigned larger weights during knowledge transfer. Promising results in extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to remove the noise effectively and obtain the high quality denoised image, the new image denoising algorithm is proposed based on improved convolutional neural network with joint loss function (MP-DCNN). Firstly, the end to end adaptive residual convolutional neural network is constructed by using adaptive convolutional and residual learning for modeling the noisy image. Secondly, the input noise image features are extracted by adaptive convolution and leaky rectified linear units (Leaky ReLU) active function in the first half of the network, and then the image features reconstruction is performed by the other structure and convolutional operation of the network. Finally, the initial denoised image is obtained using the mean square error (MSE) loss function which can learn and optimize the extracted feature. Meanwhile, the initial denoising image is input to the pre-trained SegNet which can obtain a better learn of the image edge information. The final denoised image is obtained by using the perceptive loss function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image denoising algorithm, the performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified on a variety of noise levels. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior performance both in visual quality and two evaluation indexes such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), compared with other state-of-the-art denoising algorithms. Especially for high noisy environment with a noise standard deviation of 60, the algorithm finally obtains 24.26 dB of average PSNR in the test dataset. Its average PSNR is about 0.5 dB and 1 dB higher than DnCNN and BM3D, respectively. At the same time, the proposed method obtain denoising image with no boundary artifact finally. The proposed algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the image denoising system from the perspective of expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) is a recently proposed evolutionary-type algorithm which has shown promising results to tackle many complex optimization problems. This paper discusses the performance of this meta-heuristic in Unequal Area Facility Layout Problems (UA-FLPs). The UA-FLP is an important problem in industrial production, which considers a rectangular region and a set of rectangular facilities. These facilities must be allocated in the plant in the most adequate way satisfying certain constraints. The Flexible Bay Structure has been selected in order to represent solutions for the UA-FLP in the proposed CRO algorithm. In this paper, we detail the implementation of the algorithm and provide the results of different tests in several UA-FLP instances with different size and setting. The obtained results confirm the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in solving UA-FLPs, improving alternative algorithms devoted to this problem in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a recurrent neural network (RNN) which is improved by using an efficient discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for predicting a high-frequency time series. In the combined DWT-RNN model, first, a multiresolution based on B-spline wavelet of high order d (BSd) is used to decompose the time series into several smooth data sets. Therefore, an approximation data set (with low-frequency) and several detail data sets (with high-frequency), with small wave amplitude, are obtained. Then, all decomposed components are used as RNN inputs. The proposed BSd-RNN model can approximate smooth patterns with satisfactory accuracy, and because of the local properties, BSd is a better choice than other common DWT such as Haar and Daubechies of order n (dbn), for preprocessing the high-frequency time series. According to results of performance metrics for predicting four different stock indices, the BSd-RNN model outperforms other common DWT-RNN model such as Haar-RNN and dbn-RNN. Also, the results show the BSd-RNN model outperforms other common artificial neural network (ANN) model such as multilayer feed-forward neural network (FFNN). Finally, The results show that BS3-RNN predicting model has better predictive ability than other compared models which use other wavelets or other ANNs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The cold-start problem is one of the critical challenges in personalized recommender systems. A lot of existing work has been studied to exploit a user-item rating matrix as well as additional information for users/items, e.g., user profiles, item contents, and social relationships among users. However, because existing work is primarily biased to the auxiliary information for users/items, it is difficult to identify various and reliable item neighbors that are relevant to cold-start items. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a new crowd-enabled framework, called CrowdStart, which is an integrated human-machine approach for new item recommendation. The main contributions of the CrowdStart framework are twofold: (1) To find various and reliable item neighbors for new items, we design two-step crowdsourcing tasks that harness not only machine-only algorithms but also the knowledge of crowd workers (including a few experts and a large number of non-expert workers in a crowdsourcing platform). (2) We develop a novel hybrid model to exploit the user-item rating matrix, the content information about items, and the crowd-based item neighbors from human knowledge into new item recommendation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CrowdStart framework, we conduct extensive experiments including both a user study and simulation tests. Through the empirical study, we found that the CrowdStart framework provides relevant, diverse, reliable, and explainable crowd-based neighbors for new items and the crowd-based neighbors are meaningful for improving the accuracy of new item recommendation.

AB Recently, evolutionary multi-tasking (EMT) has surfaced as a new search paradigm in the field of evolutionary computation to solve two or more tasks simultaneously. EMT algorithms accelerate the convergence of multiple optimization tasks by sharing useful knowledge among tasks, i.e., knowledge transfer is the key to the success of EMT algorithms. However, as the evolutionary search proceeds, the learnability of one task to others might decrease and the knowledge transfer becomes less efficient. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm by hybridizing two complementary strategies, namely genetic transform strategy and hyper-rectangle search strategy (MFEA-GHS). The proposed genetic transform strategy is applied in individual reproduction and aims to strengthen the knowledge transfer efficiency. Particularly, if two parent individuals are specific to different tasks, one parent individual is transformed to fit the other task by task space mapping. As such, higher-quality offspring individuals towards a target task can be generated with the transformed individual. The hyper-rectangle search strategy based on opposition learning is designed to perform efficient exploration and exploitation in both the unified search space and the sub-space of each task, which enables the population to search more unexplored regions. Comprehensive experiments are carried out on both single-and multi-objective EMT optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of MFEA-GHS and the two proposed strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The financial liberalization and globalization have increased the need for expert and intelligent systems to deal with credit risk management works. Clustering algorithms are widely used for knowledge acquisition in such systems to assess the credit risk from a data point of view. Conventional clustering algorithms fall short in credit risk assessment because credit datasets are typically high-dimensional, class-imbalanced, and with large sample size. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel evolutionary multi-objective soft subspace clustering (EMOSSC) algorithm for credit risk assessment. Firstly, we develop a soft subspace clustering validity index for credit risk assessment, by which we can detect the underlying subspace for each cluster from the entire high-dimensional feature space, and we also incorporate the weight of each cluster and the between-cluster separation into the clustering validity index to obtain a comprehensive data structure in the clustering process. Secondly, we propose to optimize the clustering criteria of the new clustering validity index simultaneously by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm without any predefined weighting coefficients, which guarantees the robustness of the algorithm. We also further provide a local search strategy which significantly accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. Thirdly, we design a GPU-based parallel computation framework for updating the weights of features in our proposed algorithm to improve the computational efficiency on credit datasets with large sample size. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experiment, with its results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in credit risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the financial portfolio selection (FPS) problem, the investor usually considers several conflicting objectives such as return, risk, and liquidity. The values of these objectives are often provided by the investor who keeps inaccurate information and states his/her considerations subjectively. In order to deal with such a situation, we will propose a combined possibility theory and goal programming model (GP) allowing to consider tradeoffs between investor's preferences regarding several incommensurable objectives in an imprecise environment. The aim of this paper is to formulate a multi-objective FPS approach involving fuzzy parameters, where possibility distributions are given by fuzzy numbers from the information supplied by the decision-making environment (investor, analyst, financial market environment, etc.). Moreover, the investor's preferences will be explicitly incorporated through the concept of satisfaction functions. The proposed model is applied to FPS within the Tunisian stock exchange market and discussed in comparison with other portfolio selection procedures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research develops an expert system to addresses a novel problem in the literature of buffer allocation and production lines. We investigate real-world unreliable unbalanced production lines where all time-based parameters are probabilistic including time between parts arrivals, processing times, time between failures, repairing times, and setup times. The main contributions of the paper are a twofold. First and foremost, the mean processing times of workstations and buffer capacities, unlike the existing literature, are considered as decision variables in a multi-objective optimization problem which maximizes the throughput rate and minimizes the total buffer capacities as well as the total cost of the mean process time reductions. Secondly, an efficient methodology is developed that can precisely reflect a real-world system without any unrealistic and/or restrictive assumptions on the probabilistic nature of the system, which are commonly assumed in the existing literature. One of the greatest challenges in this research is to estimate the throughput rate function since it highly depends on the random behavior of the system. Thus, a simulation optimization approach is developed based on the Design of Experiments and Response Surface Methodology to fit a regression model for throughput rate. Finally, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Non-dominated Ranked Genetic Algorithm (NRGA) are used to generate high-quality solutions for the aforementioned problem. This methodology is run on a real numerical case. The experimental results confirm the advantages of the proposed methodology. This methodology is an innovative expert system with a knowledge-base developed through this simulation optimization approach. This expert system can be applied to complex production line problems in large or small scale with different types of decision variables and objective functions. The application of this expert system is transformative to other manufacturing systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Random forest (RF) is one of the most powerful ensemble methods with high performance when dealing with high dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel approach, inspired by multi-view theory and by human multi-view approach in object recognition, to increase the performance of RF by increasing the number of trees and limiting the number of levels for each tree in RF. The standard RF algorithm constructs the trees to a maximum possible depth until no further classification is needed, or no further feature is available. In the proposed method, trees of RF are bounded to a certain depth to allow increasing the views. That is why this approach is called "Increasing the Views and Reducing the Depth (IVRD)" approach in RF. Each bounded tree is considered as a local view of the problem and the more local view means the better classification/recognition capability. IVRD approach in RF has been tested on a group of synthetic datasets, a standard dataset, and two datasets of Down Syndrome subjects. Several evaluations have been conducted to determine the effects of the tree depth and the number of trees in a forest on the accuracy of IVRD approach. The results showed by bounding the number of levels in each tree and increasing the number of trees in the forest, the accuracy can be improved, especially in very high dimensional problems.

AB Most of the watermarking techniques designed to protect relational data often use the Primary Key (PK) of relations to perform the watermark synchronization. Despite offering high confidence to the watermark detection, these approaches become useless if the PK can be erased or updated. A typical example is when an attacker wishes to use a stolen relation, unlinked to the rest of the database. In that case, the original values of the PK lose relevance, since they are not employed to check the referential integrity. Then, it is possible to erase or replace the PK, compromising the watermark detection with no need to perform the slightest modification on the rest of the data. To avoid the problems caused by the PKdependency some schemes have been proposed to generate Virtual Primary Keys (VPK) used instead. Nevertheless, the quality of the watermark synchronized using VPKs is compromised due to the presence of duplicate values in the set of VPKs and the fragility of the VPK schemes against the elimination of attributes. In this paper, we introduce the metrics to allow precise measuring of the quality of the VPKs generated by any scheme without requiring to perform the watermark embedding. This way, time waste can be avoided in case of low-quality detection. We also analyze the main aspects to design the ideal VPK scheme, seeking the generation of high-quality VPK sets adding robustness to the process. Finally, a new scheme is presented along with the experiments carried out to validate and compare the results with the rest of the schemes proposed in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID CHEMICAL-REACTION OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB Organizations spend considerable amount of time and money in distributing goods from production centres to customers who are geographically distributed. When vehicles are engaged to make long trips, along with serving the customers it may halt at facility centres like toll booths, warehouses, refuelling stations etc., for some service. The cost and time associated with these halts will have an impact on the overall cost of the route. But, when organizations plan a route with minimum cost, the costs associated with halts in the facility centres are generally not accounted. When these facility centres are limited in number, vehicles should wait for their turn to get the service which has an impact on the overall cost of the tour. This paper intends to address the issues that are associated with the waiting time at the refuelling station. Green Vehicle Routing Problem with Queues (GVRP-Q) is introduced in this paper. GVRP-Q aims to serve a set of customers, but includes halts in between for refuelling in the refuelling stations. Each refuelling station is modelled as M/M/1 queue model, where vehicle is allowed to wait in the queue. The impact of this wait time on the overall cost of the route is studied in this paper. GVRP-Q is solved using an enhanced Chemical Reaction Optimization (e-CRO) where the performance of CRO is enhanced by a bacterial transformation. Experiments are conducted on bench mark data sets and the results predict the influence of the wait time on the overall route cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EMOTION RECOGNITION; DISTRACTION
AB Stress has been identified as one of the contributing factors to vehicle crashes which create a significant cost in terms of loss of life and productivity for governments and societies. Motivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is essential to build a practical system that can detect drivers' stress levels in real time with high accuracy. A driver stress detection model often requires data from different modalities, including ECG signals, vehicle data (e.g., steering wheel, brake pedal) and contextual data (e.g., weather conditions and other ambient factors). Most of the current works use traditional machine learning techniques to fuse multimodal data at different levels (e.g., feature level) to classify drivers' stress levels. Although traditional multimodal fusion models are beneficial for driver stress detection, they inherently have some critical limitations (e.g., ignore non-linear correlation across modalities) that may hinder the development of a reliable and accurate model. To overcome the limitations of traditional multimodal fusion, this paper proposes a framework based on adopting deep learning techniques for driver stress classification captured by multimodal data. Specifically, we propose a multimodal fusion model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to fuse the ECG, vehicle data and contextual data to jointly learn the highly correlated representation across modalities, after learning each modality, with a single deep network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we perform experiments on our dataset collected using an advanced driving simulator. In this paper, we present a multi-modal system based on the adoption of deep learning techniques to improve the performance of driver stress classification. The results show that the proposed model outperforms model built using the traditional machine learning techniques based on handcrafted features (average accuracy: 92.8%, sensitivity: 94.13%, specificity: 97.37% and precision: 95.00%).

AB Cloud service composition builds new value-added services by combining existing single services. However, because of the exuberant growth of cloud services and the varying quality of service (QoS), discovering required services and creating a service composition with certain quality guarantees becomes a significant technical issue and attracts much concern. Computational intelligence techniques are considered to be effective in solving such problems, and researchers have made substantial efforts in this area. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic research about this issue with a particular focus on computing intelligence. Thus, the current study aims to create a panoramic view of QoS-aware cloud service composition from the perspective of computational intelligence. The objectives of this paper are to (1) investigate the relevant studies on this field; (2) make a comprehensive examination of the literature from different aspects: active researchers, research motivations, QoS parameters, algorithms, datasets, optimization strategies and could layers; (3) identify the areas which need further research. For this, a search protocol has been well defined, and 105 articles from 2009 to 2018 were selected. This study classified these articles into three groups, including non-heuristic, heuristic and meta-heuristic, and then examined the research works from several aspects. The results indicate that reducing response time is the most important motivation for researchers, and meta-heuristic algorithms, especially genetic algorithms, are the most widely used computational intelligence techniques. Besides, the most widely used QoS attributes and datasets are also revealed. Additionally, the study points out there are still some research challenges in this area, such as QoS evaluation in a dynamic environment and inter-service correlations. In general, this study classified and compared the existing computational intelligence techniques; analyzed the research status and identified future research directions. It can provide a basis for both researchers and practitioners who are interested in this area. More significantly, in the field of expert and intelligent systems, this study can assist in the design and development of expert and intelligent systems in enterprises, it can efficiently assist enterprises in business decisions and risk reduction.

AB The ability of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) when applied to the choice problem in the context of group decision making under uncertainty has been often criticised. AHP is not able to fully capture the various opinions and the uncertainty associated with the lack of information. This work develops an integrated constrained fuzzy stochastic analytic hierarchy process (IC-FSAHP) method in order to deal with the aforementioned drawbacks. IC-FSAHP combines two existing fuzzy AHP (FAHP) methods and further extends its applicability by implementing stochastic simulations. A case study has been conducted in order to assess the ability of IC-FSAHP; the results showed that IC-FSAHP is able to capture the uncertainty and multiple DMs' opinions. This paper also discusses the effect that the number of DMs has in enhancing rank discrimination. Besides, the possibility of the occurrence of rank reversal because of the use of IC-FSAHP has been analysed. The results showed that the ranking of alternatives was preserved throughout the changes in the number of alternatives, however, rank reversal occurred in the case of changes in judgements scales. By comparing the U-uncertainty in fuzzy global priorities obtained using IC-FSAHP to that obtained using an existing FSAHP method, we show that our method is capable of minimising the risk of losing important knowledge during the computations. We also discuss how IC-FSAHP can decrease the uncertainty and increase the reliability of the decisions by means of robust computations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bankruptcy prediction problem has been intensively studied over the past decades. From traditional statistical models to state of the art machine learning models, various predictive models are developed and applied to various datasets. However, models that use machine learning are not used in the field of business, for two main reasons. First, the prediction accuracy does not far exceed the statistical models and second, the results are not interpretable. In this study, we focused on solving the skewness which is a characteristic of financial data. By solving this problem, we obtained 17% average improvement in AUC over existing models. To address the second shortcoming, we analyze the importance of features identified by the XGBoost model. The interpretation of the model differs among categories of data. Our bankruptcy prediction model has high predictive accuracy with clear explanations and is therefore directly applicable to the industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Segmentation is an important method for MRI medical image analysis as it can provide the radiologists with noninvasive information about a patient that is crucial to the diagnostic process. The efficiency of such a computer-aided diagnosis system relies on the accuracy of an adopted image segmentation method. Multi-level thresholding is a segmentation method that has been widely adopted in medical image analysis in recent studies, where selecting the optimal thresholds has a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm. While some well-known methods, such as Kapur's and Otsu's, are proven effective for bi-level thresholding, multi-level thresholding remains a challenge as it is computationally expensive. Evolutionary algorithms, such as Differential Evolution (DE), have the potential to address this problem, as they can find sufficiently good solutions with manageable computational effort. While a number of DE solutions have been proposed for multi-level thresholding, they are not stable, in that, when the number of thresholds increases, the algorithm efficiency decreases due to the imbalance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we propose a DE solution that achieves a good balance between exploration and exploitation through a new adaptive approach and new mutation strategies. The new adaptive approach can generate optimal solutions in assigning populations by measuring the quality of candidate solutions to evaluate the efficiency of different parts of the proposed DE algorithm. The new mutation methods harness Mantegna Levy and Cauchy distributions, as well as Cotes' Spiral to improve global search, and to further balance between exploitation and exploration. We further experimentally compare the proposed DE algorithm, referred to as Adaptive Differential Evolution with Levy Distribution (ALDE), against three DE benchmark algorithms on T2 weighted MRI brain images. Our results show that ALDE can, not only obtain optimal thresholds at a reasonable computational cost, but more importantly, clearly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we compute the sentiment of social media posts using a novel set of fuzzy rules involving multiple lexicons and datasets. The proposed fuzzy system integrates Natural Language Processing techniques and Word Sense Disambiguation using a novel unsupervised nine fuzzy rule based system to classify the post into: positive, negative or neutral sentiment class. We perform a comparative analysis of our method on nine public twitter datasets, three sentiment lexicons, four state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised Sentiment Analysis and one state-of-the-art method for supervised machine learning. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis of twitter data is performed using a single lexicon. Our results can give an insight to researchers to choose which lexicon is best for social media. The fusion of fuzzy logic with lexicons for sentiment classification provides a new paradigm in Sentiment Analysis. Our method can be adapted to any lexicon and any dataset (two-class or three-class sentiment). The experiments on benchmark datasets yield higher performance for our approach as compared to the state-of-the-art. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Triage is a critical process in hospital emergency departments (ED). Specifically, we consider how to achieve fast and accurate patient Triage in the ED of a pediatric hospital. The goal of this paper is to establish methodological best practices for the application of machine learning (ML) to Triage in pediatric ED, providing a comprehensive comparison of the performance of ML techniques over a large dataset. Our work is among the first attempts in this direction. Following very recent works in the literature, we use the clinical outcome of a case as its label for supervised ML model training, instead of the more uncertain labels provided by experts.
   The experimental dataset contains the records along 3 years of operation of the hospital ED. It consists of 189,718 patients visits to the hospital. The clinical outcome of 9271 cases (4.98%) wa hospital admission, therefore our dataset is highly class imbalanced. Our reported performance comparison results focus on four ML models: Deep Learning (DL), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Data preprocessing includes class imbalance correction, and case re-labeling. We use different well known metrics to evaluate performance of ML models in three different experimental settings: (a) classification of each case into the standard five Triage urgency levels, (b) discrimination of high versus low case severity according to its clinical outcome, and (c) comparison of the number of patients assigned to each standard Triage urgency level against the Triage rule based expert system currently in use at the hospital. RF achieved greater AUC, accuracy, PPV and specificity than the other models in the dychotomic classification experiments. On the implementation side, our study shows that ML predictive models trained according to clinical outcomes, provide better Triage performance than the current rule based expert system in operation at the hospital.

AB Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Location-based service; Trajectory publication; Privacy preservation;

AB The existing location-based services have collected a large amount of user trajectory data, and if these data are directly released without any processing, the user's personal privacy will be leaked. At present, differential privacy protection technology is favored by many scholars, but how to apply it reasonably to location-based services is also a challenge for us. Trajectory is spatiotemporal continuous, but most existing methods only consider the single location of moving objects at a certain time without considering the entire trajectory, which may destroy the spatiotemporal integrity of the trajectory. In this paper, we address this problem and firstly propose a Sequence R (SR)-tree structure that satisfies the differential privacy based on the R-tree, and we construct the SR-Tree by using the trajectory sequence instead of the minimum bounding rectangle of the R-tree. Then we put forward an attack model called nonlocation sensitive information attack, in order to resist this attack, we add noise into the location data and non-location sensitive data using differential privacy techniques. Finally, the Algorithm can be consistently dealt with the problem of data inconsistency after adding noise. Experimental results show that our Algorithm not only has high data availability, operational efficiency, but also has good scalability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent applications (e.g. active gels and self-assembly of elastic sheets) motivate the need to efficiently simulate the dynamics of thin elastic sheets. We present semi-implicit time stepping algorithms to improve the time step constraints that arise in explicit methods while avoiding much of the complexity of fully-implicit approaches. For a triangular lattice discretization with stretching and bending springs, our semi-implicit approach involves discrete Laplacian and biharmonic operators, and is stable for all time steps in the case of overdamped dynamics. For a more general finite-difference formulation that can allow for general elastic constants, we use the analogous approach on a square grid, and find that the largest stable time step is two to three orders of magnitude greater than for an explicit scheme. For a model problem with a radial traveling wave form of the reference metric, we find transitions from quasi-periodic to chaotic dynamics as the sheet thickness is reduced, wave amplitude is increased, and damping constant is reduced.

AB Surrogate-modeling techniques including Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is commonly used for statistical estimation (aka. Uncertainty Quantification) of quantities of interests obtained from expensive computational models. PCE is a data-driven regression-based technique that relies on spectral polynomials as basis-functions. In this technique, the outputs of few numerical simulations are used to estimate the PCE coefficients within a regression framework combined with regularization techniques where the regularization parameters are estimated using standard cross-validation as applied in supervised machine learning methods.
   In the present work, we introduce an efficient method for estimating the PCE coefficients combining Elastic Net regularization with a data-driven feature ranking approach. Our goal is to increase the probability of identifying the most significant PCE components by assigning each of the PCE coefficients a numerical value reflecting the magnitude of the coefficient and its stability with respect to perturbations in the input data. In our evaluations, the proposed approach has shown high convergence rate for high-dimensional problems, where standard feature ranking might be challenging due to the curse of dimensionality.
   The presented method is implemented within a standard machine learning library (scikitlearn [1]) allowing for easy experimentation with various solvers and regularization techniques (e.g. Tikhonov, LASSO, LARS, Elastic Net) and enabling automatic cross-validation techniques using a widely used and well tested implementation. We present a set of numerical tests on standard analytical functions, a two-phase subsurface flow model and a simulation dataset for CO2 sequestration in a saline aquifer. For all test cases, the proposed approach resulted in a significant increase in PCE convergence rates. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale complex systems require high fidelity models to capture the dynamics of the system accurately. The complexity of these models, however, renders their use to be expensive for applications relying on repeated evaluations, such as control, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a powerful Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) technique developed to reduce the computational burden of high fidelity models. In cases where the model is inaccessible, POD can be used in a nonintrusive manner. The accuracy and efficiency of the nonintrusive reduced model are highly dependent on the sampling scheme, especially for high dimensional problems.
   To that end, we study integrating the locally adaptive sparse grids with the POD method to develop a novel nonintrusive POD-based reduced order model. In our proposed approach, the locally adaptive sparse grid is used to adaptively control the sampling scheme for the POD snapshots, and the hierarchical interpolant is used as a surrogate model for the POD coefficients. An approach to efficiently update the surpluses of the sparse grids with each POD snapshots update is also introduced. The robustness and efficiency of the locally adaptive algorithm are increased by introducing a greediness parameter, and a strategy to validate the reduced model after convergence. The proposed validation algorithm can also enrich the reduced model around regions of detected discrepancies. Three numerical test cases are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed POD-Adaptive algorithm. The first is a nuclear reactor point kinetics, the second is a general diffusion problem, and the last is a variation of the analytical Morris function. The results show that the developed algorithm reduced the number of model evaluations compared to the classical sparse grid approach. The built reduced models captured the dynamics of the reference systems with the desired tolerances. The non-intrusiveness and simplicity of the method provide great potential for a wide range of practical large scale applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We consider numerical approximation of the degenerate advection-diffusion equation, which is formally parabolic but may exhibit hyperbolic behavior. We develop both explicit and implicit finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in multiple space dimensions on non-uniform computational meshes. The diffusion degeneracy is reformulated through the use of the Kirchhoff transformation. Space is discretized using WENO reconstructions with adaptive order (WENO-AO), which have several advantages, including the avoidance of negative linear weights and the ability to handle irregular computational meshes. A special two-stage WENO reconstruction procedure is developed to handle degenerate diffusion. Element averages of the solution are first reconstructed to give point values of the solution, and these point values are in turn used to reconstruct the Kirchhoff transform variable of the diffusive flux. Time is discretized using the method of lines and a Runge-Kutta time integrator. We use Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta methods for the explicit schemes, which have a severe parabolically scaled time step restriction to maintain stability. We also develop implicit Runge-Kutta methods. SSP methods are only conditionally stable, so we discuss the use of L-stable Runge-Kutta methods. We present in detail schemes that are third order in both space and time in one and two space dimensions using non-uniform meshes of intervals or quadrilaterals. Efficient implementation is described for computational meshes that are logically rectangular. Through a von Neumann (or Fourier mode) stability analysis, we show that smooth solutions to the linear problem are unconditionally L-stable on uniform computational meshes when using an implicit Radau IIA Runge-Kutta method. Computational results show the ability of the schemes to accurately approximate challenging test problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid droplets sliding along solid surfaces are a frequently observed phenomenon in nature, e.g., raindrops on a leaf, and in everyday situations, e.g., drops of water in a drinking glass. To model this situation, we use a phase field approach. The bulk model is given by the thermodynamically consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes model from Abels et al. (2012) [8]. To model the contact line dynamics we apply the generalized Navier boundary condition for the fluid and the dynamically advected boundary contact angle condition for the phase field as derived in Qian et al. (2006) [7]. In recent years several schemes were proposed to solve this model numerically. While they widely differ in terms of complexity, they all fulfill certain basic properties when it comes to thermodynamic consistency. However, an accurate comparison of the influence of the schemes on the moving contact line is rarely found. Therefore, we thoughtfully compare the quality of the numerical results obtained with three different schemes and two different bulk energy potentials. Especially, we discuss the influence of the different schemes on the apparent contact angles of a sliding droplet. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We discuss the aeroacoustic resolution properties of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes in detail and compare their performance with the state of the art finite difference (FD) schemes, including the classical dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) schemes. Analysis shows that, even though the DG schemes are slightly dissipative, their overall dispersion and dissipation properties are comparable with the corresponding DRP schemes on the same stencil. For the convenience of a direct comparison with FD schemes, we write the DG schemes in the form of block finite difference schemes. Ample numerical tests, including the tests on nozzle flow problems, are performed and we observe that the DG schemes and DRP schemes with the same stencil produce comparable numerical results. Since the DG schemes are flexible on non-uniform meshes and general unstructured meshes, they should be good candidates for computational aeroacoustics, especially those on complex geometry.

ID IMMERSED INTERFACE METHOD; JUMP CONDITIONS; RIGID OBJECTS; MOTION
AB Particle collisions in fluids are ubiquitous, but to compute the collision dynamics in a Navier-Stokes flow remains challenging. In addition to capturing the two-way coupling between the fluid and the particles, a key difficulty is to resolve the collision dynamics mediated by the flow. The gap between particles during collision is minuscule. This introduces a small length scale which needs to be resolved simultaneously with the flow at the large scale. Our goal is to develop a numerical scheme that is accurate and efficient in computing the Navier-Stokes flow around moving particles while taking into account the effect of the lubrication forces on the collisions. Our method integrates the immersed interface method with the lubrication theory in a way that directly couples all three parts, the bulk flow, the flow in the gap, and the dynamics of the freely moving particles. We present a general algorithm for computing the collision. To test the method, we study four fundamental cases involving normal and tangential collisions, so that we can compare numerics against analytic solutions in the lubrication layer. In addition, we provide the lubrication solution needed for computing collisions between surfaces of any shapes in arbitrary relative motions, so that the method can be applied to other cases.

AB Implicit time integration schemes are widely used in computational fluid dynamics to speed-up computations. Indeed, implicit schemes usually allow for less stringent time-step stability constraints than their explicit counterpart. The derivation of an implicit scheme is however a challenging and time-consuming task, increasing substantially with the model equations complexity since this method usually requires fairly accurate evaluation of the spatial scheme's matrix Jacobian. This article presents a flexible method to overcome the difficulties associated to the computation of the derivatives, based on the forward mode of automatic differentiation using operator overloading (ADOO). Flexibility and simplicity of the method are illustrated through implicit resolution of various flow models of increasing complexity such as the compressible Euler equations, a two-phase flow model in full equilibrium [28] and a symmetric variant [44] of the two-phase flow model of Baer and Nunziato [2] dealing with mixtures in total disequilibrium.

AB In this paper, we propose a local-global multiscale mortar mixed finite element method (MMMFEM) for multiphase transport in heterogeneous media. It is known that, in the efficient numerical simulations of this problem, one important step is a fast solution of the pressure equation, which is required to be solved in each time step. Thus, some types of efficient numerical methods, such as multiscale methods, are crucial for this problem. To present our main concepts, we take the two-phase flow system as an example. In our proposed method, the pressure equation is solved via the multiscale mortar mixed finite element method. Using this approach, a mass conservative velocity field can be obtained. Next, we use an explicit finite volume method to solve the saturation equation. The key ingredient of our proposed method is the choice of mortar space for the MMMFEM. We will use both polynomials and multiscale basis functions to form the coarse mortar space. The multiscale basis functions used are the restriction of the global pressure field obtained at the previous time step on the coarse interface. To initialize the simulations, we solve the pressure equation on the fine grid. We will present several numerical experiments on some benchmark 2D and 3D heterogeneous models to show the excellent performance of our method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an extension of the computational fluid mechanics approach to the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem, which was developed by Benamou-Brenier in [4]. Our extension allows optimal transfer of unnormalized and unequal masses. We obtain a oneparameter family of simple modifications of the formulation in [4]. This leads us to a new Monge-Ampere type equation and a new Kantorovich duality formula. These can be solved efficiently by, for example, the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm [6]. This solution to the extended mass transfer problem gives us a simple metric for computing the distance between two unnormalized densities. The L-1 version of this metric was shown in [25] (which is a precursor of our work here) to have desirable properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The constraints are captured and delineated through diffusion maps, while the scatter is captured and sampled through a projected stochastic differential equation. The objective function and constraints of the optimization problem are then efficiently framed as non-parametric conditional expectations. Different spatial resolutions of a large-eddy simulation filter are used to explore the robustness of the model to the training dataset and to gain insight into the significance of spatial resolution on optimal design.

We propose a version of that method and a space/time approximation thereof that is scale invariant. The approximation in time is explicit and the approximation in space uses a length scale for the relaxation that is proportional to the mesh size.

The optimal trial wave-function is obtained through variational Monte Carlo and the computational cost scales quadratically with the number of electrons. The algorithm does not make use of any prior knowledge such as atomic orbitals. Yet it is able to represent accurately the ground-states of the tested systems, including He, H-2, Be, B, LiH, and a chain of 10 hydrogen atoms. This opens up new possibilities for solving large-scale many-electron Schrodinger equation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soft solids in fluids find wide range of applications in science and engineering, especially in the study of biological tissues and membranes. In this study, an Eulerian finite volume approach has been developed to simulate fully resolved incompressible hyperelastic solids immersed in a fluid. We have adopted the recently developed reference-map technique (RMT) by Valkov et al. (2015) [122] and assessed multiple improvements for this approach. These modifications maintain the numerical robustness of the solver and allow the simulations without any artificial viscosity in the solid regions (to stabilize the solver). This has also resulted in eliminating the striations ("wrinkles") of the fluid-solid interface that was seen before and hence obviates the need for any additional routines to achieve a smooth interface. An approximate projection method has been used to project the velocity field onto a divergence free field. Cost and accuracy improvements of the modifications on the method have also been discussed.

ID SCHEMES
AB A unified approach to derive optimal finite differences is presented which combines three critical elements for numerical performance especially for multi-scale physical problems, namely, order of accuracy, spectral resolution and stability. The resulting mathematical framework reduces to a minimization problem subjected to equality and inequality constraints. We show that the framework can provide analytical results for optimal schemes and their numerical performance including, for example, the type of errors that appear for spectrally optimal schemes. By coupling the problem in this unified framework, one can effectively decouple the requirements for order of accuracy and spectral resolution, for example. Alternatively, we show how the framework exposes the tradeoffs between e.g. accuracy and stability and how this can be used to construct explicit schemes that remain stable with very large time steps. We also show how spectrally optimal schemes only bias odd-order derivatives to remain stable, at the expense of accuracy, while leaving even-order derivatives with symmetric coefficients. Schemes constructed within this framework are tested for diverse model problems with an emphasis on reproducing the physics accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we investigate numerical solutions of the two-dimensional shallow water wave using a fully nonlinear Green-Naghdi model with an improved dispersive effect. For numerics, the Green-Naghdi model is rewritten into a formulation coupling a pseudoconservative system and a set of pseudo-elliptic equations. Since the pseudo-conservative system is no longer hyperbolic and its Riemann problem can only be approximately solved, we consider the utilization of the central discontinuous Galerkin method, which possesses an important feature of the needlessness of Riemann solvers. Meanwhile, the stationary elliptic part will be solved using the finite element method. Both the well-balanced and the positivity-preserving features, which are highly desirable in the simulation of the shallow water wave, will be embedded into the proposed numerical scheme. The accuracy and efficiency of the numerical model and method will be illustrated through numerical tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A data transfer (called later remap) of physical fields between two meshes is an important step of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) simulations. This step is challenging for high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes since the Lagrangian flow motion leads to high-order meshes with curved faces. It becomes even more challenging for unstructured polygonal meshes that do not have a polynomial map from the reference to a current cell. We propose and analyze a new framework to create remap schemes on curvilinear polygonal meshes based on the theory of virtual element projectors. We derive a conservative remap scheme that is high-order accurate in space and time. The properties of this scheme are studied numerically for smooth and discontinuous fields on unstructured quadrilateral and polygonal meshes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   network; Symbolic neural network
ID PHYSICS
AB Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and store massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called PDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with minor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The design of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work [1] where the original version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.

AB This paper proposes a novel locally adaptive pseudo-time stepping convergence acceleration technique for dual time stepping which is a common integration method for solving unsteady low-Mach preconditioned/incompressible Navier-Stokes formulations. In contrast to standard local pseudo-time stepping techniques that are based on computing the local pseudo-time steps directly from estimates of the local Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit, the proposed technique controls the local pseudo-time steps using local truncation errors which are computed with embedded pair RK schemes. The approach has three advantages. First, it does not require an expression for the characteristic element size, which are difficult to obtain reliably for curved mixed-element meshes. Second, it allows a finer level of locality for high-order nodal discretisations, such as FR, since the local time-steps can vary between solution points and field variables. Third, it is well-suited to being combined with P-multigrid convergence acceleration. Results are presented for a laminar 2D cylinder test case at Re = 100. A speed-up factor of 4.16 is achieved compared to global pseudo-time stepping with an RK4 scheme, while maintaining accuracy. When combined with P-multigrid convergence acceleration a speed-up factor of over 15 is achieved. Detailed analysis of the results reveals that pseudo-time steps adapt to element size/shape, solution state, and solution point location within each element. Finally, results are presented for a turbulent 3D SD7003 airfoil test case at Re = 60, 000. Speed-ups of similar magnitude are observed, and the flow physics is found to be in good agreement with previous studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Simulation of blood flows in the human artery is a promising tool for understanding the hemodynamics. The blood flow is often smooth in a healthy artery, but may become locally chaotic in a diseased artery with stenosis, and as a result, a traditional solver may take many iterations to converge or does not converge at all. To overcome the problem, we develop a nonlinearly preconditioned Newton method in which the variables associated with the stenosis are iteratively eliminated and then a global Newton method is applied to the smooth part of the system. More specifically, we model the blood flow in a patient-specific artery based on the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with resistive boundary conditions discretized by a fully implicit finite element method. The resulting nonlinear system at each time step is solved by using an inexact Newton method with a domain decomposition based Jacobian solver. To improve the convergence and robustness of the Newton method for arteries with stenosis, we develop an adaptive restricted region-based nonlinear elimination preconditioner which performs subspace correction to remove the local high nonlinearities. Numerical experiments for several cerebral arteries are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the classical method with respect to some physical and numerical parameters. We also report the parallel scalability of the proposed algorithm on a supercomputer with thousands of processor cores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Cross field; Quad meshing; High order; Spectral element method;
   Irregular node characterization
AB We describe a high order technique to generate quadrilateral decompositions and meshes for complex two dimensional domains using spectral elements in a field guided procedure. Inspired by cross field methods, we never actually compute crosses. Instead, we compute a high order accurate guiding field using a continuous Galerkin (CG) or discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spectral element method to solve a Laplace equation for each of the field variables using the open source code Nektar++. The spectral method provides spectral convergence and sub-element resolution of the fields. The DG approximation allows meshing of corners that are not multiples of pi/2 in a discretization consistent manner, when needed. The high order field can then be exploited to accurately find irregular nodes, and can be accurately integrated using a high order separatrix integration method to avoid features like limit cycles. The result is a mesh with naturally curved quadrilateral elements that do not need to be curved a posteriori to eliminate invalid elements. The mesh generation procedure is implemented in the open source mesh generation program NekMesh. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a class of optimized filters based on hybrid blending of implicit and explicit filters are formulated for the three time-level leapfrog time integration scheme. As the leapfrog method is the most recurrently employed in ocean and atmospheric simulations, however, it also admits a spurious mode in the numerical computations. To subdue the computational mode, the developed hybrid time filters are also optimized using constraints arising from error dynamics. The optimized filters are adept in suppressing the computational mode(s) more efficaciously without altering the physical mode. Finally, the developed hybrid filters coupled with centered and compact spatial discretization schemes are also authenticated for the numerical solutions to one-dimensional (1D) convection equation, two-dimensional (2D) dispersive rotating shallow water equation, and unsteady 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation at different Reynolds numbers. Present solutions are also compared with results reported in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The new component of the "laser plasma simulation environment" (LPSE) described here is a practical numerical model that solves the coupled vector equations for the propagation of nearly monochromatic, coherent, electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous unmagnetized plasmas. It operates efficiently in the numerically challenging semiclassical regime where characteristic plasma scale lengths are many times greater than the wavelength of the light and solutions are highly oscillatory. Solutions can be obtained in one, two, or three spatial dimensions and time. The model includes the effects of nonlinear coupling of electromagnetic waves to the low-frequency plasma perturbations (i.e., ion-acoustic response) that are responsible for stimulated Brillouin scattering. Induced plasma perturbations are assumed to be imposed on a prescribed large-scale inhomogeneous background that includes spatially varying plasma density and flow. Our code is directly relevant to the problem of cross-beam energy transfer in laser-driven inertial confinement fusion. It may also be applicable in other areas where eikonal solutions of multicomponent wave equations (or coupled wave equations) are insufficient, such as optical scattering from ultrasound, electron dynamics in quantum devices or in nanoscale light-matter interactions.

AB This work demonstrates a computational framework for simulating vaporizing, liquid-gas flows. It is developed for the general vaporization problem [1] which solves the vaporization rate based as from the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the liquid-gas system. This includes the commonly studied vaporization regimes of film boiling and isothermal evaporation. The framework is built upon a Cartesian grid solver for low-Mach, turbulent flows [2] which has been modified to handle multiphase flows with large density ratios [3]. Interface transport is performed using an unsplit volume of fluid solver [4]. A novel, divergence-free extrapolation technique is used to create a velocity field that is suitable for interface transport. Sharp treatments are used for the vapor mass fractions and temperature fields [5]. The pressure Poisson equation is treated using the Ghost Fluid Method [6]. Interface equilibrium at the interface is computed using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and is coupled to the flow solver using a monotone, unconditionally stable scheme.
   It will be shown that correct prediction of the interface properties is fundamental to accurate simulations of the vaporization process. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed numerical framework is verified against solutions in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulations recover first order convergence under temporal and spatial refinement for the general vaporization problem. The work is concluded with a demonstration of unsteady vaporization of a droplet at intermediate Reynolds number. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The thermal conduction through interfaces plays an important role for optimization and new designs in micro/nano energy system. However, the available knowledge and understanding on the physical picture of phonon transport at interfaces are still insufficient. The discrete-ordinates method (DOM) has been recently applied to solve the equation of phonon radiative transfer (EPRT) but it still suffers from expensive computational cost, especially with interfaces of different materials. In the present work, we introduce the Gauss-Legendre quadrature for frequency domain to improve the efficiency of discrete-ordinates method between heterogeneous materials over the uniform discretization scheme. The present scheme is verified for cross-plane interfacial phonon transport, with comparisons with both theoretical solution and kinetic-type Monte Carlo method. One to two orders of magnitude improvements on CPU time have been obtained numerically. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Constructing efficient numerical solution methods for the equation of radiative transfer (ERT) remains as a challenging task in scientific computing despite of the tremendous development on the subject in recent years. We present in this work a simple fast computational algorithm for solving the ERT in isotropic media. The algorithm we developed has two steps. In the first step, we solve a volume integral equation for the angularly-averaged ERT solution using iterative schemes such as the GMRES method. The computation in this step is accelerated with a fast multipole method (FMM). In the second step, we solve a scattering-free transport equation to recover the angular dependence of the ERT solution. The algorithm does not require the underlying medium be homogeneous. We present numerical simulations under various scenarios to demonstrate the performance of the proposed numerical algorithm for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, a fast multipole method (FMM) is used to decrease the computational time of a fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model with a controllable effect on its accuracy. The hydraulic fracture model is based on the fully-coupled poroelastic formulation of the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) which is a special formulation of the boundary element method (BEM). DDM is a powerful and efficient method for problems involving fractures. However, this method involves the multiplication of a dense matrix with a vector in several places. Thus, the DMM algorithm slows down drastically as the number of elements increases, and even more so with the inclusion of necessary details such as poroelasticity, which makes the solution history-dependent. Rather, FMM is a technique to expedite matrix-vector multiplications, within a controllable error range, by approximating the far-range interactions without forming the matrix explicitly. In doi ng so, FMM offers a leverage in the computational efficiency by modifying the algorithm of the fully-coupled poroelastic displacement discontinuity method (PDMM) in two places. The first modification is in the time-marching scheme, which accounts for the solution of previous time steps to compute the current time step. The second modification is in the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), where the unknowns are solved for iteratively.
   Several examples are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed fast multipole fullycoupled poroelastic displacement discontinuity model (FMPDDM) in problems with large degrees of freedom (in time and space). These examples include hydraulic fracturing of a horizontal well and randomly distributed pressurized fractures at different orientations with respect to principal horizontal stresses. The results of FMPDDM are compared to PDDM in terms of computational time and accuracy, which demonstrates that FMPDDM decreases the computation time by up to a factor of 70 for a case with 20000 piece-wise constant elements and a single time step. The difference between the computational times of FMPDDM and PDDM can be higher for a larger number of elements and time steps. Moreover, the associated absolute value of relative error for a problem of this size is observed to be less than 4% for the hydraulic fracture example, and less than 0.5% for the example of randomly distributed pressurized fractures. Furthermore, the solution of tip displacements using both methods are used to compare the computation of stress intensity factors (SIF) in mode I and II, which are needed for fracture propagation. The calculated displacement discontinuities reveal that the SIF calculation using FMPDDM has a negligible error compared to PDDM. Therefore, FMPDDM will not affect the estimation of the fracture propagation direction. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm may be used for fracture propagation studies to substantially reduce the computational time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A stable added-mass partitioned (AMP) algorithm is developed for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems coupling viscous incompressible flow and compressible elastic solids. The hyperbolic system governing the solid is integrated using an explicit upwind (Godunov) scheme. The equations for the fluid are integrated using an implicit-explicit (IMEX) fractional-step scheme whereby the velocity is advanced in one step, treating the viscous terms implicitly, and the pressure is computed in a second step. The AMP interface conditions for the fluid arise from the outgoing characteristic variables in the solid, and they are partitioned into a Robin (mixed) interface condition for the pressure and interface conditions for the velocity. The latter conditions include an impedance-weighted average between fluid and solid velocities using a fluid impedance of a special form. A similar impedance-weighted average is used to define interface values for the solid. Deforming composite grids are used to effectively handle the evolving geometry and large deformations. The new algorithm is verified for accuracy and stability on a number of useful benchmark problems in two space dimensions, including a radial-piston problem for which exact solutions for radial and azimuthal motions are found and tested. Exact traveling wave solutions for a solid disk surrounded by an annular region of fluid are also derived and used to verify the AMP scheme. Fluid flow in a channel past a deformable solid annulus is computed, and the errors are estimated from a self-convergence grid refinement study. The AMP scheme is found to be stable and second-order accurate, without subtime-step iterations, even for very difficult cases of very light solids when added-mass and added-damping effects are large.

AB To solve an applied inverse problem, a numerical forward model for the problem's physics is required. Commonly, the finite element method is employed with discretizations consisting of elements with variable size h and polynomial degree p. Solutions to hp-forward models are known to converge exponentially by simultaneously decreasing h and increasing p. On the other hand, applied inverse problems are often ill-posed and their minimization rate exhibits uncertainty. Presently, the behavior of applied inverse problems incorporating hp elements of differing p, h, and geometry is not fully understood. Nonetheless, recent research suggests that employing increasingly higher-order hp-forward models (increasing mesh density and p) decreases reconstruction errors compared to inverse regimes using lower-order hp-forward models (coarser meshes and lower p). However, an affirmative or negative answer to following question has not been provided, "Does the use of higher order hp-forward models in applied inverse problems always result in lower error reconstructions than approaches using lower order hp-forward models?"
   In this article we aim to reduce the current knowledge gap and answer the open question by conducting extensive numerical investigations in the context of two contemporary applied inverse problems: elasticity imaging and hydraulic tomography - nonlinear inverse problems with a PDE describing the underlying physics. Our results support a negative answer to the question - i.e. decreasing h (increasing mesh density), increasing p, or simultaneously decreasing h and increasing p does not guarantee lower error reconstructions in applied inverse problems. Rather, there is complex balance between the accuracy of the hp-forward model, noise, prior knowledge (regularization), Jacobian accuracy, and ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix which ultimately contribute to reconstruction errors. As demonstrated herein, it is often more advantageous to use lower-order hp-forward models than higher-order hp-forward models in applied inverse problems. These realizations and other counterintuitive behavior of applied inverse problems using hp-forward models are described in detail herein. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The modeling of multiphase fluid mixture and its flow in porous media is of great interest in the field of reservoir simulation. In this paper, we formulate a novel energy-based framework to model multi-component two-phase fluid systems at equilibrium. PengRobinson equation of state (EOS) is used to model the bulk properties of each phase, though our framework works well also with other equations of state. Our model reduces to the conventional compositional grading if restricted to one spatial vertical dimension together with the assumption of monodisperse pore-size distribution (all pores being one size). However, our model can be combined with a general distribution of pore size, which can generate interesting behaviors of capillarity in porous media. In particular, the model can be used to predict the capillary pressure of two-phase fluid as a function of saturation, with a given pore-size distribution. This model is the quantitative study of the first time in the literature for the capillarity of a two-phase fluid with partial miscibility. We propose an unconditionally stable energy-decay numerical algorithm based on convex-concave splitting, which has been demonstrated to be both robust and efficient using numerical examples. To verify our model, we simulate the compositional grading of a binary fluid mixture consisting of carbon dioxide and normal decane. To demonstrate powerful features of our model, we provide an interesting example of fluid mixture in a porous medium with wide pore size distribution, where the competition of capillarity and gravity is observed. This work represents the first effort in the literature that rigorously incorporates capillarity and gravity effects into EOS-based phase equilibrium modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB We focus our attention on enhancing of computation performance at numerical simulation of a laser pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium (optical periodic structure or photonic crystal) which is described in the framework of 1D Schrodinger equation without using slowly varying envelope in spatial coordinate. It allows taking into account the optical pulse reflection from medium inhomogeneous. In practice, as a rule at computer simulation the domain size before photonic crystal is many times greater than the photonic crystal size. Decreasing this domain one can essentially increase a computation performance. This aim is achieved by re-statement of the problem: instead of initial distribution of complex amplitude along spatial coordinate before the photonic crystal we consider its specifying as a boundary condition (BC), which results in the pulse propagation in both directions of the propagation axis. Taking this into account and that a part of a laser pulse reflects from faces of photonic crystal layers, we use the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs). To avoid an influence of waves propagated in negative direction of spatial coordinate on the laser pulse interaction in photonic crystal (this influence appears due to imperfection of ABC). We introduce in consideration some number of artificial waves related with the equation under consideration. With this aim, firstly, we provide a computation of the laser pulse propagation in a linear medium and storage the complex amplitude values at chosen section of a coordinate, along which a laser light propagates. Then we use this complex amplitude values as a left boundary condition for 1D nonlinear Schrodinger equation in domain containing a nonlinear photonic crystal. To decrease amplitude of the wave reflected from artificial boundaries. We demonstrate also that instead of a complex amplitude values storage one can use the corresponding analytical expression for the linear Schrodinger equation solution, corresponding to a laser pulse propagation in a linear domain before the photonic crystal. We discuss also various ways for full transform of the optical pulse energy for reflected wave into artificial waves. This results essentially increasing of computation efficiency.

AB Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of fluid flows offers the ability to understand the impact of variation in fluid properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions on simulation results. In this work, an open-source program called multiUQ is developed which performs UQ using an intrusive approach applied to gas-liquid multiphase flows. Intrusive methods require modifying the governing equations by incorporating stochastic (uncertain) variables. This adds complexity but reduces computational cost compared to non-intrusive methods (e.g. Monte Carlo). To date, much of the work on intrusive UQ has focused on single phase flows. We extend this work by adding capabilities for gas-liquid flows which include a stochastic conservative level set method to capture the location of the phase interface, computing a stochastic curvature, and development of a stochastic surface tension force. Several test cases are presented which illustrate the strength of the framework. Both deterministic and stochastic channel flow cases converge to analytic results and demonstrate the accuracy of the level set transport. Zalesak's disk and the deformation test cases further highlight the abilities of the transport method as well as the robustness of the reinitialization equation, which maintains the level set profile. Deterministic and stochastic oscillating droplet test cases paired with analytic results, solve a true multiphase flow problem, and highlight the abilities of the UQ framework. Finally, results from a stochastic atomizing jet show droplet breakup and merging for cases of uncertainty about the surface tension coefficient and incoming velocity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A fast spectral method (FSM) is developed to solve the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation for quantum gas mixtures with generalized differential cross-sections. The computational cost of the proposed FSM is 0 (Mdv-1 Ndv+1 log N), where d(v) is the dimension of the problem, Mdv-1 is the number of discrete solid angles, and N is the number of frequency nodes in each direction. Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy, respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by the FSM, which agree well with the analytical solutions. Then, the FSM is applied to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients increases with fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical to degenerate limits, but the relative difference in shear viscosity decreases when the fugacity increases. Finally, the viscosity and diffusion coefficients are calculated for a two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular masses of the two components are the same, our numerical results agree with the variational solutions. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our results are reliable because (i) the method does not rely on any assumption on the form of velocity distribution function and (ii) the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum bound predicted by the string theory.

AB New entropy stable spectral collocation schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy are developed for the unsteady 3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on dynamic unstructured grids. To take into account the grid motion and deformation, we use an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. As a result, moving and deforming hexahedral grid elements are individually mapped onto a cube in the fixed reference system of coordinates. The proposed scheme is constructed by using the skew-symmetric form of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are discretized by using summation-by-parts spectral collocation operators that preserve the conservation properties of the original governing equations. Furthermore, the metric coefficients are approximated such that the geometric conservation laws are satisfied exactly on both static and dynamic grids. To make the scheme entropy stable, a new entropy conservative flux is derived for the 3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on dynamic unstructured grids. The new flux preserves the design order of accuracy of the original spectral collocation scheme and guarantees entropy conservation on moving and deforming grids. We present numerical results demonstrating design order of accuracy and freestream preservation properties of the new schemes for both the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on dynamic unstructured grids.

AB Conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) using least square distance (L-2 norm) between the observed and predicted seismograms suffers from local minima. Recently, the Wasserstein metric (W-1 metric) has been introduced to FWI to compute the misfit between two seismograms. Instead of comparisons bin by bin, the W-1 metric allows to compare signal intensities across different coordinates. This measure has great potential to account for time and space shifts of events within seismograms. However, there are two main challenges in application of the W-1 metric to FWI. The first one is that the compared signals need to satisfy nonnegativity and mass conservation assumptions. The second one is that the computation of W-1 metric between two seismograms is a computationally expensive problem. In this paper, a strategy is used to satisfy the two assumptions via decomposition and recombination of original seismic data. In addition, the computation of the W-1 metric based on dynamic formulation is formulated as a convex optimization problem. A primal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch has been developed to solve this large-scale optimization problem on GPU device. The advantages of the new method are that it is easy to implement and has high computational efficiency. Compared to the L-2 norm based FWI, the computation time of the proposed method will approximately increase by 11% in our case studies. A 1D time-shift signals case study has indicated that the W-1 metric is more effective in capturing time shift and makes the misfit function more convex. Two applications to synthetic data using transmissive and reflective recording geometries have demonstrated the effectiveness of the W-1 metric in mitigating cycle-skipping issues. We have also applied the proposed method to SEG 2014 benchmark data, which has further demonstrated that the W-1 metric can mitigate local minima and provide reliable velocity estimations without using low frequency information in the recorded data.

AB Reduced-order models based on level-set methods are widely used tools to qualitatively capture and track the nonlinear dynamics of an interface. The aim of this paper is to develop a physics-informed, data-driven, statistically rigorous learning algorithm for state and parameter estimation with level-set methods. A Bayesian approach based on data assimilation is introduced. Data assimilation is enabled by the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother, which are used in their probabilistic formulations. The level-set data assimilation framework is verified in one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases, where state estimation, parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification are performed. The statistical performance of the proposed ensemble Kalman filter and smoother is quantified by twin experiments. In the twin experiments, the combined state and parameter estimation fully recovers the reference solution, which validates the proposed algorithm. The level-set data assimilation framework is then applied to the prediction of the nonlinear dynamics of a forced premixed flame, which exhibits the formation of sharp cusps and intricate topological changes, such as pinch-off events. The proposed physics-informed statistical learning algorithm opens up new possibilities for making reduced-order models of interfaces quantitatively predictive, any time that reference data is available.

ID COMPLEX SHORT-PULSE; STABILITY
AB In the present paper, we consider the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving short pulse (SP) type equations. The short pulse equation has been shown to be completely integrable, which admits the loop-soliton, cuspon-soliton solutions as well as smooth-soliton solutions. Through hodograph transformations, these nonclassical solutions can be profiled as the smooth solutions of the coupled dispersionless (CD) system or the sine-Gordon equation. Therefore, DG methods can be developed for the CD system or the sine-Gordon equation to simulate the loop-soliton or cuspon-soliton solutions of the SP equation. The conservativeness or dissipation of the Hamiltonian or momentum for the semi-discrete DG schemes can be proved. Also we modify the above DG schemes and obtain an integration DG scheme. Theoretically the a-priori error estimates have been provided for the momentum conserved DG scheme and the integration DG scheme. We also propose the DG scheme and the integration DG scheme for the sine-Gordon equation, in case the SP equation can not be transformed to the CD system. All these DG schemes can be applied to the generalized or modified SP type equations. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the optimal order of accuracy and capability of these DG schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Applying high-order finite-difference schemes, like the extensively used linear-upwind or WENO schemes, to curvilinear grids can be problematic. If the scheme doesn't satisfy the geometric conservation law, the geometrically induced error from grid Jacobian and metrics evaluation can pollute the flow field, and degrade the accuracy or cause the simulation failure even when uniform flow imposed, i.e. free-stream preserving problem. In order to address this issue, a method for general linear-upwind and WENO schemes preserving free-stream on stationary curvilinear grids is proposed. Following Lax-Friedrichs splitting, this method rewrites the numerical flux into a central term, which achieves free-stream preserving by using symmetrical conservative metric method, and a numerical dissipative term with a local difference form of conservative variables for neighboring grid-point pairs. In order to achieve free-stream preservation for the latter term, the local differences are modified to share the same Jacobian and metric terms evaluated by high order schemes. In addition, this method allows a simple hybridization switching between linear-upwind and WENO schemes is proposed for improving computational efficiency and reducing numerical dissipation. A number of testing cases including free-stream, isentropic vortex convection, double Mach reflection, flow past a cylinder and supersonic wind tunnel with a step are computed to verify the effectiveness of this method.

AB Biologically active materials and polymeric materials used in tissue engineering have been one of the most attractive research areas in the past decades, especially the use of easily accessible materials from the patients that reduces or eliminates any patient's immune response. In this study, electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated by using polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA), chitosan and hydroxyapatite (HA) polymers and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as a bioactive substance isolated from human blood. Fabricated scaffolds structure and cytotoxicity were evaluated using scanning electron microscope and MTF assays. Scaffolds osteoinductivity was investigated by osteogenic differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at the in vitro level and then its osteoconductivity was examined by implanting at the critical-sized rat calvarial defect. The in vitro results showed that scaffolds have a good structure and good biocompatibility. Alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium content and gene expression assays were also demonstrated that their highest amount was detected in MSCs-seeded PVA-chitosan-HA(PRP) scaffold. For this reason, this scaffold alone and along with the MSCs was implanted to the animal defects. The in vivo results demonstrated that in the animals implanted with PVA-chitosanHA(PRP), the defect was repaired to a good extent, but in those animals that received MSCs-seeded PVA-chitosan-HA(PRP), the defects was almost filled. It can be concluded that, PVA-chitosan-HA(PRP) alone or when stem cells cultured on them, has a great potential to use as an effective bone implant.

AB Short tandem repeats (STRs) are a widely utilized tool in forensic applications, the latter of which range from human identification and paternity testing to population analysis. The GlobalFiler STR loci, which includes 21 autosomal STRS, were analyzed in the Chechen subpopulation of Jordan. Whole blood samples were withdrawn from 159 Jordanian Chechen individuals, and genomic DNA was extracted from each sample. The GlobalFiler (TM) kit PCR Amplification Kit amplified and analyzed the STR loci on the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using GeneMapper ID-X software. The combined match probability for the 21 autosomal STR loci was calculated to be 1.06 x 10(-24) , a number that is highly discriminatory and informative. The SE33 (0.983) and TPOX (0.806) loci exhibited the highest and lowest powers of discrimination, respectively. Conclusively, the current study indicates that the GlobalFiler loci have a high utility in the Jordanian Chechen population, possibly paving the way for the future establishment of a reference population database in Jordan.

AB Background: Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SPLI) was a secreted protein which belongs to a member of whey acidic protein four-disulfide core family. In breast cancer (BC) it may inhibit cell proliferation and promote cancer metastasis. In this study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the expression and prognostic value of SLPI in breast cancer.
   Methods: SLPI expression in breast cancer was analyzed in Oncomine online database, which was subsequently confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 18 BC samples and western blotting in 26 BC samples. Breast cancer gene-expression miner v4.1 was used to access the expression level with clinicopathological parameters in breast cancer patients. The prognostic values of SLPI in breast cancer were evaluated using the PrognoScan database.
   Results: Our results indicated that SLPI was downregulated in breast cancer than in normal tissues. SLPI expression was found to be negatively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. SLPI expression level was decreased in negative basal-like status patients compared with positive basal-like status. Meanwhile, triple-negative breast cancer status positive correlated with SLPI. We confirmed a positive correlation between SLPI and interleukin 17 receptor B (IL17RB) express in breast cancer tissues via oncomine co-expression analysis. Ten proteins: Elastase, Granulin, Lipocalin, Defensin beta 103B, Defensin beta 103A, Tubulin, Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, Interleukin 6, Epidermal growth factor, Phospholipid scramblase 1 were determinate interactions with SLPI by STRING.
   Conclusion: SLPI could as a biomarker to predict the prognosis values of breast cancer. However, further comprehensive study and mining more evidence are needed to clarify our results.

AB The enzyme beta-Ketoacyl ACP synthase I (KasA) is a potent drug target in mycolic acid pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In the present study, we investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) and mutants KasA (D66N, G269S, G312S, and F413L) in both monomer and dimer form to provide insight into protein structural stability. To gain better understanding of structural flexibility of KasA, combined molecular dynamics and essential dynamics were employed to analyze the conformational changes induced by non-active site mutations. The results confirm that non-active site mutations lower the structural stability in dimer KasA as compared to WT. The protein network topology and close residue interactions of WT and mutant residues of KasA have been predicted through residue interaction network analysis (RIN). Non-active site mutations distort RIN architecture and subsequently affect the drug binding landscape. T-pad associated with mode vector analysis comprehensively pronounces the structural impact caused by non-active site mutations. It also identified the critical fluctuating residues present in the gate segment (GS) region (115-147). The non-active site mutations altered the structural stability of the mutant protein structures, and these mutations may be a cause for the resistance mechanism of KasA against anti-tuberculosis drugs. Further, it is observed that dimer mutant KasA proteins display much more structural flexibility than WT at the ligand binding site which is evident from the binding site analysis and hydrogen bond interaction patterns. This study provides a better understanding of the structural dynamic behaviour of KasA mutants, thereby facilitating the need to find a novel and potent inhibitor against Mtb.

AB Fourteen different insertion sequences belonging to seven families were identified in the genome of Streptococcus agalactiae. Among them, IS1548, a mobile element of the ISAs1 family, was linked to clonal complex (CC) 19 strains associated with neonatal meningitis and endocarditis. IS1548 impacts S. agalactiae in two reported ways: i) inactivation of virulence genes by insertion in an open reading frame (e.g. hylB or cpsD), ii) positive modulation of the expression of a downstream gene by insertion in an intergenic region (e.g. 1mb). We previously identified an unknown integration site of IS1548 in the intergenic region between the folK and the murB genes involved in folate and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, respectively. In this work, we analyzed the prevalence of IS/548 in a large collection of nine hundred and eleven S. agalactiae strains. IS1548 positive strains belong to twenty-nine different sequence types and to ten CCs. The majority of them were, however, clustered within sequence type 19 and sequence type 22, belonging to CC19 and CC22, respectively. In contrast, IS1548 targets the folK-murB intergenic region exclusively in CC19 strains. We evaluated the impact of the insertion of IS1548 on the expression of murB by locating transcriptional promoters influencing its expression in the presence or absence of IS1548 and by comparative beta-galactosidase transcriptional fusion assays. We found that in the absence of IS1548, genes involved in folate biosynthesis are co-transcribed with murB. As it was postulated that a folic acid mediated reaction may be involved in cell wall synthesis, this co-transcription could be necessary to synchronize these two processes. The insertion of IS1548 in the folK-murB intergenic region disrupt this cotranscription. Interestingly, we located a promoter at the right end of IS1548 that is able to initiate additional transcripts of murB. The insertion of IS1548 in this region has thus a dual and divergent impact on the expression of murB. By comparative beta-galactosidase transcriptional fusion assays; we showed that, consequently, the overall impact of the insertion of 1S1548 results in a minor decrease of murB gene transcription. This study provides new insights into gene expression effects mediated by IS1548 in S. agalactiae.

AB Mitogenomes in plants are well-known as exhibiting high diversity in genome size architecture and repetitive DNA sequences. In this research study, we report on the complete mitochondria) genomes of S. tuberosa and S. mombin using Illumina paired-end and mate-pair end reads. These genomes were obtained by a combination of methods of de novo assembly and contig extension. The mitogenomes of S. tuberosa and S. mombin showed 779,106 bp and 685,788 bp in length, with a total of 35 genes. Genome comparisons showed many rearrangements that were mediated by repetitive DNA, and also high incorporation of DNA from chloroplast. In summary, we demonstrate: (1) first complete mitochondrial genomes for the genus Spondias; (2) the synteny between S. tuberosa and S. mombin showed rearrangements, mediated by repetitive DNA; (3) that gene content in Spondias mitogenomes is highly conserved; and (4) the high incorporation DNA from chloroplast genome, (5) the mitogenome size is due intergenic spacers and (6) the non-tandem repeats contributes for giant intergenic spacers.

AB Despite the existing research, the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease remains poorly understood with early and accurate diagnosis difficult to achieve. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in biological processes as modulators of transcription and translation. Previous studies have demonstrated a downregulation of several genes in' early RA stages and in addition, miRNAs may serve as early biomarkers of subclinical changes in early RA.
   When comparing the four groups (ANOVA P < 0.01, fold change > 4), we found 253 differentially expressed miRNAs. Of these, 97 miRNAs were identified as overexpressed in early rheumatoid arthritis. The validation of miRNA microarray expression was performed in a set by RT-qPCR and showed strong agreement with microarray expression data. The putative targets of overexpressed microRNAs in early RA were significantly enriched in apoptosis, tolerance loss and Wnt pathways. Moreover, ROC analysis showed values of AUC 0.76 and P < 0.05 for miR 361-5p, identifying this miRNA as a potential biomarker of disease.
   We identified specific microRNAs associated with early rheumatoid arthritis and proposed them as early biomarkers of disease. Our results provide novel insight into immune disease physiopathology and describe unreported microRNAs in RA with potential for clinical use.

AB Emerging evidence demonstrates that circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel class of non-coding RNA that plays a pivotal role in cancer. Recently, circ-PRMT5 was identified as an oncogene in bladder cancer. Nevertheless, its contribution to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. Herein, we aimed to clarify the biological role of circ-PRMTS in NSCLC. High circ-PRMTS expression was identified in NSCLC tissues and cell lines and positively correlated with larger tumor size, advanced clinic stage, lymph node metastasis as well as worse prognosis. Stable knockdown of circ-PRMTS dramatically weakened the proliferative capacities of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, circ-PRMTS could simultaneously effectively sponge three miRNAs (miR-377, miR-382 and miR-498) and alleviate their repression on the well-known oncogenic EZH2, resulting in increased EZH2 expression, thereby facilitating NSCLC progression. Importantly, a strong positive correlation between circ-PRMTS and EZH2 expression was observed in NSCLC tissues. Overall, our data indicate that circ-PRMTS is an oncogenic circRNA in NSCLC that can promote the growth of NSCLC via regulation of miR-377/382/498-EZH2 axis.

AB Repeated implantation failure (RIF) was mainly due to poor endometrium receptivity. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) could regulate endometrium receptivity and act in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) theory. However, the regulatory mechanism of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in repeated implantation failure (RIF) is unclear. We obtained RIF-related expression profiles of lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs using mid-secretory endometrial tissue samples from 5 women with RIF and 5 controls by RNA-sequencing. Co-expression analysis revealed that three functional modules were enriched in immune response/inflammation process; two functional modules were enriched in metabolic/biosynthetic process, and one functional module were enriched in cell cycle pathway. By adding the miRNA data, ceRNA regulatory relationship of each module was reconstructed. The ceRNA network of the whole differentially expressed RNAs revealed 10 hub lncRNAs. Among them, TRG-AS1, SIMM25, and NEAT1 were involved in the module1, module2, and module3, respectively; LNC00511 and SLC26A4-AS1 in the module4; H19 in the module5. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of 15 randomly selected RNAs were consistent with our sequencing data. These can be used as novel potential biomarkers for RIF. Furthermore, they might be involved in endometrium receptivity by acting as ceRNA.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly invasive urological malignant tumor that results in shorter patient survival. At present, the mechanism of ccRCC metastasis is not clear. We explored the possible mechanisms of ccRCC metastasis by analyzing the transcriptome of ccRCC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Comparing the differences in transcriptome in patients with and without metastasis, we found 323 differential genes (vertical bar log2FoldChange vertical bar > 1 and P < 0.001). KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) suggest that the transfer mechanism of ccRCC may be related to complement and coagulation cascades and cholesterol metabolism. To explore the key genes affecting tumor metastasis, we analyzed the association of these genes with patient survival time and found that 16 genes were significantly associated (P < 0.05). We compared the differences in expression of these 16 genes between ccRCC patients and the normal population, and the results showed that TF and B4GALNT1 were overexpressed in patients. Co-expression gene analysis indicated that TF may participate in the metastasis of cancer through the complement system and mucopolysaccharide biosynthesis. B4GALNT1 may affect metastasis through focal adhesion, calcium signaling pathways, and Hippo signaling pathways. Our studies suggest that the complement system and the coagulation cascade, cholesterol metabolism, calcium pathway and iron transport may be associated in the mechanism of metastasis. TF and B4GALNT1 may be the key genes for metastasis, and they may be potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for ccRCC.

AB Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of alcoholic liver disease associated with high mortality. Current pharmacological treatment options are not fully effective, and novel target therapies are urgently needed. Until now, key genes, miRNAs and potential signaling pathways in AH remain unclear. Here, we integrated mRNA and miRNA expression profiles to reveal 1411 differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 69 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEM) in AH. And then 51 overlapping genes were identified by compared with miRNA target genes and DEGs, which named as consistent expression genes (CEGs). Pathway analysis showed that CEGs were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MicroRNAs in cancer, FoxO signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway and P53 signaling pathway. A total of 8 hub genes , FOS, FOXO1, SIRT1, ESR1, BCL2L11, CDK1, CCNB1 and CDKNIA, were screened using protein-protein interaction network analysis. In the regulatory network of miRNA and hub genes, a total of five miRNAs, miR-29c, miR-92b, miR-132, miR-221, miR-222, were identified as key miRNAs. Among them, miR-132 has been shown to target SIRT1, FOXO1, CDKNIA and BCL2L11, and miR-92b targets SIRT1 and BCL2L11. miR-221 and miR-222 both target FOS, ESR1, and BCL2L11. In addition, miR-29c is one of the major down-regulated miRNAs in AH, targeting FOS. Western blot analysis showed that SIRT1 and FoxO1 were expressed at low levels (P < 0.05) and CDK1 was highly expressed in the AH group (P < 0.05). The other five proteins were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). RT-PCR results showed that miR-132 was significantly higher in the AH group than in the normal group (P < 0.05), while miR-29c was lower than the normal group (P < 0.05), and the other three miRNAs were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Therefore, SIRT1, FOXO1, CDK1, miR-132 and miR-29c are involved in the regulation of FoxO and P53 signaling pathways, cell cycle and other biological processes, which may play a key role in the pathogenesis of AH.

TI Combining hierarchical clustering approaches using the PCA method

DE Clustering; Hierarchical clustering; Principle component analysis; PCA
ID COMBINATION
AB In expert systems, data mining methods are algorithms that simulate humans' problem-solving capabilities. Clustering methods as unsupervised machine learning methods are crucial approaches to categorize similar samples in the same categories. The use of different clustering algorithms to a given dataset produces clusters with different qualities. Hence, many researchers have applied clustering combination methods to reduce the risk of choosing an inappropriate clustering algorithm. In these methods, the outputs of several clustering algorithms are combined. In these research works, the input hierarchical clusterings are transformed to descriptor matrices and their combination is achieved by aggregating their descriptor matrices. In previous works, only element-wise aggregation operators have been used and the relation between the elements of each descriptor matrix has been ignored. However, the value of each element of the descriptor matrix is meaningful in comparison with its other elements. The current study proposes a novel method of combining hierarchical clustering approaches based on principle component analysis (PCA). PCA as an aggregator allows considering all elements of the descriptor matrices. In the proposed approach, basic clusters are made and transformed to descriptor matrices. Then, a final matrix is extracted from the descriptor matrices using PCA. Next, a final dendrogram is constructed from the matrix that is used to summarize the results of the diverse clustering. The experimental results on popular available datasets show the superiority of the clustering accuracy of the proposed method over basic clustering methods such as single, average and centroid linkage and previously combined hierarchical clustering methods. In addition, statistical tests show that the proposed method significantly out-performed hierarchical clustering combination methods with element-wise averaging operators in almost all tested datasets. Several experiments have also been conducted which confirm the robustness of the proposed method for its parameter setting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Performance of evolutionary algorithms depends on many factors such as population size, number of generations, crossover or mutation probability, etc. Generating the initial population is one of the important steps in evolutionary algorithms. A poor initial population may unnecessarily increase the number of searches or it may cause the algorithm to converge at local optima. In this study, we aim to find a promising method for generating the initial population, in the Feature Subset Selection (FSS) domain. FSS is not considered as an expert system by itself, yet it constitutes a significant step in many expert systems. It eliminates redundancy in data, which decreases training time and improves solution quality. To achieve our goal, we compare a total of five different initial population generation methods; Information Gain Ranking (IGR), greedy approach and three types of random approaches. We evaluate these methods using a specialized Teaching Learning Based Optimization searching algorithm (MTLBO-MD), and three supervised learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machine. In our experiments, we employ 12 publicly available datasets, mostly obtained from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. According to their feature sizes and instance counts, we manually classify these datasets as small, medium, or large-sized. Experimental results indicate that all tested methods achieve similar solutions on small-sized datasets. For medium-sized and large-sized datasets, however, the IGR method provides a better starting point in terms of execution time and learning performance. Finally, when compared with other studies in literature, the IGR method proves to be a viable option for initial population generation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder. It is reported that more than 90% of PD patients have voice impairments. Multiple types of voice recordings have been used for PD detection. Previous work indicates that the use of multiple types of samples per subject degenerates PD detection accuracy. In this paper, we validate it, and propose a two dimensional data selection method for sample and feature selection. The proposed method ranks features by using chi-square statistical model, searches optimal subset of the ranked features and iteratively selects samples. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PD detection accuracy on multiple types of voice data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Value efficiency analysis is an approach to incorporate the Decision-Maker's (DM) priori knowledge (preference information) into efficiency analysis. This paper presents a multi-objective programming model to measure the value efficiency. The model's feasible region is the production possibility set in data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the objective functions are the value efficiency scores corresponding to input and output components. Considering the structure of the proposed model and the concept of value efficiency, the step method (STEM) method to solve the model and gain the value efficiency is used in this paper. By selecting MPU (most preferred unit) units based on the manager's choice, the suitable benchmarks and value efficiency scores could be obtained corresponding to the unit under evaluation, then one could see that the obtained benchmarks and value efficiency scores are strongly dependent on the selected MPU units. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to illustrate the credit of the proposed approach. The method has been applied for real world data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since different features may require different costs, the cost-sensitive feature selection problem become more and more important in real-world applications. Generally, it includes two main conflicting objectives, i.e., maximizing the classification performance and minimizing the feature cost. However, most existing approaches treat this task as a single-objective optimization problem. To satisfy various requirements of decision-makers, this paper studies a multi-objective feature selection approach, called two-archive multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm (TMABC-FS). Two new operators, i.e., convergence-guiding search for employed bees and diversity-guiding search for onlooker bees, are proposed for obtaining a group of non-dominated feature subsets with good distribution and convergence. And two archives, i.e., the leader archive and the external archive are employed to enhance the search capability of different kinds of bees. The proposed TMABC-FS is validated on several datasets from UCI, and is compared with two traditional algorithms and three multi-objective methods. Results have shown that TMABC-FS is an efficient and robust optimization method for solving cost-sensitive feature selection problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELS
AB Times series often offers a natural disaggregation in a hierarchical structure. For example, product sales can come from different cities, districts, or states; or be grouped by categories and subcategories. This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry. Various hierarchical structures are proposed for the retail industry in order to achieve accurate product-level predictions. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the virtues of SVR-based hierarchical time series in terms of predictive performance when compared with the traditional ARIMA and Holt-Winters approaches for this task.

AB The shortage and wastage of blood products have been identified as the major contending factors that are frequently encountered in the management of blood supply chain processes. In general, the blood which is considered an essential product for which human existence relies on, has perishability characteristics that allow it to be stored up to a limited number of days. Therefore, this feature constrains the quantity of blood that can be retained in hospitals and blood centers, because keeping excessive number of blood units on inventory may result in blood product wastage. On the other hand, failure to stockpile on inventory can lead to shortage of this resource, and as a result may cause the cancellation of important activities such as treatment of special cases like surgery, accident, disaster circumstance and, in a worst case scenario increases the fatality rates at hospitals. This paper presents a dynamic mathematical model with the goal of improving the efficiency of blood related activities that occur at the blood centers. The model also caters for the assignment of whole blood units of available blood types to various requests. A set of equations that incorporate both the ABO and Rhesus blood groups are derived and presented subsequently. This further extends the initial work where only the ABO blood group was considered. In an effort to implement the developed model, three metaheuristic algorithms namely, symbiotic organisms search, symbiotic organisms search genetic algorithm, and symbiotic organisms search simulated annealing algorithms are proposed to identify the optimal routing for each of the blood types. An extensive numerical study was carried out using datasets from a synthetic blood sample collection process to illustrate the potential of the three metaheuristic algorithms to solve the developed blood assignment model. Furthermore, experimental results show that the hybrid symbiotic organisms search algorithms not only achieve superior accuracy, but also exhibits a higher level of stability, with the hybrid symbiotic organisms search genetic algorithm having the overall best superior performance.

AB Nowadays, data clustering is an important task to the mining research community since the availability of uncertain data is increasing rapidly in many applications such as weather forecasting, business information management systems. In this work, proposed Monte Carlo integration based uncertain objects modeling technique is compared with three state-of-the-art methods namely, kernel density estimation, Dempster-Shafer, and Monte Carlo simulation. Then Kullback-Leibler and Jeffrey divergences are used to measure the similarity between uncertain objects and merge them with modified DBSCAN and k-medoids clustering algorithms. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find the optimum radius, which is one of the inputs of DBSCAN. All the experiments are performed on one synthesized dataset and three real datasets namely, weather data, Japanese vowels and activity of daily living data. Five performance measures namely, accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and Jaccard index are considered for comparing proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. Two non-parametric tests namely, Wilcoxon rank sum and sign test are also conducted. These results denote the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.

AB Short messages are one of the milestones on the web especially on social media (SM). Due to the widespread circulation of SM, it already turns into excessively painful capturing outmost relevant and significant information for certain users. One of the main motivations of this work is that many users may need an inclusive brief of all comments without reading the entire list of short messages for decision making. In this work, mining in big social media data is formulated for the first time into a multi objective optimization (MOO) task to extract the essence of a text. Since some users may demand the brief at any moment, several groups of dissimilar short messages are established based on graph coloring mechanism. Six interesting feature are formalized to exhibit more interactive messages. A Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is employed to satisfy several important objectives for generating a concise summary. The problem was picked by using the Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) mechanism to trade-off among different features. Additionally, to satisfy real-time needs, an inventive incremental grouping task is modelled to update the existing colors. From exhaustive experimental results, the proposed approach outperformed other strong comparative methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In total, 139 papers are reviewed and classified, ranging from 1969 up to early 2019. Results showed that makespan was the objective function most adopted by the researchers, with 62% of the total covered, followed by multi-objective based (12%), total flow time-based (11%), due date-based (7%), stochastic based functions (6%) and cycle time (3%). Regarding the purpose of the paper, approximately 92% of the papers proposed solution methods, where 76% of the papers developed heuristic methods and 16% of exact methods, and 8% of the papers considered the analysis of the problem and literature reviews. Directions for future researches include the proposition of solution methods for mono-objective functions as total flow time-based and due date-based, development of solution methods for the m-machine flow shop with RCb and RCb* constraints and adoption of more than one additional constraint to the problem.

AB Document representation is central to modern natural language processing systems including document clustering. Empirical experiments in recent studies provide strong evidence that unsupervised language models can learn context-aware representations in the given documents and advance several NLP benchmark results. However, existing clustering approaches focus on the dimensionality reduction and do not exploit these informative representations. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple but experimentally effective clustering framework called Advanced Document Clustering (ADC). In contrast to previous clustering methods, ADC is designed to leverage syntactically and semantically meaningful features through feature-extraction and clustering modules in the framework. We first extract features from pre-trained language models and initialize cluster centroids to spread out uniformly. In the clustering module of ADC, the semantic similarity can be measured using the cosine similarity and centroids update while assigning centroids to a mini-batch input. Also, we utilize cross entropy loss partially, as the self-training scheme can be biased when parameters in the model are inaccurate. As a result, ADC can take advantages of contextualized representations while mitigating the limitations introduced by high-dimensional vectors. In numerous experiments with four datasets, the proposed ADC outperforms other existing approaches. In particular, experiments on categorizing news corpus with fake news demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for contextualized representations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increased life expectancy coupled with declining birth rates is leading to an aging population structure. Aging-caused changes, such as physical or cognitive decline, could affect people's quality of life, result in injuries, mental health or the lack of physical activity. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most promising assistive technologies to support older people's daily life, which has enabled enormous potential in human-centred applications. Recent surveys in HAR either only focus on the deep learning approaches or one specific sensor modality. This survey aims to provide a more comprehensive introduction for newcomers and researchers to HAR. We first introduce the state-of-art sensor modalities in HAR. We look more into the techniques involved in each step of wearable sensor modality centred HAR in terms of sensors, activities, data pre-processing, feature learning and classification, including both conventional approaches and deep learning methods. In the feature learning section, we focus on both hand-crafted features and automatically learned features using deep networks. We also present the ambient-sensor-based HAR, including camera-based systems, and the systems which combine the wearable and ambient sensors. Finally, we identify the corresponding challenges in HAR to pose research problems for further improvement in HAR. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the widespread adoption of data mining models to solve real-world problems, the scientific community is facing the need of increasing their interpretability and comprehensibility. This is especially relevant in the case of black box models, in which inputs and outputs are usually connected by highly complex and nonlinear functions; in applications requiring an interaction between the user and the model; and when the machine's solution disagrees with the human experience. In this contribution we present a new methodology that allows to simplify the process of understanding the rules behind a classification model, even in the case of black box ones. It is based on the perturbation of the features describing one instance, and on finding the minimal variation required to change the forecasted class. It thus yields simplified rules describing under which circumstances would the solution have been different, and allows to compare these with the human expectation. We show how such methodology is well defined, model-agnostic, easy to implement and modular; and demonstrate its usefulness with several synthetic and real-world data sets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Decision making techniques have been widely used in healthcare and medical industry. This study systematically reviews the conventional and fuzzy decision-making techniques applied in healthcare and medical problems. In total, we evaluated 202 published studies selected from 85 high-ranking journals, in which 130 of those published studies were directly related to the decision-making processes in healthcare and medical issues. Selected studies were classified into nine application areas: environmental sustain ability, waste management, service quality, risk management, medical equipment and material selection, health technology, operation researches in healthcare, hospital healthcare services and other application areas. Furthermore, we classified the selected studies by numerous significant perspectives such as the authors, application areas, utilized techniques, publication time periods, decision-making and study goals, and significant results of the papers. The statistical results show that the year 2012 was ranked first in terms of developed studies within the period of 1989-2018. The techniques of AHP and hybrid approaches were the most frequently implemented decision-making technique in healthcare fields. Notably, the results also show that decision-making approaches and techniques are mostly applied to evaluate and rank different applications of service quality in healthcare and medical industries.

AB Autonomous robot navigation consists of establishing a sequence of actions that guarantee safe and efficient locomotion for a robotic system. This work focuses on outdoor ground robot navigation guided by aerial images. We propose a pipeline of image processing, traversability estimation, terrain representation and route planning capable of assessing whether a desired target location is reachable or not. We also propose a dataset and an evaluation method to quantify the average quality of generated paths and measure how well a planning strategy finds possible routes and rejects impossible ones. This evaluation was applied to identify a parameter combination that maximized path feasibility recognition and average path quality. Our results show that the proposed strategy identifies the correct action in 85.8% of the test cases and takes an average of 2.3 s for mapping and 100 ms for path planning over 300 x 300 m(2) areas in images of size 1000 x 1000 pixels. We successfully employed our proposed method in a small scale experiment to guide our Hydra v3 mini rover. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recommendation systems have been widely deployed to address the challenge of overwhelming information. They are used to enable users to find interesting information from a large volume of data. However, in the era of Big Data, as data become larger and more complicated, a recommendation algorithm that runs in a traditional environment cannot be fast and effective. It requires a high computational cost for performing the training task, which may limit its applicability in real-world Big Data applications.
   In this paper, we propose a novel distributed recommendation solution for Big Data. It is designed based on Apache Spark to handle large-scale data, improve the prediction quality, and address the data sparsity problem. In particular, thanks to a novel learning process, the model is able to significantly speed up the distributed training, as well as improve the performance in the context of Big Data. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposal outperforms existing recommendation methods in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and computational time.

AB It is a challenging and rewarding work for monitoring driving status in daily commute, which is favorable for declining the occurrence of traffic accidents and promoting driver's health. One big challenge that restricts this kind of research from real-life applications is the robustness and transfer ability of learning methods that can effectively tackle individual difference. Drawing knowledge from others through transfer learning could boost detection performance of a new driver. The present study aims to develop an efficient cross-subject transfer learning framework for driving status detection based on physiological signals. To grasp what part of knowledge was appropriate for transferring, cross-subject feature evaluation was used to measure feature quality. Then based on the evaluation score, several filtering algorithms were combined to search for better feature subsets that were not only helpful for later classification tasks but also robust to the individual difference. Finally, the framework based on hybrid feature selection and efficient transfer classifier was validated using simulated and real driving datasets. Our experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm could achieve high recognition accuracy and good transferability among individuals, which could increase the scope of application of physiological data for drive status detection during daily life, as it alleviated the need of subject specific pilot data for assessing the physiological characteristics across subjects. This scheme can be further developed into an online warning and assistant system in vehicles helping to early detect driver's unfavorable status, better manage their negative emotion and decrease the occurrence of traffic accidents.

AB Classification of the high-dimensional data by a new expert system is followed in the current paper. The proposed system defines some non-disjoint clusters of highly relevant features with the least inner redundancy. For each cluster, a neural tree is implemented exploiting an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) together an inference engine in any node. The derived classification rules from ELM are stored in the rule base of the inference engine to recognize the classes. A majority voting is used to unify the results of the different neural trees. This structure is refereed as the Forest of Extreme Learning Machines with Rule base Transferring (FELM-RT). The contribution of FELM-RT is to decrease the duplicated computations by using two novel interaction models between the neural trees. In the first interaction model, namely Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, each node can share its rule-base with the other nodes of the various neural trees. In the second that is referred as Server-to-Client (S2C) model, a neural tree that works on a cluster with the best relevancy and redundancy, shares the rules with the other neural trees. In both of the models, a fuzzy aggregation technique is used to adjust the certainty of the rules. The processing time of FELM-RT decreases essentially and it improves the classification accuracy. The high results of F-measure and G mean, show that FELM-RT classifies the high-dimensional datasets without over-fitting. The comparison between FELM-RT and some state-of-the-art classifiers reveals that FELM-RT overcomes them specially on the datasets with more than 3 million features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many expert systems have been developed for self-adaptive PID controllers of mobile robots. However, the high computational requirements of the expert systems layers, developed for the tuning of the PID controllers, still require previous expert knowledge and high efficiency in algorithmic and software execution for real-time applications. To address these problems, in this paper we propose an expert agent based system, based on a reinforcement learning agent, for self-adapting multiple low-level PID controllers in mobile robots. For the formulation of the artificial expert agent, we develop an incremental model-free algorithm version of the double Q-Learning algorithm for fast on-line adaptation of multiple low-level PID controllers. Fast learning and high on-line adaptability of the artificial expert agent is achieved by means of a proposed incremental active-learning exploration-exploitation procedure, for a non-uniform state space exploration, along with an experience replay mechanism for multiple value functions updates in the double Q-Iearning algorithm.

AB Data scenarios on nowadays comprise an enormous number of attributes and instances while not all attributes are necessary and useful for data analytics and knowledge extraction in framing expert and intelligent systems. In such scenarios, removing irrelevant and redundant attributes is a very important task and a challenging research problem. In rough set approach, the attribute reduction method based on the positive region has reported the promising performance in consistent decision tables, while conditional information entropies are employed instead for inconsistent decision tables. However, the complexity of existing methods is still quite high. This paper proposes efficient attribute reduction approaches in inconsistent decision tables by using the concept of stripped quotient sets. Firstly, we present a method for fast determining reducts based on the conditional information entropies including Shannon's and Liang's entropies, called ERED-SQS. Secondly, we define an original notion of attribute reduction based on the stripped quotient set and propose an efficient SRED algorithm to cope with this reduct type. Finally, a simulation performed on 16 datasets varying in a number of objects, up to 5 millions, and a number of attributes, up to 20 thousands, to validate the proposed methods in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms, ERED-SQS and SRED, have significantly improved the computational time, especially for large data sets. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the reducts obtained from SRED algorithm outperforms that of the reducts based on Shannons and Liangs conditional entropies. This verifies that our proposal is applicable and effective to applications regarding attribute reduction in inconsistent decision tables. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deep Neural Network (DNN) has made great leaps in image classification and speech recognition in recent years. However, employing DNN for node classification such as in social network remains to be a non-trivial problem. Moreover, the current advanced method of implementing node classification tasks usually takes two steps, i.e. firstly, the embedding vector of the node is obtained through network embedding and then the classifier such as SVM is leveraged to do the task. Distinctly, this may only get the suboptimal solution of the problem. To settle the above issues, a novel Deep Neural Network method for node classification named DNNNC is proposed in the framework of Deep Learning. Specifically, we first get the positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) matrix from the given adjacency matrix. Then, the data is fed to deep neural network composed of deep stacked sparse autoencoders and softmax layer, which could learn the node representation while encoding the rich nonlinear structural and semantic information and could be well trained for node classification under the DNN framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world network datasets for node classification task and have shown that the proposed model DNNNC outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the view of superior performance.

AB This paper presents a new image processing and analysis technique for the quality evaluation of cell nuclei to support medical diagnostics in breast cancer. The technique allows cell nuclei that are deformed or overlapped by biological material to be reconstructed. The paper proposes a sensitivity and similarity approach, enriching the PatchMatch correspondence algorithm in accurate cell reconstruction. Its application in reconstruction processes enables accelerated computations and an increased probability of obtaining appropriate segmentation results. The numerical results demonstrate that the developed system allows for automatic and effective cell nuclei reconstruction with an acceptable average area accuracy level above 85% compared with manual human results (assuming manual segmentation as a true value). The reconstruction system allows for the recovery of the proper shape of the analyzed distorted cells very rapidly and in a repeatable manner. An additional advantage of the procedure is that the nuclei area overlapped by artifacts or other cells can be determined. The experimental results prove the high utility of the method in final HER2 gene amplification assessment in breast cancer images. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Acquiring knowledge for conversation modeling is an important task in the process of building a Conversational Agent (Chatbot). However, it is a quite difficult process that requires too much time and efforts. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper, we demonstrate a novel methodology for the automatic conversational knowledge extraction from an existing Chatbot. Extracted knowledge will be used as training dataset for building a Neural Network Conversational Agent. The experiments in the paper show that our proposed approach can be used for the automatic knowledge extraction from any type of Chatbot on the Internet. The experiment that is presented in this paper has two phases. In the first phase, we present a methodology for the conversational knowledge extraction. In the second phase of the experiment, we introduce a methodology for building a new Neural Conversational Agent using a deep learning Neural Network framework. The key novelty of our proposed approach is the automated machine-machine conversational knowledge sharing and reuse. This is an important step towards building the new conversational agents skipping the difficult and time-consuming procedure of knowledge acquisition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Credit scoring; Reject inference; Bayesian networks; Predictive accuracy
AB Credit scoring is an automatic credit assessment tool that has been used by different types of financial institutions for years. When a financial institution wants to create a credit scoring model for all applicants, the institution only has the known good/bad loan outcome for the accepted applicants; this causes an inherent bias in the model. Reject inference is the process of inferring a good/bad loan outcome to the applicants that were rejected for a loan so that the updated credit scoring model will be representative of all loan applicants, accepted and rejected. This paper presents an empirical reject inference technique using a Bayesian network. The proposed method has an advantage over traditional reject inference methods since there is no functional form that will be estimated with the accepted applicants' data and extrapolated to the rejected applicants to infer their good/bad loan outcome status.

AB Many clustering algorithms categorized as K-clustering algorithm require the user to predict the number of clusters (K) to do clustering. Due to lack of domain knowledge an accurate value of K is difficult to predict. The problem becomes critical when the dimensionality of data points is large; clusters differ widely in shape, size, and density; and when clusters are overlapping in nature. Determining the suitable K is an optimization problem. Automatic clustering algorithms can discover the optimal K. This paper presents an automatic clustering algorithm which is superior to K-clustering algorithm as it can discover an optimal value of K. Iterative hill-climbing algorithms like K-Means work on a single solution and converge to a local optimum solution. Here, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) find out near global optimum solutions, i.e. optimal K as well as the optimal cluster centroids. Single-objective clustering algorithms are adequate for efficiently grouping linearly separable clusters. For non-linearly separable clusters they are not so good. So for grouping non-linearly separable clusters, we apply Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) by minimizing the intra-cluster distance and maximizing inter-cluster distance. Many existing MOGA based clustering algorithms are suitable for either numeric or categorical features. This paper pioneered employing MOGA for automatic clustering with mixed types of features. Statistical testing on experimental results on real-life benchmark data sets from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository proves the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

ID FACE RECOGNITION
AB Given that collaborative representation (CR) methods have achieved great success in traditional single image based classification, recently, researchers have exploited the mechanism of collaborative representation to handle the case of image set based classification problem. However, without considering a proper criterion for feature extraction, this extension of collaborative representation mechanism suffers from the misleading coefficients of the incorrect classes on the uncontrolled datasets with small class separability. To address this limitation, inspired by large margin principle in discriminative analysis that aims to separately exploit the inter-class and intra-class variability, this paper proposes a novel theoretical framework of set oriented multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction based on collaborative representation classification. To achieve this framework, we integrate the learning of an optimal kernel from the multiple base kernels and a discriminative projection into a unified formulation. Moreover, robust feature information can be effectively extracted by minimizing the intra-class reconstruction residual and maximizing the inter-class reconstruction residual of the regularized hull modeled for the image sets. Since the criterion of feature extraction conforms to the mechanism of the collaborative representation classifier, the collaborative representation coefficients in our model can be much discriminative across classes. Notably, this research has important theoretical significance in improving the classification performance for collaborative representation classifier from the perspective of large margin discriminative learning. By employing the method of trace ratio maximization, we also develop a framework to solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem efficiently. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning is often associated with a bias-variance trade-off. The underfitting most clearly manifests in the tree-based inducers when used to classify the gene expression data. To improve the generalization ability of decision trees, we are introducing an evolutionary, multi-test tree approach tailored to this specific application domain. The general idea is to apply gene clusters of varying size, which consist of functionally related genes in each splitting rule. It is achieved by using a few simple tests that mimic each other's predictions and built-in information about the discriminatory power of genes. The tendencies to underfit and overfit are limited by the multi objective fitness function that minimizes tree error, split divergence and attribute costs. Evolutionary search for multi-tests in internal nodes, as well as the overall tree structure, is performed simultaneously.
   This novel approach called Evolutionary Multi-Test Tree (EMTTree) may bring far-reaching benefits to the domain of molecular biology including biomarker discovery, finding new gene-gene interactions and high-quality prediction. Extensive experiments carried out on 35 publicly available gene expression datasets show that we managed to significantly improve the accuracy and stability of decision tree. Importantly, EMTTree does not substantially increase the overall complexity of the tree, so that the patterns in the predictive structures are kept comprehensible. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose a banknote aging simulator for generating aged banknotes from new banknotes. When new banknotes begin to be circulated, automatic teller machines (ATMs) are trained with these new banknotes. However, the ATM operations become more erroneous after several months as the banknotes start aging. Also, the process of updating ATM software for aged banknotes is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we developed a simulator for banknote aging that uses the Gaussian and Perlin noise models. The proposed simulator allows ATMs to better handle aged and soiled banknotes without updating ATM software. The experimental results show that the classification and validation performance of aged and soiled banknotes improved noticeably when the classification and validation algorithms were designed using the proposed simulator for new banknotes.

AB This study explores the potential strategic determinants of firm performance, with an emphasis on R&D investment and operational efficiency in leading U.S. manufacturing firms. In particular, it investigates R&D as a driver of technological innovation, and operational efficiency and as an indicator of the best practice operations, for their impact relative to Tobin's Q and Market value. The study jointly uses ordinary least square multiple regression (OLSMR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), not only to measure the statistical significance of factors, but also to explore new insights into their relative importance, and to determine the differential impact of each factor following the varying performance levels. A major finding is that proactive R&D investments and operational excellence are the most impactful factors on both metrics of performance as compared to other conventional factors used in this study. Another encouraging finding is that both R&D intensity and operational efficiency are even more influential in the above-average performers and yield higher returns in market valuation. Through a combined OLSMR-BPNN approach, this study presents insightful findings on this intriguing subject and highlights prospective research opportunities. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper we face the problem of Community Question Answering for the Arabic language. In this setting, a member of the community posts an initial query expressed in Natural Language. Other participants post their own interventions: answers, comments, additional questions, etc. contributing to building a rather tangled thread of nodes containing Natural Language short texts. The task consists in answering the initial query using the thread as the space of possible answers. The task can be approached as a classification, a regression or a ranking problem. In our case we select the set of possible candidates, we assign a relevance score to each candidate and we rank them accordingly.
   We propose a bunch of unsupervised models and show that a model based on Latent Semantic Indexing approach outperforms state of the art models for this task. We also use transfer learning to power the embeddings layer of various deep learning models and prove that the pairwise approaches outperform their pointwise counterparts. All the proposed models have been evaluated on Semeval 2017 Task 3 Subtask D: Arabic Community Question Answering and achieve state of the art or near performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Shattering coefficient; Decision Trees; Statistical Learning Theory;
   Learning guarantees
AB In spite of the relevance of Decision Trees (DTs), there is still a disconnection between their theoretical and practical results while selecting models to address specific learning tasks. A particular criterion is provided by the Shattering coefficient, a growth function formulated in the context of the Statistical Learning Theory (SLT), which measures the complexity of the algorithm bias as sample sizes increase. In attempt to establish the basis for a relative theoretical complexity analysis, this paper introduces a method to compute the Shattering coefficient of DT models using recurrence equations. Next, we assess the bias of models provided by DT algorithms while solving practical problems as well as their overall learning bounds in light of the SLT. As the main contribution, our results support other researchers to decide on the most adequate DT models to tackle specific supervised learning tasks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low resolution, difficult illumination and noise are the important factors that affect the performance of face recognition system. In order to counteract these adverse factors, in this paper we propose copula probability models based on Gabor wavelets for face recognition. Gabor wavelets have robust performance under lighting and noise conditions. The strong dependencies exist in the domain of Gabor wavelets due to their non-orthogonal property. In the light of the structure characteristic of Gabor wavelet sub bands, the proposed methods use copula to capture the dependencies to represent the face image. Three probability-model-based methods CF-GW (Copula Function of Gabor Wavelets), LCM-GW (Lightweight Copula Model of Gabor Wavelets) and LCM-GW-PSO (Lightweight Copula Model of Gabor Wavelets with Particle Swarm Optimization) are proposed for face recognition. Experiments of face recognition show our proposed methods are more robust under the conditions of low resolution, lighting and noise than the popular methods such as the LBP-based methods and other Gabor-based methods. The face features extracted by our methods belong to the Riemannian manifold which is different to Euclidean space. In order to deal the issue of face recognition in complex environment, we can combine the face features in Riemannian manifold with the face features in Euclidean space to obtain the more robust face recognition system by using expert system technologies such as reasoning model and multi-classifier fusion.

AB In this paper, we address a real problem of packing boxes into a multi-compartment container, in which the boxes must be delivered to customers in a predefined route. This problem arises, for example, in the distribution of beverages (packed in "boxes") by trucks whose container has multiple compartments. The objective is to find a feasible packing plan that minimizes the handling of boxes inside the container along the whole truck route. The following practical constraints must be met: orientation of the boxes, cargo stability, load bearing strength of the boxes and load balancing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on a vehicle packing problem with multi-compartment containers in the context of beverage distribution. To solve this problem, we present a hybrid approach which consists of a heuristic method based on the generation of horizontal layers and on the solution of mixed integer linear programming models. Computational tests were performed with this approach and a large variety of instances based on real data from a soft drink company. The results show that the approach is able to find feasible solutions for all instances considered under all constraints, contrary to what was observed in practice with the manual procedures available in the company. In practice, if a feasible solution is not obtained, it is necessary to change the predefined route plan and/or to consider an additional new delivery route and/or to use a solution that violates some of the constraints involved. In this sense, the proposed solution approach has good potential for being embedded into existing expert and intelligent systems for supporting the decision making process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Weighting and normalization are the most important factor that may affect the text representation significantly. This paper presents two novel term weighting schemes to represent text documents, namely, i). Term-weighting scheme for document representation based on Term Frequency - Ranking of Term Frequency (TF-RTF) and ii). Term-weighting scheme for document representation based on Term Frequency - Ranking of fuzzy logic with semantic relationship of terms (TF-RFST). The ranking of each term in a document provides its priority of the document and uses these priorities for document representation in TF-RTF. In TF-RFST, each term is represented based on its frequency and the frequency of semantic related terms for that term. Hence, the ranking of each term is based on the combined frequencies of the term and its semantic related terms with a specific weighting scheme. With appropriate weighting schemes such as TF-RFT and TF-RFST, the proposed methods provide better clustering performance in terms of accuracy, entropy, recall and F-Measure than previously suggested methods, such as word count, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Term Frequency-Inverse Corpus Frequency (TF-ICF), Multi Aspect TF (MATF), BM25 and BM25F. Experiments carried out on the Reuters-8, Reuters-52 and WebKB data sets with K-means and K-means++ clustering algorithms for demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed term weighting schemes.

AB We study the design of a two-echelon supply chain network in the presence of suppliers' all-unit quantity discount and transportation mode selection. The problem involves determining the best location for plants and the allocation of customers to open plants. The problem additionally entails making decisions for the order quantity from each supplier for each plant and accordingly selecting the best transportation mode that can accommodate these order quantities among echelons. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with fixed opening and operating costs of plants, fixed and variable costs of transportation modes, and purchasing costs of raw materials. To characterize and solve this problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. We demonstrate that the MIP model has a special mathematical structure that makes it amenable to decomposition techniques. We, therefore, exploit this decomposable structure and develop an effective Lagrangian-based decomposition for solving the MIP. Our Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) method relaxes the complicating constraints associated with commodity flow conservation among echelons in the MIP, yielding more tractable subproblems, one for each echelon. Solutions obtained from the relaxed problem may be infeasible, e.g., the demand for some of the customers may not be satisfied. We remedy these subproblems' infeasibilities using novel feasibility algorithms and appropriate Lagrangian multipliers that penalize constraints' violations in the subproblems, leading the algorithm towards global feasibility/optimality. We appraise the performance of the MIP model and the LR algorithm on instances of varying sizes. We show that the MIP model solved via CPLEX finds integer feasible solutions for 42% of large problem instances and its average optimality gap for these solved instances is 64.56%. The LR algorithm significantly improves the solvability and optimality gap of the MIP model and finds integer feasible solutions for 100% of problem instances and achieves an average optimality gap of 1.78%. We investigate the robustness of our algorithm by conducting sensitivity analyses on the model parameters. We demonstrate that the LR technique remains robust and tractable with respect to various parameters' values. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A synthetic scenario for functionalization of beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) with polymeric units containing caffeic acid (beta Lg-polyCA) was developed; and all intermediates and final products were structurally confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and physico-chemically characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. The antioxidant properties and emulsion stability of beta Lg, beta Lg-CA conjugate and beta Lg-polyCA based systems containing high percentage of fish oil (50%) were evaluated; and beta Lg-polyCA presented the highest antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activity based on DPPH, ABTS and HS scavenging assays (92.4, 87.92 and 67.35% respectively). Thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) WA demonstrated that compared to native beta Lg, beta Lg-polyCA afford up 4-5 fold of inhibition of oxidative rancidity and displayed drastic secondary structure changes. Compared to native beta Lg based emulsions, beta Lg-polyCA had larger oil droplet sizes, stronger negative zeta potentials ( - 69.9 my), narrower size distributions (PDI: 0.22) and less creaming index.

AB Candida antarctica lipase B-catalysed synthesis of lipophilic esters of polydatin was investigated along with their antioxidant activities. The effects of synthesis parameters such as solvent, substrate molar ratio, enzyme concentration, addition of molecular sieves, reaction temperature and time on the production of ester were studied and optimised. The highest production of esters was obtained with acetone as the reaction solvent. The antioxidant activities of the esters were compared with those of commercial butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and alpha-tocopherol. All polydatin esters inhibited the oxidative destruction of beta-carotene more effectively than did BHT and alpha-tocopherol. Results of thiobarbituric acid tests showed that in bulk fish oil, all esters were more effective than alpha-tocopherol at 2 mmol/kg concentration but were not as effective as BHT. In fish oil-emulsions, all esters were more effective than both BHT and alpha-tocopherol at 2 mmol/kg concentration. The synthesized polydatin esters are promising antioxidants for oil/fat-based foods.

AB The nutritional and sensory quality of a fish fillet is subject to alterations depending on the culinary method used for preparation. The current study aimed to explore the effects of custom culinary preparation methods (steaming, oven-cooking, frying) on the fillet lipid and sensory quality of two important Mediterranean farmed fish species varying in their tissue fat content. These included, lean meagre and medium-fat gilthead seabream. The results indicated that culinary treatment effects on lipid quality differed among species, especially for frying. Frying created unique sensory profiles, whereas steam- and oven-cooking resulted in similar sensory profiles per species. The variable effects of culinary treatments on the lipid and sensory quality indicate that the choice of preparation method should be related to the fish species and its fat content.

AB The main contributors to the cooked off-flavor in heat-sterilized lychee juice (HLJ) were studied by means of molecular sensory science. The HLJ which elicited cooked cabbage/potato and onion/garlic off-flavor was compared with fresh lychee juice (FLJ) having desired sensory attributes via chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. Aroma extract dilution analysis, quantitative analysis and calculation of odor activity values (OAVs) were conducted on both FLJ and HLJ. The results showed that compared with FLJ, 15 compounds had increased OAVs in HLJ, among which, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methional, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) and 2,4-dithiapentane presented cooked cabbage/potato, garlic/onion and sulfurous impression. The omission experiment proved that DMS, methional, DMTS, DMDS, 3-methylbutanal and 2,4-dithiapentane had significantly negative effects on the overall aroma of HLJ. Further studies on HLJs from other varieties of lychee confirmed that DMS, methional, DMTS, DMDS and 3-methylbutanal were responsible for the cooked off-flavor of HLJ in general.

AB A method was developed and validated for determination of tryptoquialanines A and C in orange samples on epicarp (exterior peel), mesocarp (white peel), and endocarp (fruit juice) based on QuEChERS extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis. The method showed an excellent linearity over a range of 5-400 mu g kg(-1), with r(2) >= 0.998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 5 and 10 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Recoveries showed values between 57 and 101%, with RSD <= 12%. Analysis of infected oranges showed diffusion of the alkaloids between the orange layers after 4 days post infection in concentrations > LOQ. Mycotoxin diffusion to healthy oranges after direct contact with infected oranges for 48 h, showed alkaloid concentrations >= 10 mu g kg(-1) on epicarp layer. The developed method can be easily applied for quality control in routine analysis of orange fruit due to the high risk that these tremorgenic alkaloids represent to human health.

AB A small library of 57 low molecular weight oximes was prepared from fragrant aldehydes and ketones, and their olfactory profiles were determined. The most substantive and interesting in terms of the sensory impressions were ( + )-isomenthone oxime (fresh, musty, green) and cyclocitral oxime (earthy with patchouli, moss and leather notes). The linear retention indices (LRI) were determined for DB-1, DB-5 and DB-WAX columns, and E/Z isomers of 22 out of 57 compounds were resolved on the DB-5 column. Attempts were made to resolve enantiomers of the chosen oximes on chiral GC columns. The best results were obtained by using a Cyclosil B column, on which the enantiomers of camphor, menthone, piperitone and carvone oximes were fully resolved. NMR and MS spectra were acquired to characterize the synthesized library. Gas chromatography-olfactometry was used to assess odoriferous properties of both isomers of oximes. In most cases both isomers possessed similar profile and intensity.

AB Craterellus tubaeformis (Funnel Chanterelle) is among the most abundant wild mushrooms in Finland. Three polysaccharide fractions were sequentially extracted from the fruiting bodies of C. tubaeformis, using hot water, 2% and 25% KOH solutions, respectively, and purified. The monomer composition, molecular weight, and chemical structure were determined using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed as well. The hot water extract consisted mainly of high-molecular weight -> 2,6)-alpha-Man-(1 -> and -> 6)-alpha-Gal-(1 -> chains, covalently bound to proteins. The alkali extracts consisted of acidic -> 6)-beta-Glc-(1 ->, with branches of short -> 3)-beta-Glc-(1 -> chains or single beta-Glc residues. The use of alkali influenced the glycosidic linkages, molecular mass and thermal stability of the polysaccharide fractions. The use of KOH 2% increased the amount of low molecular weight polysaccharides, resulting in bimodal molecular weight distributions, with little impact on the thermal stability. Conversely, extraction with KOH 25% provided low molecular weight polysaccharides with substantially reduced thermal stability.

AB In this study the effect of agavin and inulin addition on the microstructural, textural, thermal and sensory properties of apple leathers was investigated. Agavins and inulin were added to leathers at two concentration levels (6 and 4%) individually and as a mixture. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed more compact and less porous matrices in the 6% concentration with respect to the control, influencing leather texture. In formulations with agavins the texture was significantly (p < 0.05) smoother than in those with inulin. No relationship was found between hardness and glass transition temperature (Tg), but there was a significant difference between treated leathers and the control. The acceptability of the product showed a direct relationship with the hardness. There were significant changes in the leathers after storage. Agavins and inulin exhibited different technological properties and considering the texturising effect of the agavins, their potential for use in the food industry is promising.

AB Some Eastern Asian countries deem pufferfish - especially its muscle - a culinary delight. Herein, molecular mass fingerprinting of soups prepared by Takifugu fiavidus, Takifugu obscurus and Takifugu rubripes was established via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). Soup samples were directly analyzed by MALDI MS to collect mass spectra within 0-700 Da in a quick way, followed by principal component analysis to distinguish the different soups and to find out the distinctive compounds among the soups. High performance liquid chromatography - tandem MS (HPLC-MS/MS) was applied to identify the compounds. Nineteen compounds were identified from the HPLC-MS/MS data by using METLIN database. Through literature mining, we found that these compounds are closely related to the flavor, nutrition, and safety of pufferfish soups. This method can also be used as a facile way to distinguish between different pufferfish fillets when morphological characters have been damaged or destroyed.

AB The glutenin (Glu) and gliadin (Gli) were modified by protein-glutaminase (PG) to obtain soluble glutenin (PG-Glu) and gliadin (PG-Gli), and PG-Glu or PG-Gli was added to potato starch (PS) according to different amounts (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, based on dry starch weight, w/w) to explore the effect of modified proteins on the retrogradation behavior and digestibility of PS. The results showed that the long-term retrogradation of PS was accelerated by the addition of PG-Glu or PG-Gli. The addition of PG-Glu or PG-Gli led to an increase in hydrogen bonds within starch molecules and induced a significant increase in resistant starch content. The hydrolysis kinetic parameters, C-infinity and K, both decreased with the increasing level of modified protein, indicating the deceleration of hydrolysis rate by the addition of PG-Glu or PG-Gli. In summary, the addition of PG-Glu or PG-Gli could promote the retrogradation of PS and mitigate the digestion of starch.

AB Capsaicinoids and capsinoids from dietary peppers have promising sensory properties and bioactivity, but the molecular basis of their penetration mechanism through cell lipid bilayers and its relationship to their bioavailability as food constituents are still poorly understood. Herein, statistically significant linear and quadratic quantitative structure-activity relationships were constructed to derive the essential structural elements required for their bioactivity against the elongation of etiolated wheat coleoptiles that mainly occurs via penetration. The resultant optimal models had high predictivity and reliability (r(2) > 0.825 and rp(red)(2) > 0.950), which elucidate the importance of steric structural elements. Besides, their mechanistic hypothesis and rational design strategy were proposed, and the correlation between this bioactivity and their food-sensory properties was supposed. Finally, the bioactivity of newly designed analogs with methyl terminals and/or conjugated C=C links was screened. Hopefully, this work would benefit the better understanding of their penetration mechanism and facile identification of bioactive analogs for designing food/drug formulations.

AB Recent studies have shown that the high susceptibility of flaxseed oil nanoemulsions to lipid oxidation limits their incorporation into functional foods and beverages. For this reason, the impact of various flaxseed phenolic extracts on the physical and oxidative stability of flaxseed oil nanoemulsions was investigated. Flaxseed lignan extract (FLE) and secoisolariciresinol (SECO) exhibited antioxidant activity whereas secoisolariciresinol diglu-coside (SDG) and p-coumaric acid (CouA) exhibited prooxidant activity in the flaxseed oil nanoemulsions. The antioxidant potential of flaxseed phenolics in the nanoemulsions was as follows: SECO < CouA < SDG approximate to FLE. Moreover, the antioxidant/prooxidant activity of the phenolics was also related to their free radical scavenging activity and partitioning in the nanoemulsions. Our results suggested that both SECO and FLE were good plantbased antioxidants for improving the stability of flaxseed oil nanoemulsions.

AB The technological and polyphenolic parameters of grapes for juice processing obtained from successive harvests were studied in semi-arid tropical viticulture. Red grapes "BRS Violeta" and "Isabel Precoce" were harvested during the same year and analyzed based on a multivariate approach that included climatic variations. The grapes were marked by variations in flavonoid compounds, particularly anthocyanins. Temperature, global radiation, air velocity and evapotranspiration rates were associated with higher accumulation of bioactive polyphenols in grape berries and juices. The temperatures in February were associated with higher antioxidant activity in grape peels, while the highest thermal amplitude in August and November favored the accumulation of anthocyanins up to 564 mg kg(-1). Flavanols and procyanidin compounds were more abundant in seeds when the maximum thermal amplitude was 13.8 degrees C. The climatic data together with the polyphenolic results point out useful information about appropriate periods for harvesting grapes with high phenolic content in tropical areas.

AB Zeaxanthin nanoparticles (Zea-NP) and zeaxanthin nanoemulsion (Zea-NE) were incorporated in yogurt. Control yogurt (CY), yogurt added of nanoparticles (Y-NP) and yogurt added of nanoemulsion (Y-NE) were evaluated weekly regarding pH, titratable acidity, color, textural parameters, viscosity and syneresis during 28 days. Zeaxanthin retention in Y-NP and Y-NE was also determined over storage. Sensory attributes and morphology were evaluated in all yogurt samples, and zeaxanthin bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion was analyzed in Y-NP and Y-NE after preparation. At the end of storage time, zeaxanthin retention was higher in Y-NP (22.31 +/- 2.53%) than in Y-NE (16.84 +/- 0.53%). Despite the lower firmness and viscosity observed in Y-NP, these changes were not sensory perceived. The bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion suggested that nanoencapsulation provided a controlled release of the carotenoid. Zea-NP can be incorporated in yogurt, allowing the dispersion of a hydrophobic compound in a hydrophilic matrix, providing stability.

The highest reduction in iodine content was found in boiled abalone (64.95%), followed by steamed (32.40%) and grilled (32.11%) abalones. There is no significant difference between iodine content of raw and semi-dried abalone. Absorption efficiency was determined by an in vitro digestion procedure using simulated gastro/intestinal solutions. Unlike total iodine content after cooking, absorption efficiency increased after cooking. Absorption efficiency of semi-dried abalone is the highest (28.53%), followed by boiled (23.85%), grilled (22.62%), steamed (21.51%), and raw (12.20%) abalones. Iodide was the major form of iodine present in the abalone after cooking and in vitro digestion. No iodate was observed, and the organic iodine content was very low.

AB Starch is the abundant component in rice endosperm, and its microstructure determines the quality and functional properties of rice grain. It is well known that the starch fine structure is markedly influenced by high temperature during grain filling. However, it is poorly understood on the competition among starch synthesis related enzymes as well as the interaction between amylose and amylopectin biosynthesis under increased growing temperature. In this study, the non-waxy and waxy rice were planted under normal and high temperatures. Parameterizing analysis of the starch microstructure using mathematical models proved that amylose synthesis competed with the elongation of long amylopectin chains (DP > 60); Short chains of amylopectin can be used as the substrate for elongation of longer amylopectin chains; High temperature eliminated the consistency and regularly of the synthesis of amylose and amylopectin. In addition, enzyme assay proved the validly of fitting results from mathematical modeling analysis of starch.

AB Hexaploid tritordeum is the amphidiploid cereal derived from the cross between wild barley and durum wheat. The present study compares two cultivars of tritordeum with other cereals grown in the same experimental area to weigh up its potential use as ingredient for health-valued foods. Tritordeum shows 2.5-fold higher concentration of lutein than common wheat and barley, and 1.2-fold higher than durum wheat, while the concentration of beta-glucans is 5 folds lower than the one observed for barley. Based on the distribution of bioactive compounds in pearled fractions, the use of whole-grain flours seems the best way to exploit the antioxidant potential of tritordeum. Nevertheless, the internal layers of the kernel of this cereal are characterized on average by high concentrations of antioxidants (32.0 mg/kg and 518 mg/kg soluble and cell wall-bound phenolic acids, respectively), making tritordeum interesting also for the production of refined flours rich in bioactive compounds.

AB Panela is a natural, unrefined non-centrifugal sugar obtained by intense dehydration of sugarcane juice. Acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural were determined in 40 panda samples distributed as granulated and block according to the technological process. Colour, browning, moisture, water activity, pH and antioxidant capacity were also evaluated. Acrylamide ranged between 60 and 3058 mu g/kg; granulated panda reporting the highest concentration (812 mu g/kg) compared with block panda (540 mu g/kg). The lower content in HMF and furfural, the intense dehydration, and the extensive darkening of granulated panda suggested the browning reactions were boosted due to the application of more severe thermal treatments. Principal component analysis showed a significant relationship between the panda presentation and the concentration of the analysed compounds. Benchmark values considering both types of processes would help to establish mitigation initiatives in panda products. The chromatic parameter a* could be used as an indirect index of the acrylamide content in panda.

AB The q-NMR metabolomics has already demonstrated its potential for classifying wines of different geographical origins, grape varieties, or vintages. This study focuses on the characterisation of Bordeaux red wines, seeking to discriminate them from others produced in the major French wine regions. A sampling of 224 commercial French wines was analysed by H-1 NMR and forty compounds were quantified. Non-supervised and supervised statistical analyses revealed a singular imprint of Bordeaux wines in comparison with other French wines, with classification rates ranging from 71% to 100%. Within the Bordeaux vineyards, red wines from the different Bordeaux subdivisions were analysed from different vintages. Our results indicate that q-NMR metabolomics enables the differentiation of Medoc and Libournais vineyard highlighting the most discriminant constituents. In addition, the effects of wine evolution during bottle aging and vintage on Bordeaux red wines were pointed out and discussed.

AB Cold plasma is an emerging technology increasingly applied in the agri-food industry. For fruit and vegetables, enzymatic browning is a common phenomenon, causing quality deterioration. The objective of this study was to illustrate the effect of microscale atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (mu APPJ) plasma on the horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Results showed that after plasma treatment for 10 min, the residual activity of HRP was decreased to around 17%, and modification of secondary and tertiary structures were confirmed. The atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis revealed that the aggregation of enzyme protein was enhanced with prolonging treatment time. It was concluded that the activity of HRP could be reduced with destruction of structures and deformation of microstructure induced by mu APPJ plasma. The current study attempted to provide new idea for inhibiting browning enzymes of fruit and vegetables with plasma technology through deeper understanding of the interaction mechanism of plasma active species with enzymes.

AB Collagen hydrolysates (peptides) derived from food processing byproducts have been used to produce commercially valuable food ingredients due to their potential to trigger certain desirable physiological responses in the body. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) collagen hydrolysates are generally thought to exert better bioactivities than their larger counterparts. However, the preparation of LMW collagen hydrolysates is often impeded by their special structure, cross-linking, and hydroxyproline. This review briefly introduces the motivation of the food industry to prepare LMW collagen hydrolysate from food processing byproducts. We further summarize recent progress on the preparation of LMW collagen hydrolysates and methods to determine the molecular weight. We then discuss the challenges and then provide perspectives on future directions in preparing LMW collagen hydrolysates.

AB Solid and liquid components coexist into glassy and amorphous structures of food complex matrixes. Both states admit movements, promoting physical modifications to a more thermodynamically stable system. Green and roasted coffee beans are principally characterized by a glassy structure that slowly evolves during storage. The aim of this study was to assess calorimetric and dielectric properties in combination, as a useful multi-analytical technique to improve the understanding of the motion mechanism of localized molecules. After equilibration at different water activities (a(w)) for the determination of sorption isotherms of green and roasted coffee, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the samples has been measured by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Increasing the a w from 0.155 to 0.512, the Tg shifted from 48.76 ( +/- 0.04) to 34.89 ( +/- 0.02) degrees C for green coffee and from 45.73 ( +/- 0.05) to 40.15 ( +/- 0.10) degrees C for the roasted one. The spectroscopic fingerprint of the matrix has been determined by dielectric measurements in terms of "gain" spectra (related to the imaginary part of permittivity). The maximum values of the determination coefficient (R-2), obtained by linear correlation between spectral data and water activity or glass transition values for a specific frequency of the whole range (1.6 GHz-2.7 GHz), were 0.999 and 0.943 for green, and 0.997 R-2 and 0.925 R-2 for roasted coffee respectively.

AB Effects of different levels of rutin (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 mu mol/g protein) on the conformational changes and gel properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) were investigated. Rutin at 200 mu mol/g caused the greatest carbonyl content. The incorporation of rutin caused the losses of thiol, free amine and a-helix contents, reduction in tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence intensity, and enhanced exposure of hydrophobic groups and protein cross-linking. When compared with control, the MP gels with 10, 50 and 100 mu mol/g rutin had higher gel strength but slight lower water-holding capacity; the gels appeared to have compact microstructure with few visible pores. However, 200 mu mol/g rutin was detrimental to gel properties. All the gels with rutin presented higher final storage modulus and converted to elasticity-dominant gel types. The results indicate that a slightly high concentration of rutin could improve MP gel properties which are related to the protein conformational changes induced by rutin.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of inulin with different degree of polymerization on the properties of steamed bread made from soft flour. The type and substitution level of inulin had significant impacts on the quality of steamed bread. When 5.0% of flour was replaced by FS or FI, fresh steamed bread gained the highest score, possessing a lighter color, higher specific volume and softer texture. After inulin was added, tightly bound water migrated to loosely bound water and free water, which contributed to softness and delicious taste of fresh steamed bread. Inulin increased the staling rate of steamed bread during a short storage period (<1d), but during a long storage period ( <= 1d), it decreased the staling rate. Inulin interacts with starch by hydrogen bonds and alters water distribution between protein and starch, which finally affects storage characteristics of steamed bread.

AB In this work, we developed a simple method for the preparation of N-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl)chitosan. We compared the antibacterial activity of N-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl)chitosans and previously synthesized N-(2-azidoethyl)chitosans. N-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl)chitosans possess higher antibacterial effect which is comparable with that of ampicillin and gentamicin. The effect is due to azido pharmacophore -CH2-CH (OH)-CH2-N-3 (for N-(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl)chitosan) or -CH2-CH2-N-3 (for N-(2-azidoethyl)chitosan) introduced in chitosan chain, since the corresponding organic azides NH2-CH2-CH2-N-3 and NH2-CH2-CH2-N-3 are characterized by high antibacterial activity. However, high antibacterial organic azides NH2-CH2-CH2-N(3 )and NH2-CH2-CH2-N-3 are characterized by high toxicity. Their conjugation to the chitosan chain saves their antibacterial effect, but strongly diminishes their toxicity, and the toxicity of the resulting derivatives is comparable with that of the starting chitosan. These findings are of interest to food science, since novel effective food coatings can be developed on basis of prepared derivatives.

AB Nervonic acid (NA) has attracted considerable attention because of its close relationship with brain development. Sources of NA include oil crop seeds, oil-producing microalgae, and other microorganisms. Transgenic technology has also been applied to improve the sources and production of NA. NA can be separated and purified by urea adduction fractionation, molecular distillation, and crystallization. Studies on NA functionality involved treatments for demyelinating diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as well as prediction of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. This mini review focuses on the sources, production, and biological functions of NA and provides prospective trends in the investigation of NA.

AB The effects of exogenous polyamines treatment on reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in apricot fruits were systematically analyzed through the investigation of their curative and preventive effects on black spot disease. Results showed that 1.5 mM spermine (Spm), 1.5 mM spermidine (Spd) and 10 mM putrescine (Put) treatment significantly inhibited black spot development, additionally, the efficacy of this control was dependent upon the type of polyamines used and concentration level applied. Further studies have shown that exogenous polyamines treatments significantly improved production of O-2(center dot-) and H2O2, and increased the activities and gene expression levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX), super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) ascorbate peroxidase (AXP) and glutathione reductase (GR) in apricot fruit. Increased ascorbic acid (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content were also observed after exogenous polyamines treatment. These results have revealed that postharvest polyamines treatment effectively enhanced disease resistance through the maintenance of homeostasis in apricot fruits.

AB Self-assembled nanoparticles using the biopolymers chitosan (CH) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) were developed to improve the biological activity of anthocyanin (ACN). The 86.32 +/- 0.15% (w/w) of ACN was incorporated into ACN/CH/CS nanoparticles, with the particle size of 350.1 +/- 0.99 nm in diameter (i.d.) and 42.55 +/- 0.54 in zeta potential (mV). Morphological study and thermogravimetric analysis suggested that the ACN/CH/CS nanoparticles exhibited heterogeneous morphology and high thermal stability. Significant increases in apoptosis by 12.1% and 35.1% were observed with 0.05 mg/ml ACN and ACN/CH/CS nanoparticles in the HCT-116 cell line, indicating that the nanoparticle system led to significant increase in apoptosis (p < 0.05). Structural changes in mitochondria caused by ACN/CH/CS nanoparticles indicated that the nanoparticles had negative impacts on mitochondria. These results showed that nanoparticles could potentially be used as a carrier system to improve the efficacy of ACN.

AB Mature endosperm was separated regionally into different parts in three rice cultivars, Te-qing (TQ), Wu-xiang 9915 (WX9915) and Guang-ling-xiang-nuo (GLXN), and their transgenic lines with inhibition of starch branching enzyme I and IIb (SBEI/IIb(-)). Within the three wild-type cultivars, starches from endosperm different regions showed similar molecular and crystalline structures. However, in rices with inhibition of SBEs, amylopectin short branch-chain content and branching degree gradually decreased, but amylopectin B3 + chain content and average chain length increased gradually from the interior to exterior of endosperm. The amylose content gradually increased from the interior to exterior of endosperm in TQ- and WX9915-SBEI/II- lines. From the interior to exterior of endosperm, starch changed gradually from C-C- to C-B-type in TQ-SBEI/II- line and from C-A- to C-C-type in GLXN-SBEI/II- line, and remained C-A-type in WX9915-SBEI/II- line. These results provided some information for quality breeding and utilizations of rice with inhibition of SBE.

AB The surface browning usually occurs on fresh-cut potato during storage. The effect of short-time high oxygen pretreatment on anti-browning of fresh-cut potato slices was investigated. The whole potato tubers were firstly immersed in the oxygen concentration of 21%, 60% and 80% for 20 min. Then, the potatoes were peeled, cut and stored at 4 degrees C for 8 days. The results showed that the short-time 80% oxygen pretreatment possessed significantly anti-browning effect by retarding the increase of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) content, maintaining the cell integrity. Meanwhile, the 80% oxygen treatment could increase the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POD), and the total phenolic content. Importantly, the 80% oxygen treatment could effectively improve the antioxidant capacity. Overall, all results suggest that the short-time high oxygen pretreatment holds great promise on anti-browning of fresh-cut potato.

AB The autolysis of sea cucumber is caused by depolymerisation of collagen fibres and unfolding of fibrils. In order to highlight the role of collagenase in sea cucumber autolysis, collagen fibres from sea cucumber were hydrolysed with collagenase type I. Electron microscopy (EM) results indicated the collagenase caused partial depolymerisation of collagen fibres into fibrils due to the fracture of proteoglycan interfibrillar bridges, as well as uncoiling of collagen fibrils. Chemical analysis and SDS-PAGE both indicated collagenase induced a time-dependent release of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and soluble proteins, which further demonstrated the degradation of proteoglycan interfibrillar bridges. Collagenase also degraded collagens by releasing soluble hydroxyproline (Hpy), with the dissolution rate of Hyp reaching 11.11% after 72 h. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that collagenase caused the reduction of intermolecular interactions and structural order of collagen. Hence, collagenase participated in the autolysis of sea cucumber by deteriorating both macromolecular and monomeric collagens.

AB Fifty Ribes species and R. nigrum-based cultivars from eight Ribes sections were surveyed for gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3, n-6)- and stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4, n-3)-rich oils. R. pallidiflorum, R. glabellum and R. pubescens seed oils contain noticeable GLA amounts: 13.3, 11.8, and 11.9% of total fatty acids (FA), respectively. However, the highest GLA contents were found in the seed oils of several blackcurrant cultivars, highlining Ribes 'Myuryucheene' with 20.2% GLA of total FA. Principal Component Analysis showed that similarities in FA profiles allow grouping species as botanical criteria for Ribes sections do. The main GLA-taxa detected in this study correspond to blackcurrant cultivars, all of them native to Siberia. Considering that such cultivars are notable fruit-producers, its cultivation in Siberia besides producing fruits in very difficult agronomic areas, could produce a valuable by-product, i.e. the seeds, which will add economic value to agricultural systems if devoted to GLA-rich oils extraction.

AB The objective of this work was to analyse the antiradical capacity of juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4,-naphthoquinone). The influence of oxidation and reduction on juglone was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), as well as spectrophotometric based methods. The role of juglone in oxidation processes, as either an antioxidant in browning reactions, was examined. These processes are characterized by a high chemical reactivity in redox. Juglone is irreversibly oxidized in at least one electrode step and reduced quasi-reversibly in at least three electrode steps. These results demonstrate that walnut genotypes have different radical scavenging powers. In addition, on the basis of thermogravimetry, it was demonstrated that 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione has high thermal stability above 500 degrees C. The generation of reactive oxygen species and activity in redox processes show the properties of naphthoquinones that render these compounds interesting leads for the development of novel biomolecules for potential use in various therapeutic settings.

AB To counteract iodine deficiency in the population in areas of environmental iodine deficiency table salt is often fortified with potassium iodide or iodate. However, most estimations of iodine contribution from the diet rely on calculations based on the added iodized salt and very limited experimental data about the stability of potassium iodate (KIO3) or iodine uptake during food processing is available. Therefore, the influence of cooking on the iodine content of potatoes, pasta, and rice having different size, varieties or composition was investigated. Commonly used cooking procedures were applied, using KIO3-enriched table salt in the cooking water. After iodine extraction with 0.5% NH3 iodine content was measured by ICP-MS. All products showed an increase in iodine content. Waxy potatoes, especially cut in small pieces, and egg pasta showed the highest iodine uptake. Based on the results, the use of KIO3-enriched salt for cooking is recommended to enhance iodine supply.

AB This paper is the first to study whether and how interactions between puroindolines (PINs) and lipids affect bread loaf volume (LV). Flour from near-isogenic wheat lines differing in PIN haplotype and lipases were used in bread making. That lipase impact on LV strongly depended on the flour used supported the hypothesis that PINs modify the impact of enzymatic lipid hydrolysis on LV. In dough prepared from gluten-starch blends (GSB) differing in PIN levels, PINs did not affect enzymatic lipid hydrolysis itself. Gas cells in these GSB doughs were apparently not surrounded by surface-active compounds so that the impact of PIN-lipid interactions on LV could not be evaluated. This allowed concluding that lipase impact on LV is exclusively related to stabilization of gas cell interfaces in dough since lipase application did not change GSB LVs. Our results advance knowledge on PIN-lipid interactions and the impact of lipases in bread making.

AB An improved liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method is reported for the determination of residues of captan (+ tetrahydrophthalimide), captafol, folpet (+ phthalimide), and iprodione in fruits and vegetables. The optimized electrospray ionization parameters (high cone gas flow, and a low desolvation temperature) did not result in degradation of target compounds, rather they provided a significant advantage over the conventional GC-MS/MS methods, which lack sensitivity and repeatability. Strategies for minimizing losses in recovery of these compounds during sample preparation included cryogenic comminution, extraction with acidified ethyl acetate or acetonitrile, and dilution of the final extract with acidified water prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The method performance complied with the SANTE/11813/2017 guidelines, with recoveries in the range of 70-120% at the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg across the tested matrices at various pHs. The efficiency of the method was reflected in its precision (RSDs < 10%) for incurred residues.

AB Predominant contributors to thermally-induced off-notes in muskmelon juice were investigated by combination of sensory evaluation, GC-olfactometry (GC-O), multidimensional GC, odor activity value (OAV) calculation and addition experiments. "Fermented" and "sulfurous" were revealed as the dominant heat-induced offensive off-notes, and fundamental heat-led changes in odorant compositions were observed. Comparative aroma extract dilution analysis revealed that the off-flavors were mainly caused by newly heat-formed compounds with extremely low odor threshold and unpleasant smells. These included volatile sulfur compounds with "rotten" odors, Strecker aldehydes having "fermented" notes, and heterocyclics exhibiting "roasted" smells. Specifically, dimethyl sulfide, methional, methanethiol, dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and acetaldehyde were identified as the predominant off-note contributors, among which DMS was the most important one, showing the highest OAV. Multiple extraction techniques, GC-O coupling to GC x GC-QTOF-MS and OAV calculation are powerful tools for accurate location and reliable identification of trace and key off-odorants in natural complex matrices.

AB Gelatinization properties of physically modified starch-gluten matrices are often exclusively traced back to starch constitution without considering the state of gluten. Thus, gelatinization of model dough, combining reference (rS)/modified starch (mS) with reference (rG)/modified gluten (mG), was investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetry to relate structural alterations of biopolymers to their hydration properties. No differences were found in gelatinization onsets of model dough consisting of rS and mS combined with mG (starch: gluten = 50:50 (m/m)), although gelatinization enthalpy of mS mG (1.7 +/- 0.4 J/g dm) was significantly lowered in comparison to rS mG (2.2 +/- 0.2 J/g dm). Relaxation time T-2 was significantly reduced for mG in comparison to rG, demonstrating a tighter water binding of mG. This suggests that reduced gelatinization enthalpy of modified starch-gluten matrices is caused by a destruction of crystal parts of modified starch and by a tighter water binding of modified gluten.

AB Complex hydrocolloids have been isolated and fractionated using a consecutive elution process, starting from winery waste. These extracts consist mainly of polysaccharidic populations and of smaller protein molecules and they exhibit emulsifying, thickening and texture-modifying activity. This work is a systematic study of these individual populations, as fractionated with preparative size exclusion chromatography (Prep-SEC) in terms of their chemical identity, surface properties, and emulsification behavior. The fractions have been characterized via SEC-MALLS, FTIR, DLS, zeta potential, and interfacial tension measurements. The results highlight the antagonistic and synergistic effects of the individual components of the above-mentioned complex natural material (winery waste extract) towards its emulsifying behavior, and provide a model for the kinetics of the evolution of a Pickering interfacial layer.

AB Raspberry fruits are a perfect source of polyphenols, including flavonols, anthocyanins. Some experiments have indicated that organic fruits contain more bioactive compounds than conventional fruits. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse and compare the concentration of bioactive compounds in organic vs. conventional raspberries and to determine the effects of harvest time and cultivar. Three cultivars of raspberry ('Laszka', 'Glen Ample' and 'Glen Fine') that were harvested in summer and one 'Polka' cv. that was harvested in autumn time from organic and conventional cultivation methods were used in the experiment. The contents of dry matter and polyphenols in the fruits were determined. The organic samples contained significantly more dry matter, phenolic acid and flavonoids, including myrycetin, quercetin, luteolin and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. Harvest time was an important factor in raspberry fruit quality.

AB It is estimated that over 30% of the global population is anaemic, half of which is due to iron deficiency. The bioavailability of iron from vegetables is low and variable, and influenced by food composition and matrix. We have therefore determined the relative bioavailability of iron in five types of green vegetable, spinach, broccoli, savoy cabbage, curly kale and green pepper, by measuring the ferritin response in a simulated digestion/Caco-2 cell model. Savoy cabbage gave the highest ferritin response and analysis of the digest showed that the iron was present in low molecular weight fractions which contained glucose, fructose, organic acids and amino acids. The addition of fructose 1,6-biphosphate to the Caco-2 cells increased iron uptake 2-fold. These results demonstrate that cabbage was the best source of bioavailable iron out of the vegetables studied and suggest that the formation of complexes with fructose derivatives contribute to increase the iron bioavailability.

AB In the context of growing consumer demand for clean label foods, antifungal cultures offer alternatives to chemical preservatives for the reduction of food fungal spoilage. Selected binary combinations of lactobacilli strains were recently successfully used to inhibit Penicillium commune and Mucor racemosus in four dairy products. Our aim was to identify the compounds most likely involved in their antifungal activity. Four chromatographic methods, targeting 56 antifungal compounds as well as volatiles, were combined. Overall, 53 antifungal compounds were detected, of which 33 were in significantly higher amounts in at least one product inoculated with an antifungal culture compared to the controls. They were present at concentrations below their MIC and thus could act in synergy. Among them, the most commonly identified were acetic, hydroxyphenyllactic, phenyllactic, 3-phenylpropanoic, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic and 5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acids, diacetyl, acetoin, and an unidentified volatile. This extensive study contributes to improve the knowledge about the action mode of antifungal lactobacilli.

AB Researches based on metal complexes of plant-derived phenolic acids have attracted much attention due to their beneficial applications in the development of functional food products, dietary supplements and pharmacology. Binding of phenolic acids with serum proteins greatly influences their pharmacological properties. In this context, interactions of a naturally occurring phenolic acid, sinapic acid (SA) and its Cu2+ complex with a model transport protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), have been explored by means of different spectroscopic and theoretical tools. Spectroscopic studies revealed that the interaction of SA and its Cu2+ complex with BSA occurred through quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of BSA. Site-specific experimental and docking studies were performed to predict the binding site. The geometies of bound Cu2+ and interacting residues of protein were predicted from a solution dynamics study. Interestingly, the complexation of SA with Cu2+ enhanced the antioxidant activity of SA.

AB Novel delivery systems for epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were developed using broccoli by-products and their fractions as carriers. Puree and pomace from broccoli by-products had higher adsorption capacities for EGCG than juice at 25 degrees C (43.20 mg g(-1), 39.47 mg g(-1) and 25.22 mg g(-1) dry weight for pomace, puree and juice respectively). Chemical sorption is the rate-controlling step for EGCG-broccoli interactions. Langmuir and Freundlich models well described the adsorption of EGCG onto puree and pomace. FTIR results indicated that EGCG-puree had stronger interaction than EGCG-pomace. When the same level of EGCG (similar to 26 mg) was added to different matrices, more EGCG (similar to 20%) was recovered from the in vitro digestion system of EGCG-loaded puree than from the EGCG-loaded pomace (14%) and neat EGCG (9%). The antioxidant capacity of the whole digesta was positively correlated with the EGCG levels. Broccoli by-products are promising carriers for delivering and stabilizing EGCG through gastrointestinal digestion.

AB The efficacy of two sodium reduction strategies in preserving sensory profile and consumer liking of yeasted wheat bread was tested, by combining sensory data, aroma compounds and consumer investigations. The use of (i) a reduced-sodium salt substitute, Pansalt (R) (NaC1 57%, other salts and minor ingredients) at 1.5%, and (ii) the heterogeneous NaCl distribution (average level of 1%) leading to enhanced saltiness by taste contrast, were compared with standard (1.5%) and reduced (1.0%) addition of NaCl. The heterogeneous NaCl distribution was effective in preserving saltiness. Salt substitution with Pansalt (R) was less effective but preserved the overall flavour. Higher amount of Maillard reaction volatile products, associated with more intense toasted odour of the crust, was found in breads with higher NaCl content. The consumer survey highlighted satisfactory results of Pansalt (R) use for 58% of the respondents (equal or higher liking and purchase intention). Heterogeneous salt distribution was effective for 31% of consumers.

AB Untargeted LC/MS flavoromic profiling was utilized to identify compounds that positively impact coffee quality. The chemical profiles of eighteen coffee samples and the corresponding Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) cup scores were modeled by orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) analysis with good fit and predictive ability ((RY)-Y-2 > 0.9, Q(2) > 0.9). Four highly predictive chemical compounds positively correlated to cup score were subsequently isolated and purified ( > 90%) by multi-dimensional preparative LC/MS fractionation. Sensory recombination analysis by certified SCA Q-graders (n = 5) confirmed three out of four compounds significantly increased cup score when added to a control coffee (p < 0.001). Based on accurate mass spectrometry and NMR experiments, the compound structures were identified as novel compounds 3-O-caffeoyl 4-O-3-methylbutanoylquinic acid, and the corresponding lactone 3-O-caffeoyl 4-O-3-methylbutanoyl-1,5-quinide, as well as an unknown phenolic derivative containing a 3-methylbutanoyl moiety ([M - H](-1), m/z 671). No direct flavor activity was observed for each compound, indicating these compounds act as flavor-modifiers.

AB This research investigates the effect of swarming season and sourcing geographical area on the nutrient composition of R. differens. On a dry matter basis, protein (34.2-45.8%) and fat (42.2-54.3%) are the major macronutrients. Leucine (80. 9-88.5), lysine (54.0-69.8) and valine (59.2-61.8) are the most abundant essential amino acids (EAA) (mg/g protein). Tryptophan is the most limiting EAA. Its EAA composition is like the children and adults' reference protein. Its fat is highly unsaturated (63.5-64.7). Oleic (38.4-42.7), linoleic (19.0-23.0) and palmitic (26.6-27.8) fatty acids (FA) (g/100 g total FA) are the most abundant. Geographical area significantly influences its mineral content within seasons. Season significantly influences its fat, protein, ash and mineral content but not its AAs' and FAs' content. Both factors significantly influence its vitamin B12 content (0.73-1.35 mu g/100 g).

AB Acylated anthocyanins, such as those found in red cabbage, are more heat-, light-, and alkaline pH-stable than non-acylated anthocyanins, making them attractive for a variety of commercial applications. A UPLC-DAD-MS E method with an optimized chromatographic strategy was used to identify 29 red cabbage anthocyanins, predominantly acylated and glucosylated cyanidin derivatives. Anthocyanin profiles of 27 red cabbage genotypes harvested in consecutive growing seasons were measured and assessed for variation. Three unique anthocyanin profile fingerprints were identified through hierarchical clustering analysis. PCA analysis identified anthocyanin accumulation traits and genotypes with high diversity which can be utilized in future investigations into the genetic and molecular basis for anthocyanin production, acylation, and diversity.

AB Morphological, technological and nutritional analyses were done in two scarcely studied starches from Andean tubers (mashua and melloco). The low sedimentation values, and the high zeta potential of mashua and melloco starches in cold dispersions, as consequence of their electronegativity, indicated a better behaviour as stabilizer than potato starch. During heating, mashua and melloco starches presented much higher viscosity than potato starch, associated with their higher average particle size and greater amylose content. DSC and TGA analyses indicated that melloco starch had the highest gelatinization enthalpy Delta H-gel (12.32 J g(-1)) and degradation temperature (270 degrees C), in comparison with potato starch, which are indicators of a better thermal resistance. Consequently, extracted mashua and melloco starches could be excellent and cost-effective thickening or gelling agents in both foods and a wide range of biomaterials. Mashua and melloco starches exhibited a digestion rate close to 80%, which agreed with the low resistant starch content.

AB We assessed the effects of postharvest exogenous melatonin (50,100 and 150 mu mol L-1) on the senescence and quality of sweet cherries during storage at 0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Melatonin treatment decreased decay incidence, respiration rate, and weight loss. It delayed the degradation of firmness, lightness, saturation, hue angle, titratable acidity, and total soluble solids content, thus maintaining better fruit quality. Melatonin treatment inhibited increases in O-2(center dot)-, H2O2 malondialdehyde content, and relative membrane permeability, while maintaining higher endogenous melatonin levels and increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. Additionally, melatonin treatment enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased the levels of ascorbic acid, and reduced glutathione levels, which are related to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, as well as increasing the AsA:DHA and GSH:GSSG ratios. Delayed senescence in sweet cherries after exogenous melatonin treatment may be associated with high endogenous melatonin levels and increased antioxidant activity and content.

AB This study was the first investigation into the main inducers of two lignifications by examining the changes of physicochemical properties and gene expression in king oyster mushrooms, under different conditions, during 21 days of storage. The results showed that the toughness, firmness and gumminess of the no-wounding treatment decreased to approximately 75-82.5% of the initial values, and the lignin content and expression of Pe4CL1 and Pe4CL3 decreased by 21-40% and 22-77%, respectively, in comparison to those of the other treatments in the first lignification. These findings indicated that wounding was the main factor inducing the first lignification. The second lignification of tested mushrooms was positively correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated senescence, accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage rate and mitochondrial dysfunction, which showed that ROS-mediated senescence played an essential role in the second lignification. This study is helpful for effective strategies to reduce lignification in stored mushrooms.

AB A straightforward and rapid preparation procedure for the extraction of the acrylamide from coffee beans, by means of the volatile silylated derivatives of acrylamide (AA) and headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) is described. Commercially available SPME fibre coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used. The silylation reactions of the AA were executed with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). The deuterium labelled d(3)-acrylamide was used as an internal standard. The acrylamide level was quantified using gas chromatography coupled with the mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for measuring acrylamide was 3 mu g/kg. The described method demonstrates satisfactory repeatability (RSD = 2.6%), with an intermediate precision (RSD = 9.4%) and recovery (99-105%).

AB Commission Regulation (EC) 543/2008 limits moisture and protein contents in poultry meat. However, this regulation leaves room for interpretation regarding sample homogenisation, potentially affecting comparability of laboratory results. Therefore, a proficiency test and sample homogenisation study were organised amongst 19 European National Reference Laboratories (NRL). In the proficiency test, three different pre-homogenised chicken samples (fillets, drumsticks and carcasses) were analysed. Only one NRL produced unsatisfactory results. In the homogenisation study, NRLs were supplied with uniform fillet, drumstick and carcass materials. Homogenisation was performed according to the NRLs in-house methods. Five NRLs did not return satisfactory results. As these NRLs produced satisfactory results in the proficiency test, their increase in z-scores was related to their homogenisation practices. Overall, scattering of individual results was higher for drumsticks compared to fillets and carcasses. Homogenisation practices for poultry meat introduced significant differences in moisture and protein results and standardisation is therefore advisable.

AB The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of five rubber seed oil (RSO) levels (0, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6%) on hens laying performance, egg quality, and yolks fatty acid composition and cholesterol contents. Three hundred and sixty 30-week-old Lohmann Brown laying hens were allotted to 5 groups. The results showed that the egg production was increased in 4% RSO group (P < 0.05), but egg quality parameters and the contents of dry matter, lipid, and protein in yolks were not influenced among treatments (P > 0.05). Yolk cholesterol contents were reduced in RSO supplemental groups (P < 0.05). The concentration of total n-3 PUFA in yolks increased gradually while the ratio of n-6/n-3 decreased gradually with increasing dietary RSO levels (P < 0.001). In conclusion, dietary RSO supplementation increased yolk n-3 PUFA levels, improved yolk color, and reduced yolk cholesterol contents without negative influence on laying performance parameters.

AB The need for safe and quality food, free from the presence of hazardous contaminants such as mycotoxins is an on-going and complex challenge. Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) has the potential to contribute to achieving this goal. Decontamination efficacy of CAPP against six of the most common mycotoxins found in foods and feedstuffs was assessed herein. Concentration reduction of up to 66% was achieved in maize for both aflatoxin B-1 and fumonisin B-1. Degradation products were detected only in the case of aflatoxin B-1 and zearalenone and were tested on human hepatocarcinoma cells with no increase in cytotoxicity observed. Analysis of treated maize revealed substantial changes to small molecular mass components of the matrix. While CAPP shows promise in terms of mycotoxin detoxification important questions concerning potential changes to the nutritional and safety status of the food matrix require further investigations.

AB Multi-isotope and multi-elemental analyses were performed on 600 red wine samples imported into China from 7 different countries and compared with Chinese wine. Carbon and oxygen isotopes and 16 elements were used to determine origin traceability. Our goal was to build a classification tool using data modeling that can verify the geographic origin of wines imported into China. Multivariate analyses of the isotopic and elemental data revealed that it is possible to determine the geographical origin for most imported wines with a high level of confidence ( > 90%). The results show that Artificial Neural Network method had a high discrimination accuracy and is more suitable than Discrimination Analysis and Random Forest methods when it comes to classifying wine origin on a global scale. In conclusion, stable isotope and trace element analyses followed by multivariate processing of the data is a fast and efficient technique suitable for global wine traceability.

AB Dajiang is a popular Chinese fermented soybean condiment. Here, a comparative metaproteomic analysis of traditional and commercial dajiang was performed during fermentation. A total of 4250 and 1421 peptide sequences were obtained from 3493 and 1987 proteins in traditional and commercial dajiang, respectively. 4299 differentially expressed microbial proteins show a high metabolic heterogeneity between the two types of dajiang. The KEGG annotation indicated that there were some pathways related to human diseases, which suggest that some microbes in traditional dajiang fermentation may have greater food safety hazards. In combination with qualitative metabolomic analysis, we further traced metabolic intermediates and key enzymes in several main fermentation pathways of dajiang to be mainly affiliated with Penicillium, Tetracoccus and Bacillus in traditional samples, as well as Aspergilus in commercial samples. These results could provide information for the selection of strains that are more suitable to produce high quality dajiang and other fermented products.

AB Softening is always a problem in fish preservation. This study was aimed to investigate the role of myofibrillar structural proteins degradation in fish softening. The changes of myofibrillar structural proteins, muscle ultrastructure, myofibril fragmentation, and shear force were studied. The results indicated that during the superchilled preservation of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), small (low-molecular-weight) myofibrillar structural proteins like desmin and troponin-T initiated textural deterioration, leading to Z-disk weakening and actin loosening. In contrast, giant (high-molecular-weight) myofibrillar structural proteins like thin and nebulin were degraded in more amount in the later storage, contributing to Z-disk and M-band disassembly and vague of light and dark regions (I and A bands). Compared to each other, desmin and thin played more important part in softening. All these changes were involved in the increase of muscle fibril segments and the sharp decrease of shear force.

AB Flavonoids can protect plants against UV but the mechanism by which specific flavonoids during fruit development is unclear, especially in blueberries on living plants. We analyzed the gene expression and metabolite profiles of flavonols, proanthocyanidins (PAs), and anthocyanins under preharvest UV-B/-C and postharvest UVA/-B/-C irradiation in developing blueberries. Both pre- and postharvest UV irradiation significantly increased flavonol accumulation during early fruit development, while increased anthocyanin and PA contents during late fruit development. However, PAs decreased during postharvest but increased during preharvest UV irradiation in green fruit. The antioxidant capacity increased by postharvest UV irradiation, while hardly affected by preharvest UV irradiation. Overall, the gene expression changes paralleled the flavonoid contents after UV irradiation. Notably, VcMYBPA1 was closely related with VcLAR and VcANR under pre- and postharvest UV irradiation, which could relate to PA biosynthesis. During natural fruit maturation and UV conditions, the elevated PA content exhibited higher potential antioxidant activity. Our results show that UV resistance is greater in living plants than detached fruits, the former showing a systemic and moderate response and the latter a non-systemic but strong response. These results might contribute to the development of pre- and postharvest technologies to promote healthier fruit consumption.

AB Differences in the expression of functional genes between beef Longissimus Lumborum (LL) and Psoas Major (PM) are not well understood. The aim of present study is to reveal transcriptome changes of beef LL and PM during early postmortem by high-throughput Illumina Hiseq4000 Sequencing. Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated significant differences in transcriptome profiles between LL and PM as well as 1 h and 12 h postmortem. A total of 65 genes differentially expressed between LL and PM (fold change >= 3, and p < 0.05; 34 were up-regulated in LL and 31 in PM), and the majority of them (53 genes) occurred at 12 h postmortem. These differentially expressed genes mainly involved in energy production and conversion, nucleotide metabolic, posttranslational modification, and transcription. KEGG analysis revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was one of the important pathways. This study gave new perspectives to understand the underlying mechanisms associated with muscle-specific beef quality.

AB A novel method for determination of triazole fungicides and their enantiomers in foods was developed by aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC). With an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) of ethanol/K2HPO4 as biphasic extractant, the effects of the ATPS composition, extraction temperature and time on extraction yields of triazole fungicides were investigated. Optimum conditions were concluded as follows: ethanol concentration 31% (w/w) and K2HPO4 concentration 21% (w/w), extraction temperature 60 degrees C, extraction time 21 min. Based on reversed-phase separation systems, a 2D-LC was constructed by optimizing chromatographic conditions and online heart-cutting procedures. As a result, eight triazole fungicides and their enantiomers were separated respectively on C18 and cellulose-tris (3,5-dimethyl-phenylcarbamate) stationary phases, revealing good linear relationship in the range of 0.1218-30.06 mu g/mL (R-2 >= 0.9984). The detection limits and recoveries were 0.03113-0.3525 mu g/mL and 71.57-107.8%, respectively. The ATPE-2D-LC method was successfully applied to chiral analysis of triazole fungicides in fruits and vegetables.

AB The interaction of copper complexed with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated using fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, HPLC and protein-ligand docking. The fluorescence quenching efficiency of BSA by EGCG was enhanced after EGCG was complexed with copper, and the EGCG-Cu complex exhibited a higher apparent binding affinity (8.88 x 10(5) M-1) to BSA compared with EGCG alone (5.17 x 10(5) M-1). The CD experiment showed that both the EGCG-BSA and [EGCGCu]-BSA interactions resulted in the unfolding of the secondary structure of the protein. Results of competitive binding experiments confirmed that the location of EGCG and EGCG-Cu complex binding in BSA was site I. Furthermore, molecular modeling was used to identify the amino acid residue in site I and site II that play key roles in this binding interaction. The data suggest that most of the residues involved in the [EGCG-Cu]-BSA reaction belong to the subdomains Ha (site I) of BSA.

AB beta-Xylosidase, of the glycoside hydrolase family 43 from Bacillus sp. HJ14, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant beta-xylosidase (rHJ14GH43) exhibited maximum activity at 25 degrees C, approximately 15, 45, and 88% of maximum activity at 0, 10, and 20 degrees C, respectively, and poor stability at temperatures over 20 degrees C. rHJ14GH43 showed moderate or high activity, but poor stability, in NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, KNO3, Na2SO4, and (NH4)(2)SO4 at concentrations from 3.0 to 30.0% (w/v). The crystal structure of rHJ14GH43 was resolved and showed higher structural flexibility due to fewer salt bridges and hydrogen bonds compared to mesophilic and thermophilic beta-xylosidases. High structural flexibility is presumed to be a key factor for catalytic adaptations to low temperatures and high salt concentrations. Approximately one-third of the surface of rHJ14GH43 is positively charged, which may be the primary factor responsible for poor stability in high neutral salt environments.

AB Synthesis of nanostructures using green chemistry has been popular owing to the exciting properties and innovative applications of these nanostructures. Novel, cost-effective, and eco-friendly gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were synthesized using a mix of Olea europaea (OE) fruit extract and Acacia nilotica (AN) husk extract. The synthesized Au NPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, and the average NP size (44.96 nm) was measured by a Zetasizer. A more detailed characterization was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy and electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized OEAN Au NPs was evaluated using an MTT assay on breast (MCF-7), colon (TCT-116), and hepatocellular (HCepG-2) carcinoma cells. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized OEAN Au NPs was investigated using a disc diffusion method. The synthesized Au NPs exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against the bacterial strains used and profound anticancer activity against different cell lines used. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Infections, particularly those induced via drug resistant pathogens, can cause serious issues in wound healing process. In this study, cephalexin (CEX), as an effective antibiotic, was loaded into polycaprolactone (PCL)-gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) nanofibrous by electrospinning for the development of a new wound dressing. The electrospun nanofibrous possessed continuous and smooth structure with the fiber diameters ranging from 280 to 330 nm. Swelling examination exhibited that the electrospun nanofibrous could take up water by 400-600%. Antibacterial activity of PCL/GelMA loading with CEX had a great inhibition towards both Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and negative-bacteria Escherichia coli. The hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining results from treated wounds with PCL/GelMA-CEX nanofibrous exhibited improved re-epithelialization and collagen deposition. Taken together, our study illustrate the PCL/GelMA-CEX nanofibrous can be promising for use as an effective antibacterial wound dressing in skin regeneration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DE Graphene; Ion irradiation; Defects
AB An ion-beam exposure can be applied to form defects in supported graphene which can be tuned with energies and fluence. However, recent results show that nuclear energy loss process is the dominant mechanism in defect formation. In the present work, it is shown that in low energy regime (1-10 keV Ar+ ions), both nuclear and electronic energy losses play an important role in forming different types of defects. Here we show a linear relation between defect induction efficiency and energy loss. Conductive atomic force microscopy shows a significant reduction in the current through supported graphene after ion beam exposure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Delta eutectoid can affect mechanical properties of high-speed steels. Nevertheless, the morphology and the origin of the carbide formed in delta eutectoid, as well as its microstructural changes under the effect of high temperatures, have not been completely investigated till now. To overcome it, the morphology and origin of the carbide in the delta eutectoid of M2 steel were thoroughly examined. The results showed that both M2C and M6C carbides could simultaneously form delta eutectoid. During annealing at 1200 degrees C, M2C decomposed into the mixture of M6C and V-rich carbides.

AB Template carbonization of polypyrrole nanofilm coated on TiO2 nanotube arrays is proposed to fabricate one-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube arrays (N-CNTAs) without using any foreign catalyst. Ultra-thin nitrogen-doped carbon nanofilm with thickness of 1 similar to 2 nm is formed on the wall of TiO2 nanotubes. The N-CNTAs possess high density of graphitic edge planes and exhibit an ideal Nernst behavior towards [Fe(CN)(6)](3/4) redox couple. Determination of dopamine has been demonstrated in the linear range of 5-175 mu M with a detection limit of 0.19 mu M (S/N = 3). Selective monitoring of uric acid with a linear range of 0.1-150 mu M in the coexistence of 1 mM ascorbic acid has also been illustrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB (Ba,Ca)(Sn,Ti)O-3 (BCST), a potential lead-free piezoceramic, faces serious shortcoming in view of its low Curie temperature (T-c), limiting its practical applications. The present work utilizes conventional sintering route assisted by high-energy milling technique for the synthesis of BCST to enhance its practical applicability. Restch PM100 planetary ball mill is employed to produce (Ba0.88Ca0.12)(Ti0.94Sn0.06) nanopowders by increasing the milling speed from 100 to 400 rpm, each for 5 h. A monotonous fall in average particle size from 202 nm to 7 nm with rising speed from 100 to 400 rpm leads to an appreciable increase in T-c by 6 degrees C accompanied with a substantial lowering of diffusiveness of the phase transition, and enormous increase of average grain size by 250%, remnant polarization (P-r) by 77% and piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) by 60%. The study discloses that incorporation of cost-effective high-energy ball milling procedure can play an exceptional role in addressing some vital drawbacks associated with the highly complex BCST system and hence heighten the candidature of this system for lead-free piezoceramic.

AB Directed outgrowth and accelerated elongation are crucial for the neuronal regeneration and repair. Here we evaluated combined effects of nanofibrous scaffold and electrical field on the neuronal outgrowth. Aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers provided a strong guidance cue for the neurite orientation, and the electrical field stimulation promoted the elongation and orientation of neurites. When two cues were applied simultaneously, neurite orientation was along the aligned fiber dominantly and neurite elongation was accelerated no matter the electrical field direction was parallel or vertical to the aligned fiber, indicating the synergistic effect of aligned nanofibrous scaffolds and electrical field. All the results suggested that combined application of physical contact guidance and electrical field have great prospects in the regeneration and repair of nerve system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A controllable plasma-activated method to achieve pressureless sintering of Ag nanoparticles is proposed for low-temperature bonding. O-2 plasma activation is employed to effectively decompose organics coated on the nanoparticles prior to sintering, avoiding the loose interfacial microstructures. Therefore, robust bonding Cu-Cu joints with high shear strength (>20 MPa) can be formed at a low temperature of 200 degrees C without requiring additional pressure. This rapid and controllable activation method significantly enhances the sinterability of the Ag particles, leading to a dense microstructure. The improved thermal conductivity is three times higher than the one prepared without plasma activation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the joining of an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steel without destroying the microstructure and thereby deteriorating the mechanical performance. ODS Eurofer was successfully joined by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1373 K with a heating rate of 100 K/min and a pressure of 80 MPa. An almost defect-free joint was obtained with a holding time of 40 min and a powder layer between the steel disks. The fine-grained microstructure and homogeneously distributed nanoparticles in the material show no significant change after the joining process. The tensile properties of the joint material are comparable to the base material. SPS has been proven to be a promising technique to join ODS steels due to the good mechanical properties of the joints. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The separation of water-oil mixtures has attracted widespread attention because of the increasing amounts of oily wastewater produced from the daily activities of humans and different industrial processes. Therefore, the development of facile and efficient oil-water separation technologies is imperative. In this work, a new highly superhydrophilic-superoleophobic coated stainless steel mesh was fabricated using virtue of the surface modification of poly (BzVimBr-Vim)@PFOA@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a facile preparation process. The new fabricated superhydrophilic and highly oleophobic coating exhibits good adhesive properties. The oil contact angle (OCA) and water contact angle (WCA) of the modified stainless-steel mesh were 135 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the coated stainless-steel mesh exhibited outstanding separation efficiency for oil/water mixtures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The article presents the influence of the type of reinforcing phase (micro and nanocrystalline titanium carbide) and temperature of conducted tests, on the mechanical properties of a 316L stainless steel based metal matrix composites, made additively by the Selective Laser Melting technology. The samples were compared by testing their compression strength at temperatures in the range of 25-1100 degrees C. The tests have shown that the strengthening effect of the reinforcing phase occurs only in a limited range of temperatures. Moreover, the addition of the nanocrystalline TiC changes the mechanism of deformation and the microcomposite samples revealed the separation between matrix and TiC phase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The severe threat posed by heavy-metal-containing alkali halides to environment and humans demands heavy-metal-free alkali halides without compromising their exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. In this study, manganese doped cesium iodide (CsI:Mn2+) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via the hot injection method, while retaining their optoelectronic attributes. Results corroborate manganese doping has no noticeable effect on blue emission of CsI NPs and shows well-dispersed particles with an average size of 10 nm. Due to the strong fluorescence, the CsI:Mn2+ NPs can be used for cell imaging, and have demonstrated the exceptional computed X-ray tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging potential as compared to the conventional clinical and nanosized manganese contrast agents. These findings have thus broadened the scope of potential biomedical applications of this kind of NPs for theranostics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we have triumphantly synthesized porous NiCo2O4 nanowires array on nickel foam (NiCo2O4 NWs/NF) via a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from its great one-dimensional porous nanowires architecture along with synergistic interactions between NiCo2O4 arrays and Ni foam, the NiCo2O4 NWs/NF-based sensor exhibited enhanced glucose sensing performance. The sensitivity could reach up to 5916 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), meanwhile, the linear range was 1 mu M-3.987 mM with a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.94 mu M (S/N = 3). Furthermore, it displayed good selectivity. These results inspire that the porous NiCo2O4 nanowires will be a promising candidate for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces is a popular topic in research and industry due to many potential applications including self-cleaning, anti-icing or drag reduction. Laser micro and nanostructuring is an efficient method to replicate lotus leaves double-scale structures to achieve superhydrophobicity without chemical treatment. Immediately after laser processing, samples are hydrophilic and become hydrophobic in a few days, exposed to atmospheric conditions. This time was significantly reduced by vacuum processing to only 4 h. Two-step fabrication method of superhydrophobic surfaces have been developed using nanosecond laser system. In the first step, large scale micropillars are fabricated and covered by nano-scale protrusions in the following step using defocused laser beam. The nanostructure formation increased the apparent contact angle from 149 degrees to 175 degrees. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetized biochar materials (MCs) were prepared through magnetization of biochar (C) by Fe3O4-loaded coprecipitation method and coating the MCs with different ratios of the amphoteric modifier, dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS-12), for C recycling and simultaneous adsorption of various pollutants. The MC and BS-12-coated MCs (BS-MCs) were subjected to characterization methods, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Results indicated the following. (1) With increased BS-12 coating ratio, the pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and specific surface areas (S-BET) of each BS-MC decreased gradually. (2) BS-MCs exhibited good magnetic separation performance, and their infrared spectra showed that Fe3O4 and BS-12 had been loaded on the C surface. The TG curves showed that the weight loss rate of BS-MC increased with increasing BS-12 coating ratio. (3) According to SEM results, Fe3O4 was evenly distributed on C, and no evident agglomeration was observed. After BS-12 coating, BS-MCs presented lower surface roughness and higher concentration of particles, which confirmed that BS-12 coated the MCs organically. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) were used as sensitizers to modify the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer/CsPbBr3 perovskite interface in solar cells by controlling the various spin-coating cycles on the surface of m-TiO2. The visible light absorption of m-TiO2 was enhanced because of the PbS CQDs. The prominent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.04% for the core/shell-structured TiO2/PbS photoanode was higher than that of the pristine device (2.45%).

AB The precipitate behavior in aging-treated medium-entropy alloys of Fe-75(CoCrMnNi)(25) and Fe-71.25 (CoCrMnNi)(23.75)Cu3Al2 was investigated. The applied aging treatment at 723 K for 7 h in both alloys led to the formation of B2 nanoprecipitate in a lath-martensite body-centered cubic matrix. By employing atom probe tomography, it was observed that the B2 precipitate was mainly enriched with Ni-Mn in Fe-75(CoCrMnNi)(25) and Cu in Fe-71.25(CoCrMnNi)(23.75)Cu3Al2. Furthermore, the B2 precipitate in both of these systems also displayed a different morphology due to the difference in the interfacial energy, with the B2 precipitate in Fe-75(CoCrMnNi)(25) and Fe-71.25(CoCrMnNi)(23.75)Cu3Al2 showing ellipsoidal and spherical morphology, respectively.

AB A scaleable, low cost processing method to prepare porous bioactive glass (BG) microspheres is presented. Glass powder with composition based on 45S5 BG and exhibiting irregularly shaped particles was fabricated by conventional melting. Glass powder was alkali activated to induce pore formation during the following flame synthesis step. Porous microspheres, with diameters ranging between 45 and 75 mu m, were successfully prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The porous bioactive glass microspheres are promising candidates for applications in bone regeneration, tissue engineering, and as carriers for controlled drug delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Clinically, the treatment of large bone defects caused by trauma, tumor resection and other bone diseases remains a significant challenge, especially bone defects at the load-bearing sites. To promote bone regeneration and simultaneously prevent tumor recurrence and bacterial infection after surgical resection of oteosarcoma, we designed biomimetic triphase composite scaffolds comprised of porous Ti6Al4V (pTi), chitosan (CS) and selenium (Se) doped hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles (HAP-Se), termed as pTi/CS/ HAP-Se. The scaffolds promoted osteoblast proliferation while inhibited tumor cells growth and bacterial viability. The scaffolds resemble natural bone tissues with hierarchical porous structures, showing potential applications in treating bone defects resulted from surgical resection of osteosarcoma.

AB In this study, a thermally and electrically shape memory polymer was prepared with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filled with short carbon fibers (SCFs) by the electro-mixed fusion preparation method. SCFs could be evenly distributed in the PVA matrix by this novel method. The formation of stable network structures by SCFs rearranged in the PVA matrix further improves the electrical conductivity and the mechanical properties of the PVA. In the process of shape memory recovery, the recovery ratio of PVA/SCF composites by electrical stimulation was higher than that by thermal stimulation, and the recovery time could be precisely controlled. In short, PVA/SCF composites by this novel method show desirable shape memory effects and have great potential in foldable smart devices. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
AB Carbon can be applied as an additive to improve the properties of ceramic, but it has some damage effects on the matrix. Herein, the hybrid material of TiO2-supported carbon layers (C/TiO2) was synthesized through the oxidation of Ti3C2 at high temperature, which consisted of the large-scale carbon platelets with a thickness of similar to 33.9 nm and the micron-scale TiO2 particles scattered between layers. By adding of C/TiO2 into Si3N4, the fracture toughness and the tribological properties of the composite achieved a comprehensive enhancement, importantly, without sacrificing the hardness. This was attributed to the bridging between carbon layers and grains, and the loading-support of the in-situ formed TiN. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the use of a ternary Au/Cu2O/ZnO nanocomposite for low concentration chemiresistive NO2 gas sensing at room temperature is reported. ZnO nanorods are first grown on a Si substrate with pre-patterned electrodes. Cu2O nanocubes and Au nanoparticles are sequentially photoreduced on ZnO nanorods. Under UV-activation, the responses are 26% and 3590% at 5 and 1000 ppb, respectively. The response shows an excellent exponential relationship with the concentration. Below 100 ppb, the response can be considered linearly proportional to the concentration with a sensitivity of 83 ppm(-1). The high response of the nanocomposite can be attributed to combined effects of enhanced gas adsorption and efficient charge separation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of electrochemical nitridation on the corrosion resistance of the 2205 duplex stainless steel were investigated. It was found that increased nitrogen content in the 2205 duplex stainless steel affected donor and acceptor concentration distribution in the passive films on the surface of the 2205 duplex stainless steel. Moreover, the total donor and acceptor concentration in passive films decreased with the increasing of nitrogen content. The electrochemically nitridation facilitated to induce compact passive film and thus improved significantly the corrosion resistance of the 2205 duplex stainless steel in borate buffer solution.

AB The Sb2S3 seed layer was deposited on the TiO2 compact layer by repeated step-by-step spin-coating 6.67 mM SbCl3 solution in methanol and 10 mM Na2S solution in methanol/water (v/v, 95/5) to induce the non-aqueous chemical bath deposition of the Sb2S3 thin film. The precursor solution of 40 mM SbCl3 and 80 mM thioacetamide in DMF was pretreated at 100 degrees C for 120 min to prevent the dissolution of the Sb2S3 seed layer. The Sb2S3 thin film with the thickness of 80 nm was successfully grown on the Sb2S3 seed layer at 120 degrees C for 80 min using the pretreated precursor solution of SbCl3-thioacetamide complex in DMF. The corresponding solar cells with the architecture of FTO/TiO2 compact layer/Sb2S3 thin film/spiro-OMeTAD/Au achieved an open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density of 11.15 mA.cm(-2), a fill factor of 0.40 and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 2.70%. The non-aqueous chemical bath deposition using SbCl3-thioacetamide complex solution in DMF can provide a new approach for the preparation of the Sb2S3 thin film. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Here we report the fabrication and performance of a superoleophilic and anti-bacterial nonwoven nanofibrous poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene-co-styrene) [ABS]/ZnO electrospun nanocomposite membrane. The electrospun ABS membrane was decorated with floral ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) by a post-treatment method. The pristine ABS and nanocomposite membranes showed super oleophilic nature and could selectively separate different oils from the oil-water mixture by a gravity-driven technique. The ZnO NPs in the nanofiber could enhance the oil flux and also imparted anti-bacterial activity to electrospun ABS membrane against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The current nanofibrous system can be a good candidate for multi-functional oil-water separation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and the distribution of particles in composites have been analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performance of PANi/Graphene nanocomposites has been investigated by Tafel test. Results found here show that the graphene/polyaniline composites as catalyst materials show an outstanding electrochemical activity in DSSCs. Under optimal conditions, DSSC with PANi/Graphene shows the power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 7.45%, which is slightly lower than that of Pt-based DSSC (7.63%) fabricated under similar conditions.

AB In this paper BaTiO3 particles were synthesized by an additive-free solvothermal technique. Different combinations of temperature, holding time and, especially, pressure by gas injection were studied to evaluate the effect of the synthesis parameters on particle morphology. Powders were obtained by using titanium(IV) isopropoxide, barium nitrate and potassium hydroxide as reactants and water/ethanol as solvent. The results showed that from 80 degrees C to 180 degrees C and 6 h to 24 h at inherent pressure, amorphous rough spheres, assembled nanocubes and irregular particles were formed. Dendritic and flower-like particles were synthesized at high pressures (20-80 bar). Oriented agglomeration and Ostwald ripening were the main crystal growth mechanisms observed.

AB Growing energy demand is provoking researchers to investigate semiconducting polymers for use in a wide variety of applications such as organic-based thermoelectric generators, solar panels, and thin-film transistors. Polythiophene has attracted wide interest in organic-based electronics due to the high stability of its (un)doped states, ease of structural modification, and solution processability. Herein, is described the synthesis of a thiophene monomer, 3-methoxythiophene, and its polymerization, (poly (3-methoxythiophene)) (PMoT), and statistical copolymerization with 3-hexylthiophene, poly((3methoxythiophene)-co-(3-hexylthiophene)) (PMoT-P3HT), using Grignard Metathesis polymerization in place of more traditional electropolymerization of alkoxy thiophenes. 3-methoxythiophene synthesis is verified at each intermediate step using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. PMoT-P3HT exhibited improved solubility in common organic solvents over PMoT due to the presence of the alkyl side chain. Analysis using the Spano model reveals PMoT-P3HT has a similar optical band gap and stretching mode energy to P3HT while absorbing a greater portion of the UV spectrum. Quantum chemical calculations by way of Density Functional Theory (DFT) were used to estimate polymer structures and electronic properties, which were found to capture experimental trends very well.

AB A series of porous toxic-element-free TiZr-based bulk metallic glass foams (BMGFs) with porosities ranging from 2.0% to 38.9% were fabricated by hot-pressing method. The results indicated that the BMGFs with pore sizes of 100-300 mu m exhibit relatively good mechanical properties, Young's moduli ranging from 5.8 to 56.4 GPa and compressive strength from 33 to 979 MPa which well match the properties of human bone. In in vitro tests, the TiZr-based BMGFs with porosities of 12.7% and 34.8% showed non-cytotoxicity and high extracellular calcium deposition. Owing to the excellent combination of suitable porosities, consistent mechanical properties, and high biocompatibility, the TiZr-based BMGFs are promising candidates for use in bio-implant applications from the viewpoints of avoiding stress shielding and bio-unfriendly symptoms in the human body.

AB Bi-rich bismuth oxyhalide have a great potential in the field of photocatalysis. For improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi-rich bismuth oxyhalide, here, the Bi4O5I2/Bi4O5I2 hybrids was firstly synthesized by electrostatic self-assembly method. The photocatalytic performance was investigated by the degradation of RhB and results show that the 98.34% degradation rate could be reached by Bi4O5I2/Bi4O5I2 photocatalyst. Pure and composite materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, Mapping, UV-vis DRS and PL spectra. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of closely heterostructure that boost the transfer and separation of holes and electrons. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, low-cost ion exchange technique coupled with printed-mask method has successfully been applied on the fabrication of high-quality flexible antennas. Nano-silver particles are chosen as conductive material of the CPW-fed antenna. The structure of the antennas is well-defined by the inkjet printing method. The experimental results indicate that a compact, smooth and highly-defined silver pattern is formed on the PI film with thickness of 800 nm, particle size of 50 nm and sheet resistance of 2.34 Omega/sq. A peak gain of 42.68 dB at resonant frequency 2.4 GHz nicely accords with the simulated result by ANSYS Electronics, demonstrating that the desired impedance matching can be realized. Moreover, the PI-based antenna shows excellent flexibility with a low sensibility to the bending tests. Therefore, the flexible patterned antenna by ion exchange technique and printed mask is suitable for flexible wireless electronics devices such as wearable devices, RFID labels and wireless mobile communication.

AB The current study demonstrates the feasibility of mechanical alloying (MA) and plasma spheroidization (PS) processes to produce highly-spherical Ti-22Al-25Nb-0.3Mo-1Zr-0.3Si-0.2Hf-0.4Ta (at.%) orthorhombic alloy powders. The microstructure, chemical homogeneity and phase evolution of the obtained powders at different times of milling and after plasma spheroidization were investigated using X-Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy methods. MA at short milling times resulted in powders with highly inhomogeneous layered microstructures with HPC- and BCC-crystal structures. Increasing the milling time promoted the formation of B2/beta-phase solid solution and improved the chemical homogeneity. PS of the fabricated irregular powders allowed to produce powders of the orthorhombic alloy with homogeneous chemical composition and a high degree of sphericity with the microstructure consisting of dendritic B2-phase.

AB Second harmonic generation (SHG) experiments were conducted on samples of a novel material: doped polymeric CO (dp-CO) that were synthesized via synchrotron X-ray irradiation of SrC2O4 and high pressure. The goal of the study was to ascertain if the novel material is rugged enough to handle high levels of radiation to enable its possible use as future sensors or optoelectronic devices. Three samples were tested. Two of the smaller samples that were synthesized in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and recovered at ambient conditions rapidly decomposed/degraded in the presence of the strong 3.6 x 10(9) mW/cm(2) intensity optical beam. The larger sample that was synthesized in a Paris-Edinburgh cell at 3 GPa after 1.5 h of hard X-ray white beam irradiation and also recovered to ambient conditions was not damaged by a 6.1 x 10(9) mW/cm(2) strength optical beam and exhibited second harmonic generation. This lends credence that this novel material (when synthesized under select conditions) may offer utility as a rugged radiation hardened and easy to manufacture nonlinear optical device.

AB Cobalt-doped g-C3N4 exhibited good peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for removing the organic compounds. However, the contact of PMS with cobalt-doped g-C3N4 was inhibited at neutral pH due to electrostatic repulsion. In this work, cobalt-doped g-C3N4 was treated with NaBH4 solution. The physicochemical properties of the treated cobalt-doped g-C3N4 were characterized by several techniques. Obtained results showed the changes in specific surface area and zeta potential. In the catalytic experiment, the treated cobalt-doped g-C3N4 showed an excellent activation of PMS to degrade Acid Orange 7. The significantly enhanced PMS activation was due to the effective contact between PMS and the treated Co-doped g-C3N4 via electrostatic attraction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) performed a non-interfacial growth in the Cu-5Ni/SAC305 system. The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis revealed that the orientation of the Cu6Sn5 [1 0 0] direction parallelled to the direction of electric current, however, the addition of Ni could induce that the growth of (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 grain exhibited isotropy. Additionally, the additional Ni resulted in significant reduction in grain size and enhancement in the tensile strength of joints. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unique flower-like NiO/ZnO composite with porous nanosheets has been triumphantly manufactured via the one-step hydrothermal method initially. On the basis of morphology observations and ethanol gas measurements, it is considered that the construction of P-N junctions at the interface as well as the sheet-like porous microflowers architecture greatly contribute to the fantastic gas sensing properties of the prepared materials, which exhibit superb gas response value and outstanding repeatability. Furthermore, a possible formation mechanism is proposed, elucidating the process of the oriented-attachment, the self-assembly in addition to the pores-development. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bacterial infection followed by biofilm formation at the site of injury presents an extensive and tenacious challenge to wound care management as it leads to delayed wound healing. Recently nanoparticles and nanofibers have been widely investigated for their superior physical and biological supportive properties. This study presents the green synthesis of nickel oxide nanoparticles using Gymnema sylvestre extracts. The synthesized nanoparticles were infused into electrospun poly-epsilon-caprolactone/Gelatin hybrid nanofibrous mats. As synthesized nanofibrous mats exhibited good wettability, enhanced mechanical properties, biocompatibility and potent antibacterial activity. Overall, the bio functionalized nickel oxide nanoparticles infused electrospun nanofibrous mats can serve as an effective anti-infective wound dressing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Present investigation attempts to evaluate the sintering kinetics of mechanically alloyed AlCoCrFeNi high entropy alloy powder. Dilatometric study shows an accelerated densification above 1150 degrees C during non-isothermal sintering. The process was characterized with an activation energy of 166 +/- 13 kJ/mol. Sintering was found to be controlled by the viscous flow mechanisms and atomic diffusion of constituent elements in the melt phase. This was attributed to the formation of some Cr-rich viscous phase, which had a good wettability on the solid. Results were further confirmed by an endothermic peak during differential scanning calorimetry and the solidified phases around the grains, in the quenched microstructure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Composite scaffolds were successfully obtained using sol-gel derived 58S bioactive glass particles and poly(e-caprolactone) pellets. Camphene was used as the freezing vehicle. No sintering step was used, which represents a great advantage in terms of energy and time-saving. The prepared scaffolds showed a mechanical behavior similar to elastomeric cellular solids and Young's modulus of 46.7 +/- 9.4 MPa, which may allow their use in load-bearing applications. Cytotoxicity tests revealed that the composites promoted the growth of human osteosarcoma cells. The formation of a hydroxyapatite layer on the surface of the samples was also observed after soaking them in a simulated body fluid solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the magnetoimpedance effect in Y3Fe5O12/(Ag, W) bilayers and explored the role of the spin-orbit coupling on the effective damping parameter. From this perspective, we showed that the magnetoimpedance effect is a powerful tool for the characterization of ferrimagnetic insulators. The results obtained for the bilayers enabled us to infer quantities as the effective saturation magnetization and effective damping parameter, as well as to verify the influence of the non-magnetic metal on the magnetization dynamics of the whole bilayer. Thus, we demonstrated the possibility of tailoring the effective damping parameter in this system, and we confirmed its dependence with the non-magnetic layer capping the ferrimagnetic insulator.

AB This work examined the band structure and photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride and titania nanoparticles prepared using porous silica templates with pore sizes of approximately 1 and 3 nm. The carbon nitride and titania specimens prepared in this manner exhibited absorption edge blue shifts compared to bulk samples, due to expansion of their band gap resulting from quantum size effects. The photocatalytic activity of these materials during hydrogen production from water was assessed, and the activity of carbon nitride prepared in the 1 nm pores was higher than that of the material made using 3 nm pores as well as that of the bulk carbon nitride. These results suggest that the expansion of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap contributed to increasing the catalytic performance. In contrast, the titania materials did not generate hydrogen. X-ray absorption fine structure analyses demonstrated that the titania in the silica templates had a distorted structure, which may have decreased its photocatalytic activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The antibacterial activity of gypsum-based chitosan (Gyp-CHT) biomaterial prepared for pulp capping application was evaluated with four concentrations of chitosan (10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 0% w/v CHT solutions - Gyp-CHT) against Streptococcus mutans. Test biomaterials were characterized by examining their surface morphology, chemical compositions and functional groups. The inhibition of bacterial growth was screened by agar diffusion test (ADT), direct contact test (DCT), biofilm formation assay and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicated higher antibacterial performance when tested with 2.5%CHT, 5%CHT and 10%CHT-containing biomaterials compare to Gyp-0%CHT, and the antibacterial effect was directly proportional to CHT concentration. SEM images showed a significant reduction of bacterial distribution on days 4 and 7 compare to day 1. Whereas, Gyp alone has conflicting antibacterial effects with significant less inhibitory effects. In conclusion, the experimental Gyp-CHT exhibits antibacterial effects when prepared in combination of CHT and significantly inhibits S. mutans's growth, distribution and biofilm formation.

AB The magnetorheological plastomers strengthened by glass microspheres (GMRPs) were prepared for acoustic materials with controllable properties and both the rheological properties and sound insulation characteristics were investigated. The addition of glass microspheres can improve the sound insulation at the whole frequency range. The increasing mass fraction of carbonyl iron powders and the magnetic field significantly affected the sound insulation at first resonance frequency. Finally, a vibration transfer method was established to predict the sound attenuation properties based on the mechanical properties and the fitting curve matched the experimental results very well.

AB Reversible martensitic transition in a homogenized FeMnCrCo (Fe-16Mn-8Cr-2Co) alloy is studied by mechanical spectroscopy with a focus on parameters of anelastic transient effects which accompany martensitic transition. SEM and XRD results reveal that microstructure of homogenized samples consists of alpha'-martensite (BCT), epsilon-martensite (HCP) and retained gamma-austenite (FCC). After first thermal cycle over the martensitic transition, the amount of transformed phase and height of corresponding transient internal friction peaks pronouncedly drop down. Three subsequent thermal cycles lead to minor changes, whereas phase transformation temperature remains the same. Upon heating, the relationship between transient peak height (Q(Tr)(-1)) and test parameters ((T) over dot - heating rate, f - measuring frequency and epsilon(0) - strain amplitude) can be expressed as Q(Tr)(-1) approximate to K((T) over dot/(f(0.73) x epsilon(0))).

AB Effect of external stress on pearlite transformation in a high-carbon steel was examined in terms of the measurement of volume change during isothermal holding. Two dimensional measurement of the steel holding at various temperatures under constant stress condition clarified anisotropic transformation plasticity, which means that the volume measurements are necessary to examine the transformation behaviors quantitatively. According to the measurement of volume change, it was found that the larger loading brings the shorter incubation time when compared at the same transformation temperature. These changes can be represented by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov type equation with four constants when the transformation temperature is adequately deviated from the bainite start temperature.

AB Functional interlayers applied in lithium sulfur batteries have been widely investigated due to its high reutilization of the diffused polysulfides and good cycle stability. However, the functional layer on the modified separator will indirectly decrease the sulfur content, which is harmful to the energy density of the whole cell. Herein, we report sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) modified functional separator which can deliver quite a lot reversible capacity to overcome the shortage of traditional interlayer. Meanwhile, S and N dual dopants can offer abundant adsorptive sites and have strong chemisorption to polysulfides. Thus, with this modified separator, a facile sulfur cathode can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1338 mAh/g and merely 0.178% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles at 1 C. The results indicate that SPAN is a promising material for functional interlayer between cathode and separator. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Benefiting from long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and abundant methyl groups, monolithic PRMSAs exhibit elastic recovery properties and super-high specific surface area, reaching up to 1479 +/- 83 m(2)/g. As heat insulators, PRMSAs possess a low thermal conductivity of 0.029 W/(m.K) at ambient conditions.

AB High thermal-expansion mismatched C-SiC composite and 304 stainless steel have been bonded by a 72Ag + 18Ti + 10Mo (at%) mixed powder filler. At the bonding temperature (1020 degrees C), the filler was in semi-solid state, i.e. solid-liquid mixed state of Mo particles, TiAg grains and Ag(Ti) liquid. Microstructural analysis indicated that the high activity and viscosity of the semi-solid filler help to obtain a large-thickness homogeneous joining layer (similar to 416 mm), in which Mo particles were clad by (Ti,Mo) solid solution and uniformly dispersed in Ag matrix together with the TiAg grains. The large thickness joining layer mainly composed of low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) Mo particles and ductile Ag matrix can effectively reduce the high residual stresses of the joint caused by the thermal-expansion mismatch between the dissimilar materials. Additionally, interfaces between the base materials and the joining layer were well bonded without continuous layered brittle compounds. The interfacial reaction products at C-SiC side were TiC, Ti5Si3 and Ti3SiC2 grains in Ag matrix. At 304 interface, Ti2Ni + Ti (Fe,Ni) compounds grew in columnar and gathered nearby. The characteristics of the joining layer and the bonding interfaces contribute to the high joint strength. The average shear strength of the joint at room temperature was 156 MPa.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement is the interaction between stress and hydrogen existing in materials or absorbed from environment. Exploring the hydrogen diffusion behavior under action of static tensile stress is necessary to understand the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement which happens before yielding. In this work, a new method was utilized to do research on hydrogen diffusion behavior of a container steel through hydrogen permeation tests under three static stress points, which can be realized by combining slow strain rate machine and Devanathan-Stachurski cells. Results demonstrated that with the increasing of static stress within elasticity, the hydrogen diffusion coefficient increases, the density of irreversible traps (M7C3 and Cu-rich particles) decreases, and some of irreversible traps would transform to reversible traps at the same time. Irreversible hydrogen traps have been believed to improve resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, which had been studied here that is not reliable for application of those structural parts bearing stress.

AB Cellulose triacetate (CTA) was hydrolyzed to lower degree of substitution (DS) of cellulose diacetate (CDA) at various hydrolysis time. Water affinity of cellulose acetate (CA) changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic when DS decreased to 1.96 at 16 h. Then, Janus antibacterial CA membrane was fabricated by 2 h-electrospinning with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt% of silver nitrate (AgNO3) on the front side, and pure CTA on the back side. The silver nitrate was reduced to silver nano particles (AgNPs) and distributed in fibres to gain prominent antibacterial property against S. aureus and E. coli. The Janus membrane showed directional water transportation for various biomedical applications such as wound dressings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the low photocatalytic efficiency of Cu2O caused by the serious photo-generated electronhole recombination, in this work, MoS2 is proposed to combine with Cu2O to form a nanohybrid as a photo-electrocatalytic catalyst for hydrogen generation. It is found that the optimized hybrid catalyst of 50M-C exhibits the best performance with a current density of 3700 mu A cm(-2) at -1.2 V (vs SCE), which is approximately 18-fold and 8-fold higher than those of single MoS2 (200 mA cm(-2)) and Cu2O (450 mA cm(-2)), respectively. Moreover, the enhancement mechanism is also discussed, and a synergistic effect between MoS2 and Cu2O is verified, which can reduce the charge transfer resistance and accelerate the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes.

AB Two-dimensional layered materials that possess high edge sites density have emerged as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, yet remain an extraordinary challenge. Here, we firstly report the synthesis of porous Cu2MoS4 nanosheets with edge-oriented geometry on cerium-centered metal organic framework (Ce-MOF) through a simple hydrothermal reaction. The vertical growth feature of Cu2MoS4 nanosheets efficiently exposed the active edges sites and promoted the HER catalytic performance. The Ce-MOF/Cu2MoS4 composite exhibited superior HER activity when compared with bulk Cu2MoS4 and the mixture of Cu2MoS4 and Ce-MOF, including the lower overpotential (0.36 V) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1).

AB Carbon nanotube/graphene foam/silicon carbide (CNT/GF/SiC) composites are prepared by in-situ growth of CNT in GF and followed by infiltration and pyrolysis of CNT-dispersed polycarbosilane. Results show that the CNT/GF/SiC composites exhibit outstanding electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of 32.1 dB in X-band, especially the specific SE reaches up to 33.8 dB cm(3)/g with a low density of 0.95 g/cm(3). The interconnected conductive graphene network improves the conductivity and sharply increases electric loss; meanwhile, the rich structural defects and multiscale interfaces including GF-CNT interface and CNT-SiC interface offer additional polarization loss, both of which endow composites with outstanding EMI shielding performance.

ID COMPOSITE ANODES; NANOSPHERES
AB Owing to the rich abundance and low-cost of K resources, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have been a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The exploration of suitable anode materials is challenging but of great importance for KIBs development. Alloying anodes such as Sn, Sb and their oxides have been proved as promising anode materials for KIBs due to their high specific capacities. Here, Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N doped porous carbon (Sn/NPC) are prepared using simple sol-gel method and heat treatment. As support skeleton, NPC endows Sn/NPC good conductivity and prevent agglomeration of Sn nanoparticles, which can be beneficial for high capability and rate performance. When evaluated as anode of KIBs, enhanced capacity of 198 mAh g(-1) is achieved at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this report, we demonstrate a novel two-step approach that is capable of growing uniform high-concentration MoS2 nanoflakes on the carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet substrate. The CNT sheet is simply activated by the oxygen plasma to separate large CNT bundles and to create more active surface sites. A typical chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is employed, enabling the direct growth of MoS2 nanoflakes on the activated CNT substrate. Morphologies and structures of MoS2/CNT nanohybrid are characterized by SEM/EDS, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Our results suggest that the plasma treatment of CNT sheet is critical to obtain well-dispersed large quantity of MoS2 nanoflakes on CNT assemblies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By adding bismuth subacetate (CH3COO(BiO), BiOAc) to bismuth citrate with optimal molar ratio of 1:3 and calcining at 350 degrees C in air, the resulted nanoparticle-based hollow spherical beta-Bi2O3 (H-beta-Bi2O3) exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison with nanosheet-based spherical beta-Bi2O3 (S-beta-Bi2O3) obtained from pure bismuth citrate. The degradation efficiency of rhodamine B (RhB) and malachite green (MG) was increased from 54.0% and 53.1% of S-beta-Bi2O3 to 91.2% and 94.6% of H-beta-Bi2O3 within 3 h of visible light irradiation, respectively. The improved photocatalytic performance of H-beta-Bi2O3 could be attributed to the enhanced light absorption and charge migration efficiency due to the presence of residual carbon and metal Bi, as well as higher surface area of hollow microstructure.

AB Intermetallic compound (IMC) layer growth at dissimilar metal interfaces, controlled by diffusion, usually follows a parabolic law. However, in the present study, the growth of Al3Ti layer on the Al-Ti interface at a low annealing temperature (TA, 500 degrees C) obviously didn't follow a parabolic law. A very long incubation stage of Al3Ti layer growth was observed in the Al-Ti diffusion couple annealed at 500 degrees C. Residual oxide layers and an oxygen rich layer were experimentally observed on Al-Ti and Al3Ti-Ti interface regions using high resolution STEM-EDS. The very long incubation stage is probably caused by the oxide layers and the oxygen rich layer on the interface region, which act as a diffusion barrier and as a source of oxygen atoms. The length of the incubation stage became shorter and even unobservable with increasing temperature probably due to the higher reaction rate between titanium oxides and aluminum at higher temperatures.

AB We demonstrated a novel porous Ni foam (PNF) with small voids/pores penetrating the skeleton wall by a simple etching process using commercial Ni foam, aiming to achieve the maximum use of its hollow structure for various nanostructured materials growing as the electrode for supercapacitor application. The hydrothermal Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets, functioning as the battery-type active material, were successfully grown vertically on both inner and outer surface of the PNF skeleton. The Ni(OH)(2)/PNF electrodes exhibited high capacity of similar to 578 C/g at 1 A/g current density with capacitance retention of similar to 90% after 3000 cycles, which was much higher than those of the Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrodes. The strategy suggests that 3D PNF not only provides a universal route for the rational design of biface (inner and outer) growth of various nanostructured electrode materials, but also reducing the total mass of the electrode supporter by take full advantage of the hollow structure of Ni foam for the industrial applications.

AB A novel means to improve the sub-zero impact toughness in the welding joints of 12Cr stainless steels was developed. The results indicated that the optimal conditions for performing the double post-welding heat treatment (PWHT) procedures were as follows: heating at 1000 degrees C for 15 min, followed by air cooling and then heating at 780 degrees C for 15 min, and finally air cooling. The welding joints subjected to double PWHT exhibited excellent mechanical and enhanced corrosion-resistance properties. Furthermore, the transition of the substructure in the martensitic grains was identified as the decisive factor for the improvement in the sub-zero toughness. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Surfaces with porous micro-nanostructured networks on Ti6Al4V substrates were successfully fabricated via sandblast, acid-alkali etching treatment. Wettability and hydroxyapatite (HA)-forming ability of the multilevel structured Ti6Al4V surfaces were investigated. Water contact angles and simulated body fluid (SBF) contact angles of 6 mu l droplets on the resulting surfaces were as low as 0 degrees, which could be attributed to the formation of hydrophilic TiO2 layer and larger specific surface area. Furthermore, after soaking in SBF for 1 day, a homogeneous HA layer was formed on the multilevel structured Ti6Al4V surface, whereas surface of original Ti6Al4V showed few HA precipitates even after 7 days of SBF immersion, suggesting that the fabricated structure was beneficial to faster HA deposition in SBF.

AB MoO3 nanospheres have been synthesized for the first time from MoO2(OH)(OOH) with the addition of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) through a facile hydrothermal process. The water-soluble MoO2(OH) (OOH), applied as the precursor, is obtained by the reaction between Mo powder and H2O2. The structure and morphology of the as-synthesized MoO3 products have been characterized. A typical orthorhombic structure with single-crystalline for the produced MoO3 materials is demonstrated by the XRD analysis, which is in accordance with the result exemplified by the EDS. Additionally, MoO3 with spherical morphology together with a diameter ranging from 30 to 100 nm has been shown by the FESEM. The presence of PVP is proved to be critical for the controllable synthesis of MoO3 nanospheres. Comparative experiments have been operated, and a PVP assistance reaction mechanism has been elucidated. Furthermore, the application in wastewater treatment for the adsorption of methylene blue by the produced MoO3 nanosphere has also been investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parameter estimation is an important research topic in data assimilation. In this paper, a novel parameter estimation method is introduced, where the parameter is considered as the state process in a nonlinear filtering problem and the state model that contains the parameter is used to construct a pseudo-observation. This approach is named the direct filter method since nonlinear filtering algorithms are used to estimate the parameter directly without estimating the state model as part of the solution in the nonlinear filtering problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the effectiveness and accuracy of the direct filter method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Different efficient and accurate numerical methods have recently been proposed and analyzed for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon is an element of (0, 1], which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. 0 < epsilon << 1, the solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at O(1) and O(epsilon(2)) in space and time, respectively, which brings significantly numerical burdens in designing numerical methods. We compare systematically spatial/temporal efficiency and accuracy as well as epsilon-resolution (or epsilon-scalability) of different numerical methods including finite difference time domain methods, time-splitting method, exponential wave integrator, limit integrator, multiscale time integrator, two-scale formulation method and iterative exponential integrator. Finally, we adopt the multiscale time integrator to study the convergence rates from the NKGE to its limiting models when e -> 0(+). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; REPRESENTATIONS
AB In this work, we present a novel data-based approach to turbulence modeling for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) by artificial neural networks. We define the perfect LES formulation including the discretization operators and derive the associated perfect closure terms. We then generate training data for these terms from direct numerical simulations of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We design and train artificial neural networks based on local convolution filters to predict the underlying unknown non-linear mapping from the coarse grid quantities to the closure terms without a priori assumptions. We show that selecting both the coarse grid primitive variables as well as the coarse grid LES operator as input features significantly improves training results. All investigated networks are able to generalize from the data and learn approximations with a cross correlation of up to 47% and even 73% for the inner elements, demonstrating that the perfect closure can indeed be learned from the provided coarse grid data. Since the learned closure terms are approximate, a direct application leads to stability issues. We show how to employ the artificial neural network output to construct stable and accurate models. The best results have been achieved with a data-informed, temporally and spatially adaptive eddy viscosity closure. While further investigations into the generalizability of the approach is warranted, this work thus represents a starting point for further research into data-driven, optimal turbulence models.

AB In this work we present a conservative WENO Adaptive Order (AO) reconstruction operator applied to an explicit one-step Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The spatial order of accuracy is improved by reconstructing higher order piecewise polynomials of degree M > N, starting from the underlying polynomial solution of degree N provided by the DG scheme. High order of accuracy in time is achieved by the ADER approach, making use of an element-local space-time Galerkin finite element predictor that arises from a one-step time integration procedure. As a result, space-time polynomials of order M + 1 are obtained and used to perform the time evolution of the numerical solution adopting a fully explicit DG scheme.
   To maintain algorithm simplicity, the mesh motion is restricted to be carried out using straight lines, hence the old mesh configuration at time t(n) is connected with the new one at time t(n)+1 via space-time segments, which result in space-time control volumes on which the governing equations have to be integrated in order to obtain the time evolution of the discrete solution. Our algorithm falls into the category of direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) schemes, where the governing PDE system is directly discretized relying on a space-time conservation formulation and which already takes into account the new grid geometry directly during the computation of the numerical fluxes. A local rezoning strategy might be used in order to locally optimize the mesh quality and avoiding the generation of invalid elements with negative determinant. The proposed approach reduces to direct ALE finite volume schemes if N = 0, while explicit direct ALE DG schemes are recovered in the case of N = M.
   In order to stabilize the DG solution, an a priori WENO based limiting technique is employed, that makes use of the numerical solution inside the element under consideration and its neighbor cells to find a less oscillatory polynomial approximation. By using a modal basis .in a reference element, the evaluation of the oscillation indicators is very easily and efficiently carried out, hence allowing higher order modes to be properly limited, while leaving the zero-thorder mode untouched for ensuring conservation. Numerical convergence rates for 2 = N, M <= 4 are presented as well as a wide set of benchmark test problems for hydrodynamics on moving and fixed unstructured meshes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB 3D optimal forcing and response of a 2D supersonic boundary layer are obtained by computing the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors of the global resolvent matrix. This approach allows to take into account both convective-type and component-type non-normalities responsible for the non-modal growth of perturbations in noise selective amplifier flows. It is moreover a fully non-parallel approach that does not require any particular assumptions on the baseflow. The numerical method is based on the explicit calculation of the Jacobian matrix proposed by Mettot etal. [1] for 2D perturbations. This strategy uses the numerical residual of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations imported from a finite-volume solver that is then linearised employing a finite difference method. Extension to 3D perturbations, which are expanded into modes of wave number, is here proposed by decomposing the Jacobian matrix according to the direction of the derivatives contained in its coefficients. Validation is performed on a Blasius boundary layer and a supersonic boundary layer, in comparison respectively to global and local results. Application of the method to a boundary layer at M = 4.5recovers three regions of receptivity in the frequency-transverse wave number space. Finally, the energy growth of each optimal response is studied and discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A non-intrusive bifidelity strategy [1] is applied to the computation of statistics of a quantity of interest (QoI) which depends in a non-smooth way upon the stochastic parameters. The procedure leverages the accuracy of a high-fidelity model and the efficiency of a low-fidelity model, obtained through the use of different levels of numerical resolution, to pursue a high quality approximation of the statistics with a moderate number of high-fidelity simulations. The method is applied first to synthetic test cases with outputs exhibiting either a continuous or a discontinuous behaviour, then to the realistic simulation of a flow in an underground network of fractures [2], whose stochastic geometry outputs a non-smooth QoI. In both applications, the results highlight the efficacy of the approach in terms of error decay versus the number of computed high-fidelity solutions, even when the QoI lacks smoothness. For the underground simulation problem, the observed gain in computational cost is at least of one order of magnitude. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model, a simplification of the Boltzmann equation, in the absence of boundary effect, converges to the Euler equations when the Knudsen number is small. In practice, however, Knudsen layers emerge at the physical boundary, or at the interfaces between the two regimes. We model the Knudsen layer using a half-space kinetic equation, and apply a half-space numerical solver[ 19,20] to quantify the transition between the kinetic to the fluid regime. A full domain numerical solver is developed with a domain-decomposition approach, where we apply the Euler solver and kinetic solver on the appropriate subdomains and connect them via the half-space solver. In the nonlinear case, linearization is performed upon local Maxwellian. Despite the lack of analytical support, the numerical evidence nevertheless demonstrate that the linearization approach is promising. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An analysis of a modified pressure-correction formulation for fast simulations of fully resolved incompressible two-phase flows has been carried out. By splitting of the density weighted pressure gradient, the pressure equation is reduced to a constant-coefficient Poisson equation, for which efficient linear solvers can be used. While the gain in speed-up is well documented, the error introduced by the temporal extrapolation of the pressure gradient requires further investigations. In this paper it is shown that the modified pressure equation can lead to unphysical pressure oscillations and large errors. By appropriately combining the extrapolated pressure gradient with a matching volume fraction gradient grid convergence at high density ratios could be recovered. The cases of a one-dimensional front and a sphere translating at uniform velocity were first considered, allowing to decouple the pressure equation from the momentum equation. Subsequently, the case of a rising bubble in an upflow is analysed for which the full set of governing equations is solved. The pressure jump extrapolation error has been found dependent on the density ratio and the CFL number. Ultimately, the gain in the computational time, made possible by the use of fast Poisson solvers, should be weighted by the additional computational time the reduction of the aforementioned error may require.

AB The fluid dynamics inside the left ventricle of the human heart is considered a potential indicator of long term cardiovascular outcome. In this respect, numerical simulations can play an important role for integrating existing technology to reproduce flow details and even conditions associated to virtual therapeutic solutions. Nevertheless, numerical models encounter serious practical difficulties in describing the interaction between flow and surrounding tissues due to the limited information inherently available in real clinical applications.
   This study presents a computational method for the fluid dynamics inside the left ventricle designed to be efficiently integrated in clinical scenarios. It includes an original model of the mitral valve dynamics, which describes an asymptotic behavior for tissues with no elastic stiffness other than the constrain of the geometry obtained from medical imaging; in particular, the model provides an asymptotic description without requiring details of tissue properties that may not be measurable in vivo.
   The advantages of this model with respect to a valveless orifice and its limitations with respect to a complete tissue modeling are verified. Its performances are then analyzed in details to ensure a correct interpretation of results. It represents a potential option when information about tissue mechanical properties is insufficient for the implementations of a full fluid-structure interaction approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Computational wave branches are common to linearized shallow water equations discretized on triangular meshes. It is demonstrated that for standard finite-volume discretizations these branches can be traced back to the structure of the unit cell of triangular lattice, which includes two triangles with a common edge. Only subsets of similarly oriented triangles or edges possess the translational symmetry of unit cell. As a consequence, discrete degrees of freedom placed on triangles or edges are geometrically different, creating an internal structure inside unit cells. It implies a possibility of oscillations inside unit cells seen as computational branches in the framework of linearized shallow water equations, or as grid-scale noise generally.
   Adding dissipative operators based on smallest stencils to discretized equations is needed to control these oscillations in solutions. A review of several finite-volume discretization is presented with focus on computational branches and dissipative operators. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Effective treatment of unbounded domains using artificial truncating boundaries are essential in numerical simulation, e.g. using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Among these, Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) have proved to be particularly efficient and flexible. However, an efficient handling of frequency sweeps is not trivial with such absorbing layers since the formulation inherently contains coupled space-and frequency-dependent terms. Using the FEM, this may imply generating system matrices at each step of the frequency sweep. In this paper, an approximation is proposed in order to allow for efficient frequency sweeps. The performance and robustness of the proposed approximation is presented on 2D and 3D acoustic cases. A generic, robust way to truncate the acoustic domain efficiently is also proposed, tested on a range of test cases and for different frequency regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Implication of the depth-independent barotropic mode approximation
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DE Ocean models; Barotropic mode; Mode splitting; Stability analysis
ID PART I; CONSERVATION; TOPOGRAPHY
AB The evolution of the oceanic free-surface is responsible for the propagation of fast surface gravity waves, which approximatively propagate at speed root gH (with g the gravity and H the local water depth). In the deep ocean, this phase speed is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest internal gravity waves. The very strong stability constraint imposed by those fast surface waves on the time-step of numerical models is handled using a mode splitting between slow (internal/baroclinic) and fast (external/barotropic) motions to allow the possibility to adopt specific numerical treatments in each component. The barotropic mode is traditionally approximated by the vertically integrated flow because it has only slight vertical variations. However the implications of this assumption on the stability of the splitting are not well documented. In this paper, we describe a stability analysis of the mode splitting technique based on an eigenvector decomposition using the true (depth-dependent) barotropic mode. This allows us to quantify the amount of dissipation required to stabilize the approximative splitting. We show that, to achieve stable integrations, the dissipation usually applied through averaging filters can be drastically reduced when incorporated at the level of the barotropic time stepping. The benefits are illustrated by numerical experiments. In addition, the formulation of a new mode splitting algorithm using the depth-dependent barotropic mode is introduced. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop and analyse finite volume methods for the Poisson problem with boundary conditions involving oblique derivatives. We design a generic framework, for finite volume discretisations of such models, in which internal fluxes are not assumed to have a specific form, but only to satisfy some (usual) coercivity and consistency properties. The oblique boundary conditions are split into a normal component, which directly appears in the flux balance on control volumes touching the domain boundary, and a tangential component which is managed as an advection term on the boundary. This advection term is discretised using a finite volume method based on a centred discretisation (to ensure optimal rates of convergence) and stabilised using a vanishing boundary viscosity. A convergence analysis, based on the 3rd Strang Lemma [9], is conducted in this generic finite volume framework, and yields the expected O(h) optimal convergence rate in discrete energy norm.
   We then describe a specific choice of numerical fluxes, based on a generalised hexahedral meshing of the computational domain. These fluxes are a corrected version of fluxes originally introduced in [29]. We identify mesh regularity parameters that ensure that these fluxes satisfy the required coercivity and consistency properties. The theoretical rates of convergence are illustrated by an extensive set of 3D numerical tests, including some conducted with two variants of the proposed scheme. A test involving real-world data measuring the disturbing potential in Earth gravity modelling over Slovakia is also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work discusses a general approach for preconditioning the block Jacobian matrix arising from the discretization and linearization of coupled multiphysics problem. The objective is to provide a fully algebraic framework that can be employed as a starting point for the development of specialized algorithms exploiting unique features of the specific problem at hand. The basic idea relies on approximately computing an operator able to decouple the different processes, which can then be solved independently one from the other. In this work, the decoupling operator is computed by extending the theory of block sparse approximate inverses. The proposed approach is implemented for two multiphysics applications, namely the simulation of a coupled poromechanical system and the mechanics of fractured media. The numerical results obtained in experiments taken from real-world examples are used to analyze and discuss the properties of the preconditioner. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate prediction of multiphase flow when particles are differentiated by a set of "internal" variables, such as size or temperature, can pose modelling and numerical challenges. Although Lagrangian particle methods can provide predictive simulations of a wide spectrum of complex multiphase problems, they can become prohibitively expensive as the number of particles becomes large. Alternatively, Eulerian approaches have the potential to improve the computational efficiency of multiphase flows, but classical methods produce modelling artifacts or do not properly treat the local statistical dependence between the particle velocities and internal variables, or between the internal variables themselves. In this paper an extension is proposed of the classical Gaussian ten-moment model from gaskinetic theory to a model for the treatment of a dilute particle phase with an arbitrary number of internal variables based on an entropy-maximization argument. Unlike previous formulations, this new model provides a set of first-order robustly-hyperbolic balance laws that include a direct treatment for the local statistical variance of each variable, as well as the covariance between the internal variables or the internal variables and particle velocity. A study of the wave speeds of the general hyperbolic system is presented. To demonstrate an example application, the model is then specialized for polydisperse flows that are subject to viscous fluid drag as well as gravitational and buoyancy forces. The complete eigenstructure of this fifteen-moment polydisperse Gaussian model (PGM) is presented and the PGM is shown to maintain a physically realizable distribution function for all admissible initial conditions. Finally, several illustrative low-dimensional problems are studied to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the new model. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We describe an efficient algorithm for reconstruction of the electromagnetic parameters of an unbounded dielectric medium from noisy cross section data induced by a point source in R-3. The efficiency of our Bayesian inverse algorithm for the parameters is based on developing an offline high order forward stochastic model and also an associated deterministic dielectric media Maxwell solver. Underlying the inverse/offline approach is our high order fully discrete Galerkin algorithm for solving an equivalent surface integral equation reformulation that is stable for all frequencies. The efficient algorithm includes approximating the likelihood distribution in the Bayesian model by a decomposed fast generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) model as a surrogate for the forward model. Offline construction of the gPC model facilitates fast online evaluation of the posterior distribution of the dielectric medium parameters. Parallel computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our deterministic, forward stochastic, and inverse dielectric computer models. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The uncollided angular flux can be difficult to compute accurately in discrete-ordinate radiation transport codes, especially in weakly-scattering configurations with localized sources. It has long been recognized that an analytical or semi-analytical treatment of the uncollided flux, coupled with a discrete-ordinate solution for the collided flux, can yield dramatic improvements in solution accuracy and computational efficiency. In this paper, we present such an algorithm for the semi-analytical calculation of the uncollided flux. This algorithm is unique in several aspects: (1) it applies to arbitrary polyhedral cells (and can be thus coupled with collided flux solvers that support arbitrary polyhedral meshes without the need for explicit tetrahedral re-meshing), (2) it provides accurate uncollided solutions near sources, (3) it is devised with parallel implementation in mind, and (4) it minimizes the total number of traced rays and maintains a reasonable ray density on each local subdomain. This paper provides a complete derivation of the algorithm and demonstrates its important features on a set of simple examples and a standard transport benchmark. Assessment of its parallel performance will be the subject of a subsequent paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, we propose a coupled immersed interface and grid based particle method to solve two-phase electrohydrodynamic problems in three dimensions. The problem considers a leaky dielectric (weakly conducting) droplet immersed in another leaky dielectric fluid under electric field where the non-homogeneous droplet surface charge effect is taken into account. Due to the mismatch of electrical properties between two fluids, the electric potential satisfying Laplace equation with jump conditions across the droplet surface is coupled with the conservation equation for the surface charge density. Consequently, we first develop a three-dimensional augmented immersed interface method (IIM) which incorporates some known jump conditions naturally along the normal direction and check the desired accuracy. Here, the grid based particle method (GBPM) is used to track the interface by the projection of the neighboring Eulerian grid points so no requirement for stitching of parameterizations nor body fitted moving meshes. Within the leaky dielectric framework, the electric stress can be treated as an interfacial force so that both the surface tension and electric force can be formulated in a unified continuum force in the Navier-Stokes equations. A series of numerical tests have been carefully conducted to illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the present method to simulate droplet electrohydrodynamics. In particular, we investigate the droplet equilibrium dynamics under weak and strong electric fields in detail. It is interesting to find out a chaotic tumbling motion with irregular rotating modes which we believe that is the first numerical verification to the recent experiments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB High-order methods gain increased attention in computational fluid dynamics. However, due to the time step restrictions arising from the semi-implicit time stepping for the incompressible case, the potential advantage of these methods depends critically on efficient elliptic solvers. Due to the operation counts of operators scaling with the polynomial degree p times the number of degrees of freedom n(DOF), the runtime of the best available multigrid solvers scales with O(p center dot n(DOF)). This scaling with p significantly lowers the applicability of high-order methods to high orders. While the operators for residual evaluation can be linearized when using static condensation, SCHWARZ-type smoothers require their inverses on fixed subdomains. No explicit inverse is known in the condensed case and matrix-matrix multiplications scale with p center dot n(DOF). This paper derives a matrix-free explicit inverse for the static condensed operator in a cuboidal, Cartesian subdomain. It scales with p(3) per element, i.e. n(DOF) globally, and allows for a linearly scaling additive SCHWARZ smoother, yielding a p-multigrid cycle with an operation count of O(n(DOF)). The resulting solver uses fewer than four iterations for all polynomial degrees to reduce the residual by ten orders and has a runtime scaling linearly with n(DOF) for polynomial degrees at least up to 48. Furthermore the runtime is less than one microsecond per unknown over wide parameter ranges when using one core of a CPU, leading to time-stepping for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using as much time for explicitly treated convection terms as for the elliptic solvers.

AB We introduce a new family of schemes, labeled Compact Gradient Recovery (CGR), for handling parabolic partial differential equations within the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework, with as the ultimate goal the discretization of diffusive flux terms in advection-diffusion systems such as the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Like other DG approaches for diffusion, this family of schemes is based on the mixed formulation, where an auxiliary variable is introduced (but not stored between timesteps) to approximate the solution gradient. To maximize accuracy, wherever interface approximations are necessary within the mixed formulation, our schemes apply the Recovery concept originally introduced by Van Leer and Nomura [1]. However, unlike Recovery DG, our new family of schemes is based on a nearest-neighbor stencil and does not require differentiation of the recovered solution, which can introduce large errors for shear diffusion problems. By design, the new schemes fill the void between the highly accurate Recovery DG schemes and existing mixed-form and penalty-based formulations. Fourier analysis is performed on Cartesian and simplex meshes to determine the order of accuracy and timestep-size stability limits for different solution polynomial orders p. Similar to other DG approaches for diffusion, our proposed schemes make use of a jump penalization factor when solving for the gradient along interfaces; the effect of this parameter is explored through Fourier analysis, allowing an informed recommendation regarding its value. In addition to exploration of the new scheme, the analysis includes previously unknown properties of the widely used BR2 scheme under a broad set of configurations. Our new approach is verified using a comprehensive suite of test problems (scalar Laplacian diffusion, shear diffusion, and compressible Navier-Stokes) on different mesh types and compared to the gold-standard, nearest-neighbor approach for diffusion, the BR2 scheme; our new scheme performs favorably with regard to accuracy of the solution, accuracy of the solution gradient, and timestep size without a substantial increase in computational cost.

AB We present a computational framework for the simulation of blood flow with fully resolved red blood cells (RBCs) using a modular approach that consists of a lattice Boltzmann solver for the blood plasma, a novel finite element based solver for the deformable bodies and an immersed boundary method for the fluid-solid interaction. For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM (npFEM) solver which has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used mass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling), such as an unconditional stability, versatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters to fully describe the behavior of the body at any mesh resolution. At the same time, the method is substantially faster than other FEM solvers proposed in this field, and has an efficiency that is comparable to the one of mesoscopic models. At its core, the solver uses specially defined potential energies, and builds upon them a fast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known material, our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related to the body viscoelasticity. In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for deformable bodies have more free parameters, and the calibration of the models demands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict their generality and mesh independence. We propose as well a modification to the potential energy proposed by Skalak et al. 1973 for the red blood cell membrane, which enhances the strain hardening behavior at higher deformations. Our viscoelastic model for the red blood cell, while simple enough and applicable to any kind of solver as a post-convergence step, can capture accurately the characteristic recovery time and tank-treading frequencies. The framework is validated using experimental data, and it proves to be scalable for multiple deformable bodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The tangent plane scheme is a time-marching scheme for the numerical solution of the nonlinear parabolic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which describes the time evolution of ferromagnetic configurations. Exploiting the geometric structure of the equation, the tangent plane scheme requires only the solution of one linear variational form per time-step, which is posed in the discrete tangent space determined by the nodal values of the current magnetization. We develop an effective solution strategy for the arising constrained linear systems, which is based on appropriate Householder reflections. We derive possible preconditioners, which are (essentially) independent of the time-step, and prove linear convergence of the preconditioned GMRES algorithm. Numerical experiments underpin the theoretical findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a novel numerical methodology to compute the advective transport and diffusion-reaction of tracer quantities. The tracer advection occurs through flow map composition and is super-accurate, yielding numerical solutions almost devoid of compounding numerical errors, while allowing for direct parallelization in the temporal direction. It is computed by implicitly solving the characteristic evolution through a modified transport partial differential equation and domain decomposition in the temporal direction, followed by composition with the known initial condition. This advection scheme allows a rigorous computation of the spatial and temporal error bounds, yields an accuracy comparable to that of Lagrangian methods, and maintains the advantages of Eulerian schemes. We further show that there exists an optimal value of the composition timestep that yields the minimum total numerical error in the computations, and derive the expression for this value. We develop schemes for the addition of tracer diffusion, reaction, and source terms, and for the implementation of boundary conditions. Finally, the methodology is applied in three flow examples, namely an analytical reversible swirl flow, an idealized flow exiting a strait undergoing sudden expansion, and a realistic ocean flow in the Bismarck sea. New benchmark problems for advection-diffusion-reaction schemes are developed and used to compare and contrast results with those of classic schemes. The results highlight the theoretical properties of the methodology as well as its efficiency, super-accuracy with minimal numerical errors, and applicability in realistic simulations.

AB This paper presents an efficient, low memory cost, implicit finite volume lattice Boltzmann method (FVLBM) based on conservation moments acceleration for steady nearly incompressible flows. In the proposed scheme, not as the conventional implicit schemes, both the micro lattice Boltzmann equations (LBE) and the associated conservation moment equations are solved by the matrix-free, lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme (LUSGS) and the conservation moment equations are used to predict equilibrium distribution functions at the new time, which eliminates the storage of the Jacobian matrix of the collision term in the implicit LBE system and provides a driving force for the fast convergence of the LBE. Moreover, by utilizing the projection matrix and the collision invariant, we can construct the fluxes of the moment equations efficiently from the fluxes of the LBE and avoid the time-consuming reconstruction procedure for obtaining the fluxes of the moment equations. To demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed scheme, comparison studies of simulation results of several two-dimensional testing cases by the present scheme and an explicit FVLBM are conducted and numerical results show that the proposed implicit scheme can be as accurate as its explicit counterpart with 1 or 2 orders times speedup.

AB In this work, we have derived the general representation of the scattered field in the three-layered ocean waveguide. Moreover, a generalized direct sampling method which does not rely on the equivalent condition of density, and a novel MUSIC method as an alternative approach, have been proposed for the reconstructions of penetrable obstacles in the stratified ocean waveguide. In practice, the methods are capable of recovering the scatterers of different shapes and locations, robust against noise, computationally fairly cheap and easy to carry out. We can consider them as simple and fast algorithms to supply satisfactory initial positions for the application of any existing more refined and precise but computationally more demanding techniques to achieve accurate reconstructions of physical features of objects.

AB Various ensemble-based variational (EnVar) data assimilation (DA) techniques are developed to reconstruct the spatial distribution of a scalar source in a turbulent channel flow resolved by direct numerical simulation (DNS). In order to decrease the computational cost of the DA procedure and improve its performance, Kriging-based interpolation is combined with EnVar DA, which enables the consideration of relatively large ensembles with moderate computational resources. The performance of the proposed Kriging-EnVar (KEnVar) DA scheme is assessed and favorably compared to that of standard EnVar and adjoint-based variational DA in various scenarios. Sparse regularization is implemented in the framework of EnVar DA in order to better tackle the case of concentrated scalar emissions. The problem of optimal sensor placement is also addressed, and it is shown that significant improvement in the quality of the reconstructed source can be obtained without supplementary computational cost once the ensemble required by the DA procedure is formed.

ID FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; CONSERVATION-LAWS; SCHEME; SIMULATION
AB This paper addresses how two time integration schemes, the Heun's scheme for explicit time integration and the second-order Crank-Nicolson scheme for implicit time integration, can be coupled spatially. This coupling is the prerequisite to perform a coupled Large Eddy Simulation/Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes computation in an industrial context, using the implicit time procedure for the boundary layer (RANS) and the explicit time integration procedure in the LES region. The coupling procedure is designed in order to switch from explicit to implicit time integrations as fast as possible, while maintaining stability. After introducing the different schemes, the paper presents the initial coupling procedure adapted from a published reference and shows that it can amplify some numerical waves. An alternative procedure, studied in a coupled time/space framework, is shown to be stable and with spectral properties in agreement with the requirements of industrial applications. The coupling technique is validated with standard test cases, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present a robust immersed boundary (IB) method for high density ratio multiphase flows that is capable of modeling complex wave-structure interaction (WSI) problems arising in marine and coastal engineering applications. The IB/WSI methodology is enabled by combining the distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) method of Sharma and Patankar (2005) [13] with a robust level set method based multiphase flow solver. The fluid solver integrates the conservative form of the variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a hybrid preconditioner and ensures consistent transport of mass and momentum at a discrete level. The consistent transport scheme preserves the numerical stability of the method in the presence of large density ratios found in problems involving air, water, and an immersed structure. The air-water interface is captured by the level set method on an Eulerian grid, whereas the free-surface piercing immersed structure is represented on a Lagrangian mesh. The Lagrangian structure is free to move on the background Cartesian grid without conforming to the grid lines. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coupling is mediated via Peskin's regularized delta functions in an implicit manner, which obviates the need to integrate the hydrodynamic stress tensor on the complex surface of the immersed structure. The IB/WSI numerical scheme is implemented within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, in which the Lagrangian structure and the air-water interface are embedded on the finest mesh level to capture the thin boundary layers and the vortical structures arising from WSI. We use a well balanced gravitational force discretization that eliminates spurious velocity currents in the hydrostatic limit due to density variation in the three phases (air, water and solid). We also show that using a non-conservative and an inconsistent fluid solver can lead to catastrophic failure of the numerical scheme for large density ratio variations that are prevalent in WSI applications. An effective wave generation and absorption technique for a numerical wave tank is presented and used to simulate a benchmark case of water wave distortion due to a submerged structure. The numerical scheme is tested on several benchmark WSI problems from numerical and experimental literature in both two and three dimensions to demonstrate the applicability of the IB/WSI method to practical marine and coastal engineering problems.

AB We present a novel framework inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method for predicting the fluid-structure interaction of complex structures immersed in laminar, transitional and turbulent flows.
   The key elements of the proposed fluid-structure interaction framework are 1) the solution of elastodynamics equations for the structure, 2) the use of a high-order Navier-Stokes solver for the flow, and 3) the variational transfer (L-2-projection) for coupling the solid and fluid subproblems.
   The dynamic behavior of a deformable structure is simulated in a finite element framework by adopting a fully implicit scheme for its temporal integration. It allows for mechanical constitutive laws including inhomogeneous and fiber-reinforced materials.
   The Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible flow are discretized with high-order finite differences which allow for the direct numerical simulation of laminar, transitional and turbulent flows.
   The structure and the flow solvers are coupled by using an L-2-projection method for the transfer of velocities and forces between the fluid grid and the solid mesh. This strategy allows for the numerical solution of coupled large scale problems based on nonconforming structured and unstructured grids. The transfer between fluid and solid limits the convergence order of the flow solver close to the fluid-solid interface.
   The framework is validated with the Turek-Hron benchmark and a newly proposed benchmark modelingthe flow-induced oscillation of an inert plate. A three-dimensional simulation of an elastic beam in transitional flow is provided to show the solver's capability of coping with anisotropic elastic structures immersed in complex fluid flow.

AB We propose an extension of the embedded boundary method known as "shifted boundary method" to elliptic diffusion equations in mixed form (e.g., Darcy flow, heat diffusion problems with rough coefficients, etc.). Our aim is to obtain an improved formulation that, for linear finite elements, is at least second-order accurate for both flux and primary variable, when either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are applied. Following previous work of Nishikawa and Mazaheri in the context of residual distribution methods, we consider the mixed form of the diffusion equation (i.e., with Darcy-type operators), and introduce an enrichment of the primary variable. This enrichment is obtained exploiting the relation between the primary variable and the flux variable, which is explicitly available at nodes in the mixed formulation. The proposed enrichment mimics a formally quadratic pressure approximation, although only nodal unknowns are stored, similar to a linear finite element approximation. We consider both continuous and discontinuous finite element approximations and present two approaches: anon-symmetric enrichment, which, as in the original references, only improves the consistency of the overall method; and a symmetric enrichment, which enables a full error analysis in the classical finite element context. Combined with the shifted boundary method, these two approaches are extended to high-order embedded computations, and enable the approximation of both primary and flux (gradient) variables with second-order accuracy, independently on the type of boundary conditions applied. We also show that theprimary variable is third-order accurate, when pure Dirichlet boundary conditions are embedded. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the isogeometric analysis for surface PDEs based on the extended Loop subdivision approach. The basis functions consisting of quartic box-splines corresponding to each subdivided control mesh are utilized to represent the geometry exactly, and construct the solution space for dependent variables as well, which is consistent with the concept of isogeometric analysis. The subdivision process is equivalent to the h-refinement of NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by solving various surface PDEs, such as surface Laplace-Beltrami harmonic/biharmonic/triharmonic equations, which are defined on the limit surfaces of extended Loop subdivision for different initial control meshes. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of the accuracy, convergence and computational cost for solving the above surface PDEs defined on both open and closed surfaces. The proposed approach is proved to be second-order accuracy in the sense of L-2-norm with theoretical and/or numerical results, which is also outperformed over the standard linear finite element by several numerical comparisons.

AB A framework for exponential time discretization of the multilayer rotating shallow water equations is developed in combination with a mimetic discretization in space. The method is based on a combination of existing exponential time differencing (ETD) methods and a careful choice of approximate Jacobians. The discrete Hamiltonian structure and conservation properties of the model are taken into account, in order to ensure stability of the method for large time steps and simulation horizons. In the case of many layers, further efficiency can be gained by a layer reduction which is based on the vertical structure of fast and slow modes. Numerical experiments on the example of a mid-latitude regional ocean model confirm long term stability for time steps increased by an order of magnitude over the explicit CFL, while maintaining accuracy for key statistical quantities.

AB The evolution of polydisperse systems is governed by population balance equations. A group of efficient solution approaches are the moment methods, which do not solve for the number density function(NDF) directly but rather for a set of its moments. While this is computationally efficient, a specific challenge arises when describing the fluxes across a boundary in phase space for the disappearance of elements, the so-called zero-flux. The main difficulty is the missing NDF-information at the boundary, which most moment methods cannot provide. Relevant physical examples are evaporating droplets, soot oxidation or particle dissolution.
   In general, this issue can be solved by reconstructing the NDF close to the boundary. However, this was previously only achieved with univariate approaches, i.e. considering only a single internal variable. Many physical problems are insufficiently described by univariate population balance equations, e.g. droplets in sprays often require the temperature or the velocity to be internal coordinates in addition to the size.
   In this paper, we propose an algorithm, which provides an efficient multivariate approach to calculate the zero-fluxes. The algorithm employs the Extended Quadrature Method of Moments(EQMOM) with Beta and Gamma kernel density functions for the marginal NDF reconstruction and a polynomial or spline for the other conditional dimensions. This combination allows to reconstruct the entire multivariate NDF and based on this, expressions for the disappearance flux are derived. An algorithm is proposed for the whole moment inversion and reconstruction process. It is validated against a suite of test cases with increasing complexity. The influence of the number of kernel density functions and the configuration of the polynomials and splines on the accuracy is discussed. Finally, the associated computational costs are evaluated.

ID SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION; MODEL-REDUCTION; SYSTEMS
AB The analysis of high-dimensional dynamical systems generally requires the integration of simulation data with experimental measurements. Experimental data often has substantial amounts of measurement noise that compromises the ability to produce accurate dimensionality reduction, parameter estimation, reduced order models, and/or balanced models for control. Data assimilation attempts to overcome the deleterious effects of noise by producing a set of algorithms for state estimation from noisy and possibly incomplete measurements. Indeed, methods such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are vital tools for scientists in fields ranging from electronics to weather forecasting. In this work we develop a novel framework for smoothing data based on known or partially known nonlinear governing equations. The method yields superior results to current techniques when applied to problems with known deterministic dynamics. By exploiting the numerical time-stepping constraints of the deterministic system, an optimization formulation can readily extract the noise from the nonlinear dynamics in a principled manner. The superior performance is due in part to the fact that it optimizes global state estimates. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the method on a number of canonical examples, thus demonstrating its viability for the wide range of potential applications stated above.

AB We propose a preconditioner that can accelerate the rate of convergence of the Multiple Shooting Shadowing (MSS) method [1]. This recently proposed method can be used to compute derivatives of time-averaged objectives (also known as sensitivities) to system parameter(s) for chaotic systems. We propose a block diagonal preconditioner, which is based on a partial singular value decomposition of the MSS constraint matrix. The preconditioner can be computed using matrix-vector products only (i.e. it is matrix-free) and is fully parallelised in the time domain. Two chaotic systems are considered, the Lorenz system and the 1D Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation. Combination of the preconditioner with a regularisation method leads to tight bracketing of the eigenvalues to a narrow range. This combination results in a significant reduction in the number of iterations, and renders the convergence rate almost independent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and the length of the trajectory that is used to compute the time-averaged objective. This can potentially allow the method to be used for large chaotic systems (such as turbulent flows) and optimal control applications. The singular value decomposition of the constraint matrix can also be used to quantify the effect of the system condition on the accuracy of the sensitivities. In fact, neglecting the singular modes affected by noise, we recover the correct values of sensitivity that match closely with those obtained with finite differences for the Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation in the light turbulent regime. We notice a similar improvement for the Lorenz system as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a number of fully-conservative, four-equation, multicomponent reconstruction schemes for the Euler equations, which have been designed to maintain both constant pressure and temperature at isothermal contact discontinuities, as is required by thermodynamic consistency. The schemes we discuss have been implemented in AWE's staggered-mesh detailed turbulence modelling code TURMOIL and also in a finite-volume Riemann-solver based code. We show results for a problem where material properties with a high contrast in adiabatic index and material specific heat lead to substantial pressure and temperature perturbations for a simple mass fraction model. The improved schemes maintain the isobaric and isothermal nature of the initial condition to numerical precision. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We study the problem of electromagnetic scattering by multiple open cavities embedded in an infinite ground plane with high wave numbers. The problem can be described by a series of Helmholtz equations with coupled boundary conditions. We develop a sixth-order finite difference scheme to discretize the coupled Helmholtz equations. By Gaussian elimination in the vertical direction and Fourier transform in the horizontal direction, we can reduce the multiple cavity scattering problem to an aperture linear system. However, in the situation of high wave numbers, the condition number of the coefficient matrix of the reduced linear system is especially large and the system tends to be ill-conditioned. The convergence histories of most iterative methods become oscillating which consume considerable computations and memory spaces. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by high wave numbers, we develop an efficient preconditioned iterative method based on the Krylov subspace, which greatly improves the eigenvalue distributions and reduces the number of iterations. Numerical experiments show the validity and efficiency of the proposed sixth-order fast preconditioned algorithm for solving the scattering by multiple cavities with high wave numbers.

AB A common strategy in the numerical solution of partial differential equations is to define a uniform discretization of a tensor-product multi-dimensional logical domain, which is mapped to a physical domain through a given coordinate transformation. By extending this concept to a multi-patch setting, simple and efficient numerical algorithms can be employed on relatively complex geometries. The main drawback of such an approach is the inherent difficulty in dealing with singularities of the coordinate transformation.
   This work suggests a comprehensive numerical strategy for the common situation of disk-like domains with a singularity at a unique pole, where one edge of the rectangular logical domain collapses to one point of the physical domain (for example, a circle). We present robust numerical methods for the solution of Vlasov-like hyperbolic equations coupled to Poisson-like elliptic equations in such geometries. We describe a semi-Lagrangian advection solver that employs a novel set of coordinates, named pseudo-Cartesian coordinates, to integrate the characteristic equations in the whole domain, including the pole, and a finite element elliptic solver based on globally C-1 smooth splines (Toshniwal et al., 2017 [27]). The two solvers are tested both independently and on a coupled model, namely the 2D guiding-center model for magnetized plasmas, equivalent to a vorticity model for incompressible inviscid Euler fluids. The numerical methods presented show high-order convergence in the space discretization parameters, uniformly across the computational domain, without effects of order reduction due to the singularity. Dedicated tests show that the numerical techniques described can be applied straightforwardly also in the presence of point charges (equivalently, point-like vortices), within the context of particle-in-cell methods.

AB Recent works have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), because of their effectiveness in feature extraction and classification tasks, are suitable tools to address the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) problem. Further, it has been pointed out how ensembles of CNNs allow improving classification accuracy. Nevertheless, a detailed experimental analysis on how ensembles of CNNs could be effectively generated in the FER context has not been performed yet, although it would have considerable value for improving the results obtained in the FER task. This paper aims to present an extensive investigation on different aspects of the ensemble generation, focusing on the factors that influence the classification accuracy on the FER context. In particular, we evaluate several strategies for the ensemble generation, different aggregation schemes, and the dependence upon the number of base classifiers in the ensemble. The final objective is to provide some indications for building up effective ensembles of CNNs. Specifically, we observed that exploiting different sources of variability is crucial for the improvement of the overall accuracy. To this aim, pre-processing and pre-training procedures are able to provide a satisfactory variability across the base classifiers, while the use of different seeds does not appear as an effective solution. Bagging ensures a high ensemble gain, but the overall accuracy is limited by poor-performing base classifiers. The impact of increasing the ensemble size specifically depends on the adopted strategy, but also in the best case the performance gain obtained by involving additional base classifiers becomes not significant beyond a certain limit size, thus suggesting to avoid very large ensembles. Finally, the classic averaging voting proves to be an appropriate aggregation scheme, achieving accuracy values comparable to or slightly better than the other experimented operators.

AB Preventing cost overruns of such infrastructure projects as power plants is a global project management problem. The existing risk assessment methods/models have limitations to address the complicated nature of these projects, incorporate the probabilistic causal relationships of the risks and probabilistic data for risk assessment, by taking into account the domain experts' judgments, subjectivity, and uncertainty involved in their judgments in the decision making process. A knowledge-based expert system is presented to address this issue, using a fuzzy canonical model (FCM) that integrates the fuzzy group decision-making approach (FGDMA) and the Canonical model (i.e. a modified Bayesian belief network model). The FCM overcomes: (a) the subjectivity and uncertainty involved in domain experts' judgment, (b) significantly reduces the time and effort needed for the domain experts in eliciting conditional probabilities of the risks involved in complex risk networks, and (c) reduces the model development tasks, which also reduces the computational load on the model. This approach advances the applications of fuzzy-Bayesian models for cost overrun risks assessment in a complex and uncertain project environment by addressing the major constraints associated with such models. A case study demonstrates and tests the application of the model for cost overrun risk assessment in the construction and commissioning phase of a power plant project, confirming its ability to pinpoint the most critical risks involved-in this case, the complexity of the lifting and rigging heavy equipment, inadequate work inspection and testing plan, inadequate site/soil investigation, unavailability of the resources in the local market, and the contractor's poor planning and scheduling.

AB In this paper, the frequently used normalization methods for the entropy method (EM) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) when these two methods are used in combination with each other are summarized. Taking information entropy (IE) as an indicator to measure the diversity of attribute data (DAD), the effects of normalization on the entropy-based TOPSIS method are analyzed. It is found that normalization can affect the decision result by affecting the DAD, while the DAD affects the contribution of attributes to the distance of each alternative from the ideal solution and the negative ideal solution, manifested in that the higher the DAD is, the bigger the contribution of the attribute will be. It is proved that vector normalization (VN) and sum normalization (SN) will not change the DAD, whereas min-max normalization (MMN) not only will change the DAD, but also may cause the appearance of numerous zero values, finally resulting in the fact that the calculated results of IE cannot represent the diversity of raw data. Therefore, normalization is not suggested for the EM, and VN is suggested for TOPSIS method. Some discussions on the combinability between the EM and TOPSIS method are also given as well as the applicability of different normalization methods in TOPSIS method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Companies have an advantage over the competitors if they can present customized offers to customers. Demographic information of customers is critical for the companies to develop individualized systems. While current technologies make it easy to collect customer data, the main problem is that demographic data are usually incomplete. Hence, several methods are developed to predict unknown genders of customers. In this study, customer genders are predicted from their paths in a shopping mall using fuzzy sets. A fuzzy classification method based on Levenshtein distance is developed for string data that refer to the indoor customer paths. Although there are several ways to predict the gender, no study has focused on path-based gender classification. The originality of the research is to classify customer data into the gender classes using indoor paths. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Label ranking is a machine learning task that deals with mapping an instance to a ranking of labels, representing the labels' ordered relevance to the instance. Three recent studies have suggested the use of ensembles to improve the performance of simple label ranking models. However, none of them has explicitly inspected the question of how should the results obtained by simple models be aggregated into a single combined output. While classification tasks and regression tasks typically employ trivial aggregation techniques (i.e., majority voting and averaging, respectively), the case of label ranking tasks is not straightforward. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose to apply voting rules, typically used in the field of social choice, as the aggregation technique for label ranking ensembles. Our evaluation reveals that there is no single rule that consistently outperforms all other voting rules, and that under different settings different voting rules perform the best. Second, we propose a novel aggregation method for label ranking ensembles that learns the best voting rule to be used in a given setting. An extensive evaluation of the proposed method on semi-synthetic as well as real-world datasets shows that it obtains prediction performance that is significantly higher than that of the aggregation techniques currently used by state-of-the-art label ranking ensembles.

TI Topic discovery in massive text corpora based on Min-Hashing

ID ALGORITHM
AB Topics have proved to be a valuable source of information for exploring, discovering, searching and representing the contents of text corpora. They have also been useful for different natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text summarization and machine translation. Most existing topic discovery approaches require the number of topics to be provided beforehand. However, an appropriate number of topics for a given corpus depends on its characteristics and is often difficult to estimate. In addition, in order to handle massive amounts of text documents, the vocabulary must be reduced considerably and large computer clusters and/or GPUs are typically required. This paper describes Sampled Min-Hashing (SMH), a scalable approach to topic discovery which does not require the number of topics to be specified in advance and can handle massive text corpora and large vocabularies using modest computer resources. The basic idea behind SMH is to generate multiple random partitions of the corpus vocabulary to find sets of highly co-occurring words, which are then clustered to produce the final topics. An extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation on the 20 Newsgroups, Reuters, Spanish Wikipedia and English Wikipedia corpora shows that SMH is able to consistently discover meaningful and coherent topics at scale. Remarkably, the time required by SMH grows linearly with the size of the corpus and the number of words in the vocabulary; a non-parallel implementation of SMH was able to discover topics from the whole English version of Wikipedia (5M documents approximately) with a vocabulary of 1M words in less than 7 h. Our findings provide further evidence of the relevance and generality of beyond-pairwise co-occurrences for pattern discovery on large-scale discrete data, which opens the door for other applications and several interesting research directions.

TI HGGC: A hybrid group recommendation model considering group cohesion

ID SYSTEMS
AB In the real world, people organize and participate in many group activities. Group recommendation that finds out preferable items for a group of users is a challenging problem since it is difficult to properly aggregate diverse preferences among the members. Group cohesion denotes proportion of group members who actively participate in various activities relevant to group's objectives. In a strongly cohesive group, most members actively participate in group decision, while many of group members in a weakly cohesive group are bystanders who just follow the other member's decision. Since group cohesion is an important factor in group recommendation, the concept of group cohesion needs to be properly reflected to the recommendation model. We present a new approach about group recommendation that appropriately captures group cohesion. A hybrid model that considers content information and rating data simultaneously is also proposed to alleviate a well-known data sparsity problem in group recommendation. We use a heterogeneous information network (HIN) that can contain rich information about entities and relationships from which additional content information can be extracted. Then, this information is properly incorporated to the group recommendation model. Experimental results on the real datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and improves recommendation performances significantly.

AB An important goal in synthetic biology is to maximize the expression levels of proteins. For this purpose, multiple genes encoding the same protein can be integrated into the host genome. However, this approach is affected by two key issues. Firstly, codons with better adaptation indexes should be used, since some synonymous codons are better adapted than others. Secondly, the multiple protein-coding sequences should be as different as possible to avoid the loss of gene copies due to homologous recombination. Therefore, this task shows strict biological requirements that make it difficult to tackle. In this work, we design and implement a computational intelligence approach to address this problem, the Multi-Objective Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (MOSFLA). This method combines the optimization capabilities provided by parallel searches, multiple operators, and memetic strategies to tackle problems with difficult solution quality requirements. Several alternatives have been comparatively analyzed, including MOSFLA variants with three objectives as in other approaches from the literature and also variants with only two objectives. Experiments on nine real-world protein datasets give account of the improved, statistically significant performance achieved over the related work, attending to different quality metrics, confirming that our proposal satisfactorily deals with the complex nature of the problem.

TI ALSR: An adaptive label screening and relearning approach for

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Anomaly detection; Multi-type KPIs; Machine learning; Interval-oriented
AB Anomaly detection using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) is a key part of AlOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations). Recent anomaly detection approaches have adopted Machine Learning to detect anomalies on the perspective of individual time points more than events. These approaches do not effectively utilize the labels of continuous anomaly intervals, nor do they pay attention to the differences among anomaly points. The detection performances are therefore not precise enough to be applied in practice, and the differences in length of anomaly intervals also cause loss of performance. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach named ALSR, which uses a label screening model and a relearning model to analyze and utilize the continuous anomaly intervals of KPIs in finer granularity. The label screening model takes advantage of the continuity of anomaly intervals to remove some unnecessary data from the training set, making it more suitable for interval-oriented anomaly detection. The relearning model based on random forest reclassifies the true false positive points within domain of detected anomalies, thus effectively reduces the number of false positive points. ALSR uses several features extracted by sliding windows, and the feature set is proved to better describe the characteristics of KPI time series. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 25 KPIs. The total F-score of ALSR is 0.965, which outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Modern surveillance systems combine tens or even hundreds of cameras to ensure a wide area of coverage. With such a large amount of incoming video data, it is difficult for humans to effectively monitor each camera for potential threats. Recent advances in machine learning have brought forth great improvements in computer vision, which forms the key to automating surveillance systems. Previous works on the topic of automated surveillance systems have not been updated to leverage the emerging wave of convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms, nor considered the implications of these rapidly evolving frameworks. This work investigates the design of the processing system for a CNN-based automated surveillance system, including off-the-shelf algorithms and hardware components. Performance benchmarks are then used to evaluate several design options that impact processing speed of CNN-based surveillance algorithms. Finally, a set of design considerations are presented for the processing system of a modern CNN-based automated surveillance system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TOPIC DETECTION
AB With increasing popularity of social media, Twitter has become one of the leading platforms to report events in real-time. Detecting events from Twitter stream requires complex techniques. Event-related trending topics consist of a group of words which successfully detect and identify events. Event detection techniques must be scalable and robust, so that they can deal with the huge volume and noise associated with social media. Existing event detection methods mostly rely on burstiness, mainly the frequency of words and their co-occurrences. However, burstiness sometimes dominates other relevant details in the data which could be equally significant. Besides, the topological and temporal relationships in the data are often ignored. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach, called the Enhanced Heartbeat Graph (EHG), which detects events efficiently. EHG suppresses dominating topics in the subsequent data stream, after their first detection. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (i.e., Football Association Challenge Cup Final, Super Tuesday, and the US Election 2012) show superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques.

AB This work presents self-adaptive multiobjective real-code population-based incremental learning hybridised with differential evolution (MRPBIL-DE) for solving a 6D robot trajectory planning multiobjective optimisation problem. The objective functions are assigned to minimise travelling time and minimise maximum jerk taking place during motion while the constraints are velocity, acceleration and jerk constraints. A five order polynomial function is used to represent a motion equation while the motion path is divided into two sub-paths; from initial to intermediate positions and from intermediate to final positions. The optimiser is used to find a set of design variables including joint positions, velocities and accelerations at intermediate positions, moving time from the initial to intermediate positions, and that from the intermediate to final positions. Several multiobjective meta-heuristics (MOMHs) along with the proposed algorithm are used to solve the trajectory optimisation problem of robot manipulators while their performances are investigated. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for multiobjective robot trajectory planning optimisation problem. The results obtained from such a method are set as the baseline for further study of robot trajectory planning optimisation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PATTERNS; CHESS; INFORMATION; EXPERTISE
AB Process Models (PM) are visual documentations of the business processes within or across enterprises. Activities (tasks) are arranged together into a model (i.e., similar to flowcharts). This study aimed at understanding the underlying structure of PM comprehension. Though standards for describing PM have been defined, the cognitive work load they evoke, their structure, and the efficacy of information transmission are only partially understood. Two studies were conducted to better differentiate the concept of visual literacy (VL) and logical reasoning in interpreting PM.
   Study I: A total of 1047 students from 52 school classes were assessed. Three different process models of increasing complexity were presented on tablets. Additionally, written labels of the models' elements were randomly allocated to scholars in a 3-group between-subjects design. Comprehension of process models was assessed by a series of 3 x 4 (=12) dichotomous test items. Latent Class Analysis of solved items revealed 6 qualitatively differing solution patterns, suggesting that a single test score is insufficient to reflect participants' performance.
   Study II: Overall, 21 experts and 15 novices with respect to visual literacy were presented the same set of PMs as in Study I, while wearing eye tracking glasses. The fixation duration on relevant parts of the PM and on questions were recorded, as well as the total time needed to solve all 12 test items. The number of gaze transitions between process model and comprehension questions was measured as well. Being an expert in visual literacy did not alter the capability of correctly understanding graphical logical PMs. Presenting PMs that are labelled by single letters had a significant influence on reducing the time spent on irrelevant model parts but did not affect the fixation duration on relevant areas of interest.
   Both samples' participants required longer response times with increasing model complexity. The number of toggles (i.e., gaze transitions between model and statement area of interest) was predictive for membership in one of the latent classes. Contrary to expectations, denoting the PM events and decisions not with real-world descriptions, but with single letters, led to lower cognitive workload in responding to comprehension questions and to better results. Visual Literacy experts could neither outperform novices nor high-school students in comprehending PM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB In this work, we tackle the problem of multi-norm and multilingual license plate (LP) detection and recognition in natural scene images. The system architecture use a pipeline with two deep learning stages. The first network was trained to detect license plates on the full raw image by using the latest state-of-the-art deep learning based detector namely YOLOv2. The second stage is then applied on the cropped image to recognize captured license plate photographs. Two recognition engines are compared in this work: a segmentation-free approach based on a convolutional recurrent neural network where the recognition is carried out over the entire LP image without any prior segmentation and a joint detection/recognition approach that performs the recognition on the plate component level. We also introduced a new large-scale dataset for automatic LP recognition that includes 9.175 fully annotated images. In order to reduce the time and cost of annotation processing, we propose a new semi-automatic annotation procedure of LP images with labeled components bounding box. The proposed system is evaluated using two datasets collected from real road surveillance and parking access control environments. We show that the system using two YOLO stages performs better in the context of multi-norm and multilingual license plate. Additional experiments are conducted on the public AOLP dataset and show that the proposed approach outperforms over other existing state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examine the long-term relationship between signals derived from nine years of unstructured social media microblog text data and financial market developments in five major economic regions. Employing statistical language modeling techniques we construct directional sentiment metrics and link these to aggregate stock index returns. To address the noise in finance-related Twitter messages we identify expert users whose tweets predominantly focus on finance topics. We document that expert users are the main drivers behind an interdependence between Twitter sentiment and financial markets. The direct prediction value of expert sentiment metrics for stock index returns, however, is found to be elusive and short-lived. Yet, we detect significant predictive gains over benchmark models in times of negative market returns. In consequence, the relation between expert sentiment metrics and stock indices is sufficient to devise hypothetically profitable cross-sectional as well as time series momentum investment strategies for futures based on Twitter signals that survive basic transaction cost assumptions. In this context, our results show that expert sentiment signals can yield higher risk-adjusted returns than classical price-based signals. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Data and rules power expert systems and intelligent systems. Rules, as a form of knowledge representation, can be acquired by experts or learned from data. The accuracy and precision of knowledge largely determines the success of the systems, which awakens the concern for causality. The ability to elicit cause-effect rules directly from data is key and difficult to any expert systems and intelligent systems. Rough set theory has succeeded in automatically transforming data into knowledge, where data are often presented as an attribute-value table. However, the existing tools in this theory are currently incapable of interpreting counterfactuals and interventions involved in causal analysis. This paper offers an attempt to characterize the cause-effect relationships between attributes in attribute-value tables with intent to overcome existing limitations. First, we establish the main conditions that attributes need to satisfy in order to estimate the causal effects between them, by employing the back-door criterion and the adjustment formula for a directed acyclic graph. In particular, based on the notion of lower approximation, we extend the back-door criterion to an original data table without any graphical structures. We then identify the effects of the interventions and the counterfactual interpretation of causation between attributes in such tables. Through illustrative studies completed for some attribute-value tables, we show the procedure for identifying the causation between attributes and examine whether the dependency of the attributes can describe causality between them.

ID ROUGH SET APPROACH; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION;

AB This paper puts forward a newly derived framework for capturing and inferring from subjective based uncertainty for any given observation. The framework is referred to as the R-fuzzy grey analysis framework (RfGAf), which itself is comprised of 3 distinct components: 1. R-fuzzy sets - to capture the uncertainty, which utilises crisp rough set bounding of uncertain possible fuzzy membership values. 2. A significance measure - to provide a means to allow for conditional probability to be undertaken, and also to allow for the translation of the data to that of a time series, allowing for the linking to that of the third component. 3. Grey analysis, more specifically, the absolute degree of grey incidence, where post-analysis can be undertaken and additional metrics obtained. The hybridisation of all three has allowed for the creation of a framework ideally suited for the quantification of perception based uncertainty, which by proxy will be inherently associated to subjectivity. It will be shown and demonstrated how such a framework can be made use of, showcasing the advantages of such an approach. By making use of R-fuzzy sets and the significance measure, an intermediary approach to that of a generalised type-2 fuzzy set can be obtained. As it is widely agreed upon that a generalised type-2 fuzzy approach is ideal for capturing higher degrees of resolution with regards to uncertainty, the associated computational burden of its complexity makes it unfavourable, hence why the interval-valued type-2 approach is favoured. The findings indicate the RfGAf can allow for the high capacity and detail one would expect when considering a type-2 fuzzy set representation, with that of the simplistic objectiveness one would associate to a typical type-1 fuzzy set. The novelty of the framework allows for one to fully capture all the nuances and individualities of a population without a single loss of information. That snapshot in time can tell an awful lot with regards to perceived perception. The framework can be deployed on varying sizes of populations, from the intrinsically small to the overtly large. Potentially, one can use that snapshot to predict how an observation could be perceived in future events. If one can forecast the perception ahead of time, one can improve drastically on efficacy and efficiency. Such a framework has a strong applicability with regards to expert and intelligent systems in allowing for more detailed inference to be utilised and acted upon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Air-writing is the process of writing characters or words in free space using finger or hand movements without the aid of any hand-held device. In this work, we address the problem of mid-air finger writing using web-cam video as input. In spite of recent advances in object detection and tracking, accurate and robust detection and tracking of the fingertip remains a challenging task, primarily due to small dimension of the fingertip. Moreover, the initialization and termination of mid-air finger writing is also challenging due to the absence of any standard delimiting criterion. To solve these problems, we propose a new writing hand pose detection algorithm for initialization of air-writing using the Faster R-CNN framework for accurate hand detection followed by hand segmentation and finally counting the number of raised fingers based on geometrical properties of the hand. Further, we propose a robust fingertip detection and tracking approach using a new signature function called distance-weighted curvature entropy. Finally, a fingertip velocity-based termination criterion is used as a delimiter to mark the completion of the air-writing gesture. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed fingertip detection and tracking algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches giving a mean precision of 73.1% while achieving real-time performance at 18.5 fps, a condition which is of vital importance to air-writing. Character recognition experiments give a mean accuracy of 96.11% using the proposed air-writing system, a result which is comparable to that of existing handwritten character recognition systems.

AB Clinical diagnosis and regular monitoring of the population at risk of chronic diseases is clinically and financially resource-intensive. Mining administrative data could be an effective alternative way to identify this high-risk cohort. In this research, we apply data mining and network analysis technique on hospital admission and discharge data to understand the disease or comorbidity footprints of chronic patients. Based on this understanding we have developed a chronic disease risk prediction framework. The framework is then tested on Australian healthcare context to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The dataset contained approximately 1.4 million admission records from 0.75 million patients. From this, we filtered and sampled the records of 2300 patients having comorbidities including T2D and another 2300 patients having comorbidities other than T2D. Along with demographic and behavioral risk factors for prediction, we propose several graph theory and social network-based measures which indicate the prevalence of comorbidities, transition patterns, and clustering membership. We use an exploratory approach to understand the relative impact of these risk factors and evaluate the prediction performance using three different predictive methods-regression, parameter optimization, and tree classification. All three prediction methods gave the highest ranking to the graph theory-based 'comorbidity prevalence' and 'transition pattern match' scores showing the effectiveness of the proposed network theory-based measures. Overall, the prediction accuracy between 82% to 87% shows the potential of the framework utilizing administrative data. The proposed framework could be useful for governments and health insurers to identify high-risk chronic disease cohorts. Developing preventive strategies then, over a period of time, can reduce the burden of acute care hospitalization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The semantic analysis method of structured big data generated based on human knowledge is important in expert recommendation systems and scientific and technological information analysis. In these fields, the most important problem is the calculation of concept similarity. The study aims to explore the spatial mapping relationship between the general knowledge base and the professional knowledge base for the application of the general knowledge map in professional fields. With the core resource database (CRD) as the main body of the general knowledge and the institutional repository (IR) as the main body of the professional knowledge, the conceptual features of institutional expert knowledge were firstly abstracted from IR and inferred from small-scale datasets and the mathematical model was established based on the similarity of text concepts and related ranking results. Then, a two-set concept space mapping algorithm between CRD and IR was designed. In the algorithm, the more granular concept nodes were extracted from the information on the shortest paths among concepts to obtain a new knowledge set, the Expert Knowledge Recommendation System (EKRS). Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out with open datasets to verify the algorithm. The simulation results showed that the algorithm reduced the structural complexity in the calculation of large datasets. The proposed system model had a clear knowledge structure and the recommended accuracy of the text similarity was high. For small-scale knowledge base datasets with different sparsity, the system showed the stable performance, indicating the better convergence and robustness of the algorithm.

AB In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for environmental sound classification based on a ID Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that learns a representation directly from the audio signal. Several convolutional layers are used to capture the signal's fine time structure and learn diverse filters that are relevant to the classification task. The proposed approach can deal with audio signals of any length as it splits the signal into overlapped frames using a sliding window. Different architectures considering several input sizes are evaluated, including the initialization of the first convolutional layer with a Gammatone filterbank that models the human auditory filter response in the cochlea. The performance of the proposed end-to-end approach in classifying environmental sounds was assessed on the UrbanSound8k dataset and the experimental results have shown that it achieves 89% of mean accuracy. Therefore, the proposed approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches that use handcrafted features or 2D representations as input. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms all approaches that use raw audio signal as input to the classifier. Furthermore, the proposed approach has a small number of parameters compared to other architectures found in the literature, which reduces the amount of data required for training.

AB Grey models have been reported to be promising for time series prediction with small samples, but the diversity kinds of model structures and modelling assumptions restrains their further applications and developments. In this paper, a novel grey prediction model, named discrete grey polynomial model, is proposed to unify a family of univariate discrete grey models. The proposed model has the capacity to represent most popular homogeneous and non-homogeneous discrete grey models and furthermore, it can induce some other novel models, thereby highlighting the relationship between the models and their structures and assumptions. Based on the proposed model, a data-based algorithm is put forward to select the model structure adaptively. It reduces the requirement for modeler's knowledge from an expert system perspective. Two numerical experiments with large-scale simulations are conducted and the results show its effectiveness. In the end, two real case tests show that the proposed model benefits from its adaptive structure and produces reliable multi-step ahead predictions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Rank2vec: Learning node embeddings with local structure and global

AB Network embedding aims to project each node to a low-dimensional representation while maximally preserving network structure and inherent properties. It is attracting tremendous attention due to its great significance in various network analysis tasks, such as expert finding, relationship prediction, people classification, community identification, etc. However, the existing embedding methods mainly focus on capturing the microscopic structure of the nodes in the network. But they ignore the different global roles played by the nodes, resulting in the limitations in the mesoscopic and macroscopic tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel network embedding method named Rank2vec. It considers both local structure and global structural roles. Thus it enables the learned representations to preserve both the microscopic and macroscopic information. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct some extensive experiments on the task of multi-label classification on several real data sets. The experimental results have shown that the Rank2vec achieves significant improvement than state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural Language Understanding has seen an increasing number of publications in the last few years, especially after robust word embeddings models became prominent, when they proved themselves able to capture and represent semantic relationships from massive amounts of data. Nevertheless, traditional models often fall short in intrinsic issues of linguistics, such as polysemy and homonymy. Any expert system that makes use of natural language in its core, can be affected by a weak semantic representation of text, resulting in inaccurate outcomes based on poor decisions. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel approach called Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA), that disambiguates and annotates each word by its specific sense, considering the semantic effects of its context. Our approach brings three main contributions to the semantic representation scenario: (i) an unsupervised technique that disambiguates and annotates words by their senses, (ii) a multi-sense embeddings model that can be extended to any traditional word embeddings algorithm, and (iii) a recurrent methodology that allows our models to be re-used and their representations refined. We test our approach on six different benchmarks for the word similarity task, showing that our approach can produce state-of-the-art results and outperforms several more complex state-of-the-art systems.

AB Nearly 1.24 million people die every year in traffic accidents. More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0-15 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.

AB Low-rank representation (LRR) related algorithms have achieved great successes in subspace segmentation tasks. Among them, matrix factorization based methods usually show better performances than those of other LRR-related algorithms. According to our analyses, we found that the matrix factorization based low-rank algorithms could be regarded as the extensions of classical K-means performed in a latent subspace. From this viewpoint, we proposed a kind of new matrix factorization based algorithm, term self-regularized latent K-means (SRLKM), for subspace segmentation. In SRLKM, we devised a new graph-regularizer by using one of the solution to SRLKM itself. For further clarification about our proposed method, we declared the relationships between SRLKM and some close-related algorithms. Moreover, an optimization algorithm for solving SRLKM problem was provided. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted to show that SRLKM was superior to the related algorithms.

AB In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based architecture, which is under the scope of expert and intelligent systems, to perform accurate real-time tridimensional hand pose estimation using a single RGB frame as an input, so there is no need to use multiple cameras or points of view, or RGB-D devices. The proposed pipeline is composed of two convolutional neural network architectures. The first one is in charge of detecting the hand in the image. The second one is able to accurately infer the tridimensional position of the joints retrieving, thus, the full hand pose. To do this, we captured our own large-scale dataset composed of images of hands and the corresponding 3D joints annotations.
   The proposal achieved a 3D hand pose mean error of below 5 mm on both the proposed dataset and Stereo Hand Pose Tracking Benchmark, which is a public dataset. Our method also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

ID SPANNING-TREES; BRANCH VERTICES; BOUNDED NUMBER; ALGORITHM
AB In this paper, a novel problem in transshipment networks has been proposed. The main aims of this paper are to introduce the problem and to give useful tools for solving it both in exact and approximate ways. In a transshipment network it is important to decide which are the best paths between each pair of nodes. Representing the network by a graph, the union of thesepaths is a delivery subgraph of the original graph which has all the nodes and some edges. Nodes in this subgraph which are adjacent to more than two nodes are called switches because when sending the flow between any pair of nodes, switches on the path must adequately direct it. Switches are facilities which direct flows among users. The installation of a switch involves the installation of adequate equipment and thus an allocation cost. Furthermore, traversing a switch also implies a service cost or allocation cost. The Switch Location Problem is defined as the problem of determining which is the delivery subgraph with the total lowest cost. Two of the three solutions approaches that we propose are decomposition algorithms based on articulation vertices, the exact and the math-heuristic ones. These two approaches could be embedded in expert systems for locating switches in transshipment networks. The results should help a decision maker to select the adequate approach depending on the shape and size of the network and also on the external time-limit. Our results show that the exact approach is a valuable tool if the network has less than 1000 nodes. Two upsides of our heuristics are that they do not require special networks and give good solutions, gap-wise. The impact of this paper is twofold: it highlights the difficulty of adequately locating switches and it emphasizes the benefit of decomposing algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine based analysis and prediction systems are widely used for diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, lower accuracy of existing techniques and lack of post diagnosis monitoring systems limit the scope of such studies. In this paper, a novel machine learning based diagnosis and monitoring of AD-like diseases is proposed. The AD-like diseases diagnosis process is accomplished by analysing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using deep learning and is followed by an activity monitoring framework to monitor the subjects' activities of daily living using body worn inertial sensors. The activity monitoring provides an assistive framework in daily life activities and evaluates vulnerability of the patients based on the activity level. The AD diagnosis results show up to 82% improvement in comparison to well-known existing techniques. Moreover, above 95% accuracy is achieved to classify the activities of daily living which is quite encouraging in terms of monitoring the activity profile of the subject. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION
AB Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most successful recommendation techniques due to its simplicity and attractive accuracy. However, existing CF methods fail to interpret the reasons why they recommend a new item. In this paper, we propose a Contextual-boosted Deep Neural Collaborative filtering (CDNC) model for item recommendation, which simultaneously exploits both item introductions (textual features) and user ratings (collaborative features) to alleviate the cold-start problem and provide interpretable item recommendation. Specifically, we propose an interactive attention mechanism to learn the user representation, which makes use of the mutual information from both the user ratings and item introductions to supervise the representation learning of each other. With the learned attention weights, we can obtain the importance of each historical item among the historical list. Meanwhile, the attention model can assign different weights to the words in item introductions according to their importance. Therefore, CDNC can provide interpretations for the recommendations by assigning different attention weights to the historically interacted items and the words in the item introductions. On the other hand, we also learn the distributed representations of new-coming items with deep neural networks (i.e., LSTM), considering both rating and item introduction information. Finally, the user representation and the representations of new-coming item are concatenated to perform recommendation score prediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CDNC. In addition, CDNC has the advantage of interpreting the recommendations and providing user profiles for down-stream applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes an effective hybrid-based methodology, called interpretable logic tree analysis (ILTA), which characterizes and quantifies event causality occurring in engineering systems with the minimum involvement of human experts. It integrates two concepts: knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and fault tree analysis (FTA). The KDD extracts the root-causes in the form of a set of interpretable (meaningful) patterns and then is exploited to automatically construct a logic tree. Only the feasible solutions consisting of non-redundant patterns that cover the maximum number of observations in the dataset are selected using a burn-and-build algorithm. These solutions are employed first to visualize the discovered knowledge under the interpretable logic tree and second, to estimate the probability of an event given the occurrence of its root-causes. An actuator system dataset is used to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. Moreover, the ILTA methodology allows the tuning of the system states based on Bayesian control rules that characterize the nature of the discovered root-causes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an important problem in computer science which consists in finding a path linking a set of cities so that each of then can be visited once, before the traveler comes back to the starting point. This is highly relevant because several real world problems can be mapped to it. A special case of TSP is the one in which the cities (the points to be visited) are not static as the cities, but mobile, changing their positions as the time passes. This variation is known as Moving Target TSP (MT-TSP). Emerging systems for crowd monitoring and control based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be mapped to this variation of the TSP problem, as a number of persons (targets) in the crowd can be assigned to be monitored by a given number of UAVs, which by their turn divide the targets among them. These target persons have to be visited from time to time, in a similar way to the cities in the traditional TSP. Aiming at finding a suitable solution for this type of crowd monitoring application, and considering the fact that exact solutions are too complex to perform in a reasonable time, this work explores and compares different heuristic methods for the intended solution. The performed experiments showed that the Genetic Algorithms present the best performance in finding acceptable solutions for the problem in restricted time and processing power situations, performing better compared to Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing Algorithms.

AB Modern neuroscience imaging technologies considerably affect diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and facilitate progress towards the cure of brain diseases. The benefits largely depend on the practicalities by which the large-scale imaging and clinical data can be integrated, examined and understood. In EU neuGRID4You (N4U) project, many datasets were generated from research centres and hospitals. In order to perform effective analyses, these datasets and their metadata along with a number of pre-computed parameters are stored in a big data repository. This paper focuses on the patient identification using big data and Fuzzy Logic, which has been achieved through fuzzy processing where a reference number called Alzheimers Disease Identification Number (ADIN) is calculated. It has enabled patients sorting for a particular intensity of Alzheimers disease, short-term estimation of the progression of that disease and context of individual patients with respect to other patients such as appropriate treatment, estimated life expectancy etc. The generated rules define the necessary knowledge base for the inference engine to generate output sets and an aggregate membership function of each rule is formed. Using this function, a most representative value of the total output set is obtained which represents the disease intensity. The implemented system and its evaluation are based on realistic datasets, demonstrators and making use of real-life neuroscience case studies. The presented results of four selected case studies show that this approach have provided sufficient expressiveness in understanding patients' disease information. Finally, a discussion and conclusions are presented on the opportunities offered by the calculation of ADIN to manage Alzheimers disease along with potential future extensions or applications of this work.

AB Emerging security requirements lead to new validation protocols to be implemented to recent authentication systems by employing biometric traits instead of regular passwords. If an additional security is required in authentication phase, keystroke recognition and classification systems and related interfaces are very promising for collecting and classifying biometric traits. These systems generally operate in time-domain; however, the conventional time-domain solutions could be inadequate if a touchscreen is so small to enter any kind of alphanumeric passwords or a password consists of one single character like a tap to the screen. Therefore, we propose a novel frequency-based authentication system, TAPSTROKE, as a prospective protocol for small touchscreens and an alternative authentication methodology for existing devices. We firstly analyzed the binary train signals formed by tap passwords consisting of taps instead of alphanumeric digits by the regular (SIFT) and modified short time Fourier transformations (mSTFT). The unique biometric feature extracted from a tap signal is the frequency-time localization achieved by the spectrograms which are generated by these transformations. The touch signals, generated from the same tap-password, create significantly different spectrograms for predetermined window sizes. Finally, we conducted several experiments to distinguish future attempts by one-class support vector machines (SVM) with a simple linear kernel for Hamming and Blackman window functions. The experiments are greatly encouraging that we achieved 1.40%-2.12% and 2.01%-3.21% equal error rates (EER) with mSTFT; while with regular SIFT the classifiers produced quite higher EER, 7.49%-11.95% and 6.93%-10.12%, with Hamming and Blackman window functions, separately. The whole methodology, as an expert system for protecting the users from fraud attacks sheds light on new era of authentication systems for future smart gears and watches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Possibilistic Data Envelopment Analysis (PDEA) is one of the most applicable and popular approaches in the literature to deal with imprecise and ambiguous data in DEA models. In this approach, with respect to tendency of decision maker (DM) in taking optimistic, pessimistic and compromise attitude, three measures including possibility, necessity and credibility measures are used to form the Fuzzy DEA (FDEA) models, respectively. However, decision makers may have different preference and so it is necessary to customize fuzzy DEA models according to properties of DMUs. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy DEA model based on general fuzzy measure in which the attitude of DMUs could be determined by the optimistic-pessimistic parameters. As a result, the proposed FDEA model is general, applicable, flexible, and adjustable based on each DMUs. A numerical example is used to explain the proposed approach while usefulness and applicability of this approach have been illustrated using a real data set to measure efficiency of 38 hospital in United States.

AB An isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INAH) chemically modified fumed silica, as a novel adsorbent, was designed for the preconcentration and determination of Hg (II) ions in fish samples via the solid phase extraction followed by the hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS). In this work, the efficiency of the synthesized adsorbent was investigated to determine its ability for the extraction of the Hg (II) ions from the aqueous solutions. The extraction efficiency was investigated by optimizing of different experimental conditions, such as pH, sample volume, flow rate, adsorbent dosage, and eluent type. Under the optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve for the solid phase extraction method was obtained in the range of between 0.12 and 16.5 mu g L-1. The obtained detection limit and preconcentration factor were 0.018 mu g L-1 and 25, respectively (RSD > 3%). The proposed optimized method was successfully applied to fish samples.

AB Turbot can induce allergy in susceptible individuals due to the presence of parvalbumin (PV), a major fish allergen. This study aimed M evaluating the digestibility and the ability of PV to elicit the release of cellular degranulation, following treatment with tyrosinase (PV-Tyr), caffeic acid (PV-CA) and in combination (PV-Tyr/CA), using in vitro digestion and RBL-2H3 (passive rat basophil leukemia) cell line. The digestion assay products revealed that the stability of PV in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) was stronger, while in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) was rather weak. Western blot analysis revealed that the IgG-binding abilities of the cross-linked PV were markedly reduced. Moreover, crosslinking hampered the release of cellular degranulation process in RBL-2H3 cell lines. PV-Tyr/CA showed highly significant reduction in the release rate of beta-hexosaminidase (66.02%), histamine (35.01%), tryptase (29.25%), cysteinyl leukotrienes (29.72%), prostaglandin D-2 (34.96%), IL-4 (43.99%) and IL-13 (38.93%) and shown potential in developing hypoallergenic fish products.

AB The administration of anabolic agents in farm animals to improve meat production has been prohibited in EU, due to the potential risks to human health. Meat quality was investigated to detect the effects of illegal administration of dexamethasone or prednisolone or 17 beta-estradiol on Charolais bulls. Three groups of 6 bulls were treated and 12 bulls were the control. Meat quality parameters were measured on live animals, carcasses and on samples of Longissimus thoracis and multivariate statistical data analysis was applied. In Charolais bulls, these parameters were affected by growth promoter administration and the multivariate canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish between treated and untreated animals mainly due to three electronic nose's parameters, 24 h carcass temperature and drip loss. Therefore, meat quality control and the multivariate analysis could be useful as a first screening to address targeted controls on farms suspected of illicit use of growth promoters.

AB Fruits and vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Study of the contamination sources which result from farming activities is of importance. For this reason, a chitosan-graphene oxide nanocomposite film was prepared and implemented as the extractive phase in thin film microextraction of six organophosphate residues (OPPs) in the samples using high-performance liquid chromatography. The optimized method was validated and the limits of detection (0.7-1.2 mu gl(-1)), limits of quantification (2.3-4.0 mu gl(-1)) and linear dynamic range (2.0-1000.0 mu gl(-1)) were obtained. Principal component analysis revealed clustering of the fruit and vegetable samples based on the selected (OPPs) into two groups of unwashed-unpeeled and peeled-washed. This mapping was further investigated using descriptive method of boxplot. Washing and peeling of the samples, reduced the presence of OPPs to half or one third of interquartile range found in the unpeeled and unwashed samples.

AB This paper focuses on the use of a new type of yeast encapsulation procedure, applying the chitosan-calcium alginate double layer microcapsules, for the production of Riesling sparkling wine. Four different sparkling wines were produced by free or encapsulated yeasts. The four types of yeast used were adapted (Free EtOH-A, Encapsulated EtOH-A) and non-adapted to ethanol (Free, Encapsulated).
   The different yeast-inoculating formats had a significant impact on oxygen consumption and pressure increase rate in the bottle during the prise de mousse. Similarly to the free form, encapsulated yeast successfully completed the secondary fermentation. After an ageing period of 6 months, volatiles and sensory profiles of sparkling wines were compared. Although, some differences in volatile profiles were found among samples, sparkling wines produced by Encapsulated EtOH-A showed sensory properties, in terms of aroma, taste and body, similar to those produced by free yeast (both adapted and non-adapted to ethanol).

AB New antioxidant polyamide was prepared by total immersion in active extract for 48 h. Its antioxidant performance was tested using DPPH (IC50 = 270 +/- 21 mu g/g) and ORAC (1.52 mu mol Trolox/g). In vivo study was done using fresh minced meat stored at 4 degrees C and analysed after 0, 6, 13, 19, 23 days. After 23 days metmyoglobin (MetMb(BK) = 31.3 +/- 2.9% and MetMb(AOX) = 25.9 +/- 0.8%), CIE L*a*b* (a*(BK) = 15.0 +/- 0.4 and a*(AOX) = 16.6 +/- 0.3) and TBARS (MDA(BK) = 0.0060 +/- 0.0003 mu g/g and MDA(AOX) = 0.0044 +/- 0.0002 mu g/g) showed an improvement of meat shelf life. The results showed that this active film protected meat during 23 days. Migration study to food simulants was done by UPLC (R)-QqQ-MS and UPLC (R)-ESI-Q-TOF-MSE. A decrease of oligomers migration (for caprolactam n = 3: BK = 0.050 +/- 0.004 mg/Kg; AOX = 0.019 +/- 0.001 mg/Kg) was found.
   Industrial relevance: Nowadays, food industry is focused on improving shelf life of products by controlling its lipid oxidation using natural antioxidants. The obtained results la us design a new active packaging based on natural antioxidants for extending the shelf life of fresh minced meat at industrial scale.

AB In this study, water-soluble curdlan products (Cur and Cur-D) were prepared by an alkali-neutralization treatment process, after which ferulic acid (FA)-grafted Cur conjugates (Cur-g-FA and Cur-D-g-FA) were fabricated in the presence and absence of salt by adopting an approach involving free-radicals generated by the ascorbic acid/hydrogen peroxide redox pair under an inert atmosphere. Results showed that FA was successfully grafted onto the C-6 and C-4 positions of the Cur chains through covalent linkages and that the presence of salt exerted minor influences on the grafting ratios and structural characterizations of the products. Cur-g-FA and Cur-D-g-FA showed decreased crystallinity, thermal stability, and rheological properties, as well as a distinct surface morphology, when compared with those of native Cur. However, Cur-g-FA and Cur-D-g-FA also exhibited remarkably enhanced free-radical scavenging ability and antioxidant capacity in vitro. These results indicate that FA-grafted Cur conjugates have great potential application in the field of functional foods.

AB Microwave (MW) radiation was applied to perform the separation of triacylglycerols (TGs) in oil samples. The novelty of the work lies in the application of MW radiation to assist the separation of several non-polar compounds employing a totally organic mobile phase. Once the influence of the evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) variables on the sensitivity was optimized, the TGs separation was compared conditioning the column with either a conventional HPLC or a MW oven. Contrary to previous applications in which the mobile phase contained water, the improvement in sensitivity using MW was not as significant in comparison with conventional heating but it allowed a shortening in the retention times of several TGs in about 50% respect elution at room temperature. The method was finally applied for the quantification of most common TGs in almond, tiger nut, and argan oil.

AB Pinot noir and Zinfandel wines were produced with traditional maceration (Control), and extended maceration for one (1 month-EM), and six months (6 months-EM). Addition of an extra amount of pomace during EM was also evaluated through a treatment referred to as Double pomace. The application of EM and Double pomace decreased the chromatic as well as the anthocyanin and anthocyanin-derived pigment composition of the wines. Large polymeric pigments were favored in EM and Double pomace wines, but the total polymeric pigment content was not improved by any of the winemaking treatments. The 6 months-EM wines showed a 13-fold (Pinot noir) and a 1.6-fold increase (Zinfandel) in tannins, respectively, relative to Control wines. However, the 1 month-EM and Double pomace treatments did not affect tannin levels, suggesting that in these wines, the extraction of tannins during EM may depend upon desorption of previously extracted tannins during extended contact time.

AB Over 200 sugars, high sugar content foods, and sugar-free alternative products found in Canadian supermarkets were analyzed for carbon isotope (delta C-13) values, adding to the record of food items with reported delta C-13 values, which can aid in food authentication and human diet studies. The delta C-13 values of the products were mostly consistent with the photosynthetic pathway of the plant from which the main ingredients were derived. With the exception of those sugars and syrups derived from known C3 sources, all of the sugars and syrups and most of the sugar added to food products were from C4 plants such as sugar cane or corn syrup. Many sweeteners are chemically manufactured, and most reflect an intermediate delta C-13 value. A mixing model estimated the contribution of C3- and C4-based ingredients in foods with high sugar content, which may be used to evaluate the percentage of added sugar from C3- or C4-sources.

AB The natural bioactive polysaccharide was regarded as the effective nanocarrier for delivery of active ingredients for its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Moreover, the Fructus Mori polysaccharide has been proved to have good antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities. In this study, the Fructus Mori polysaccharide particles were prepared using antisolvent precipitation method. The bioactive polysaccharide particles exhibited smaller and rounder as the increase of the ethanol/water ratio. The average size, polydispersity index (PDI) and xi-potential of the bioactive polysaccharide particles were 396.06 nm, 0.38 and - 21.23 mV at ethanol/water ratio of 20:1. After spheroidization, the polysaccharide particles exhibited more stable when exposed to heat, increased ionic strength and alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the bioactive polysaccharide particle with the smallest size had the strongest protein adsorption capacity and bioavailability. Especially, the MFP-NP3 showed the ORAC value of 917.06 +/- 34.13 mu mol TE/g, and the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of 56.98 +/- 1.19% at 0.5 mg/mL. In addition, compared to the native Fructus Mori polysaccharide, the spheroidization enhanced the antioxidant ability and hypoglycemic activity.

AB Moringa oleifera is a worldwide cultivated edible and medicinal plant. Its seeds are rich in oil, proteins, and glucosinolates. A practical method was developed to simultaneously extract and separate the three groups of substances from M. oleifera seeds. Smashed seed material was loaded into columns with petroleum ether: ethanol 8:2 (PE-ethanol) and eluted sequentially with 4.8-fold PE-ethanol to extract oil, and 10.8-fold water to extract proteins and glucosinolates. More than 95% of oil, proteins, and glucosinolates were extracted. The extracts were separated automatically into ether (oil) phase and ethanol aqueous phase. The latter was further separated into proteins and glucosinolates by 70% ethanol precipitation. The main glucosinolate was identified by LC-MS as GLC (4-alpha-rhamnopyranosyloxy-benzyl glucosinolate). After purification, 22.3 g refined oil, 33.0 g proteins, and 5.5 g purified GLC from 100 g M. oleifera seeds were obtained. This study provides a simple and high-efficient method to utilize M. oleifera seeds.

AB Technologies for monitoring meat spoilage are important to ensuring consumer safety. As dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a reliable marker for meat freshness, sensitive and selective DMS sensors are of great interest. Herein, two trinuclear cyano-bridged bimetallic donor-acceptor ensembles, Fe-II(bpy)(2)(CN)(2)-[Pt-II(DMSO)Cl-2](2) (1) and Fe-II(bpy)(2)(CN)(2)-[(AuCl)-Cl-I](2), were synthesized, and corresponding solid-supported sensors were fabricated to determine the effect of the acceptor metal (M-A) on DMS detection. Changing M-A from Au-I to Pt-II improved the sensitivity and selectivity owing to changes in the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the complex and M-A-DMS adduct. When applied to real meat samples, 1 exhibited a linear spectroscopic response to DMS, even in the presence of interfering compounds, with a method detection limit of 1.0 ppm. The total bacteria count and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results revealed that the spectroscopic signal generated by 1 correlated with the microbial growth level and DMS concentration during meat spoilage.

AB The contents of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and endocannabinoids (ECs) in 43 food products were assessed and daily intakes, based on consumption of Mediterranean, vegetarian and Western diets, were simulated. NAPEs and NAEs were more abundant in plant-based foods than in animal food products; NAPEs were in the ranges 0-4032 vs 4-398 mu g/g dw and NAEs were in the ranges 0-35 vs 0.1-0.7 mu g/g dw, respectively while ECs were in the range 0-0.1 vs 0-34 mu g/g dw. Daily intakes of NAPEs and NAEs were higher from Mediterranean (263 and 0.25 mg/day) and vegetarian (242 and 0.28 mg/day) diets than the Western diet (163 and 0.08 mg/day). Conversely, ECs intakes were higher from Western and Mediterranean diets (0.17 mg/day) than the vegetarian diet (0.01 mg/day). Future studies will evaluate the physiological role of dietary NAPEs, NAEs and ECs in humans.

AB Fatty acids, phenolic compounds, and tocopherols of Coratina, Bosana, Semidana, and Tonda di Cagliari virgin olive oils, were measured over a 45-day harvest period. Phenolic composition was the primary factor distinguishing Bosana, Tonda di Cagliari, and Semidana, whereas fatty acids differentiated Coratina and the other cultivars. Harvest period principally influenced oleacein, oleocanthal, oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones, and flavonoids. High phenolic content was observed for Coratina (1039-688 mg/kg) and Bosana (788-592 mg/kg). A drastic decrease in phenolic content was observed in Semidana (529-134 mg/kg) and Tonda di Cagliari (507-142 mg/kg) during the harvest period. These two cultivars also had low MUFA/PUFA (6.0-4.0 and 4.9-3.2 respectively), suggesting that these varieties should be harvested earlier in the season. These results provide information to producers for improved management of the harvesting process, which is strongly affected by varietal factors.

AB Tropomyosin (TM), a myofibrillar protein, is a major allergen in most crustaceans including king pawn (Litopenaeus vannamei). In this study, the structural modifications and allergenic response of TM in fresh king prawn as induced by cold argon plasma jet (CAPJ) were examined. The result showed that the level of alpha-helix structures declined as treatment time progressed, while the level of beta-sheets and random coils increased. The free sulfhydryl groups decreased as CAPJ treatment progressed due to the formation of disulphide bonds while surface hydrophobicity increased until equilibrium values. In addition, after 15 min of plasma exposure, the maximum reduction recorded for IgE and IgG binding capacities were 17.6% and 26.87% respectively as revealed by ELISA test. These findings correlated with the occurrence of protein unfolding and denaturation, evident by complementary structural analyses conducted. The study indicates that non-thermal plasma maybe a promising tool for developing hypoallergenic food products.

AB The effects of near freezing temperature (NFT) storage at - 1.9 degrees C on cell wall degradation of 'Shushanggan' apricot was studied comparing to 0 degrees C and 5 degrees C storage. Our results indicated that NFT storage strongly inhibited the solubilization of Na2CO3-soluble pectin and cellulose, by the suppression of cell wall modifying enzymes (polygalacturonase, beta-Galactosidase, pectin methyl esterase and cellulase) and related genes expressions. The loss of side chains was the main modification in CDTA (Cyclohexane-diamine-tetraacetic Acid)-soluble pectin during storage and made the main contribution to the softening of apricot, while the loss of side chain was suppressed by NFT storage. Microscopic observation showed that NFT storage delayed the degradation of pectin fraction and protected cell wall structure from loosing. This study proves that NFT storage is an effective technology to suppress the cell wall polysaccharides degradation and ultrastructure modification of apricot.

AB The carotenoid profiles of citrus fruit have been well studied, but knowledge about the xanthophylls esters pattern is more limited. In this study, the native carotenoid profiles of mandarin and orange juices were studied. Xanthophylls in oranges were esterified with lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids. The fatty acids esterifying beta-cryptoxanthin in mandarins were lauric, myristic, palmitic and capric acid. In oranges, the average relationships of total free carotenoids to the sum of mono-esters and di-esters were 0.82 and 1.67, respectively, and the average relationships total mono-esters to total of di-esters was 2.51. In general, the mono-ester fraction was the most significant quantitatively. In mandarins, the average relationship of total free carotenoids to the sum of mono-esters was 0.17, which is in line with the fact that beta-cryptoxanthin was mostly esterified and not free (unesterified).

AB Anthocyanin lipophilization emerged as an efficient technique to improve their chemical stability, liposolubility and antioxidant properties for novel technological applications. This work describes an efficient method for the synthesis of cyanidin-3-glucoside-fatty acid conjugate using a Candida antarctica lipase B-rich extract, without further purification and retained in a porous membrane. Due to the enzyme retention within the membrane structure it was possible to improve the yield of the lipophilization reaction by 2.5-fold as well as obtaining the product in a shorter period of time comparing with its free form. Furthermore, the membrane retention allowed for enzyme reusability, since the same conversion yield was obtained in three consecutive reaction cycles.

AB In this work, a disposable and portable aptasensor for the fast and sensitive detection of oxytetracycline (OTC) using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs)@thionine connecting complementary strand of aptamer (cDNA) as signal tags was constructed. The substrate electrode of the aptasensor was thin film gold electrode (TFGE), which have the advantages of portable and uniform performance. In the presence of OTC, OTC competed with cDNA to combine with aptamer. The bioconjugate (AuNPs/cMWCNTs/cDNA@thionine) was released from the TFGE. Thus, the electrochemical signal declined. Under optimized conditions, the aptasensor exhibited good stability, high selectivity and high sensitivity. Furthermore, the developed electrochemical aptamer-based TFGE had a wide dynamic range of 1 x 10(-13)-1 x 10(-5) g mL(-1) for target OTC with a low detection limit of 3.1 x 10(-14 )g mL(-1) and was successfully used for the determination of OTC in chicken sample.

AB This study aimed to examine the modification effect of whey protein concentrate (WPC), WPC-gum arabic (WPCGA) or WPC-high methoxyl pectin (WPC-PEC) complex to tailor-modify W/O/W emulsion for secondary microencapsulation of hydrophilic arbutin and hydrophobic coumaric acid. The stability and rheological properties of coated emulsions, encapsulation yield, release and degradation kinetics of arbutin and coumaric acid were investigated. Results revealed that WPC-PEC complex (at the ratio of 1:3) coating W/O/W emulsion exhibited the highest viscosity and stability, with the highest encapsulation yield of 91.08% for arbutin and 80.92% for coumaric acid, respectively. Tighter coating structure of the WPC-PEC complex (1:3) forming a stronger gel network structure was confirmed, accounting for the larger mean particle size of 569.67 nm. Moreover, the WPC-PEC (1:3) coating W/O/W emulsion also showed controlled release of arbutin and coumaric acid in simulated conditions. The k value of degradation kinetics for arbutin (7.99 x 10(-4) at pH = 1.2, 4.19 x 10(-4) at 90 degrees C and 7.52 x 10(-4) at UV-C treatment) and coumaric acid (5.18 x 10(-4) at pH = 1.2, 3.24 x 10(-4) at 90 degrees C and 6.90 x 10(-4) at UV-C treatment) indicated low degradation rate. The present study revealed that the WPC-PEC (1:3) coating W/O/W emulsion could provide a better synergistic effect on higher encapsulation yield and stability of arbutin and coumaric acid.

AB Water soluble caffeic acid derivatives in aqueous extracts of mate (Ilex paraguariensis) showed a direct dose-dependent response, protecting protein thiols in a chicken breast meat model system when oxidation was initiated by a lipophilic radical initiator (2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile; AMVN). In contrast, an inverse dose-dependent response was obtained when initiated by a hydrophilic radical initiator (2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride; AAPH), pointing toward a mechanism, where a specific concentration of water-soluble polyphenol yields optimum protection. Optimal concentrations of mate extract for the protection of thiols against radicals initiated in the lipid phase (AMVN) or in the aqueous phase (AAPH) were 0.1-0.5% and 0.01-0.1%, respectively. Green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract showed a pro-oxidative effect involving quinones from oxidation of pyrogallol-type catechins (epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), gallocatechin-3-gallate (GCG), and epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG)) and not the catechol-type catechins (catechin and epicatechin).

AB Red drupelet is a postharvest disorder of blackberries with several drupelets turning back to red. This affects visual quality and thus marketability and consumers' acceptance. However, the cause of this disorder as well as metabolite changes during color reversion have not been fully understood. Anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside, cyanidin 3-dioxalylglucoside, and total anthocyanin, were significantly lower in red drupelets than in black drupelets after 7 days of storage. Sugars and organic acids, lipids, and free amino acids also changed with storage and by color reversion. The untargeted metabolomics analyses indicated that red drupelets were generally differentiated from berries at harvest or black drupelets at metabolite level. The results of this study help better understand the red drupelet disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating red drupelet disorder by comparing black and red drupelets at metabolite level.

AB The study evaluated bioaccumulation capacity of macro- and microelements, their impact on the production of glucosinolates and phenolic acids and antioxidant properties in a microshoot culture model of Nasturtium officinale.
   Elements: calcium, chromium, copper, iron, lithium, magnesium, selenium and zinc were supplemented in different salt concentrations to culture media. Bioaccumulation of elements [mg/100 gDW] varied from 1.24 (Li,1 mg/l) to 498.62 (Cr,50 mg/l) and was dependent on the type of element and its concentration. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) ranged from 11.37 (Li,25 mg/l) to 4467.00 (Ca,1 mg/l). The total glucosinolate contents [mg/100gDW] varied from 108.11 (Cr,1 mg/l) to 172.90 (Ca,1 mg/l). The presence of four phenolic acids was confirmed in the microshoots. Their total contents [mg/100gDW] ranged from 19.35 (Mg,10 mg/l) to 139.21 (Fe,50 mg/l). The highest antioxidant activity [nM trolox/mgDW], as evaluated by CUPRAC and QUE-NCHER-CUPRAC methods, was equal to 55.50 (Cu,1 mg/l) and 161.10 (Li,5 mg/l), respectively. The results proved good correlations between all studied parameters.

AB Rice geographical traceability requires analytical procedures and data evaluation capable of linking its composition to the producing area. In this work, major and trace elements in soil and rice grains and husk from 9 cities and 17 producers were evaluated. Arsenic species were measured solely in rice grains. The rice mineral profile evaluated by principal component analysis allowed the identification of controlling variables and origin fingerprints. Vectors controlling data variability were linked to the geographical area, to crop management, producers and in a lower extent to soil composition. Elemental discrimination through 3D models was proposed. Arsenic species in the grains and elemental husk composition were decisive to achieve the required discrimination. Rice discrimination was obtained by cities, producers and varieties. The present work model was compared with others from similar studies.

AB Analytical chromatographic techniques for mycotoxins control are well established, but they often depend on costly immunoaffinity sample clean-up. Serum albumins, particularly that from bovine origin (BSA), have stable binding affinity towards some mycotoxins, and can be cheaper alternative receptors for sample clean-up due to their wide availability. Thus, this work used BSA immobilized in agarose beads as a novel solid-phase extraction method for quantification of ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine. Constructed BSA-agarose columns could extract OTA efficiently from red wine after its dilution (4-fold) in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0. The method was linear (R-2 = 0.9999) in the OTA concentration range studied (0.05 to 3.0 mu g L-1) with recovery rates above 98%. It also showed low detection (0.017 mu g L-1) and quantification (0.051 mu g L-1) limits. The efficacy of the BSA-based method was further validated by direct comparison with commercial immunoaffinity columns. Portuguese wines analyzed by both methods had agreeing results.

AB Quinoa starch granules were esterified with dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) to various degrees of substitution (DS) (0.0023-0.0095). Physicochemical properties and emulsification capacity of the modified starch were studied. Increasing DS increased the particle size, water solubility, and swelling power, while decreasing the gelatinization enthalpy change and relative crystallinity of the starch. The DDSA groups were suggested to be mostly located in the amorphous region of starch granules. With increasing DS, the viscosity and storage modulus (G') obtained from rheological analysis increased first and then decreased. The DDSA modified quinoa starch efficiently stabilized O/W Pickering emulsions and has some technical advantages compared to octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified quinoa starch. Increasing DS led to decreased droplet size of the emulsions and a higher capacity in stabilizing emulsions during storage for a period of 10 days. This study suggested the potential application of DDSA modified quinoa starch as an emulsifier in stabilizing Pickering emulsions.

AB A point-of-care testing chip was developed for the colorimetric detection of inorganic mercury ion (Hg2+). The disposable chip fabricated by three-dimensional printing technology contains DNAzymes produced by rolling circle amplification (RCA); a color change caused by the enzymatic reaction between DNAzymes and the peroxidase substrate 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) is measured using a portable spectrophotometer. In the "turn-off"-type RCA reaction, the annealing of the T(12) primer that initiates the RCA reaction is blocked by the interaction of thymine with Hg2+; thus, the amount of amplified DNAzymes causing a color change is decreased depending on Hg2+ concentration. The colorimetric signal is enhanced by amplifying double-repeat DNAzymes from a circular DNA template. The chip detected Hg2+ in tap drinking water samples with high sensitivity (lowest validated value: 3.6 mu g/L) and showed better selectivity, precision, and reproducibility than conventional analysis instruments. This low-cost easy-to-use platform can reduce the risk of accidental Hg2+ poisoning.

AB Although storage temperature is important for partial coalescence, the literature is scant on exploring the partial coalescence behavior between refrigerated and room temperature storage. In this study, comparison of the partial coalescence behavior between 4 and 20 degrees C was investigated towards corresponding oil-in-water emulsions, and subsequently towards the ultimate properties of the aerated colloidal system. As expected, compared to the value of Avrami constant (K) at 20 degrees C, the value of palm kernel stearin (PKS85) and mixtures of PKS85 and glycerol monostearate (PKS85-GMS) obtained at 4 degrees C increased by 22 and 14 times, respectively. PKS85 and PKS85-GMS displayed the needlelike appearance (N-type crystal) with a little layer crystal (L-type crystal) at 4 degrees C and spherical shape formed by L-type crystal along with granular crystal at 20 degrees C. Interestingly, several unstable air bubbles with irregularly-shape were observed in the aerated emulsions at 20 degrees C, while these emulsions at 4 degrees C displayed numerous rounded and uniform air bubbles with glossy surface. This was attributed to the sufficient stiff needle crystals at 4 degrees C, facilitating the coalescence of fat globules via liquid fat bridges, further forming a rigid crystal-based network and trapping the air bubbles. Therefore, our findings gained an insight into the partial coalescence behavior in emulsion, providing theoretical support for designing and optimizing the production process of foam structure products.

AB Patulin (PAT) contamination of apple juice leads to a serious food safety issue. Developing an excellent adsorbent to efficiently remove PAT is more desirable. Herein, a cost-effective and efficient adsorbent (GO-SH/diatomite) with abundant active sites was successfully fabricated via surface engineering of diatomite with sulfur-functionalized graphene oxide (GO-SH) nanosheets, which exhibited excellent selective adsorption capacity toward PAT. The adsorption behavior, adsorption mechanism, stability and cytotoxicity were investigated by systematic studies. The adsorption results showed that its maximum adsorption capacity was 10.68 mu g/mg. Moreover, attributed to the specific interaction between PAT and thiol group, more than 90% of PAT was removed from apple juice without any juice quality deterioration. Importantly, the risk of food safety issue of apple juice caused by residual GO-SH/diatomite was negligible due to the properties of easy removal and excellent biocompatibility, which guaranteed its potential application in apple juice industry for PAT removal.

AB This study focused on the development of a novel model dough for leavened food production, which was obtained by blending gluten protein with damaged cassava starch (DCS) induced by mechanical activation (MA). The characteristics of model dough and the interaction between DCS and gluten were investigated, and the quality of bread made from the model dough was also evaluated. The results showed that both the addition of gluten and the increased damage of DCS could improve the strength of model dough. The damage of cassava starch prevented the formation of gluten network. The enhanced DCS-gluten interaction had an impact on the performance of dough, attributing to the interaction of hydrogen bonds between both of them. Moderate interaction was required to obtain the bread with desired quality, and MA for moderating structural damage to starch was an effective approach in promoting the interaction between starch and gluten protein.

AB A reasonable, high sensitive and accurate analytical method for the determination of 20 allergenic disperse dyes in foodstuffs was developed and validated. The obtained results showed that an ultra high liquid performance chromatography system - equipped with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) proved to be ideal for the selected method enabling multidimensional processing of the samples. Under optimized conditions, validation results showed excellent linearity (5-1000 mu g/L, r(2) >= 0.997), limits of detection (LODs, 1.1-10.8 mu g/kg), recoveries (60.2-110.3%) and precision (RSDs <= 12.6%) for the twenty disperse dyes under investigation. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 20 disperse dyes in real foodstuffs demonstrating the validity and applicability of the current method for continuing monitoring of the selected dyes. The proposed UHPLC-MS/MS is thus proved to be a convenient, effective, sensitive and timesaving method for the isolation and determination of allergenic disperse dyes in edible packaging and other foodstuffs.

AB Targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometric (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) profiling of phenolic compounds was utilised for varietal differentiation of 173 wines made from four red and six white grape varieties. Among 58 identified phenols many were found relevant as exclusive or partial discriminators between wines. Successful differentiation models were built by linear discriminant analysis with the percentage of correct classification higher than 95% in all cases, with peonidin 3-(6"-acetyl)-glucoside and taxifolin as the most potent differentiators between red, and cis-piceid between white monovarietal wines. Diverse typical colour attributes among the monovarietal wines were tentatively ascribed to the variations in the composition of monomeric anthocyanins. Plavac mali red wine exhibited the most specific composition, and its most typical samples were distinguished by the abundance in trans-fertaric acid, isorhapontin, phlorizin, quercetin 3-rhamnoside, and myricitrin. Despite positive correlations with particular astringent flavonols, the typical astringency of Plavac mali wine remained unresolved.

AB The mechanisms of main tomato carotenes (phytoene, phytofluene, lycopene and beta-carotene) intestinal absorption are still only partly understood. We thus compared carotene bioavailability in mice after gavage with carotene-rich oil-in-water emulsions. We also determined each carotene absorption profile along the duodenalileal axis of the intestine to identify their respective absorption sites and compared these profiles with the gene expression sites of their identified transporters, i.e. SR-BI and CD36. Our data show that phytofluene presented a significantly higher bioavailability compared to lycopene and beta-carotene (areas under the curve of 0.76 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.05, 0.09 +/- 0.05 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 mu mol/L.h for phytofluene, phytoene, lycopene and beta-carotene, respectively). beta-Carotene was mostly converted in the proximal and median intestine. Phytoene and phytofluene accumulation tended to be more important in the distal intestine, which did not correlate with the proximal expression of both Scarb1 and CD36. Overall, these results highlight the high bioavailability of phytofluene.

AB Indirect measurements of taste-related compounds are required when a high number of samples has to be analyzed in a short period of time, with a minimum cost. For this purpose, FT-MIR partial least square (PLS) regression models for the prediction of total soluble solids, sugars and organic acids have been developed using three sample sets including breeding lines and commercial varieties of watermelon. Specific models with excellent performance were obtained only for sugars. Nevertheless, a general model supposed a compromise between the best and worse models and offered %RMSEP values of 11.3%, 11.1% and 11.7% for fructose, glucose and sucrose respectively. The model was applied to the selection of high content samples (selection pressure 20% and 30%) obtaining good sensitivity levels and mean percentile of selected samples close to the expected values (100% sensitivity). The robustness of FT-MIR models was assessed with predictions of external assays, obtaining reasonable performances.

AB This study reports a clear-cut relationship of the technological use of specific filter aids with highly variable vanadium levels in beer, wine, and fruit juices. First, the previously reported broad range of vanadium levels was confirmed in 68 commercial beverages by ICP-MS. Since cloudy apple juices exhibited significantly lower vanadium amounts than clear apple juices, filter aids used for clarification were analyzed and found to contain substantial and highly variable amounts of vanadium, particularly in all analyzed diatomite (38-368 mg vanadium per kg filter aid), but not in perlite products ( < 4 mg/kg). Subsequent pilot-scale precoat filtration experiments (170 L/batch) proved vanadium to be released from diatomite (Kieselguhr), increasing its levels from ca. 2.1-2.6 mu g/kg unfiltered to 27-201 mu g/kg filtered juice, depending on the use of diatomites high or low in vanadium. Thus, filter aid selection was shown to modulate the vanadium concentrations in clarified beverages.

AB Oligosaccharide derivatives were developed to crosslink keratin materials from poultry feathers, swine bristles and ox hairs to valorize these major wastes from meat industry. Global butchery generates more than 8,600,000 tons of keratinous wastes annually. Keratin was considered a promising resource for developing bio-based products as alternatives to petroleum products. Regenerated keratin products, such as films, usually showed insufficient mechanical properties, and required external crosslinking. However, most crosslinkers for proteins are either toxic, expensive, or with low efficiencies under mild conditions. In this research, regenerated keratin films were crosslinked by oxidized sucrose, a safe and potent bio-polyaldehyde. The crosslinker with verified low toxicity improved both tensile strength and elongation of keratin films, surpassing many other safe crosslinkers. Mechanism of the crosslinking reaction was proposed as forming Schiff bases and aminals and verified via H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. Relationship between tensile properties and crosslinking degree of keratin films was also quantified.

AB This research was to compare mortadella elaborated with synthetic antioxidant and microcrystals of curcumin in relation to its physicochemical and sensorial characteristics for a period of 90 days. It was detect no differences between the three evaluated treatments in relation to the pH, color, and texture profile features. The mortadella with curcumin microcrystals showed significantly lower TBARS values at the end of the storage when compared to the other treatments. In the sensory analysis, the addition of curcumin decreased the acceptance of color's sample and the purchase intention, but no significant difference was observed among the other attributes. The color of the sample containing curcumin also became worse than its day-of-production standard during storage. The results obtained suggest the potential of curcumin in replacing synthetic antioxidants in cooked meat sausage, since it practically does not modify its physicochemical characteristics, besides preventing the oxidation of the food.

AB Molecular dynamics simulation was performed on sugar profile and moisture content-based mixture systems of six Indian honey samples. Comparative studies were performed to understand the interactive effects of fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose and water on crystallization. All simulations led to formation of stable crystal but with different interaction energies. Post-simulation analysis showed that Fructose:Glucose of 1.18 formed the most stable crystal with highest van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The stability of crystal was further validated with least gyration radius (209 +/- 1.81 nm(2)), accessible surface area (4.09 +/- 0.04 nm) and root mean square displacement (3.51 +/- 0.00261 nm). Results indicated that not only Fructose:Glucose ratio but also sucrose, maltose and water had a significant effect on the overall crystallization process. The simulation data was used to train the artificial neural network which predicted the stability of honey crystallization depending on Fructose:Glucose and Glucose:Water ratios.

AB An effective, simple and sensitive analytical method has been developed employing liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and validated for estimation of five organophosphate pesticides at trace levels in six fruits and twelve vegetables. Plackett-Burman design and central composite design was used to screen and optimize the significant factors in modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) extraction method. The method evaluation was done by matrix-matched calibration with linearity ranging from 5 to 500 mu g/L with a correlation coefficient more than 0.990. The detection and quantification limit ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mu g/kg and 0.5 to 5 mu g/kg, respectively. The mean recoveries were in the range of 76.89-110.30 % with the relative standard deviation less than 13.26% for all pesticides. Further, the method developed was applied to analyze real samples cultivated in the hill areas of Nilgiris, South India.

AB Tartary buckwheat grains were subjected to hydrothermal treatments (steaming/boiling/autoclaving) whose effects on rutin enrichment in the buckwheat flour by rutin migration from the bran fraction were investigated in terms of optical, rheological, thermal, and microstructural properties. The highest amount of rutin was observed in the bran out of the native milling fractions (hull, bran, and flour). The hydrothermal treatments however increased the level of rutin in the flour, even showing a higher level of rutin than the bran in the autoclaved sample. Furthermore, rutin in the hydrothermally-treated flours was not degraded into quercetin by mixing with water. Scanning electron microscopic images demonstrated that the granules of buckwheat starch round in shape and grouped in lumps were disrupted by the hydrothermal treatments. The rutin contents of the buckwheat flour samples were linearly well-correlated with their pasting profiles (peak viscosity), colors (L and b values), and thermal parameters (gelatinization enthalpy and temperature).

AB Despite the ban of nitrofurans (NFs) for use in food production in many countries in the 1990s, NF metabolites in food are still regularly detected during import control testing. We have developed a confirmatory routine method for the detection and quantification of NF metabolites in seafood using LC-MS/MS and validated the method according to the strict criteria in European legislation and Codex Alimentarius. Method characteristics were found to fulfill the criteria. We report for the first time a new false positive for 1-amino-2,4-imidazolidinedione (AHD), the metabolite of Nitrofurantoin (NFT). By using optimized washing procedures, the non tissue bound false positives can be minimized. The results from the validation on both lean and fatty fish and crustaceans, results from proficiency tests and routine use over many years, demonstrates that the method is fit for purpose to determine NF metabolites in the seafood category.

AB Under the optimal conditions, a crosslinked electrospun polyvinyl alcohol/cinnamon essential oil/beta-cyclodextrin (CPVA-CEO-beta-CD) nanofibrous films for sustained release of antimicrobials were successfully prepared. Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) can be sustainably released due to CPVA-CEO-beta-CD nanofibers complex delivery systems. The chemical crosslinking and physical welding achieved simultaneously by glutaraldehyde atomization fumigation, making fibers more suitable for fresh food packaging. Nanofibrous films were characterized in terms of SEM, ATR-FTIR, DSC, water contact angle analysis and antibacterial trials. ATR-FTIR and DSC data indicated that CEO was encapsulated in a beta-CD cavity and they coexisted in PVA nanofibers. The water contact angle of the crosslinked PVA nanofibrous films increased with CEO and the values were always below 90 degrees. Crosslinked nanofibers possessed fine properties in vitro antibacterial against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coll. Furthermore, CPVA/beta-CD/CEO nanofibrous films delayed decay of mushroom during storage, indicating their potential implementation in active food packaging.

AB Bioactive compounds should be extracted using alternative solvents and enabling technologies, in accordance with green extraction principles. The aim of this study is to develop an eco-friendly extraction method for grapepomace anthocyanins on a larger scale. From a preliminary screening of 8 different natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), a combination of choline chloride:citric acid was selected because of its price, physicochemical properties, and anthocyanin recovery and stability. The effects of multimode-microwave (MW), and low-frequency-ultrasound (US) irradiation (used alone or simultaneously), as well as that of process parameters on extraction efficiency have been investigated in order to maximise anthocyanin extraction yield. The best conditions were found to be: simultaneous ultrasound/microwave-assisted extraction (UMAE) (MW power at 300 W, US power 50 W), for 10 min with 30% (v/v) of water. This gave 1.77 mg g(dw)(-1) of anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were efficiently recovered from NADES, which were recycled. The optimised procedure was scaled up to a half-litre batch.

AB In this work, a sensitive and stable ZrO2-Cu(I) nanosphere mesoporous material modified non-enzymatic glucose sensor has been developed through simple, low cost chemistry.
   ZrO2-Cu(I) material was obtained by controlled co-precipitation method under ultra dilution conditions. Cyclic voltammetric tests were performed in order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity ZrO2-Cu(I) modified electrode. The modified electrode showed high sensitivity, wide linear range and very low detection limit of 0.25 mM, this indicates that the modified sensor is competent with that reported earlier. Spherical morphology of the active material, alkaline environment and presence of + 1 copper have significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose on carbon paste platform. Also, the fabricated electrode showed excellent anti-interference nature. Electro-catalytic oxidation of glucose was demonstrated in real raw unpurified orange juice, this shows the selective electrocatalytic activity of the ZrO2-Cu(I) nanosphere material towards glucose even in the presence of interferrants.

AB This study was intended to produce turanose and resistant starch (RS) using recombinant amylosucrase from Neisseria subflava (NsAS). Turanose production yield maximally reached to 76% of sucrose substrate at 40 degrees C by NsAS treatment. To evaluate turanose as a low-calorie functional sweetener, its hydrolysis pattern was investigated in continuous artificial digestion system. When turanose was consecutively exposed through small intestinal phase, only 8% of disaccharide was hydrolyzed. Structural modification of gelatinized corn or rice starch was carried out by NsAS with sucrose as a glucosyl donor. Non-digestibility of enzyme-modified starches increased to 47.3% maximally through branch-chain elongation, enough for chain-chain association and recrystallization. Obviously, NsAS-modified starches had higher gelatinization peak temperatures than native counterparts, and their paste viscosity was inversely related to their digestibility due to elongated-chain induced retrogradation. These results suggested that NsAS could be a vital biocatalyst candidate in food industry to produce next generation low-calorie carbohydrate food materials.

AB Olive (Olea europaea) is a rich source of valuable bioactive polyphenols, which has attracted widespread interest. In this study, we combined targeted metabolome, Pacbio ISOseq transcriptome, and Illumina RNA-seq transcriptome to investigate the association between polyphenols and gene expression in the developing olive fruits and leaves. A total of 12 main polyphenols were measured, and 122 transcripts of 17 gene families, 101 transcripts of 9 gene families, and 106 transcripts of 6 gene families that encode for enzymes involved in flavonoid, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol biosynthesis were separately identified. Additionally, 232 alternative splicing events of 18 genes related to polyphenol synthesis were analyzed. This is the first time that the third generations of full-length transcriptome technology were used to study the gene expression pattern of olive fruits and leaves. The results of transcriptome combined with targeted metabolome can help us better understand the polyphenol biosynthesis pathways in the olive.

AB Viscosity is a property that exerts great influence on the body of wines, since it affects the sensation of thickness in the mouth. The present study refers to the quantitative correlation of the major components of wine, alcohol, reduced sugar, glycerol and total acidity, in its viscosity. Various model aqueous solutions consisting of these components were prepared and viscosity was measured at 20 degrees C. Each component was studied either alone or in mixtures with the others. Viscosity of white dry wines samples was also measured. From the experimental results, linear multi-dependence equations were derived, which correlate the viscosity with the concentration of the components of the solutions, each of them alone and in combination. Glucose was found to affect viscosity of model aqueous solutions the most, whereas ethanol had the least effect. The knowledge of these factors may have a practical value in optimizing wine's body.

AB Presence of pungent gingerols in ginger oleoresin makes it an ideal natural flavoring candidate for the food industry. The study reports its incorporation for synergistic enhancement of flavor and nutraceutical portfolio of candied mango. The process is systematically optimized at bench-scale for gingerols infusion and subsequent candying treatment in a range of hypo and hypertonic osmotic solutions for critical transport properties. After that, optimization of the drying process and the scale-up study was conducted with a 200 folds increase in the batch size. Collated effects of multistep optimization resulted in 85.6, 76.8, 60.2% retention in beta-carotene, total phenolics, Vitamin C, respectively, along with minor color difference and significant improvement in sensory scores over fresh mango. Mass transfer and quality parameters were comparable in both scales, implying excellent repeatability and scalability of the process. Compared with a similar commercial product, substantial improvement in quality characteristics along with 376.7% reduction in overall processing time was achieved.

AB The impact of fungicides mepanipyrim (Mep) and tetraconazole (Tetra) and their corresponding commercial formulations (Mep-Form and Tetra-Form) on the aroma composition of wines was assessed. Fungicide residues can affect the biotransformation of aroma precursors from grapes and/or the yeast metabolism. The results confirmed that both maximum residue levels (MRL and 2xMRL) of Mep promoted benzyl alcohol and 4-vinylguaiacol contents; while MRL and 2xMRL of Mep-Form promoted benzene derivatives (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and trans-isoeugenol), 2-phenylethanol and y -nonalactone. The addition of Tetra (2xMRL) and Tetra-Form (MRL and 2xMRL) release higher contents of cis-3-hexen-1-ol and ethyl vanillate and affected yeast metabolism related to phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, methionol, capric acid, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl monosuccionate, diethyl succinate and gamma-butyrolactone production. Fungicide residues did not display higher variations in global odour activity values with respect to control wines, although some variations on the "floral", "fruity", "spicy" and "lactic" nuances could be sensed.

AB The aim of a three-year study was to assess the effect of combined biofortification with I and Se in carrot. Four cultivars ('Askona' F-1, 'Samba' F-1, 'Kazan' F-1 and White Satin') were grown in soil fertilized with KI (4 kg I ha(-1)) and Na2SeO4 (0.25 kg Se ha(-1)). The I + Se fertilization did not affect yield but the plants of all cultivars accumulated both elements in leaves and roots. On average, the I and Se contents in roots increased 7.7-times for I and 4.9-times for Se as well as the average I:Se molar ratio was 0.28:1. The contents of both elements in roots remained well below the hazard threshold thus the intake of 100 g of biofortified carrot would substantially cover the RDA for I and Se. The changes in chemical composition of roots (nitrates, phenolic compounds, sugars, carotenoids, macro-, microelements and cadmium) were rather year-dependent than affected by the applied I + Se fertilization.

AB For efficient extraction of amplifiable DNA from edible vegetable oils, we developed a novel DNA extraction approach based on the non-silica-based dipolar nanocomposites. The nanoparticle comprises a hydrophilic polymethyl methacrylate core with abundant capillaries, hydrophilic vesicles decorated with molecules having DNA affinity and a coating hydrophobic polystyrene layer. The nanoparticles are soluble in oil, adsorb the DNA from the aqueous phase and gave a high DNA recovery ratio. All DNA extracts from fully refined vegetable oil soybean, peanut, rapeseed, and cottonseed oils, including their blends, were sufficiently pure to be amplified by real-time PCR targeting the chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate gene (rbcL), therefore, the species of origin and their ratios in mixed vegetable oils blended from two or three oil-species could be determined. These results indicate that the novel DNA isolation and real-time PCR kit is a simple, sensitive and efficient tool for the species identification and traceability in refined vegetable oils.

AB Dietary fiber has several benefits for humans, and the development of healthier rice with an improved dietary fiber composition has attracted increasing amounts of attention. Based on the method of AOAC 2002.02, we developed a simplified method to screen polished rice containing high total dietary fiber (TDF). Mutant cw with a high TDF content could be distinguished easily from R7954 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) by the digestion-resistant phenotype, which is characterized as an almost intact grain after hydrolysis by pepsin, pancreatic alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase. The individuals identified from the F-2 population showed digestion resistance all had TDF content higher than 5%, while those without a digestion-resistant phenotype had TDF content lower than 5%. The phenotype of digestion resistance could be a valuable index for identifying rice with higher TDF content, and the identification of this phenotype provides a simplified, economical and high throughput method for high TDF rice breeding.

AB Since the intake of quercetin glucosides has healthy benefits, the analysis of quercetin glucosides in food is useful. The electrochemical determination of individual quercetin glucosides (quercetin-3-glucoside (Q3G), quercetin-4'-glucoside (Q4'G), and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside (Q34'G)) in food is carried out. For the detection of quercetin glucosides, a long-length carbon nanotube electrode offers attractive properties such as well-defined current peaks, high sensitivity, and high reproducibility. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) demonstrates distinct and specific peak currents: the oxidation peaks at +0.37, +0.45, and +0.78 V are assigned to the catechol group in the B-ring of Q3G, the 3-hydroxy group in the C-ring of Q4'G, and the resorcinol group in the A-ring of both Q4'G and Q34'G, respectively. Currents, which are determined by CV, of individual quercetin glucosides at the peak potential are proportional to the concentrations of onion, apple peel, and tartary buckwheat, which show good agreement with those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography.

AB Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by fungi or molds, which may cause serious harm to human health through polluted cereal foods. In order to measure the typical mycotoxin contaminations in wheat and corn, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method was established using SPR sensor chip that was fabricated based on self-assembled monolayer. The minimum detection limit of aflatoxin Bl, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol were identified as 0.59 ng/mL, 1.27 ng/mL, 7.07 ng/mL and 3.26 ng/mL, respectively. The cross-reactivity for all four mycotoxins were demonstrated to be low. Moreover, the test data were compared with HPLC-MS/MS confirmatory analysis results and good agreement was found between them. In conclusion, the SPR method for simultaneously detecting four mycotoxins has been developed with high sensitivity, good linearity and specificity, which can meet the detection requirements of cereal foods.

AB Ethyl carbamate (EC) and N-nitrosoamines (NAs) are toxic contaminants which can be typically formed in fermented alcoholic beverages. In the present work, a novel approach for simultaneous analysis of EC and NAs in beer and yellow rice wine based on ice-bath assisted sodium hydroxide purification and GC-MS/MS was firstly established. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile-ethyl acetate after addition of internal standards. The extraction solution system was purified by sodium hydroxide solid under ice-bath. After concentration, target analyzes were separated on a HP-INNOWAX quartz capillary column and determined under dynamic multiple reactions monitoring mode of MS/MS. The limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ), matrix effect, recovery and precision of the method were evaluated. Results were linear in the concentration range 2-200 mu g/L for all analyzes of interest, with regression coefficients higher than 0.999. LODs and LOQs were in the ranges of 0.1-0.5 mu g/kg and 0.5-1.5 mu g/kg, respectively. The mean recoveries M three spiked levels were between 81.5% and 121.0%. The intra- and inter-day precisions were in the ranges of 2.2-9.4% and 1.6-7.9%, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to determine thirteen targets in commercial beer and yellow rice wine. EC was detected in all beers and yellow rice wines with the concentrations ranging from 1.18 to 22.90 mu g/ L. Results indicated wide EC contamination and confirmed its urgency for monitoring EC in fermented alcoholic beverages.

AB In this study, lecithin obtained from acid degumming of canola oil was fractionated with absolute ethanol. The lipid composition and emulsifying properties of the resulting fractions were investigated. The results showed that phosphatidylcholine and lyso-phosphatidylcholine were greatly enriched in the ethanol soluble fraction (ESF), accounting for 43.79% and 13.21% of ESF, respectively. Phosphatidylinositol, lyso-phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid, as a group, were enriched in the ethanol insoluble fraction (EIF), accounting for 37.4% of EIF. ESF and EIF promoted oil/water (o/w) emulsions as stable as the parent canola lecithin. EIF was not better than the parent lecithin as w/o emulsifier. This information is critical for evaluating the potential utilization of these canola lecithin fractions as emulsifiers or sources of specific phospholipid.

AB To investigate the effect of reduced glutathione (GSH) on the quality characteristics of apple wine, 10, 20 and 30 mg/L of GSH were added to apple juice before alcoholic fermentation. Meanwhile, apple wine fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae which had been pre-incubated with GSH (100 mg/L) was another experimental group. Mono-phenols, GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were determined by HPLC. Aroma compounds were analysed by GC-MS. Further, E-nose was applied to monitor the odor. After fermentation, GSH content was the same in all of the samples. However, for the apple wine with GSH addition, GSSG content increased significantly. Notably, GSH could reduce the color index, protect chlorogenic acid and phloretin, decrease the content of epicatechin and catechin as well as change the profile of aroma compounds (higher levels of 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl benzoate, linalool, etc.). GSH may be used for flavor enhancement and quality improvement of apple wine.

AB In stock farming, illegal use of antipsychotics has caused the food safety problem. This paper presents for the first time, a mull-residues method for the simultaneous enantioselective determination of seven antipsychotics in pork, beef and lamb muscles. The behaviors of Chiralpak AGP toward changes in pH and organic modifier in mobile phase were studied, and all analytes were rapidly separated within 30 min. The calibration curves of all enantiomers were linear in the range of 1-250 ng g(-1), with correlation coefficient above 0.9931. The recoveries of the targeted compounds were higher than 82.1%, with repeatability and intermediate precision lower than 18.2% and 17.4%, respectively. In three matrices, the limit of detection and limit of quantification ranged from 0.20 to 0.65 ng g(-1) and from 0.40 to 1.00 ng g(-1), respectively. The proposed method can be used to provide additional information for the reliable risk assessment of chiral antipsychotics.

AB The human L-DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) is a gene that has been in the center of research attention in many laboratories the last decades, due to its major implication in various disorders, including many types of cancer. In the current work, we used in-house developed RACE and high-throughput sequencing approaches, in order to detect and identify novel DDC transcripts. Bioinformatic analysis revealed new alternative splicing events that support the existence of novel DDC transcripts. As a result, a total of 14 DDC splice variants were identified and their expression profile was investigated in a wide panel of human cancer cell lines. From all 14 novel DDC transcripts that were identified, 9 transcripts are predicted to encode new protein isoforms, while the remaining 5 are nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) candidates. Our results demonstrate that the human DDC gene undergoes complex processing leading to the figuration of multiple mRNA isoforms in cancer cells.

AB Bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most frequent malignancy and the thirteenth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. CDKN1A-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) is involved in the development of various cancers, while its role in BC remains unclear. In this study, we found that CIZ1 was up-regulated in BC tissues and cells. Knockdown of CIZ1 suppressed the proliferation and growth of T24 and 5637 cells. Apoptosis and caspase 3/7 activity were enhanced after CIZ1 silencing in both cells. At the molecular level, PCNA, Ki67, HIF-1 alpha, survivin, CCND1 and CCNB1 were down-regulated, and caspase-3, p53, p21, caspase-9 were up-regulated by CIZ1 knockdown. This suggested that silencing of CIZ1 suppressed BC cell proliferation through inducing apoptosis and reducing cell cycle progression. Our study suggests that targeting CIZ1 maybe a potential therapeutic strategy for BC.

AB Background: The F + 1 (rs511898 G > A) polymorphism in a disintegrin and metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) gene has been implicated in susceptibility of chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD). However, a series of studies have reported inconclusive. The aim of this study is to explore the association between the F + 1 (rs511898) of ADAM33 gene and COPD susceptibility by using the method of meta-analysis.
   Method: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI), Chongqing VIP database, Wanfang and China Biology Medicine (CBM) were searched comprehensively to obtain the related cohort studies and case-control studies. The included studies were selected according to inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratios were performed respectively for allele comparison, additive model, dominant genetic model and recessive genetic model. The association between the F + 1 polymorphism of ADAM33 gene and COPD susceptibility was measured by OR and 95%CI by STATA 12.0. The subgroup analysis was distinguished according to the ethnicity. The publication bias was tested by funnel plots and Egger's linear regression method.
   Results: Twelve case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis, which study is comprised of 6935 participants (2454 patients with COPD and 4481 controls). The meta results showed significant association between ADAM33 F + 1 polymorphism and COPD susceptibility in allele model OR (total) = 1.16(95% CI 1.04-1.30, P = 0.007), OR Asian = 1.14(95% CI 1.02-1.27, P = 0.022), additive model OR total = 1.27 (95% CI 1.13-1.43, P = 0.000), OR Asian = 1.25 (95% CI 1.08-1.45, P = 0.003), recessive model OR (total) = 1.49 (95% CI 1.16-1.91, P = 0.002), OR (Asian) = 1.56(95% CI 1.09-2.22, p = 0.014), but not significant in Caucasians.
   Conclusion: The ADAM33 F + 1 mutant gene A may increase the risk of COPD among the Asian population, while it may not associate with the European population.

AB Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), a frequent cause of obstructive azoospermia and male infertility in Chinese, is mainly due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This study aim to explore the promoter region of CFTR gene in CBAVD patients and study the mutations by functional analysis, and to discuss the significance of mutation testing in this area. We performed screening analysis on 65 CBAVD patients and 50 controls to detect mutations in the CFTR gene, and studied the functions of promoter mutations using reporter gene constructs, transient transfection techniques and subsequent assessment of transcriptional activity and expression levels. Mutations c. - 195C > A and c. - 34C > Tin the promoter region of the CFTR gene were detected in 4 of our Chinese CBAVD patients, one of which was novel (c. - 195C > A) and located in the conservative area, as well as the binding site of SP1 transcription factor through the prediction of bioinformatics analysis. By reverse transcription qPCR assay and luciferase assay, we validated it as a functional disease-causing variant that down-regulates the CFTR gene expression, and this effect was related to the amount of transcription factors. This study was the first to explore the promoter region of the CFTR gene in Chinese, and we believe that mutations in this region are associated with Chinese CBAVD patients. We also suggest a systematic strategy for genotyping Chinese CBAVD couples, which should help in developing reproductive counseling.

AB Objective: Exosomes have been described as a messenger between cells' communication and contain various information (lipids, proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs, LncRNAs). It has been proved that Linc-ROR was enriched in exosomes released by HepG2 cells. Our aim was to investigate whether exosomes released by HepG2 cells could affect the biological behaviors of LO2 cells and whether Linc-ROR played an important role in this process.
   Methods: Exosomes-derived from HepG2 cells were isolated and characterized. Real-time PCR assessed expression level of Linc-ROR in specimens of cancerous tissues and carcinoma-adjacent tissues. The Linc-ROR expression level in HepG2, Huh7, SMMC-7721, Bel-7402, LO2 cells and exosomes was detected by real-time PCR. Knockdown the expression of Linc-ROR in HepG2 by using effective siRNA. Cell counting method was used to test LO2 cells proliferative activities. Flow cytometry was performed to quantify the apoptosis rates of LO2 cells cocultured with exosomes. The expression levels of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, P53 and CD133 were assessed by western blot.
   Results: Linc-ROR was enriched in exosomes released by HepG2 cells. Exosomes derived from HepG2 cells promoted the proliferation and suppressed the apoptosis of LO2 cells suffering nutrient deficiency. Knockdown the expression of Linc-ROR in HepG2 or LO2 cells could significantly impaired the exosomes' effects on LO2 cells. In addition, the long-term coculture with exosomes would obviously change the biological behaviors of LO2 cells.
   Conclusions: Our experiments indicated the HepG2 cells could transfer its Linc-ROR to the LO2 cells via exosomes, then influenced the recipient cells.

AB Trigeminal neuropathic pain is seen as a huge clinical challenge. Although numerous drugs have been developed to treat the condition, some patients have shown intolerance to the drugs and thus continue to suffer. In the present study, a rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain was established using incorrectly positioned dental implants, which had various manifestations that were similar to human trigeminal neuropathic pain. Using this model, we investigated the differential regulation of JAK2 and PTEN. Firstly, we examined the expression of JAK2 and PTEN in the medullary dorsal horn. After inhibiting JAK2/PTEN, we evaluated nociception-related behavioral alterations. The rat models were established by replacing the left lower second molar with a mini dental implant. Immunoblot assay and immunofluorescence experiments indicated high expression of JAK2 and PTEN in medullary dorsal horn after the nerve injury, which attained plateau levels on post-operative day (POD) 5-10 and 10-20. Administration of adenovirus-shRNA-JAK2 on POD 1 reduced mechanical allodynia and downstream STAT activation. Meanwhile, the administration of adenovirus-shRNA-PTEN on POD 1 attenuated mechanical allodynia while upregulating AKT. In addition to postoperative JAK2 and PTEN activation, dexmedetomidine treatment (10 mg/kg) also modulated the downstream sensors of these signaling molecules. These data suggest that JAK2 and PTEN are pivotal to the development of trigeminal neuropathic pain, and that JAK2 and PTEN suppression alleviates the neuropathic pain.

AB RNA interference (RNAi) has extensive potential to revolutionize every aspect of clinical application in biomedical research. One of the promising tools is the Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules within a cellular component. Principally, siRNA mediated innovative advances are increasing rapidly in support of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic purposes. Conversely, it has some delivery challenges to the site of action within the cells of a target organ, due to the progress of nucleic acids engineering and advance material science research contributing to the exceptional organ-specific targeted therapy. This siRNA based therapeutic technique definitely favors a unique and effective prospect to cancer patients. Herein, the significant drive also takes to review and summarize the major organ specific targets of diverse siRNAs based gene silencing mechanism. This machinery promisingly served as the inhibitor components for cancer development in the human model. Furthermore, the focus is also given to current applications on siRNA based quantifiable therapy leading to the silencing of cancer related gene expression in a sequence dependent and selective manner for cancer treatment. That might be a potent tool against the traditional chemotherapy techniques. Therefore, the siRNA mediated cancer gene therapy definitely require sharp attention like future weapons in opposition to cancer by the method of non-invasive siRNA delivery and effective gene silencing approaches.

AB Background: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) contain a series of critical enzymes regulating proliferation or apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment. Data from publications about the correlation between Glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) gene 313 A/G (rs1695) polymorphism and bladder caner (BCa) remained controversial. To explore the exact correlation between this polymorphism and the development of BCa, we carried out this study.
   Materials and methods: All relevant publications from Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PMC, Embase and Wanfang databases (from building to March 30th, 2019) were retrieved. This meta-analysis was carried out by utilizing STATA software.
   Results: 34 case-control studies with 15,704 participants recruiting 7236 BCa patients and 8468 healthy controls were ultimately analyzed in our study. The pooling results indicated that GSTP1 gene 313 A/G (rs1695) polymorphism was obviously related to BCa (GG vs AA: OR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.04-1.69). Similar results were found in the association between this polymorphism and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) risk (GG vs AA: OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.18-3.23). Furthermore, we revealed an increased association between the GG genotype and BCa in Asians (GG vs AA: OR = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.09-3.79), while no correlation was revealed in Caucasians. As to different tumor grades or stages, this polymorphism was considered to elevate low grade BCa development and null results were uncovered with high grade BCa.
   Conclusion: This study indicated that GSTP1 gene 313 A/G (rs1695) polymorphism increased the susceptibility to BCa, particularly to TCC. In addition, this study found that this polymorphism was obviously related to elevated BCa risk in Asian population and also increased low grade BCa risk. Results based on the five genetic models indicated that GSTP1 G-allele might be the susceptibility gene and GG genotype might be the susceptibility genotype.

AB Kinesin-14 motor es-kifc1 is highly expressed in the male reproductive system of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (E. sinensis). In addition to acrosomal formation, es-KIFC1 also tightly surrounds the nucleus and its specific mechanism remains unknown. During spermatogenesis, sperm nucleus dents into a cup-shaped structure with several radial arms and completed the nuclear decondensation. In this study, the spatial expression pattern of es-KIFC1 indicates a potential function in nuclear formation with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on N-terminal domain which is crucial for the translocation of es-KIFC1 into the nucleus. The Motor domain is associated with microtubule modulation and the Golgi vesicles positioning. Furthermore, the expression level of es-KIFC1 is not only related to the seasonal variation of crustacean development, but also associates with mature sperm storage. The double strand RNA (dsRNA) mediated RNA interference manifests that the cup-shaped sperm nucleus is remarkably malformed and even separates the chromatin throughout the nuclei at the last stage of spermiogenesis. Besides, the sperm nucleus almost disperses its structure and separates the chromatin into several segments throughout the nucleus showing an asymmetrical performance without cytoskeleton. In summary, these results indicate the importance of es-KIFC1 in microtubule positioning and the maintenance of the mature sperm nuclei.

AB Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered as a complex disorder. The etiology of PCOS is multifactorial with a clear genetic component. Several human studies have been conducted to explore the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and PCOS susceptibility, but these provide inconsistent results and the combined result of A1298C remains vacant. Our aim is to examine whether MTHFR C677T or A1298C are related to PCOS.
   Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphisms and PCOS. Electronic database was searched, including PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Web of science and the reference lists of relevant articles for studies published from the inception to June 17, 2019. The included studies were assessed in the following genetic model: dominant model, recessive model, allelic model, homozygote model, Heterozygote model.
   Results: 19 articles (21 studies) with 2383 patients of PCOS and 2492 controls were considered for MTHFR C677T, and 7 articles (8 studies) were employed for MTHFT A1298C in this meta-analysis. For MTHFR C677T and Al 298C, significant association with PCOS was observed in the combined population and Asian population. None of the contrasts of genetic model yielded a significant finding in the Caucasian population.
   Conclusion: Our result based on previously published studies demonstrated that T allele in MTHFR C677T polymorphism might be a genetic risk factor for PCOS, especially in the Asian population. MTHFR A1298C might be contribute to PCOS susceptibility. More efforts and further studies with larger sample size will be required to validate the risk of PCOS.

ID SHAPLEY VALUE; EFFICIENCY
AB Game theory provides valuable tools to examine expert multi-agent systems. In a cooperative game, collaboration among agents leads to better outcomes. The most important solution for such games is the Shapley value, that coincides with the expected marginal contribution assuming equiprobability. This assumption is not plausible when externalities are present in an expert system. Generalizing the concept of marginal contributions, we propose a new family of Shapley values for situations with externalities. The properties of the Shapley value offer a rationale for its application. This family of values is characterized by extensions of Shapley's axioms: efficiency, additivity, symmetry, and the null player property. The first three axioms have widely accepted generalizations to the framework of games with externalities. However, different concepts of null players have been proposed in the literature and we contribute to this debate with a new one. The null player property that we use is weaker than the others. Finally, we present one particular value of the family, new in the literature, and characterize it by two additional properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION
AB Over the course of research on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, few modifications have been made to the fully connected layers at the ends of the networks. In image classification, these neural network layers are responsible for creating the final classification results based on the output of the last layer of high-level image filters. Before the breakthrough of CNNs, these image filters were handcrafted, and any classification algorithm could be applied to their output. Because neural networks use gradient descent to learn their weights subject to the classification error, fully connected neural networks are a natural choice for CNNs. But a question arises: Are fully connected layers in a CNN superior to other classification algorithms? In this work, we benchmark different classification algorithms on CNNs by removing the existing fully connected classifiers. Thus, the flattened output from the last convolutional layer is used as the input for multiple benchmark classification algorithms. To ensure the generalisability of the findings, numerous CNNs are trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a subset of ILSVRC-2012 with 100 classes. The experimental results reveal that multiple classification algorithms, namely logistic regression, support vector machines, eXtreme gradient boosting, random forests and K-nearest neighbours, are capable of outperforming fully connected neural networks. Furthermore, the superiority of a particular classification algorithm depends on the underlying CNN structure and the nature of the classification problem. For classification problems with many classes or for CNNs that produce many high-level image features, other classification algorithms are likely to perform better than fully connected neural networks. It follows that it is advisable to benchmark multiple classification algorithms on high-level image features produced from the CNN layers to improve classification performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is no reliable guidance available in literature so far for the selection of a suitable technique for denoising Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The performance of edge-preserving denoising schemes like Nonlocal Means, Bilateral, Total Variation, Anisotropic Diffusion, Kuwahara, wavelet denoising, Linear Minimum Mean Square Error, Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus and Beltrami filters on MR images are evaluated and compared in this paper. Performance evaluation is done on real-time MR Images, Shepp-Logan Phantom images and simulated MR images. Image Quality Analysis indices used for the evaluation are Structural Similarity Index Metric, Noise Quality Measure, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Edge Preservation Index, MetricQ Anisotropic Quality Index, Blind Reference Image Quality Evaluator and computational time. It has been observed that the performance of each filter is completely different on Shepp-Logan, simulated MR and real-time MR images. It is critically sensitive to the strength of noise also. No filter which can offer good performance equally on Phantom, simulated MR image and real-time MR images, is available in the literature. Values of the objective indices are not in concordance with subjective quality ratings. Filter designs optimized on Phantom or simulated MR using maximum PSNR between denoised and ground-truth images as an objective function (minimum error sense in general) do not perform well on real-time MRI.

AB Stock market prediction is one of the most challenging problems which has been distressing both researchers and financial analysts for more than half a century. To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index. As a proof of real effectiveness of our approach, we exploit the predictions to run a high frequency trading simulation reaching more than 80% of annualized return. This project represents a step forward to combine technical and fundamental analysis and provides a starting point for developing new trading strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent computer systems aim to help humans in making decisions. Many practical decision-making problems are classification problems in their nature, but standard classification algorithms often not applicable since they assume balanced distribution of classes and constant misclassification costs. From this point of view, algorithms that consider the cost of decisions are essential since they are more consistent with the requirements of real life. These algorithms generate decisions that directly optimize parameters valuable for business, for example, the costs savings. But despite on practical value of cost-sensitive algorithms, the little number of works study this problem concentrating mainly on the case when the cost of a classifier error is constant and does not depend on a specific example. However, many real-world classification tasks are example-dependent cost-sensitive (ECS), where the costs of misclassification vary between examples and not only within classes. Existing methods of ECS learning include just modifications of the simplest models of machine learning (naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree). These models produce promising results, but there is a need for further improvement in performance that can be achieved by using gradient-based ensemble methods. To break this gap, we present the ECS generalization of AdaBoost. We study three models which differ by the ways to introduce cost into the loss function: inside the exponent, outside the exponent, and both inside and outside the exponent. The results of the experiments on three synthetic and two real datasets (bank marketing and insurance fraud) show that example-dependent cost-sensitive modifications of AdaBoost outperform other known models. Empirical results also show that critical factors influencing the choice of the model are not only the distribution of features, which is typical for cost-insensitive and class-dependent cost-sensitive problems but also the distribution of costs. Next, since the outputs of AdaBoost are not well calibrated posterior probabilities, we check three approaches to calibration of classifier scores: Platt scaling, isotonic regression, and ROC modification. The results show that calibration not only significantly improves the performance of specific ECS models but allows making better capabilities of original AdaBoost. Obtained results provide new insight regarding the behavior of the cost-sensitive model from a theoretical point of view and prove that the presented approach can significantly improve the practical design of intelligent systems.

AB We propose a novel deep multibranch and multitask neural network for artist, style, and genre painting categorization. The multibranch approach allows us to exploit at the same time the coarse layout of the painting and the fine-grained structures by using painting crops at different resolutions that are wisely extracted using a Spatial Transformer Network trained to identify the most discriminative subregions of paintings. The effectiveness of the proposed network is proved in experiments that are performed on a new dataset originally sourced from wikiart.org and hosted by Kaggle, and made suitable for artist, style and genre multitask learning. The dataset here proposed and made available for research is named MultitaskPainting100k, and is composed by 100K paintings, 1508 artists, 125 styles and 41 genres annotated by human experts. Among the different variants of the proposed network, the best method achieves accuracy levels of 56.5%, 57.2%, and 63.6% on the MultitaskPainting100k dataset for the tasks of artist, style and genre prediction respectively.

AB Background: Few proposed gene biomarkers have been satisfactory in clinical applications. That is mainly due to the small studies sample size. Because of the batch effect, different gene-expression studies cannot be merged directly. Many integrative methods have attempted to integrate various datasets to eliminate the batch effect while keeping biological information intact. However, due to the complexity of the batch effect, it cannot be eliminated, and these methods may even add new systematic errors to the data, further complicating integrated data. Therefore, direct analysis of the merged data may cause some issues. In this paper, we suggest a novel integrative analysis framework for merged gene-expression data. The framework adopts the self-paced learning. This method allows samples to be automatically added into the training period, from simple to intricate, in a purely self-paced way. Moreover, the framework includes a new feature selection method, the SCAD-Net regularization method, a combination of SCAD and network-based penalties to integrates the biological network knowledge. The simulation shows that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark with more accurate marker identification. The analysis of seven large NSCLC gene expression datasets shows that the proposed method not only results in higher accuracies, but also identifies potential therapeutic markers and pathways in NSCLC. In conclusion, we provide a new and efficient integrative analysis system of gene expression, for the search for new reliable diagnosis or targeted therapy biomarker. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forming combinations of comoving assets is a critical step in pairs trading that has only been addressed either manually or through enumerative procedures. Both approaches fail in the multivariate case and do not consider conflicting objectives in the problem structure. This paper is the first attempt to address these novel problems by presenting an intelligent system that recommends profitable pair combinations through a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation and solving the NP-Hard optimization problem with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) containing problem specific modifications. Combinations of assets are optimized on two conflicting objectives of risk (mean-reversion) and return (spread variance) to form sets of profitable multivariate pairs trading opportunities. Promising results support the superiority of multi-objective and multivariate pairs trading strategies over their traditional single objective and univariate counterparts. The findings should motivate new directions for pairs trading research and also expand the applications of evolutionary multi-objective optimization for hard problems in finance and other industries.

AB Twitter is one of the most popular social platforms. It has changed the way of communication and information dissemination through its real-time messaging mechanism. Recently, it has been used by researchers and industries as a new source of data for various intelligent systems, such as tweet sentiment analysis and recommendation systems, which require high data quality. However, due to its flexibility and popularity, Twitter has become the main target for spamming activities such as phishing legitimate users or spreading malicious software, which introduces new security issues and waste resources. Therefore, researchers have developed various machine-learning algorithms to reveal Twitter spam. However, as spammers have become smarter and more crafty, the characteristics of the spam tweets are varying over time making these methods inefficient to detect new spammers tricks and strategies. In addition, some of the employed methods (e.g. blacklisting) or spammer features (e.g. graph-based features) are extremely time-consuming, which hinders the ability to detect spammer activities in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a framework to deal with the volatility of the spam contents and new spamming patterns, called the spam drift. The framework combines the strength of unsupervised machine learning approach, which learns from unlabeled tweets, to retrain a real-time supervised tweet-level spam detection model in a batch mode. A set of experiments on a large-scale data set show the effectiveness of the proposed online unsupervised method in adaptively discovers and learns the patterns of new spam activities and achieve stable recall values reaching more than 95%. Although the average spam precision of our method is around 60%, the high spam recall values show the ability of our proposed method in reducing spam drift problems compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

AB In general, a practical online recommendation system does not rely on only one algorithm but adopts different types of algorithms to predict user preferences. Although most of similarity measures can rapidly calculate the similarity on the basis of co-rated items, their prediction accuracy is not satisfactory in the case of sparse datasets. Making full use of all the rating information can effectively improve the recommendation quality, but it reduces the system efficiency because all the ratings need to be calculated. To recommend items for target users rapidly and accurately, this paper designs a hybrid item similarity model that achieves a trade-off between prediction accuracy and efficiency by combining the advantages of the two above-mentioned methods. First, we introduce an adjusted Google similarity to rapidly and precisely calculate the item similarity in the condition of enough co-rated items. Subsequently, an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) based Kullback-Leibler (KL) similarity is presented from the perspective of user preference probability to effectively compute the item similarity in the condition of rare co-rated items. Finally, the two proposed schemes are integrated by an adjusted variable to comprehensively evaluate the similarity values when the number of co-rated items lies in a certain range of value. The proposed model is implemented and tested on some benchmark datasets with different thresholds of co-rated items. The experimental results indication that the proposed system has a favorable efficiency and guarantees the quality of recommendations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In real-life classification problems, prior information about the problem and expert knowledge about the domain are often used to obtain reliable and consistent solutions. This is especially true in fields where the data is ambiguous, such as text, in which the same words can be used in seemingly similar texts, but have a different meaning. A promising avenue for text classification is machine learning, which has been shown to perform well in a variety of applications including query classification and sentiment analysis. Many of the proposed approaches rely on the bag-of-words representation, which loses the information about the structure of the text. In this paper, we propose a Customised Grammar Framework for text classification, which exploits domain-related information and a new way to represent text as a series of syntactic categories forming syntactic patterns. The framework employs a formal grammar approach for transforming the text into the syntactic patterns representation. We applied the framework for the query classification problem and our results show that our approach outperforms previous ones in terms of classification performance.

AB As one of the most important issues in the field of mobile robotics, self-localization allows a mobile robot to identify and keep track of its own position and orientation as the robot moves through the environment. In this work, a hybrid localization approach based on the particle filter and particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented, focusing on the localization tasks when an a priori environment map is available. This results an accurate and robust particle filter based localization algorithm that is able to work in symmetrical environments. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated for indoor robot localization and compared with two benchmark algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves robust and accurate positioning results in indoor environments, requiring fewer particles than the benchmark methods. This advance could be integrated in a wide range of mobile robot systems, helping to reduce the computational cost and improve the navigation efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic texture analysis has been the focus of intensive research in recent years. Thus, this paper presents an innovative and highly discriminative dynamic texture analysis method, whose signature is composed of the weights of the output layer of a randomized neural network after a training procedure. This training is performed by using the pixels of slices of each orthogonal plane of the video (XY, YT, and XT) as input feature vectors and corresponding output labels. The obtained video signature provided an accuracy of 97.05%, 98.54%, 97.74% and 96.51% on the UCLA-50 classes, UCLA-9 classes, UCLA-8 classes and Dyntex++, respectively. These results, when compared to other dynamic texture analysis methods, demonstrate that our descriptors are very effective and that our proposed approach can contribute significantly to the field of dynamic texture analysis.

ID BEE COLONY ALGORITHM; COVERING PROBLEM
AB The set-union knapsack problem (SUKP) is a generalization of the standard 0-1 knapsack problem. It is NP-hard, and has several industrial applications. Several approximation and heuristic approaches have been previously presented for solving the SUKP. However, the solution quality still needs to be enhanced. This work develops a hybrid binary particle swarm optimization with tabu search (HBPSO/TS) to solve the SUKP. First, an adaptive penalty function is utilized to evaluate the quality of solutions during the search. This method endeavours to explore the boundary of the feasible solution space. Next, based on the characteristics of the SUKP, a novel position updating procedure is designed. The newly generated solutions obtain the good structures of previously found solutions. Then, a tabu based mutation procedure is introduced to lead the search to enter into new hopeful regions. Finally, we design a tabu search procedure to improve the exploitation ability. Furthermore, a gain updating strategy is employed to reduce the solution time. The HBPSO/TS is tested on three sets of 30 benchmark instances, and comparisons with current state-of-the-art algorithms are performed. Experimental results show that HBPSO/TS performs much better than the other algorithms in terms of solution quality. Moreover, HBPSO/TS improves new best results at 28 out of the 30 instances. The impact of the main parts of the HBPSO/TS is also experimentally investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reinforcement learning paradigm has been shown to be an effective approach in solving the k-server problem. However, this approach is based on the Q-learning algorithm, being subjected to the curse of dimensionality problem, since the action-value function (Q-function) grows exponentially with the increase in the number of states and actions. In this work, a new algorithm based on the deep reinforcement learning paradigm is proposed. For this, the Q-function is defined by a multilayer perceptron neural network that extracts the information of the environment from images that encode the dynamics of the problem. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated in a case study in which different nodes and servers problem configurations are considered. The agents behavior is analyzed during the training phase and its efficiency is evaluated from performance tests that quantify the quality of the generated server displacement policies. The results obtained provide a new algorithm promising view as an alternative solution to the k-server problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Many approaches have been proposed to recognize clusters in subspaces. However, their performance is highly sensitive to input parameter values. The purpose and expected ranges of these parameters may not available to a non-expert user. The parameter setting producing optimal results can only be known after repeated execution of the clustering process every time with a different set, which is very time consuming. Most of the existing algorithms show high runtimes due to excessive data scans. In this work, we propose a subspace clustering technique that estimates the distance threshold parameter automatically from the data for each attribute and works on the basis of single linkage clustering, in bottom up, greedy fashion. The experimental results show that, the algorithm produces optimal results without accepting any input from the user, achieves up to 10 times better runtime and improved accuracy in a single run without requiring any tuning of parameter values.

AB Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid heart rhythm that begins in the lower chambers of the heart. When it happens continuously, this may result in life-threatening cardiac arrest. In this paper, we apply deep learning techniques to tackle the problem of the physiological signal classification of ventricular tachycardia, since deep learning techniques can attain outstanding performance in many medical applications. Nevertheless, human engineers are required to manually design deep neural networks to handle different tasks. This can be challenging because of many possible deep neural network structures. Therefore, a method, called ADAG-DNE, is presented to automatically design deep neural network structures using deep neuroevolution. Our approach defines a set of structures using probabilistic grammar and searches for best network structures using Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Programming. ADAG-DNE takes advantages of the probabilistic dependencies found among the structures of networks. When applying ADAG-DNE to the classification problem, our discovered model achieves better accuracy than AlexNet, ResNet, and seven non-neural network classifiers. It also uses about 2% of parameters of AlexNet, which means the inference can be made quickly. To summarize, our method evolves a deep neural network, which can be implemented in expert systems. The deep neural network achieves high accuracy. Moreover, it is simpler than existing deep neural networks. Thus, computational efficiency and diagnosis accuracy of the expert system can be improved.

AB Recommender systems aim at predicting users' preferences based on abundant information, such as user ratings, demographics, and reviews. Although reviews are sparser than ratings, they provide more detailed and reliable information about users' true preferences. Currently, reviews are often used to improve the explainability of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose the sentiment based matrix factorization with reliability (SBMF+R) algorithm to leverage reviews for prediction. First, we develop a sentiment analysis approach using a new star-based dictionary construction technique to obtain the sentiment score. Second, we design a user reliability measure that combines user consistency and the feedback on reviews. Third, we incorporate the ratings, reviews, and feedback into a probabilistic matrix factorization framework for prediction. Experiments on eight Amazon datasets demonstrated that SBMF+R is more accurate than state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous methods have been developed in the context of expert and intelligent systems for structural health monitoring (SHM) with wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, these techniques have been proven to be efficient when dealing with continuous signals, and the applicability of such expert systems with discrete noisy signals has not yet been explored. This study presents an intelligent data mining methodology as part of an expert system developed for SHM with noisy and delayed signals, which are generated by a through-substrate self-powered sensor network. The noted sensor network has been demonstrated as an effective means for minimizing energy consumption in WSNs for SHM. Experimental vibration tests were conducted on a cantilever plate to evaluate the developed expert system for SHM. The proposed data mining method is based on the integration of pattern recognition, an innovative probabilistic approach, and machine learning. The novelty of the proposed system for SHM with data interpretation methodology lies in the integration of the noted intelligent techniques on discrete, binary, noisy, and delayed patterns of signals collected from self-powered sensing technology in the application to a practical engineering problem, i.e., data-driven energy-efficient SHM. Results confirm that the proposed data mining method employing a probabilistic approach can be effectively used to reconstruct delayed and missing signals, thereby addressing the important issue of energy availability for intelligent SHM systems being used for damage identification in civil and aerospace structures. The applicability and effectiveness of the expert system with the data mining approach in detecting damage with noisy signals was demonstrated for plate-like structures with an accuracy of 97%. The present study successfully contributes to advance data mining and signal processing techniques in the SHM domain, indicating a practical application of expert and intelligent systems applied to damage detection in SHM platforms. Findings from this research pave a way for development of the data analysis techniques that can be employed for interpreting noisy and incomplete signals collected from various expert systems such as those being used in intelligent infrastructure monitoring systems and smart cities.

AB This research introduces the Recursive General Regression Neural Network Oracle (R-GRNN Oracle) and is demonstrated on several binary classification datasets. The traditional GRNN Oracle classifier (Masters et al., 1998) combines the predictive powers of several machine learning classifiers by weighing the amount of error each classifier has on the final predictions. Each classifier is assigned a weight based on the percentage of errors it contributes to the final predictions as the classifiers evaluate the dataset. The proposed R-GRNN Oracle is an enhancement to the GRNN Oracle in which the proposed algorithm consists of an oracle within an oracle - where the inner oracle acts as a classifier with its own predictions and error contribution. By combining the inner oracle with other classifiers, the R-GRNN Oracle produces superior results. The classifiers considered in this study are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several datasets were used, with the primary one being the publicly available Spambase dataset. The predictions of SVM, MLP, KNN, and RF were used to create the first GRNN Oracle, which was then enhanced with the high performances of SVM and RF to create the second oracle, the R-GRNN Oracle. The combined recursive model was 93.24% accurate using 10-fold cross validation, higher than the 91.94% of the inner GRNN Oracle and the 91.29% achieved by RF, the highest performance by a stand-alone classifier. The R-GRNN Oracle was not only the most accurate, but it also had the highest AUC, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and Fl-score (97.99%, 91.86%, 94.40%, 93.28%, and 92.57%, respectively). The research contribution of this paper is introducing the concept of recursion (a concept not fully explored in machine learning models and applications) and testing this structure's ability on further enhancing the performance of the traditional oracle. The recursive model has also been applied to several other datasets: The Human Resources, Bank Marketing, and Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) datasets. The results of these implementations are summarized in this paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Cross-lingual semantic spaces
AB The ability to represent the meaning of words is one of the core parts of natural language understanding (NLU), with applications ranging across machine translation, summarization, question answering, information retrieval, etc. The need for reasoning in multilingual contexts and transferring knowledge in cross-lingual systems has given rise to cross-lingual semantic spaces, which learn representations of words across different languages.
   With growing attention to cross-lingual representations, it has became crucial to investigate proper evaluation schemes. The word-analogy-based evaluation has been one of the most common tools to evaluate linguistic relationships (such as male-female relationships or verb tenses) encoded in monolingual meaning representations. In this paper, we go beyond monolingual representations and generalize the word analogy task across languages to provide a new intrinsic evaluation tool for cross-lingual semantic spaces. Our approach allows examining cross-lingual projections and their impact on different aspects of meaning. It helps to discover potential weaknesses or advantages of cross-lingual methods before they are incorporated into different intelligent systems.
   We experiment with six languages within different language families, including English, German, Spanish, Italian, Czech, and Croatian. State-of-the-art monolingual semantic spaces are transformed into a shared space using dictionaries of word translations. We compare several linear transformations and rank them for experiments with monolingual (no transformation), bilingual (one semantic space is transformed to another), and multilingual (all semantic spaces are transformed onto English space) versions of semantic spaces. We show that tested linear transformations preserve relationships between words (word analogies) and lead to impressive results. We achieve average accuracy of 51.1%, 43.1%, and 38.2% for monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual semantic spaces, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integer programming models for community detection in relational networks have diverse applications in different fields. From making our lives easier by improving search engine optimization to saving our lives by aiding in threat detection and disaster management, researches in this niche have added value to human experience and knowledge. Besides the community structure, the influential nodes or members in a complex network are highly effective at diffusing information quickly to others in the community. Prior research dealing with the use of optimization models for clustering networks has independently focused on detecting communities. In this research, we propose a new integer linear programming model to detect community structure in real-life networks and also identify the most influential node within each community. We validate the proposed model by testing it on a well-established community network. Further, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with the existing best performing optimization model as well as three heuristic approaches for community detection. The experimental results indicate that in most cases the proposed integer programming model performs better than the existing optimization model with respect to modularity, Silhouette coefficient and computational time. Besides, our model yields superior Silhouette and competitive modularity values compared to the heuristic approaches in many cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unsupervised near-duplicate detection has many practical applications ranging from social media analysis and web-scale retrieval, to digital image forensics. It entails running a threshold-limited query on a set of descriptors extracted from the images, with the goal of identifying all possible near-duplicates, while limiting the false positives due to visually similar images. Since the rate of false alarms grows with the dataset size, a very high specificity is thus required, up to 1-10(-9) for realistic use cases; this important requirement, however, is often overlooked in literature. In recent years, descriptors based on deep convolutional neural networks have matched or surpassed traditional feature extraction methods in content-based image retrieval tasks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to establish the performance range of deep learning-based descriptors for unsupervised near-duplicate detection on a range of datasets, encompassing a broad spectrum of near-duplicate definitions. We leverage both established and new benchmarks, such as the Mir-Flick Near-Duplicate (MFND) dataset, in which a known ground truth is provided for all possible pairs over a general, large scale image collection. To compare the specificity of different descriptors, we reduce the problem of unsupervised detection to that of binary classification of near-duplicate vs. not-near-duplicate images. The latter can be conveniently characterized using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). Our findings in general favor the choice of fine-tuning deep convolutional networks, as opposed to using off-the-shelf features, but differences at high specificity settings depend on the dataset and are often small. The best performance was observed on the MFND benchmark, achieving 96% sensitivity at a false positive rate of 1.43 x 10(-6 )(C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The cell formation problem is a crucial component of a cell production design in a manufacturing system. Problems related to the cell formation problem are complex NP-hard problems. The goal of the work is to design the algorithm for the cell formation problem that is more efficient then the best-known algorithms for the same problem. The strategy of the new approach is to use the specificities of the input instances to narrow down the feasible set, and thus increase the efficiency of the optimization process. In the dynamic production environment, efficacy is one of the most significant characteristics of the applied expert system. The result is, extensible hybrid algorithm that can be used to solve complex, multi-criteria optimization cell formation problems. The new algorithm produces solutions that are as good as, or better than, the best results previously reported in literature on all commonly used test instances. The time efficiency of the proposed algorithm is at least an order of magnitude better than the efficiency of the most efficient reported algorithms. The obtained experimental results, modularity and generality of the new algorithm imply the significant impact on the expert systems for cell formation problem since the proposed strategy can improve the efficiency of existing algorithms for the grouping problems.

ID FRAMEWORK; DATASET
AB Historically, the harm caused by insiders has proven to be one of the greatest concerns for any organization. As such, it has received considerable attention from both the industrial and research communities. Existing works mainly focused on modeling the employees' normal biometric behavior (e.g., human to device interaction pattern) to detect anomalous behavior which corresponds to the insider activity. However, it is unattainable to stop the insider at the final moment when the malicious act is being carried out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which performs employee profiling based on aspect-based sentiments and social network information and examine its applicability for early detection of potential insider threats. On the contrary to the traditional sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis provides more fine-grained information on the employee. Our framework employs a combination of deep learning techniques such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and skipgram to build temporal sentiment profiles for the employees. It then performs anomaly detection on the profiles and ranks the employees based on their respective anomaly score. Due to the absence of relevant benchmark dataset, we augmented the publicly available real-world Enron email corpus with an insider threat scenario to evaluate our framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that the augmentation is indeed reflected in the augmented employee's anomaly ranking (i.e., from normal to abnormal) and her close associates are indeed placed closely to her when the profiles are visualized in the 2D space. The profiles obtained from our framework can also be used to complement any existing expert and intelligent systems with additional capabilities in handling textual information such as, integration with profiles obtained from biometric behavior to form a more comprehensive threat detection system.

AB Text summarization has become an important research area, especially in the biomedical domain, where information overload is a major problem. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical text summarization system that combines two popular data mining techniques: clustering and frequent itemset mining. Biomedical paper is expressed as a set of biomedical concepts using the UMLS metathesaurus. The K-means algorithm is used to cluster similar sentences. Then, the Apriori algorithm is applied to discover the frequent itemsets among the clustered sentences. Finally, the salient sentences from each cluster are selected to build the summary using the discovered frequent itemsets. For the evaluation step, we selected randomly 100 biomedical papers from the BioMed Central database full-text, and we evaluated the performances of our system by comparing the resulting summaries with the abstracts of these papers using the ROUGE metrics in term of recall, precision, and F-measure. We also compared the obtained summaries with those achieved by five well-known summarizers: TextRank, TextTeaser, SweSum, ItemSet Based Summarizer, Microsoft AutoSummarize, and two baselines: summarization using only the frequent itemsets mining (FRQ-CL), and summarization using only the clustering (CL-FRQ). The results demonstrate that this combination can successfully enhance the summarization performances, and the proposed system outperforms other tested summarizers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a combinatorial problem called a pick-up routing problem with a three-dimensional (3D-PRP) loading constraint, clustered backhauls at the operational level, and train loading at the tactical level for an intermodal transportation network. A two-phase approach, called clustering first, packing-routing second, is proposed for use during the first stage. The clustering of backhauls is carried out using the k-means algorithm. A hybrid approach is provided, which combines the packing of orders by first solving a 3D loading problem for each cluster using machine learning with a best-fit-first strategy, with routing using a genetic algorithm. During the second stage, the train-loading problem is solved using a mixed integer programming approach to minimise the total costs by incorporating various cost types, in which detention and demurrage costs are taken into account. All solution approaches are computationally evaluated on real-world data provided by an international logistics firm and new randomly generated instances. Comparisons are carried out using both exact solution methods and heuristic approaches, and the proposed approach was shown to be more effective for real-world problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID KNOWLEDGE; MOVIE
AB In this paper, we address two research topics in Recommender Systems (RSs) which have been developed in parallel without a deeper integration: Cross-Domain RS (CDRS) and Context-Aware RS (CARS). CDRS have emerged to enhance the quality of recommendations in a target domain by leveraging sources of information in different domains. CDRS are especially useful to address cold-start, sparsity and diversity problems in target domains with scarce information. CARS, on its turn, have been proposed to consider contextual information for recommendations. Such systems are suitable when the users' interests change according to factors like time, location, among others. By combining these two approaches, better RSs can be developed, considering both the availability of useful data from multiple domains and the use of contextual information. In this paper, we formalize the combination of CDRS and CARS, which represents a more systematic integration of these approaches compared to previous work. Based on this formulation, we developed novel RSs techniques, named CD-CARS. To evaluate the developed CD-CARS techniques, we performed extensive experimentation through real datasets taking into account several scenarios. The recommendations were evaluated in terms of predictive and ranking performance, respectively achieving up to 62.6% and 45%, depending on the scenario, in comparison to traditional cross-domain collaborative filtering techniques. Therefore, the experimental results have shown that the integration of techniques developed in isolation can be useful in a variety of situations, in which recommendations can be improved by information gathered from different sources and can be refined by considering specific contextual information.

AB Wheat is one of the world's most widely consumed staple food. However, the number of people suffering from wheat-related disorders has increased drastically. Amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) have recently been identified as one of the main triggers of non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). In this study, an enzymatic assay for the determination of trypsin inhibition activity in hexaploid wheat was developed. This method was optimized with respect to several parameters, such as extraction and incubation procedures, and was validated according to international standards, concerning accuracy, precision and robustness of the method. Results revealed that linear inhibition and thus accuracy occurred only in a narrow concentration range. However, after optimization of settings the novel method was found to be satisfactory for accurate determination of trypsin inhibition in wheat. Purification of the wheat extract with immobilized trypsin beads led to the identification of CM inhibitors (chloroform/methanol soluble proteins) as main contributors of trypsin inhibition.

AB This study investigated the application of ultrasonic pretreatment (UP) to assist with enzymatic extraction of chicken bone protein. Relevant parameters of UP including ultrasonic power, duration of treatment and temperature were studied. The effect of ultrasound was evaluated by examining the protein structure changes (i.e. surface hydrophobicity, secondary and tertiary structures, molecular weight distribution) and their functionalities (i.e. solubility, oil holding capacity, foaming and emulsifying properties). Higher protein extraction yield and surface hydrophobicity were evident after UP, along with the changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. UP alone effects the proteins having molecule weight at about 100 kDa. Results also reveal UP was capable of enhancing the protein functionalities. Therefore, UP could be applied as a suitable technology to improve the yield and quality of the protein extracted from chicken bone by enzymatic method, and as such, facilitating the potential utilization of waste byproduct from poultry industry.

AB To ease the mass exchange in fruit tissues, cutting and blanching are traditionally performed. However, recently, unconventional methods such as sonication are becoming more popular, which cause several alterations of physical and chemical properties as well as microstructure changes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the distribution of water inside the cranberry fruits, microstructural changes and sugars content, following traditional and sonication pre-treatments in osmotic solutions. TD-NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the transverse relaxation time (T-2) and intensity of proton pools in different cellular compartments. The microstructure of the samples was evaluated by SEM microscopy, sugars content by HPLC and sucrose melting temperature and enthalpy by DSC. Different pre-treatments appeared to promote microstructure alterations and loss of water from vacuole and cytoplasm/extracellular space, more pronounced in cut and blanched samples. Cutting and blanching followed by osmotic dehydration with assisted sonication eased sucrose penetration into the tissue.

AB The jaggery-making process involves various thermo-chemical treatments of sugarcane juice. As jaggery making is a traditional practice, knowledge about the use of different chemicals in the process is transferred from generation to generation without much scientific understanding. Phosphoric acid is one of the chemicals commonly used in this process. We have investigated its effect through systematic experiments. The addition of acid causes inversion of sucrose, which beyond a certain point is not desirable for good quality jaggery. In the correct proportions, however, phosphoric acid improves the colour and texture of jaggery and helps in the formation of smaller sized crystals. Reducing sugars formed due to inversion hinder crystal growth, resulting in relatively small crystals. In our experiments, the average crystal size reduced from 22.22 mu m to 14.34 mu m. Acid-treated jaggery was found to equilibrate at higher moisture. A comparison with normal jaggery is thus provided for its keeping quality.

AB In the present study, the antioxidant hydrolysates obtained from watermelon seed protein (WSP) after divergent ultrasound and ultrafiltration treatment were studied. The results showed that the slit divergent ultrasound (SDU, 20/28 KHz) pretreatment had considerable influence on the structure and enzymatic efficiency of WSP. Besides, compared with hydrolysates without ultrasonic and ultrafiltration treatment, watermelon protein hydrolysates with molecular weight < 1 kDa (WSPHs-I) showed the highest antioxidant activities and could protect RAW 264.7 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative stress damage via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Interestingly, WSPHs-I had good stability against oxidation at temperature under 100 degrees C or in the acidic or neutral condition and still exhibited strong antioxidant activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Taken together, SDU pretreatment could significantly increase the antioxidant activities and stability of WSPHs by improving the structure and facilitating enzymolysis of the WSP.

AB Peanut allergy is usually lifelong and accidental exposure impose formidable risk. The aim of this study was to assess the capacity of peanut proteins complexed to polyphenol extracts to reduce allergic response in C3H/HeJ mice. Mice were sensitized to peanut flour followed by exposure to amino acid diets fortified with peanut protein-polyphenol aggregates of either with low (15%; w/w) or high (40%; w/w) complexation ratios of blueberry (BB-Low and BB-High) and cranberry (CB-Low and CB-High) extracts. Treatment groups on diets with high complexation ratios of blueberry and cranberry aggregates showed significant reduction in peanut specific plasma Immunoglobulin E (IgE). Western blot analysis of spleen lysates showed CD63 protein expression was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in blueberry and cranberry complexed peanut protein supplemented diet groups. Our results demonstrate for the first time that complexation of polyphenols to peanut flour can potentially lower plasma IgE of peanut-sensitized C3H/HeJ mice.

AB Selecting the appropriate type of barrel for wine maturation but also deciding on the optimum maturation length, is a challenge for winemakers. As different types of barrel woods emerge, it is of great importance for a guideline to be established, which could facilitate winemaking decisions. Since the sensory perception of the finished wine, and particularly the intensity of astringency, is a decisive factor for the quality of a barrel-aged wine, in this experiment, the structural characteristics of wine proanthocyanidins were determined and their correlation with astringency was established. According to the results obtained, the proanthocyanidin content and the type of subunit that is dominant in tannin chains could be used to construct an astringency estimation model. The findings could provide winemakers with a useful tool when deciding how long to mature a specific type of wine in a specific wood container without making it appear coarse and astringent.

AB Within the cocoa market (Theobroma cacao L.), quality and prices are often determined by geographical origin, making traceability indispensable. Therefore, to investigate possibilities of tracing by analytical methods, 48 carefully selected cocoa samples from 20 countries have been profiled using a combination of stable isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR). Chemometric analysis of combined data sets from both, stable isotope data (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, delta H-2, %C, %N, %O, %H) and H-1 NMR fingerprints, achieved good separation with increased classification rates compared to classification with data of the isolated methods. IRMS contributed primarily to discrimination between countries, while H-1 NMR significantly contributed to separation of varieties, but also the regions within individual countries. This study thus demonstrates that combination of two analytical methods is an effective tool to enhance both, accuracy and precision, in authenticity testing of cocoa.

AB Beehive products are considered sentinels for environmental pollutants. The presence of trace elements and pesticides in honey and beeswax may pose a health hazard to consumers. The study's aim was to determine the profile of pesticides and trace elements in Israeli honey and beeswax samples in relation to human risk assessment. At least two pesticides contaminated the honey and beeswax samples simultaneously, in which, amitraz metabolites and coumaphos were frequently detected. The neonicotinoid insecticides and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, were found only in honey samples, whereas the more lipophilic pesticides were predominantly found in beeswax. In honey, chromium displayed the highest mean concentration, followed by zinc, whereas lead and molybdene occurred only in beeswax. Our findings indicate that the daily consumption of honey and beeswax together may compromise children's health. Sucrose-syrup fed honey could not be distinguished from floral honey based on sugar profile, rather by its trace elements levels.

AB Determination of lead at trace levels was achieved by slotted quartz tube-flame atomic absorption spectrometry (SQT-FAAS) after the preconcentration with deep eutectic solvent-based liquid phase microextraction (DES-LPME). A green solvent was used to extract lead from the aqueous solution. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and determination were optimized in the aim to lower the detection limit. Under the optimum experimental and instrumental conditions, the proposed method exhibited a linear range between 50 and 1000 mu g L-1, and the limits of detection and quantitation (LOD and LOQ) were found to be 8.7 and 29.0 mu g L-1, respectively. The detection power was improved by 48 times using DES-LPME-SQT-FAAS method with respect to conventional FAAS system. Recovery studies were carried out in raw milk samples to check the accuracy and the applicability of the developed method and the percent recoveries obtained were between 102.5 and 103.2% for the spiked raw milk samples.

AB Applying methyl jasmonate can mimic the defense response to insect damage in broccoli and enhances the production of glucosinolates, especially inducible indolyl GS-neoglucobrassicin. Previous studies have suggested that glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products are anti-carcinogenic. Therefore, MeJA treatment may increase the nutritional quality of broccoli. However, there are few reports on the sensory evaluation and consumer acceptance of MeJA-treated broccoli. In this study, an untrained consumer panel could not detect any taste differences between steamed MeJA-treated and untreated broccoli, even though the steamed MeJA-treated broccoli contained 50% more glucosinolates than untreated broccoli. The partial least square-regression model suggested that neoglucobrassicin-derived hydrolysis compounds were the major metabolites that determined overall preference for raw MeJA-treated broccoli potentially due to their potential negative sensory qualities. The results imply that MeJA treatment can increase the nutritional quality of broccoli without sacrificing taste in precooked meals or frozen vegetables.

AB Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) constitute a chemical family within the saponifiable fraction of vegetable oils. GPLs have been scarcely studied in edible oils owing to the lack of sensitive and selective analytical methods. We have developed a method for identification, confirmation and relative quantitation of GPLs in vegetable oils. The method is based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) for isolation of GPLs and determination by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As proof of concept, the approach has been applied to characterize GPLs in different olive oil categories, thus revealing compositional changes, which could be explained by factors such as the quality of fruits and the extraction process. Families such as glycerophosphatidic acids and phosphatidylglycerides are remarkable because of their capability to discriminate virgin olive oils from the rest of categories. These results open a door to additional studies targeted at the identification of olive oil quality by monitoring these lipids.

AB Three varieties of sweetpotato flour (Orange Sunset (OS), Purple Dawn (PD), and Red) were treated by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Thermal analysis showed that complete starch gelatinization occurred in PD and Red subjected to 600 MPa. Starch of OS was partially gelatinized at 600 MPa. The pressure of 600 MPa caused significant decreases in peak viscosity, breakdown and setback, and an increase in pasting temperature. Compared with native samples, HHP-treated samples showed higher in vitro starch digestibility in uncooked conditions but lower digestibility in cooked conditions. HHP significantly improved the extractability of bioactive compounds from sweetpotato flour. The changes in beta-carotene content, total phenolic content, in vitro antioxidant activities, individual phenolic acids, and anthocyanins profiles were investigated. This study suggests the potential of HHP as a non-thermal processing tool to modify the functional properties of sweetpotato flour.

AB Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa willd.) is an annual herbaceous flowering plant showing appropriate nutritional and functional properties due to its high quality protein with a wide amino acid spectrum, particularly rich in lysine. The mature quinoa seed predominantly consists of 11S-type globulin called chenopodin, comprising about 37% of the total protein, and also 2S albumin accounting for 35% of the seed protein both stabilized through disulfide bridges. Moreover, quinoa seed contains low concentration of prolamins (0.5-7% of total protein) making it suitable for patients with celiac disease. Different enzymatic, chemical and physical modification methods also can influence the structural and finally nutritional and functional properties of protein isolate. Consequently, considering appropriate nutritional and functional properties of quinoa protein, it can be considered as a good candidate to supply human food products.

AB This study aims to exploit the molecular and cellular mechanisms concerning the functionality of dietary polyphenols (catechin, procyanidin B3, procyanidin C2, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate) in a nutritional context to prevent Celiac Disease (CD). In that sense, the interaction between the main CD bioactive peptide (32-mer peptide) and some polyphenols was fully characterized at the intestinal level under near physiological conditions by means of different spectroscopic techniques and dynamic simulations. Accordingly, it is proposed that the primarily polyphenol-binding sites on the 32-mer peptide correspond to leucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine containing domains being this interaction entropy-driven. Although procyanidin B3 and trimer C2 had a similar low-affinity constant at 310 K, both procyanidins were able to reduce the 32-mer peptide apical-to-basolateral translocation in in vitro simulated intestinal epithelial barrier thus prospecting the occurrence of additional and still unexplored regulatory mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols might modulate the transepithelial transport of CD bioactive peptides.

AB Alginate lyases can be used for alginate oligosaccharide production and for structural characterization or modification of alginates. For these applications it is important to obtain detailed information on mode of action and substrate specificities of alginate lyases. In this study, five alginate lyase genes were cloned from Cellulophaga algicola DSM 14237 genomic DNA, heterologously expressed, and characterized by using HPSEC-RI and HPAEC-PAD/MS. It was demonstrated that these analytical approaches can provide detailed information on preferred substrates, extent of hydrolysis, and the liberated products. The recombinant enzymes cleaved alginates endolytically (CaAly1, CaAly2, CaAly3) or exolytically (CaAly4, CaAly5). The three endolytic alginate lyases predominantly hydrolyzed guluronic acid-rich alginates, only CaAly1 also showed activity on mannuronic acid-rich alginates. The oligosaccharide profiles further demonstrated that the endolytic enzymes have rather narrow but slightly different substrate specificities and that the two exolytic alginate lyases mainly cleaved unsaturated guluronic acid oligosaccharides to monomers.

AB The composition of inorganic elements is a key factor in determining the quality of fruit wines. However, the use of direct sample injection is challenging for multi-elemental analysis of fruit wine samples. In this paper, an analytical method using inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) was established for determining multiple elements (Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb) in fruit wine. The fruit wine was diluted using ultrapure water and acidified with nitric acid before injecting into the ICP-MS/MS. Spectral interferences in the complex matrix composition of different fruit wine samples, in the MS/MS mode, were eliminated using mixed reaction gases of O-2/H-2 and NH3/He/H-2 through the mass shift and on-mass methods. The limits of detection ranged from 0.41 to 58.1 ng L-1. This study demonstrates a new approach for multi-elemental analysis in fruit wine with great convenience and high accuracy.

AB Pigment-depletion in the fillets of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) arises after periods of elevated water temperatures with voluntary starving. This study tested the effects of dietary pre-loading with different pigment carotenoids (astaxanthin and/or canthaxanthin) combined with two alpha-tocopherol levels (normal and high: 500 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively) on pigment-depletion in vivo in Atlantic salmon after four weeks of challenge. We also tested whether oxidative stress manifested as an underlying depletion mechanism.
   Carotenoid levels in whole fillet homogenates were not decreased significantly post-challenge but fillet alpha-tocopherol concentrations were increased significantly in contrast to decreased oxidative stress indices. However, image analysis revealed localised fillet pigment-depletion following all dietary treatments. These data imply that localised pigment-depletion was not prevented by pre-loading of the fillet with different carotenoid-types/mixtures and increased of alpha-tocopherol levels from normal to high, respectively. Further, we suggest that oxidative stress might not facilitate pigment-depletion in vivo.

AB Hydrogen gas (H-2), a multifunctional signaling molecule, has received increasing attention in recent years. In the present study, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) (2 ppm) was used for the processing of sprouted black barley (Hordeum distichum L.), and the results showed that the HRW treatment could significantly increase the germination rate and growth rate of black barley (P < 0.05). A chemical component analysis showed that in sprouted black barley, the HRW treatment could change the distribution of phytochemicals (e.g., the ionic strength of guanosine), increase the concentrations of free vanillic acid, coumaric acid, sinapic acid, conjugated sinapic acid, Ca and Fe and the hydroxyl radical scavenging rate, and decrease the protein, fat, starch and dietary fibre contents compared with the results obtained after treatment with ultra-pure water (P < 0.05). HRW can be used for the processing of sprouted grains to effectively increase their germination efficiency and concentrations of bioactive phytochemicals.

AB Matrix effects in complex tea matrices remains a great challenge to rapid quantitative analysis of multi-residue pesticides by analysis of mass spectrometry. Herein, a mixed-mode polymer cationic exchange based dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) procedure was established to eliminate matrix effects of tea for a rapid target alkaline multi-residue pesticides analysis. One-step DSPE procedure can eliminate matrix interferences from the tea extract without additional dilution or tedious cleanup operations. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry using pre-column dilution injection mode was used as the detection technique, while eliminating solvent effects of target analytes and improving the detection sensitivity. Based on this effective analytical method, the results of absolute matrix effects were within 0.77-1.08 for quantitation of the 68 alkaline pesticides, and superior relative matrix effects were also achieved with RSD values below 9.8%. Finally, this method was validated and applied to the alkaline pesticides analysis of the 123 tea samples.

AB The health-promoting functions of fruit phenolic compounds are mainly attributed to their metabolites. The organic cultivation of fruits is becoming increasingly popular. Thus, this study evaluates whether the differences in red Grenache grapes derived from organic culture conditions influence the bioavailability and metabolism of phenolic compounds in rats. Organic and nonorganic (conventional) red Grenache grapes (OG and CG, respectively) were characterized and administered to Wistar rats (65 mg gallic acid equivalents/kg bw). Serum was recollected at different time points, and the phenolic metabolites were quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The results showed that organic cultivation increased the oligomeric proanthocyanidin and anthocyanidin contents and decreased the content of free flavanols and dietary fiber. The serum profile of OG-administered rats showed higher metabolite concentrations at 2 h and reduced metabolite concentration at 24 h compared with the CG-administered rats. Thus, this particular serum kinetic behavior might influence the bioactivity of their phenolic compounds.

AB An environmentally friendly method which is based on preparation and use of a new composite consisting of poly 3-aminophenol and graphene oxide for solid-phase microextraction of triazole fungicides from natural water and juices is introduced. The composite was synthesized by in-situ polymerization of 3-aminophenol and graphene oxide in weak alkaline media. By using the obtained results from the characterization, a suitable mechanism for polymerization and a proper structure for the polymer were proposed. Under optimal conditions, there are linear relationships between concentration of triazoles and their HPLC peak areas in the range of 0.5-100 mu g L-1. The recovery percentages, pre-concentration factors and LOQ for all triazoles were 95.2-98.0%, about 200 and 0.2-0.4 mu g L-1, respectively. The offered method was applied for extraction and determination of triazoles from natural water, some juices and it represents a promising alternative method for analysis of triazoles.

AB Dynamic high-pressure microfluidization (DHPM) pretreatment and glycation with lactose were employed to modify alpha-Lactalbumin (alpha-LA) with respect to the IgE/IgG binding capacities. No significant difference on incorporation ratio value of glycated alpha-LA was observed with and without DHPM pretreatment. However, IgE/IgG binding capacities of alpha-LA were decreased after glycation and DHPM pretreatment promoted the reduction. The lowest IgE/IgG binding capacities of glycated alpha-LA were obtained by DHPM pretreatment at 110 MPa. Native alpha-LA was mainly glycated at K62, K94, K98, whereas glycation sites and degree of substitution per peptide (DSP) were added after DHPM treatment. Therefore, the reduced IgE/IgG binding capacities of alpha-LA was attributed to the characteristics of glycated sites, including the amount, location, and DSP values. Interestingly, K98 played the most important role in decreasing IgE/IgG binding capacities of alpha-LA. The study revealed that glycation combined with DHPM was a promising way to decrease the allergenicity of proteins.

AB Citrus fruit postharvest degreening is a critical stage in marketing, carried out by exposure to ethylene or ethephon. Genome-wide screening of the AP2/ERF superfamily indicated that a novel ERF-II (CitERF6) was shown to trans-activate the CitPPH promoter. Expression of CitERF6 is associated with both developmental and postharvest degreening in citrus fruit. Transient and stable over-expression of CitERF6 in Nicotiana tabacum leaves and 'Ponkan' fruit also results in rapid chlorophyll degradation. Auto-and mutual-regulation was also found between CitERF6 and the previously characterized CitERF13 using the dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays. Moreover, substitution of the 35S promoter for endogenous promoters showed that both pCitERF6::CitERF6 and pCitERF13::CitERF13 were effective in trans-activating their promoters or triggering chlorophyll degradation. It is proposed that ethylene is one of the triggers activating promoters of CitERF6 and CitERF13, and subsequent auto-and mutual-regulation between CitERF6 and CitERF13 might facilitate the effect of ethylene, leading to fruit degreening.

AB Macroporous resins have been employed in the effective recovery of flavonoids from plants. In this study, S8 polar resins were used to recover flavonoids and procyanidins from lotus seedpods. Adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics studies revealed that the adsorption process involved physico-chemical interactions, including flavonoid-resin and flavonoid-flavonoid electrostatic interactions, pi - pi aromatic stacking, moderate and strong hydrogen bonding, and repulsive forces. These forces worked complementarily in adsorption, except for the repulsive force, which opposed the adsorption. Further, adsorption temperature determined the adsorption behavior, with multilayer adsorption enhancing adsorption capacity. In dynamic desorption tests, an acetone/water/acetic acid mixture (58.77: 39.34: 1.89) designed by the D-optimal design method was able to desorb 95.57% and 89.85% of total flavonoids and procyanidins, respectively, using less than two bed volumes of solvent. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple-time of flight/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF/MS) analysis showed that 26 flavonoids, including 5 procyanidins, were detected after the recovery.

AB A novel strategy was used to produce inulin fructotransferase from Arthrobacter aurescens (Aa-IFTase) embedded in curdlan-based mesoporous silica microspheres (CMSiM-Aa-IFTase). The CMSiM-Aa-IFTase was constructed by co-entrapping cross-linked Aa-IFTase aggregates and curdlan into biomemitic silica, and the curdlan was subsequently removed by digestion with endo-beta-1,3-glucanase. During this process, the curdlan served as an agent to introduce pores in silica microspheres. The resulting CMSiM-Aa-IFTase showed higher stability and activity than free Aa-IFTase and mCLEAs-Aa-IFTase (modified cross-linked enzyme aggregates with Aa-IFTase). Furthermore, the CMSiM-Aa-IFTase displayed good reusability and excellent storage stability. The excellent catalytic performances were due to the combinational structure from the cross-linked enzyme aggregates and hard shell of mesoporous silica microspheres, which might decrease the negative interaction between support and enzyme, and improve the mechanical properties. The CMSiM-Aa-IFTase was applicable for efficient production of Difructose Anhydride III (DFA III), and this approach should be highly valuable for preparing various mesoporous composites for catalysis.

AB The low solubility, instability, and low bioavailability of food bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and flavonoids, restrict their applications in the fields of food science and nutrition. Ferritin protein has received more and more attention in encapsulation and delivery of the bioactive compounds due to its nanosized shell-like structure and its reversible self-assembly character. After encapsulation, bioactive compounds can be functionalized by the ferritin vehicle to achieve stabilization, solubilization, and targeted delivery. In addition, the outer interfaces and the porous structure of ferritin are also artfully harnessed for encapsulation. This review focuses on the newest advances in the fabrication, characterization, and application of ferritin-based nanocarriers for bioactive compounds by the reversible self-assembly, outer-interface decoration methods, and the channel-directed approach. The functional improvements of food bioactive compounds, including their solubility, stability, and cellular uptake, are emphasized. The limitations that affect ferritin encapsulation are also examined.

AB Nineteen red and white wines were screened for the presence of crown (oligomeric cyclic) procyanidins with 4, 5 or 6 (epi)catechin monomers by means of HPLC-HRMS/MS. For the first time, the distribution of crown procyanidins in wines obtained from several grape varieties was discussed including white wines. The ratios between crown and non-cyclic procyanidins allowed the samples to be discriminated by grape variety. The crown hexameric procyanidin was present in the red wines and absent in the white wines analyzed. The crown pentameric procyanidin was absent in Gewurztraminer. In Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, the pentameric procyanidin was present only in the cyclic form. Less oxidized high quality red wines displayed a higher fraction of crown to non-cyclic procyanidins than the other wines. These compounds are proposed as potential complement markers of wine quality and authenticity.

AB Terpenes and their derivatives, terpenoids, are important biomarkers of grape quality as they contribute to flavor and aroma of grape and wine. The evolution of terpene and terpenoids throughout grapevine phenological development cycles is not well understood. The current study investigated the volatile profiles of free terpene and terpenoid of five widely grown Vitis vinifera L. cultivars (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Chardonnay and Pinot Gris), at different phenological stages from fruit-set to harvest. 17 Monoterpenoids, 3 norisoprenoid and 13 sesquiterpenoids were identified and quantified. Discriminant analysis revealed that for each grape cultivar, free terpene profiles at different E-L stages were distinctive. When integrating total sugar, total terpenes and the cumulated heat index, it could be found that flavor ripening was more consistent with sugar ripening in the warmer vintage 2016. Comparing the two red wine varieties, the overall development patterns of total monoterpenes, norisoprenoids and sesquiterpenes were similar.

AB Inflammation plays a key role in diseases such as diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Diet can influence different stages of inflammation and can have an important impact on several inflammatory diseases. Increasing scientific evidence has shown that polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, which are found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, or cocoa, can have anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that flavonoids can inhibit regulatory enzymes or transcription factors important for controlling mediators involved in inflammation. Flavonoids are also known as potent antioxidants with the potential to attenuate tissue damage or fibrosis. Consequently, numerous studies in vitro and in animal models have found that flavonoids have the potential to inhibit the onset and development of inflammatory diseases. In the present review, we focused in flavonoids, the most abundant polyphenols in the diet, to give an overview of the most recent scientific knowledge about their impact on different inflammatory diseases.

AB The fragility of biscuits yields checking (cracks) and eventually breakage, which originated mainly from heterogeneity in water distribution in the thickness dimension (surface vs centre) and also to the plan dimension (edge vs centre) of the product. The objective of the BRICE project is to study the impact of the distribution of water on the occurrence of checking and breakage (C&B) in biscuits, considering a round and thick biscuit and a rectangular and thinner biscuit presenting piercing points.
   C&B counting was performed over 15 days of storage (the time needed to reach stability). A higher C&B occurrence was observed in the round biscuits, while rectangular biscuits had a near-zero C&B rate. The Karl Fischer method was combined with an automated NIR imaging system to monitor the water distribution at the centres and surfaces of the products, as well as the apparition of C&B. The results confirmed that minuscule water gradients are involved.

AB The aim of this study was to extract benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from green papaya by distillation apparatus without using organic solvents, and to improve the stability of BITC in aqueous solution. The distillation of mashed green papaya successfully yielded BITC as a water solution with more than 80% purity with good reproducibility. The amount of BITC in the distilled water gradually decreased during its storage at 4 degrees C, whereas it was not significantly changed at -20 degrees C for a few months. Moreover, the addition of L-cysteine ameliorated the BITC decomposition by the 4 degrees C-storage, but not affected by N-acetyl-cysteine and glutathione. These results suggested that the combination of BITC extraction by distillation and cysteine supplementation as well as frozen storage might be a useful method for the preparation and storage of the safer grade of BITC-containing extract.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NaCl on the formation, structure and property of samples formed from wheat starch (WS) and the fatty acids (lauric acid (LA), myristic acid (MA), palmitic acid (PA) and stearic acid (SA)). Results from RVA, DSC, XRD and Raman analyses showed that LA, and to a lesser extent MA, formed complexes with WS. Under the experimental conditions used, only minor amounts of WS-PA and WS-SA complexes formed. The low solubility of PA and SA, and to some extent MA, in water caused these fatty acids to mostly self-aggregate. The presence of NaCl promoted the formation of WS-LA complexes and, to a lesser extent complexes with MA, but had little effect on the formation of WS-PA and WS-SA complexes. Solubility of fatty acids in aqueous medium was proposed to be a major factor for the formation of starch-fatty acid complexes.

AB Of all the active compounds in rosemary extract, carnosic acid (CaA) has the most potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activity; however, its low solubility limits its applications. We developed complexing systems using cycloamylose (CA), branched dextrin (BD), and beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) to improve the solubility of CaA and compared it to the use of maltodextrin (MD). The complexes formed with CA, BD, beta CD, and MD improved the water solubility of CaA by as much as 2.8-fold, 2.1-fold, 1.75-fold, and 2.06-fold, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of CaA in aqueous solutions was also enhanced in the complexes due to the increased water solubility. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activity was improved more dramatically upon complexation with CA (7.27-fold) compared to the improvement when complexed with BD (4.82-fold), beta CD (2.87-fold), and MD (3.83-fold). This may be due to the improvement of the antimicrobial potential of the functional groups of CaA by complexation with flexible cyclic glucans.

AB UPLC-ESI-HRMS/MS was used to identify the free, esterified and bound phenolic compounds in Kainth fruit extracts. In total, around 17, 15 and 18 free, esterified and bound phenolic compounds respectively were identified. Among these, Procyanidin B-2, Epicatechin, Phloridzin, Hesperetin, etc. are being reported for the first time. The total phenolic content of free, esterified and bound fractions were 178.33 +/- 6.90, 151.33 +/- 7.73 and 707.16 +/- 19.77 mg GAE/100 g of fruit. The major phenolic compounds quantified were chlorogenic acid (7.97 mg/100 g), arbutin (7.05 mg/100 g) and catechin (44.56 mg/100 g) in free, esterified and bound form respectively. Various antioxidant assays (DPPH, ABTS, TAC and FRAP) were performed for all the extracts. Among different extracts, the bound phenolics exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. Systematic identification and quantitative profiling of phenolics in Kainth fruit being presented for the first time would help in utilising this fruit for designing functional food formulations.

AB Immobilization of enzymes is an essential strategy with outstanding prospects in biocatalytic processes. Nontoxic, inexpensive immobilized enzyme approach is especially important for food enzymes. We here demonstrate that a carbohydrate-binding module family 56 domain (CBM56-Tag) mediates the immobilization of fusion enzymes with the curdlan (beta-1,3-glucan) particle support, thereby enabling the one-step immobilization-purification of target enzymes. CBM56-Tag exhibits an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which can be adsorbed by curdlan via hydrogen bond-mediated binding. The maximum adsorption capacity of a fusion chitosanase (CBM56-GsCsn46A) on curdlan is 50.72 mg/g. The immobilized enzyme could be directly used in the packed-bed reactor. This immobilization strategy utilizes a natural polysaccharide without any treatment, avoiding the negative environmental effects. Moreover, the one step immobilization-purification simplifies the purification step, which reduces the use of chemicals. Our study provides a nontoxic and inexpensive immobilization strategy for the biocatalytic reaction in food industry.

AB The health risk assessment of exposure to toxic metals through the consumption food crops is very important. The present study was aimed to investigate the bioaccessibility of toxic metals (including arsenic, lead and cadmium) in rice through an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model, and assess health risks associated with these metals in raw, cooked and digested rice. Total and bioaccessible concentration of metals were measured by introducing the prepared samples into the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. Based on the results, the bioaccessible toxic metals in gastric phase were significantly higher than that in both oral and small intestinal phases. The estimated concentrations of these metals in the raw and cooked rice are very far from the actual exposure state. Therefore, to assess the extent of health risks associated with the subjected toxic metals through the rice consumption, the actual exposure value of the metals (bioaccessible value) should be considered.

AB The nutritional and antinutritional components of minor millets were correlated with mixolab dough mixing behavior and in vitro protein and starch digestibility. Total arabinoxylan (r = - 0.53, p < 0.05) and dietary fiber (r = - 0.66, p < 0.05) content significantly (p < 0.05) increased protein weakening. Peak viscosity negatively correlated with phenolic (r = - 0.55, p < 0.05) content. The dietary fiber and phenolics suppressed retrogradation. Protein digestibility negatively correlated with tannin (r = - 0.70, p < 0.05), phytic acid (r = - 0.69, p < 0.05), phenolics (r = - 0.79, p < 0.05), flavonoids (r = - 0.72, p < 0.05) and total dietary fiber content (r = - 0.84, p < 0.05). A positive correlation of resistant starch (RS) with total dietary fiber (r = 0.85, p < 0.05), phenolics (r = 0.89, p < 0.05), flavonoids (r = 0.83, p < 0.05), phytic acid (r = 0.43, p < 0.05) and tannin content (r = 0.79, p < 0.05) was observed. Millets predicted lower glycemic index than wheat and it was found to be negatively associated with the RS (r = - 0.96, p < 0.05) and total dietary fiber content (r = - 0.89, p < 0.05) and positively correlated (r = 0.98, p < 0.05) with rapidly digestible starch. The millets may be diversified for personalized nutrition and development of functional food.

AB The objective of this work was to assess the impact of high-pressure processing (HPP) on the carotenoid profile, colour as well as the microbial and enzymatic stability of cloudy carrot juice. The predominant carotenoids in the fresh juices were by far the provitamin A carotenoids beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. Others were zeta-carotene, phytofluene, phytoene and lutein. HPP at 300 MPa in three cycles caused the highest carotenoids degradation (41%) whereas the lowest degradation (26%) was achieved at 600 MPa. The highest inactivation of POD (31%) and PPO (57%) was achieved with 600 MPa and 300 MPa applied in three cycles, respectively what indicates that POD is more responsible for carotenoids degradation. The colour differences (Delta E-ab(*)) between fresh juice and HPP-treated juices ranged from 3.02 to 4.15 CIELAB units. As far as the impact on microorganism was concerned, there was a clear trend between the applied pressure and the microbial reduction achieved.

AB White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) raised in low-salinity farm are considered inferior to those in seawater. In order to develop a rapid discrimination method for the food industry, we investigated the potential of using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging to discriminate shrimp muscle samples from freshwater and seawater farms. We constructed 3 different discrimination models with 4 optimal wavelength selection methods and compared the performance of each model. The results showed that sequential forward selection combined with partial least squares discriminant analysis (SFS-PLS-DA) generated the best discrimination performance with an overall accuracy of 99.2%. The elemental and isotopic analysis indicated a high correlation between 918 and 925 nm region (which was selected by SFS) and C-13 concentration. This agrees with the fact that there is more C-13 in shrimp of salty water compared to those of freshwater. The results demonstrated (hyperspectral imaging) HSI is promising to discriminate L. vannamei raised in fresh and seawater environments.

AB Although coffee beans have been widely studied, application of coffee flower (CF) has not been previously investigated. Here, we evaluated the use of CF for the production of bioactive compounds, melanoidins, and biosugars through the green process. Pressurized hot water extraction was found to be the most appropriate method for extracting bioactive compounds from CF, which contain high values of total phenolic content and have antioxidant properties. Caffeine and trigonelline were the main compounds in CF with yields of 1070.8 mg and 1092.8 mg/100 g dry weight (DW), respectively. Melanoidins were also identified and quantified in the CF extracts that is approximately 30.2% were efficiently recovered in the initial extracts of CF. Bio-sugar was also obtained from cellulase and pectinase at a 92.8% conversion rate. The aim of this study is to promote a novel approach using high amounts of CFs in the production of functional healthy foods and beverages.

AB The aim of this study was to assess content of primary and secondary metabolites of 18 plum cultivars selected in Serbia. Autochthonous cultivar 'Crvena Ranka' exhibited the highest level of total sugars (174.3 g/kg FW) while cultivar 'Mildora' had the highest sugars/acids ratio (17.2). Cultivar 'Nada' also contained high sugars/acid ratio as well as a high level of glucose and total sugars. Compared to the other cultivars, 'Nada' had a higher content of anthocyanins (27.14 mg/100 g FW), 'Crvena Ranka' neochlorogenic acid (23.21 mg/100 g FW) and flavanols (86.15 mg/100 g FW) but also the highest antioxidant activity. The PCA analysis confirmed that 'Nada' and 'Crvena Ranka' demonstrated better results in terms of sugars and antioxidant activity than the standard cultivars grown in Serbia and can be recommended for increased plum growing for fresh consumption, processing and in the breeding of plum with enhanced nutritional content.

AB Dietary protein peptides from quinoa yoghurt beverage (QYB) fermented with probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains play a protective role against diabetes and hypertension. In this study, the alpha-glucosidase and ACE inhibitory activities of germination-based protein hydrolysates of QYB were investigated. All protein hydrolysates exhibited a dose and strain-dependent inhibition on the enzymes. The inhibition of alpha-glucosidase was the highest in QLCSY13 (IC50 = 8.86 mg/mL), while ACE inhibition was the highest in QLCZ (IC50 = 0.03 mg/mL). Overall, QLCSY13 had the highest inhibitory activities, which was ascribed to its relatively higher amino acid contents and hydrophobicity. In addition, the ACE and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of peptide fractions identified by RP-HPLC were 127 +/- 4.29 mg/mL and 10.39 +/- 4.73 mg/mL respectively. Among the potent inhibitory peptide sequences identified, both LAHMIVAGA and VAHPVF significantly had alpha-glucosidase and ACE inhibitory activities. Consequently, dietary protein peptides present in QYB had anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic potentials.

AB Jaggery is a non-centrifugal sweetener produced by thermo-chemical treatments of sugarcane juice. The traditional practices involved in making jaggery are usually tailored using chemicals to meet consumer requirements. Sodium hydrosulphite (hydros) is a commonly employed chemical in the jaggery industry to improve its colour. This article presents a comparative study of jaggery made with and without hydros treatments. The differences in properties, such as sorption behaviour, colour, polyphenols, flavonoids, minerals, and sulphur dioxide content, were measured. Hydros-treated jaggery was found to be brighter in colour with a lower browning index by 5-10. SO2 content of hydros-treated jaggery was > 70 ppm, while minerals, polyphenols, and flavonoids were less abundant compared to control jaggery, thereby compromising overall quality. Based on the experiments carried out, the optimum treatment of hydros can be employed to satisfy consumer demand while producing an acceptable quality of jaggery that conforms to norms.

AB The aim of this study was to research the effect of yeast fermentation on the polyphenol content of Lycium ruthenicum (LR) to guide the production of bread with a lower digestibility. Liquid fermentation from 0 to 2 h significantly increased the phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin content of LR, while further liquid fermentation from 2 to 16 h had little additional effect. The addition of LR without prior liquid fermentation impaired the bread quality, while a prior liquid fermentation for at least 2 h improved the bread quality. The bread digestibility was decreased after adding LR, and it was further reduced with the extended liquid fermentation time. The results of this study indicate that adding LR with prior liquid fermentation to the dough during bread making could result in a higher quality and a lower digestibility.

AB Control of lipid digestibility by various food components has received great attention in recent decades. However, there is limited literature on investigating the synergistic effect of exogenous emulsifiers and endogenous sodium cholate (SC) on lipid digestion in a simulated physiological crowded medium. In this work, the synergistic interaction of Tween80 and SC according to the regular solution theory, and the hydrolysis of lipid emulsions containing tricaprylin, glyceryltrioleate or soybean oil in crowding medium was studied. The results show that emulsions stabilized by a combination of Tween80 and SC showed higher digestion rate and transformation than those with Tween80 or SC. The digestion rate could be increased by polyethylene glycols (PEGn) with varying crowding degree. The denaturation temperature of the lipase was increased in macromolecular crowded medium. This work allows for better understanding of the interaction between the amphiphiles and the macromolecular crowding effect on lipase digestion in the physiological environment.

AB Synthesis of beta-ionone in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae is limited by the efficiency of Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenases (CCD), membrane-tethered enzymes catalyzing the last step in the pathway. We performed in silico design and membrane affinity analysis, focused on single-point mutations of PhCCD1 to improve membrane anchoring. The resulting constructs were tested in a beta-carotene hyper-producing strain by comparing colony pigmentation against colonies transformed with native PhCCD1 and further analyzed by beta-ionone quantification via RP-HPLC. Two single-point mutants increased beta-ionone yields almost 3-fold when compared to native PhCCD1. We also aimed to improve substrate accessibility of PhCCD1 through the amino-terminal addition of membrane destination peptides directed towards the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane. Yeast strains expressing peptide-PhCCD1 constructs showed beta-ionone yields up to 4-fold higher than the strain carrying the native enzyme. Our results demonstrate that protein engineering of CCDs significantly increases the yield of beta-ionone synthesized by metabolically engineered yeast.

AB An integrated targeted-untargeted H-1 and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis was applied to determine the impact of roasting on coffee lipids. For targeted analysis, both an internal standard (IS) method, as well as the ERETIC2 tool based on PULCON (Pulse Length-based Concentration determination), were used for quantitation. PULCON allows for quantitative analysis without sample contamination with an IS and was found to be in very good agreement with the traditional IS approach as indicated by a systematic Bland-Altman comparison study. For the untargeted analysis, NMR was coupled with multivariate statistical analysis (MVSA), namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). C-13 NMR spectra were acquired using a z-stored spin-echo sequence to achieve higher spectral quality, which is important for both targeted and untargeted analysis. Results showed that roasting has a clear effect on coffee lipids, with diterpenes, oxidation/hydrolysis products and unsaturated fatty acid chains being the most significant markers. In addition, the application of MRI indicated important morphological alterations in bean structure and lipid migration from the endosperm to the surface of the coffee bean.

AB As an environmentally friendly approach for fruit quality improvement, the effect of preharvest UV-C on the physiology of strawberry fruit during postharvest storage remains to be assessed. Strawberry fruit developed with supplementary UV-C were stored at room temperature for 2 weeks. Preharvest UV-C attenuated fruit postharvest senescence and altered phytochemicals composition. Higher ester titer was found in the treated fruit at harvest, whereas higher terpene and furanone contents were detected after 72 h of storage. At harvest, polyphenolics accumulated to a higher level in UV-C group, but the difference disappeared after 24 h of storage. Meanwhile, the intrinsic level of abscisic acid and the expressions of FaPYR1, SnRK2, and FaASR in the UV-C-treated fruit was enhanced at harvest but returned to a lower level as storage proceeded. This study highlights the time-dependent effect of preharvest UV-C on strawberry fruit postharvest biochemical indexes and the possible involvement of abscisic acid signaling factors.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles were synthesised to extract Sudan dyes from chilli powders. The adsorbents used were magnetic ferroferric oxide nanoparticles coated with polystyrene. The extraction procedures for Sudan dyes comprised liquid-solid extraction and magnetic solid phase extraction. The conditions were optimised to achieve efficient magnetic solid phase extraction, including extraction and desorption time, type and volume of the desorption solvent, and the mass of the adsorbents. Repeatability tests showed satisfactory recovery rates of 80.2-115.8%, with a relative standard deviation < 3.8%. The results suggested that the proposed extraction method was effective and efficient to extract Sudan dyes from chilli powders. The extraction process was simpler compared with traditional approaches because the adsorbents can be rapidly removed from the sample matrix using a permanent magnet. The use of recyclable adsorbents decreased the cost greatly. Chilli powder samples collected from local markets in Singapore were tested using the proposed method under optimum conditions.

AB Protein oxidation of beef patties stored in high oxygen modified atmosphere packaging for 9 days was investigated. Meat was either stored in the dark, under light, or in the dark with addition of FeCl2/H2O2/myoglobin (forced oxidation). SDS-PAGE analysis showed high degree of protein polymerization for meat exposed to light, compared to the other samples. Light exposure induced reducible (disulfide) and non-reducible cross-links, while mainly disulfides were formed in meat stored in the dark. Light exposure was responsible for 58% loss of free thiols (Cys residues). No significant loss of other amino acid residues was observed and none of the most common oxidation products of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were detected. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of tryptophan showed 27% loss in samples exposed to light, which was ascribed to loss of protein solubility via protein polymerization rather than tryptophan oxidation. Protein carbonyls were mainly detected in forced oxidized samples at Day 0.

AB This study was undertaken in order to estimate the effect of in vitro propagation on antioxidant activity in strawberry. Results of this research exhibited differences between conventionally and in vitro propagated plants in respect of all traits analyzed. In spite of the decrease in range and mean content of vitamin C and polyphenols as well as antioxidant activity, the genetic gain expressed as percent of mean was higher in microplants regarding phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in contrast to conventional plants (22.39-20.83, 21.79-15.61, 9.52-3.39; resp.). Correlation and path coefficients showed changes of antioxidants inter-relations between micropropagated and conventional plants. Phenolics and vitamin C correlated positively with antioxidant activity in all genotypes. The highest positive direct effect on antioxidant activity was observed via vitamin C in microplants (0.705), while in conventional plants via phenolics (0.834). Flavonoids affected directly and positively antioxidant activity in microplants (0.103) and negatively in conventional plants (-0.143).

AB The chemical compositions and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of anthocyanins extracted from blueberry, blackcurrant and blue honeysuckle fruits and their acid hydrolysates (anthocyanidins) were analysed. Those anthocyanins were glycosidic anthocyanins that converted to anthocyanidins during acid hydrolysis, leading to increases in their alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities (expressed as IC50 values) from 0.232, 0.152 and 0.188 to 0.113 to 0.005 and 0.025 mg/mL. The potential inhibitory mechanism of these anthocyanidins was then investigated through inhibition kinetics, fluorescence quenching and docking simulations. The results showed the following: 1) all anthocyanidins were mixed-type inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase and they bind more tightly to free alpha-glucosidase as compared to the alpha-glucosidase-substrate complex; 2) anthocyanidin inhibition of alpha-glucosidase was a static procedure, presumably driven by hydrophobic associations and hydrogen bonding; and 3) all anthocyanidins were inserted into the active site of alpha-glucosidase and avoided the entrance of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. This study is valuable for anthocyanidins as potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.

AB The aim of this research is to develop, characterize and utilize a multi-layer antibacterial film using chitosan ( CS) and sodium alginate (SA) as biopolymers and cinnamon essential oil (CEO) as main antibacterial ingredients. The dense cross-section of SA layer in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis verified that layer-bylayer method improved physical and mechanical properties of CS-CEO single layer film. The thermogravimetric (TGA) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicated that the layer-by-layer method changed the intermolecular interaction and the thermal stability. Importantly, the multi-layer film exhibited more sustained release and higher retention rate of CEO compared CS-CEO single layer film. The multi-layer coating showed a more significant and lasting inhibition of penicillium expansion which further demonstrated that the layer-bylayer method improved the release and retention of CEO in the multiphased system. To summarize, the multilayer film system is a promising controllable release system for loading essential oils.

AB Traceability and authenticity is crucial to the food safety of scallop. The present study investigated the possibility of using stable isotope analysis to identify the origins and species of scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis, Chlamys farreri, and Argopecten irradians) in the coastal areas of China. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of a total of 575 samples from seven sites around China were determined and additional 150 samples were tested by fisher linear discrimination analysis (LDA) to estimate the accuracy of origin identification and species prediction. The results show that the stable C and N isotope composition differed significantly depending on the origin, season and species of scallops. Meanwhile, the LDA shows that 92% of the samples were correctly classified for origin prediction, and an accuracy of 98.3% was obtained for species prediction. This study reveals that stable isotope ratio is an effective technique to trace the geographical origin and identify the species of scallops.

   DEFINITION
AB vestigated denaturation of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins of pork loins caused by freezing-thawing in relation to freezing rate. Compared to fast freezing, slow freezing caused 28% larger thaw loss, decreased water-holding capacity of myofibrils and increased surface hydrophobicity, indicating more pronounced denaturation of myofibrillar proteins. We here propose a model: In slow freezing protons are concentrated in the unfrozen water resulting in reduced pH in proximity of structural proteins causing protein denaturation. In parallel, large ice crystals are formed outside of muscle fibers resulting in transversal shrinkage. In fast freezing small ice crystals trap protons and cause less severe protein denaturation and reduced thaw loss. Differential scanning calorimetry and tryptophan fluorescence spectra indicated sarcoplasmic protein denaturation in drip due to freezing-thawing. However, sarcoplasmic protein denaturation was independent of freezing rate.

AB The effects of exogenous melatonin treatment on the enzymatic browning and nutritional quality of fresh-cut pear fruit were investigated. Fresh-cut fruit soaked with 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mM melatonin were stored at 4 degrees C. Our results showed that 0.1 mM melatonin treatment was optimal for reducing the surface browning and maintaining the titratable acidity of the fresh-cut fruit, which significantly decreased MDA and H2O2 contents and the growth of microorganism, enhanced total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, and delayed the reduction of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, melatonin treatment at 0.1 mM decreased the expression of genes involving in enzymatic browning pathway including POD, PPO1, PPO5 and LOX1, and reduced PPO activity. Moreover, this treatment increased the expression of PAL and CHS, and enhanced PAL and CHS activities. These results showed that melatonin treatment might be a promising strategy to alleviate browning and improve the nutritional quality of fresh-cut pear fruit.

AB This work evaluated nutritional and organoleptic properties of murta, a Chilean native berry, impregnated with Lactobacillus casei var. rhamnosus and dehydrated by different methods: freeze- (FD), convective- (CD) and vacuum- (VD) drying. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that L. casei localized at the peduncle and near the peduncle of the impregnated fruit. Murta enriched with probiotics contained higher L. casei viable counts after dehydration with FD compared to CD and VD methods. Overall, drying resulted in a decrease in crude fibre and phenolic compounds, which was attributed to L. casei metabolic activity suggesting that murta berries could act as prebiotics for L. casei. Among drying methods, L. casei enriched FD murta presented less alterations in the microstructure, less drying-induced damage and obtained a higher sensory acceptability score than CD and VD murta. Taken together, these results will contribute to the development of functional foods from regional products improving local economy.

ID DELIVERY; LINKING; FIBERS
AB The design of antibacterial-releasing coatings or wrapping materials with controlled drug release capability is a promising strategy to minimise risks of infection and medical device failure in vivo. Collagen fibres have been employed as medical device building block, although they still fail to display controlled release capability, competitive wet-state mechanical properties, and retained triple helix organisation. We investigated this challenge by pursuing a multiscale design approach integrating drug encapsulation, in-situ covalent crosslinking and fibre spinning. By selecting ciprofloxacin (Cip) as a typical antibacterial drug, wet spinning was selected as a triple helix-friendly route towards Cip-encapsulated collagen fibres; whilst in-situ crosslinking of fibre-forming triple helices with 1,3-phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) was hypothesised to yield Ph-Cip pi-pi stacking aromatic interactions and enable controlled drug release. Higher tensile modulus and strength were measured in Ph-crosslinked fibres compared to state-ofthe-art carbodiimide-crosslinked controls. Cip-encapsulated Ph-crosslinked fibres revealed decreased elongation at break and significantly-enhanced drug retention in vitro with respect to Cip-free variants and carbodiimide-crosslinked controls, respectively. This multiscale manufacturing strategy provides new insight aiming at wet spun collagen triple helices with nanoscale-regulated tensile properties and drug release capability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a nanotwinned structure of a two-phase titanium (TC21) alloy was prepared via the martensitic phase transformation method. The TC21 alloy forms initially a single phase beta when the temperature reaches 1050 degrees C. Then, it transitions into an orthorhombic martensite (alpha '') material when quenched in water. After tempering at 500 degrees C, the martensite transforms into a high-density nanotwinned alpha phase material. The hardness of the nanotwinned alloy is 25% higher than that of the TC21 raw material. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ( )Understanding processing-property relationships for directed-energy-deposition (DED) parts remains a major roadblock to widespread process implementation. Herein we investigate the effect of scanning-strategy and testing-orientation on the fatigue response of as-printed Ti6Al4V components. At similar to 10(6) cycles, samples tested in the build-direction exhibited similar to 45% decrease in fatigue strength relative to the horizontally-tested samples, owing to higher overall porosity and the testing orientation relative to residual pores. Samples failing <10(6) cycles demonstrated tortuous surfaces, whereas samples enduring >10(6) cycles exhibited smoother-surfaces. Our results indicate that DED-produced parts can exhibit directionally-dependent fatigue performance, and print-strategy must be taken into consideration for dynamic-loading applications.

AB One strategy to produce nanocellular polymers is the use of nucleating species to promote nucleation. Whereas two-phase systems are widely studied, tri-phasic blends with two nucleating agents are uncommonly investigated. In this work, nanocellular polymers are obtained using tri-phasic blends of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with two nucleating agents: needle-like sepiolites and a polymethylmethacrylate-polybutylacrylate-polymethylmethacrylate (MAM) block copolymer. Blends of PMMA with different concentrations of MAM and a fixed amount of sepiolites are produced by extrusion. Results show that at low MAM contents (1 wt%), the nucleation is a combination of the action of the two additives, but the addition of sepiolites induces the appearance of anisotropic structures. Meanwhile, at high MAM concentrations (10 wt%), MAM nanostructuration controls the nucleation and sepiolites increase the anisotropy. The alignment of the MAM micelles and the sepiolites in the extrusion direction promotes coalescence in this direction, leading to highly anisotropic nanocellular structures. Mean cell sizes of 100-300 nm and an average anisotropy ratio of 2.77 are obtained thanks to the combined effect of MAM and sepiolites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CO2; FOAMS
AB Nanocellular polymers are novel materials characterized by nanometric cell sizes with huge potential in many industrial applications. However, their production is challenging and usually requires demanding processing conditions that make difficult the production at industrial scale. In this work, we prove that nanocellular polymers based on PMMA can be obtained, thanks to the addition of nucleating species, using low saturation pressure (6 MPa) and room saturation temperature in a gas dissolution foaming process. Nanoparticles and block copolymers at different concentrations are used to obtain a collection of nanocellular polymers with densities ranging 0.16-0.58 and cell sizes from 120 to 900 nm. Comparison with the literature results shows that the processing parameters used in this work are the less demanding ever used for producing nanocellular PMMA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mangiferin-loaded F127/PEG micellar systems were evaluated regarding the effect of PEG addition at different molecular weights, where the system with best mangiferin solubility response (0.5 wt% of PEG in 1 wt% F127 aqueous solution) was chosen to be a potential drug delivery system (DDS), which solubilized 7.92 mg dL (1) of mangiferin. Subsequently, the chosen mangiferin-loaded DDS was evaluated in regard the inhibition of enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which showed a more effective inhibition, around 95.42%, when compared to the standard acarbose (92.59%) and to the free-form mangiferin (90.42%). The same micellar system was also evaluated for its cytotoxicity, where no significative values of LDH activity was observed. No study has been done yet with both mangiferin and DDSs regarding in vitro alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This work proposes a "new" alternative towards diabetes treatment.

AB In this study the ultrafine-grained aluminum alloy 6061 of the Al-Mg-Si system with a grain size of 350 nm and a regulated distribution of the secondary hardening phase Mg2Si, processed by equalchannel angular pressing in parallel channels (ECAP-PC), was investigated. Under tensile stress at 160...250 degrees C, this ultrafine-grained structure gives rise to signs of superplastic behavior at lower temperature with a total elongation of 240%, the parameter of strain rate sensitivity (m) equals to 0.31. The forming behavior of ultrafine-grained alloy 6061 at room temperature was studied by Eriksen test method, which is a simulation of cold sheet stamping. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automotive heat exchanger materials with high strength and excellent corrosion resistance performance are highly required due to the increasing demands of weight reduction and fuel economy. In this work, 0.16 wt% Zr was added into a Al-1.5Mn-0.3Fe-0.6Si-0.5Cu(wt.%) alloy for the improvement of the related performance. The microstructure, mechanical properties and electrochemical properties were investigated. The results indicate that Zr addition can decrease grain size and increase the volume fraction of low angle boundaries (LAGBs) in the alloy. The improved strength derives from finer grain sizes and Al3Zr particle. The enhanced pitting corrosion resistance mainly results from the higher volume fraction of LAGBs and smaller grain sizes.

AB This paper reports a nanoflakes-assembled 3D flower-like nickel hydroxidenitrate (NiNH) and its application in water oxidation. It is demonstrated for the first time that the NiNH is an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in alkaline solution. Specifically, it can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(2) at a fairly low overpotential of 280 mV and a correspondent small Tafel slope of 39.6 mV dec(1) . The impressive OER catalytic activity of the as-prepared NiNH can be ascribed to its favorable 3D hierachical microstructure. The present research not only provide us a prospective and costeffective electrocatalyst for water splitting but also affords us an inspiration for designing effective transition-metal based electocatalysts through microstructure regulation.

AB An innovative NiO functionalized Co3O4 hetero-nanocomposite exhibiting an unusual apple-like architecture has been successfully fabricated via a facile two-step chemical route for CO gas sensing applications. The unique mimetic morphology constructed by spike-like NiO nanobundles with sharp tips planted on the surface of the preformed extremely porous Co3O4 nanospheres not only creates specific structural advantages but, more importantly, induces chemical activation required for gas sensing. Higher sensitivity and lower operating temperature are thus obtained for the present NiO-Co3O4 hetero-nanocomposite in comparison with those for the bare Co3O4 nanospheres and also for most reported intrinsic or heterogeneous Co3O4 nano-oxides.

AB A novel severe plastic deformation process (SPD), namely an equal channel angular bending (ECAB), was proposed and successfully applied to thin Mg-3Al-1Zn sheets. Results of microstructure characterization indicate that simultaneous activation of multiple types of twins can be introduced by ECAB, which can refine the grain and efficiently weaken the basal texture. Moreover, the dominant twin types in ECAB are found to be closely related to the imposed deformation paths of ECAB, and profuse extension twinning can be activated under cross shear deformation. After appropriate annealing, the tensile ductility under cross shear deformation is improved with a relative increase of 60.5% to original sheets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
