AB A precise probe that can be applied in a variety of situations, such as both environmental sensor and in vitro imaging, is very attractive and promising. Here, we firstly reported a kind of nitrogen-rich carbon dots (N-CDots) growing during hydrothermal treatment, which emit bright and colorful fluorescence can be utilized as a reliable probe for Ferric ions (Fe3+) detection and bio-imaging. The nitrogen/carbon molar ratio (N/C) in N-CDots is as high as 39.9%. It is the high nitrogen content which provides N-CDots high quantum yield (at excitation wavelength of 365 nm, 400 nm, 440 nm: 34.8%, 27.6%, 22.3%) and thus high sensitivity and bright imaging when detecting Fe3+ and labeling cells, respectively. Regards to Fe3+ detection, the N-CDots show really low detection limit (7.6 nM), high selectivity when 16 kinds of other cationic ions are present and high accuracy to determine the concentration of Fe3+ in tap water. Regards to bio-imaging, the N-CDots showing low toxicity, are successfully loaded into cells and emit colorful florescence in cytoplasm and cytoderm. Furthermore, the N-CDots possess good water dispersibility, excellent photochemical stability and excitation dependent behavior, revealing the big potential for practical applications.

AB We demonstrate the generation of dark solitons (DSs) in erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser based on black phosphorus nanoparticles (BPNPs) for the first time. The side-polished fiber deposited with BPNPs is embedded into the laser to enhance the birefringence and nonlinearity of the laser cavity. In the paper, the saturable absorption property of BPNPs with an optical modulation depth of 5.7% and a saturable intensity of 21.7 MW/cm(2) are experimentally illustrated. After inserting the BPNPs saturable absorber (SA) into EDF laser, the DSs with repetition rate of 14.68 MHz are obtained at a pump power of 90 mW. Our results prove that the BPNPs are the promising candidate materials for generating DSs in EDF laser.

AB We report the new fluorescent polymerizable imidazolium-based ionic liquids for photonics application. We investigate two approaches: one ionic liquid (IL) contains the active fluorescein dianion as an intrinsic part of the polymerizable ionic liquid structure. The second liquid is based on the mixture of polymerizable ionic liquid with optically active europium(III) nitrate hydrate. We demonstrate the polymerization abilities of both liquids by means of electron beam in vacuum conditions. Furthermore, we measure the light emission properties of liquid and polymerized structures. The results reveal that IL with europium(III) nitrate hydrate yields emission spectrum with Eu3+ bands not only as a liquid but also as a polymerized solid microstructure, which is important for its application in active photonics components.

AB Bi2S3/RGO composite materials were prepared by the mean of a facile liquid-phase synthesis method. The morphology and structure characterizations of the Bi2S3/RGO composite materials indicated that the Bi2S3 nanoparticles were well-dispersed on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. The third-order nonlinear optical properties of all materials were measured by using Z-scan technique with a picosecond pulse laser at 532 nm. The Z-scan results showed that both Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/RGO composite materials had reverse saturable absorption and positive nonlinear refraction properties. The enhancement of nonlinear optical properties could be affected by quantum size effect, enhanced charge transfer property and synergistic effect. Our results not only deepen the understanding of Bi2S3/RGO composite materials, but also widen their potential applications in the areas of the optical limiting and optical switches.

The compound 6 present a high response to various stimuli: shows 18 fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield with the increase in viscosity of the medium due to the restriction rotation at 90% glycerol. The boron compound 6 under basic conditions of pH the emission bands exhibited poor emission intensities and when the pH value is adjusted slightly below of neutral pH value, the fluorescence peak exhibited a hypsochromic shift from 421 to 400 nm. In state solid it compound was exposed to compression at 8t (t: metrics tons), its color changed from yellow to dark yellow and it was gradually lost its fluorescence property; this binuclear exhibit the property of reversible thermochromism. Compounds 5-8 have also been investigated using DFf. Computational work shows that the compound 6 has a free rotation about carbon-boron bond.

AB In this study, series of Eu3+-doped LiCa2SrMgV3O12 (LCSMV) phosphors with broad-band emission and color tunable feature were prepared via solid phase reaction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results presented a pure cubic phase product with micron-sized and homogeneous distribution of element. Their spectroscopic properties were investigated systematically by photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra, temperature-dependent PL spectra and luminescence decay curves. The LCSMV phosphors displayed a strong absorption to ultraviolet light and a broad cyan emission. Moreover, in Eu3+- doped LCSMV phosphors, Eu3+ ion characteristic emissions at 589, 610, 651 and 705 nm, attributing to the D-5(0)-> F-7(1),F-7(2), F-7(3) and F-7(4) transitions, were observed. Along with Eu3+ ion concentrations increasing, the emission colors could be readily tuned from cyan to orange and the decay lifetimes of (VO4)(3-) became shorter. Meanwhile, electric dipole-dipole interaction was responsible to energy migration from (VO4)(3-) groups to Eu3+ ions. Further, the quantum efficiency (QE) values were estimated to be 32.5% for LCSMV host and 39.3% for LCSMV: 0.01Eu(3+) sample. Finally, a LED lamp was prepared by integrating the blend of the LCSMV: 0.01Eu(3+) phosphors and commercial blue-emitting BaMgAl10O17:Eu(2+ )phosphors with NUV chip (365 nm) and exhibited warm white light (CCT = 3655 K, Ra = 90), which may be applied in lighting and display field.

AB Recently, low-voltage phototransistors have become promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. In this study, a general strategy for the fabrication of high-performance lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystal (NCs)-based vertical phototransistor (VPT) using graphene as electrode was presented. Within the vertical geometry, channel length was determined by measuring the thickness of NCs thin film, thus enabling the device with ultrashort channel length (213 nm) without expensive lithography. Moreover, a high current density of 863 A cm(-2) was obtained at low voltage. Utilizing the unique tunable Fermi energy (FE) of graphene, the vertical carrier transport could be effectively modulated by the Schottky barrier height between the graphene and PbSe NCs active material. As a result, the device exhibited excellent photoelectric characteristics, including a responsivity of 1.1 x 10(4) A W-1, an external quantum efficiency of 1.7 x 10(6)% a detectivity of 1.3 x 10(10) Jones, and a temporal response of 7 ms at an illumination irradiance of 36 mW cm(-2). Through analysis of energy levels, the carrier transport was modulated by the barrier height at the graphene-PbSe NCs interface, which is attributed to the tunable FE of graphene. Fabrication of VPT with high performance and low energy consumption represents a significant step forward for high-speed opticalswitch applications and future nanoscale complementary circuits.

AB EuPO4 and Eu3+-activated REPO4 (RE = La, Dy, Er) ultrasmall fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of 2.1 nm were prepared via colloidal synthesis and tested for sensing Cu2+ and other heavy-metal ions. The pure monoclinic monazite crystal structure (space group P121/n1) of the synthesized particles was confirmed using X-ray diffraction measurements, and transmission electron microscopy images showed round particles with a narrow particle-size distribution. The NPs exhibited intense red emission, which is characteristic of the f-f electronic transition of Eu3+, and the quenching of their emission in the presence of heavy-metal ions was revealed by dispersing colloidal particles in a TRIS buffer and then performing photoluminescence measurements. Strong quenching of the emission (at a rate of 0.195 mu M-1) was observed upon the addition of Cu2+ ions over the concentration range of 0-10 mu M with a limit of detection of 60 nM for Cu2+. The recovery of nearly 90% of the original emission intensity of the probe was achieved via the addition of ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid and was possible in five quenching/recovery cycles.

AB Planar waveguide LuAG/10 at.%Yb:LuAG/LuAG laser ceramics were fabricated by the tape casting method combined with the vacuum pre-sintering and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-treatment. The morphologies of the raw materials, tapes and green bodies were observed. The microstructure, optical transmittance and the Yb3+ ions distribution of the LuAG/10 at.%Yb:LuAG/LuAG ceramics with different pre-sintering temperatures after HIP post-treatment were mainly studied. The experimental results showed that the average grain size and in-line transmittance of the HIPed ceramics increased with the increase of pre-sintering temperature. For the LuAG/10 at.%Yb:LuAG/LuAG ceramics pre-sintered at 1825 degrees C for 20 h and then HIPed at 1700 degrees C for 3 h under 200 MPa Ar atmosphere, the in-line transmittance of the sample with the thickness of 2 mm was about 74% at 1100 nm and the maximum diffusion distance of Yb3+ was about 166 pm. The bulk and grain boundary diffusion coefficients of Yb3+ ions for the samples pre-sintered at 1775 degrees C-1825 degrees C after HIP post-treatment were calculated by Fick's second law by using the LA-ICP-MS. What's more, CW laser at 1030 nm was demonstrated and the maximum output power of 0.4 W with a slop efficiency of 9.4% was achieved.

AB In the present paper, we report the evolution of Bi2Se3 topological phase from the Bi diffusion into GeSe(2 )layer in the Bi/GeSe(2 )hetero junction film with light and thermal energy. The photo and thermal induced changes in the structural and optical properties of thermally evaporated Bi/GeSe2 bilayer film has been studied by various characterization techniques. The amorphous to crystalline phase transition and the formation of Bi2Se3 topological phase was confirmed from the X-ray diffraction analysis. The deposition as well as diffusion of Bi into GeSe2 layer changed the optical constants like transmitivity, absorption power, optical band gap, Urbach energy, Tauc parameter as studied from UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The transmission power decreased after thermal annealing and laser irradiation where the reverse effect was found in case of absorption coefficient. The optical band gap decreased after diffusion which can be explained on the basis of density of defect states with an increase in disorder. Scanning electron microscopy investigations showed that the surface morphology was influenced by the diffusion phenomena. The Raman analysis also confirms the Bi(2)Se(3 )phase evolution with appropriate vibrational peaks. The modifications in optical parameters with thermal and light induced diffusion can be used in various optical applications using such metal/chalcogenides heterojunction layers.

AB 2-(Naphthalen-2-yl)benzo[d]thiazole meso fused dipyrromethene boron difluoride dyes are synthesised and their linear and non-linear optical properties are studied. The third order nonlinear susceptibility (chi 3) value obtained from the Z-scan experiment is 11.21 x 10(-)(13) and 13.30 x 10(-13) esu. The global hybrid (B3LYP and BHHLYP) and range-separated hybrid (CAM-B3LYP) functional with the basis set 6-311 + + G(d,p) performed better in computing the linear and non-linear optical properties. The computed beta(0) value (56.36 x 10(-30) esu and 48.64 x 10(-30) esu for Kr-OH-BDY and Kr-OMe-BDY respectively) of both the dyes are superior to that of urea (beta(0) = 0.371 x 10(-30) esu). Thermal and reorientational study display the dominating electronic contribution to the linear polarizability (alpha) whereas for first-order hyperpolarizability (beta), pure vibrational contributions found to be more operative in both the dyes. The geometries of the dyes were optimized by using B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) level of theory.

AB Laser-induced damage of ultraviolet (UV) coatings poses a great challenge and restricts its application in space. Coatings prepared by ion beam sputtering are dense and possess high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT), which are absence of structural nodule defects. Subsurface damage defects easily exposed by etching are inevitable under substrate grinding and polishing processes, which are usually ignored in electron-beam evaporation coatings. In our experiments, we find that LIDT of 355-nm high-reflection (HR) coatings sputtered on etched substrates declines dramatically, meanwhile defect density increases. Pits are found on the surface of the substrates and the coatings, and the pits that induce laser damage are very small (submicron-scale). Laser damage morphologies reveal that damage sites are prone to occur around the pits caused by acid etching. Finite element analysis shows consistent results, enhancement of electric field and rise of temperature are obvious, and the most significant part is around the pits, which is prone to induce damage. To conclude, small structural defects are sensitive to laser-induced damage of HR coatings prepared by dual ion beam sputtering (DIBS). This work contributes to finding new ways of improving the LIDT of sputtering coatings.

AB Three novel fluorescent NLOphoric push-pull fluorophores (2a-c) constituted by different cyano containing acceptors linked to morpholine-thiourea (donor) and acenaphthene (rotor) hybrid were synthesized and characterized. They exhibit positive absorption and emission solvatochromism. The solvent polarity function based Lippert-Mataga plot provides the validation of charge transfer (CT) characteristics whereas, Rettig plot furnishes an alternative relaxation channel due to twisting around the sigma-bonds between donor and acceptor on photoexcitation leading to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state in dyes 2a-c. Viscosity induced emission studies show 4.18, 17.61, and 5.30 fold increase in the emission intensity for dyes 2a, 2b, and 2c respectively which recommends these dyes as fluorescent molecular rotors (FMR). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations [(B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p)] give complete information of structural as well as electronic properties of dyes 2a-c. The difference in dipole moment (ca. 4.86-8.23 D) results in a strong non-linear optical (NLO) properties which increases in the order 2a < 2b < 2c. Z-scan studies reveal that the dyes possesses reverse-saturable i.e. positive type of absorption non-linearity resulting in a positive values of beta (2c > 2b > 2a). The lower optical limiting threshold values for dyes 2a-c, made them suitable for the use in the application of NLO materials.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) film and hybrid electrolyte are prepared via sol-gel method to fabricate solid-state electrochromic device (ECD). Electrochromic performance of the ECD has been studied in the near-infrared region. By optimizing the supplied pulse voltages and TiO2 film thickness, the high coloration efficiency (79.4 cm(2)/C at 1000 nm) has been obtained for the ECD under the pulse voltages of +/- 1.6 V. Additionally, the switch time of 16.1 s and 2.8 s is respectively achieved for coloring and bleaching at -1.6 and + 1.6 V. The fast switching speed between bleached and colored states results from the porous structure of solution-based TiO2 film that improves the Li+ ions release/insert. Stable current-cycle behavior has been achieved by cyclic tests with alternating pulse voltages within 2 x 10(4) s, which indicates excellent reversible stability in the ECD.

AB Single-phased Sr4Ca(PO4)2(SiO4):Dy3 +, M+ (M = Li, Na, K) phosphors have been prepared via a solid-state reaction. Their phase structures, photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation spectra (PLE), and decay curves were studied, respectively. Under ultraviolet irradiation, the Sr4Ca(PO4)2(SiO4):Dy3 + samples exhibit a white light emission of the host matrix due to the characteristic blue emission band (480 nm) and yellow-light emission(574 nm) of Dy3+. Furthermore, with incorporating Li +, Na +, or K+ ions as charge compensation agents, the emission intensities were obviously enhanced compared to that of Sr4Ca(PO4) 2(SiO4):Dy3+ due to the charge balance and symmetry adjustment of crystal field. Moreover, thermal quenching luminescence measurement of Sr3.92Li0.04Ca(PO4)2SiO4:0.04Dy3 + exhibits good thermal stability. Therefore, the results reveal that the Sr4Ca(PO4)2(SiO4):Dy3 +, M+ (M = Li, Na, K) phosphors can be used as a potential single-component white light emitter for application in near- UV excited white light emitting diodes (w-LED).

ID BAND-GAP FIBERS; POINT; POWER
AB The Dirac mode in the hollow core photonic crystal fibers (HC-PCFs) traditionally rely on high refractive index glasses with a high air-filling factor. In this paper, the Dirac mode was observed in the modified honeycomb lattice HC-PCFs, which breaks the constraint of refractive index, and can be realized in pure silica glasses for the first time. The band structure of the modified honeycomb lattice was calculated to elaborate the formation process of the Dirac point. The Dirac mode in the HC-PCFs was established at the Dirac frequency outside the bandgaps. In addition, the relationship between the Dirac frequency and the air-filling fraction and the refractive index were also analyzed. This design provides a modified honeycomb lattice HC-PCFs with substantially reduced fabrication effort and expands the application of Dirac mode in the conventional silica-based optical fiber devices.

AB We realize a white light emission based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are loaded with red/yellow/green/blue (R/Y/G/B) primary-colour fluorescent dye molecules. The MOF superset of dye powders emitting red/green/blue light are synthesized via an activated adsorption reaction, whilst the MOF 3 dye powder emitting yellow light is prepared via an in-situ reaction. By grinding these R/Y/G/B MOF superset of dye powders and adjusting the mass proportions of each primary-colour component, a white light emission with a quasi-flat spectrum is obtained. Experimentally, under excitation with an ultraviolet light (at a wavelength of 365 nm), the emission peaks of the R/Y/G/B MOF superset of dye powders are located at 621.0 nm, 560.0 nm, 522.5 nm and 438.5 nm, respectively. When the mass proportions of R/Y/G/B components are 35.3%, 21.2%, 14.7% and 28.8%, the full-width at half-maximum bandwidth of the light emission is 251.5 nm (from 391.5 nm to 643.0 nm), and the 1-dB bandwidth is 201.5 nm. The measured Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are (0.319, 0.341). The flat and wide spectrum of this material makes it a promising candidate in applications such as lighting, display and visible-light communication systems.

AB The influence of small molecule (SM) alpha, omega-di-hexyl-sexithiophene (DH6T) concentration, in the blends of conjugated polymer (CP) poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and DH6T, was investigated in terms of barrier potential reduction and improved photoresponse of the fabricated photoconductor using these blends. Barrier potential in Au/P3HT:DH6T/Au device structure, occurring at the interface of Au (top)/P3HT:DH6Twas estimated by Fowler Nordheim (FN) tunneling model-based analysis of I-V characteristics. The barrier potential of the fabricated device was observed to decrease upon addition of a small quantity of DH6T in comparison to the pristine polymer-based device. This reduction in barrier was attributed to the improved ordering and morphology of the polymer chains upon blending it with an SM. The variation in the ordering of the polymer chains was further confirmed with Photoluminescence spectroscopy, Absorption spectroscopy, and XRD data. Subsequently, it was also observed that only up to a definite SM concentration (25% in this study) ordering of polymer chains improved causing a reduction in barrier potential and subsequent improvement in the photoresponse of the fabricated devices. Finally, it was observed that the optimized blending of CP and SM could to be useful in reducing the effect of penetration of Au inside the CP matrix in the top contact configuration thereby resulting in the reduction of a barrier for carrier injection which is generally lower in the bottom contact configurations. These studies are critical from the point of view of the development of photoconductors and photosensitive top contact organic field effect transistors (OFETs).

AB Carbon dots (CDs) have been regarded as novel heavy-metal-free fluorescent materials because of their prominent optical features. In this work, one type of amphipathic CDs is prepared by facile one-step solvothermal treatment of p-Phenylenediamine. The obtained CDs own numerous surface function groups which endow them prominent dispersibility in different solvents. Absorption, steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy have been adopted to investigate the mutual influence between the surface groups and different solvent molecules on the optical properties of the CDs. Strong solvatochromic behavior with tunable emission from blue to green and strict excitation-independent emission characteristic can be observed when the as-prepared CDs are dissolved in different solvents, suggesting their feasible sensing applications as an alternative of solvatochromic dye molecules. Furthermore, highly selective detection of Cu2+ ions using the as-synthesized CDs as sensing probes is achieved. It is expected that the investigated CDs with solvent-dependent optical properties as well as selective Cu2+ detection may have broad application prospects in bioimaging and biodetecting.

AB The visible-light-responsive inorganic-organic hybrid was prepared by surface modification of commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) with 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The optical absorption of the hybrid material is red-shifted compared to unmodified TiO2 powder due to the surface charge transfer complex (CTC) formation. The experimental results are supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the corresponding model cluster. The calculated electronic excitation spectrum is in agreement with the measured reflection spectrum of surface-modified TiO2 powder with 4-CP. The paramagnetic species, generated in the unmodified and surface modified TiO2 powders upon excitation with ultraviolet and visible light, were identified using low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The formation of trapped electrons (Ti(III) centers) and the persistent oxygen-centered organic radicals indicated the photoinduced electron transfer from the chemisorbed 4-chlorophenol to the conduction band of TiO2.

AB Ce3+ -doped oxyfluoride aluminosilicate glasses and glass ceramics were prepared by a melt-quenching method with subsequent heat treatment, and their spectral and scintillation properties were measured and analyzed. The effects of Na+ ions and glass microcrystallization on the spectral and scintillation properties are discussed. Although Na+ ions were favorable for the formation of glass, their photoluminescence and radioluminescence intensity were relatively low. After microcrystallization, the photoluminescence and radioluminescence intensities of the sodium-free oxyfluoride aluminosilicate glass ceramics increased by 2.3 and 4 times, respectively. Microcrystallization of glass is an effective method to improve the scintillation properties.

AB Through of the technique route of pre-coordination and post-polymerization and final-blend by program controlling from vinyl-functionalized RGB complex monomers [Eu(TTA)(3) (UA)](TTA = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, UAH = Undecenoic acid), [Tb(2-ABA)(3) (UA)] (2-ABAH = 2-Aminobenzoic acid), [Be (BTZ) (MAA)] (BTZ = Benzothiazole, MAA = Methylacrylic acid) with Methyl methacrylate(MMA) to synthesize the monochrome polymers poly(MMA-co-Eu(TTA)(3) (UA)) (abbr. PMEu), poly(MMA-co-Tb(2-ABA) 3 (UA)) (abbr. PMTb), poly(MMA-co- Be (BTZ) (MAA)) (abbr. PMBe), and finally obtain the white-light blend-polymer phosphors by program controlling. The monochrome polymers PMEu, PMTb, PMBe have 1.69, 11.53, 10.57 times of the luminescent intensity as RGB complex monomers. The serial blend polymer phosphors have the emission located in the white light region with the CIE coordinates close to the calculated ones running by the program. When the RGB ratio = 1:1.38:0.46, the experiment coordinates are situated at (0.32, 0.33), being close to the theoretical coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), proving that the program controlling can guide the tuning of the chromaticity of the emission color. The LED device was fabricated by the blend polymer phosphor with the RGB ratio of 1:1.38:0.46 matched with the chip of 365 nm wavelength, the color temperature is 6444 K, the color rendering index 84.2, and the luminance 12740 cd/m(2) at 3.2 V. This research develops an approach of pre-coordination, post-polymerization and final-blend by program controlling that not only improves the luminescent intensity, but also suppresses the energy transfer, and more importantly achieves the precise adjustment to the white light.

Efficient CW laser operation with 9.2 W output power, 46% optical-to-optical and 74% slope efficiencies was demonstrated. Efficient SESAM mode-locked Yb:YAB bulk laser was demonstrated for sigma-polarization with 4 W average output power at 70 MHz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and 195-fs pulse duration resulting in the pulse energy of 57 nJ and pulse peak power of 0.3 MW. Optical-to-optical efficiency of 27% in mode-locked regime is demonstrated. Chirped pulse regenerative amplifier based on Yb:YAB crystal demonstrated with maximum output power of 4.6 W (6 W of chirped pulses and optical-to-optical efficiency of 25%) and 695 fs pulse duration at 100 kHz PRF for the first time to the best of our knowledge.

AB The dysprosium and boron effect on the emission properties of europium-doped SrAl2O4 samples has recently attracted considerable attention due to their high brightness and long afterglow. Here, the influence of both cations, Dy3+ and B3+, on the spectroscopic properties of the europium free samples SrAl2O4:Dy3+ and SrAl2O4:Dy3+, B3+ has been investigated in order to get more insights concerning the mechanism by which they enhance the afterglow. Unique features have been observed in their excitation and emission spectra that show on one hand the lattice defects induced by the replacement of Sr2+ by Dy3+ and proves the existence of different crystallography sites for the Dy3+ ions and on the other hand, the local distortion of the energy levels of Dy3+ ions in the presence of B3+.

AB In this work, Eu3+-doped glass-ceramic materials containing LaF3 nanocrystals (GC Eu3+:LaF3) were fabricated by controlled heat-treatment of precursor xerogels synthesized via low-temperature sol-gel method. In order to characterize the thermal resistance of silica xerogels and to determine the crystallization temperature of LaF3 phase the TG/DSC analysis was performed. The formation of LaF3 nanocrystals in glass-ceramics was confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). In addition, the IR-ATR spectra were registered to identify the types of vibrational modes existing within prepared sol-gel hosts. The photoluminescence behavior of synthesized Eu3+-doped materials was characterized based on PLE (lambda(em) = 611 nm) and PL spectra (lambda(exc) = 393 nm) as well as luminescence decay analysis. The characteristic D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0-4) infra-configurational transitions within 4f(6) manifold of Eu3+ ions were registered in reddish-orange spectral range. In order to estimate the symmetry in local framework around Eu3+ ions the R/O-factor defined as I(D-5(0) -> F-7(2))/I(D-5(0) -> F-7(1)) was calculated. The recorded decay curve for GC Eu3+:LaF3 exhibits bi-exponential profile, what provides the distribution of Eu3+ ions between two local sites with different decay rates.

SO OPTICAL MATERIALS

ID SOLAR-CELLS
AB Nanostructured designs provide new possibilities to improve light absorption in thin film photovoltaic devices. However, the underlying design rules are not well established. Most thin film photovoltaic absorbers are weak dielectrics in which light trapping is a challenge, owing to lower density of admissible trapped waveguide modes. We consider a nanostructured bulk heterojunction as a representative example of the weak dielectric systems. We show using a combination of theoretical simulations and experiments that such a weak dielectric photovoltaic system built on a nanostructured transparent substrate can enhance light trapping via nano-scale morphologies at both the dielectric light entry interface and at the rear absorber-metal electrode interfaces. Our simulations predict an enhancement exceeding 80% in the photocurrent density generated per unit absorber volume, for absorber thickness in the range 100-200 nm. This thickness range appears to be optimal for most thin-film solar cells. Our experiments based on monolithic nanostructured substrates showed good agreement with the predictions of the model. Broadband enhancement in photocurrent was obtained only for thinner absorbers which allowed the formation of nanoscale interfaces on the front and rear interfaces. Further, we have studied the role of the nano-scale curvature through simulations. It was seen that the convex nano-domes result in the best optoelectronic performance with similar to 14% improvement in photocurrent and similar to 15% improvement in the fill factor leading to about 30% improvement in the power conversion efficiency. This is due to an improved absorption in conjunction with about 38% drop in the series resistance. This study shows using that in the case of weak-dielectric absorbers, it is useful to have nanoscale interfaces of optimal curvature at both the front and rear absorber contacts. The associated design rules for simultaneous improvement of optical and electrical performances are established.

AB Mixed-phase and low-symmetry systems are widely observed among uranium oxide materials. Amorphous-U2O7 forms during the calcination of studtite, a uranyl peroxide mineral. Using a genetic algorithm search for stable crystalline phases, we have identified a potentially stable phase of U2O7 that shares structural features with experimentally observed amorphous U2O7 samples. The crystalline structure is expected to undergo a solid solid phase change around 12 GPa.

AB The effect of Nb5+ on the crystallographic structure, electrical properties and the dielectric behaviour of Na(0.5)La(0.5)Cu(3)Ti((4-x))Nb(x)O(12)( )ceramics prepared via the solid-state reaction method were investigated. Rietveld refinement of the powder diffraction data confirmed a cubic, single phase structure with space group Im3. A low frequency Debye-type relaxation is observed for the Nb-doped samples in addition to the usually observed high frequency relaxation. The grain boundary resistance decreased significantly with increasing Nb5+ dopant. The reduced grain boundary resistivity was found to be responsible for the decrease in the potential barrier at the grain boundary as observed from the overall variation of current density-electric field (J-E) characteristics. The dielectric constant at low Frequency is increased with increasing Nb content. The dielectric behaviour of the compound is explained on the basis of the Internal Barrier Layer Capacitance (IBLC) model.

AB The ultra-narrow band perfect metamaterial absorber (PMA) based on dielectric-metal periodic configuration for near infrared spectral region is proposed. The PMA consists of a dielectric resonant structure and a metal substrate. Two design examples show that the proposed PMAs are able to exhibit nonpolarizing absorption peaks at normal and oblique incidences respectively. Moreover, the absorption spectra of the PMA for oblique incidence are insensitive to the incident angle under TE polarized light illumination. But this PMA exhibits a large spectral shift by rotating the angle of incidence under TM polarized light illumination. Then a PMA sample for oblique incidence is fabricated through thin-film deposition and electron beam lithography patterning. Finally, the reflection spectra of the fabricated PMA sample are measured. The absorption spectra obtained by subtracting the measured reflection spectra from incident spectra are consistent with the theory. Thus the novel characteristics of the ultra-narrow band PMA based on dielectric-metal periodic configuration are experimentally demonstrated.

AB Transparent multilayer Nd:YAG ceramics were successfully fabricated by employing an ISOBAM-aqueous tape casting system, followed by oxygen sintering. Homogenous and flexible green tapes were obtained after drying the tapes for > 24 h at room temperature in a controlled humidity chamber maintained at > 60% relative humidity. The de-hindering and sintering processes were performed in a single heat treatment step conducted in an oxygen atmosphere. After sintering and subsequent polishing were performed, high transparency ceramics were obtained without the need for any additional annealing treatment. SEM characterization of the Nd:YAG ceramic sintered at 1750 degrees C for 20h revealed a highly homogeneous microstructure, with an average grain size of approximately 5 mu m. The transmittance of the ceramic was measured to be 77% at the laser emission wavelength of 1063 nm.

AB In-doped ZnO films grown by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis have been studied by means of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The photoluminescence (PL), transmittance and absorbance have been controlled as well. It was shown that the ZnO optical band gap demonstrates the blue high energy shift to 3.31 eV at 300 K and the PL intensity of near band edge (NBE) emission enlarges at In doping 0.5-2.5 at%. Simultaneously, the positions of XRD peaks and their intensities vary insignificantly owing to the difference in the In3+ and Zn2+ ionic radii. Meanwhile, intensity decreasing the green PL band confirms the occupation of the zinc vacancies by In ions with the formation of substitutional In-Zn defects and ZnO crystal quality improving.
   At higher In contents the new PL band (3.034eV) appears in PL spectra and its peak shifts to lower energy with In content increasing. This PL band was attributed to the emission via the complex defects, formed by In-i interstitial atoms. Simultaneously, the PL intensity and ZnO film crystallinity falling down, the ZnO crystal lattice parameters increase and the ZnO optical band gap demonstrates the red low energy shift. To reveal a nature of the optical transition responsible for the new PL band, PL spectra have been studied in the temperature range 11-290 K. The dependence of the In-i complex defect formation versus In contents in ZnO NC films is analyzed and discussed. The optimal In concentration range to fabricate the ZnO films with high optical parameters has been estimated.

AB Eu-doped LiBaPO4 phosphors were synthesized by sol gel route using PVA as the chelating agent. The structure and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as-prepared LiBaPO4 phosphors were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and PL spectroscopy. The samples presented single hexagonal phase and the incorporation of the excess Li did not affect the crystal structure. The luminescence properties of the Eu-doped LiBaPO4 phosphors strongly depend on the Li concentration. It is possible that the Li excess contributes to the Eu3+ -> Eu2+ reduction and enhances the Eu2+ stabilization in the LiBaPO4 structure.

The laser sintering technique consists of using a CO2 laser to thermally activate the sintering process. The YAG:Eu powders were synthesized by a polymeric precursor method and yielded single cubic crystalline phase particles after calcination at 1000 degrees C for 2 h as determined by x-ray diffraction. The laser-sintered ceramics with a total sintering time of 7 min exhibited high relative density and homogeneous microstructure. The photoluminescent spectra of the YAG:Eu laser-sintered ceramics presented the well-know Eu3+ emissions along with two additional bands associated with Eu2+, as confirmed by ?CANES, even when sintered in air.

AB For the first time we report the synthesis of nanocrystalline powders of Na3Al2Li3F12 phase, both pure and doped with Mn4+ using slow room temperature co-precipitation in methanol-water mixtures. Optical properties of obtained highly crystalline nanoparticles with the size in the range of 40-80 nm are studied. The synthesized Mn4+ doped fluoride garnet nanophosphors show typical Mn4+ luminescence spectrum in the red region (620-630 nm) under both photo- and 10 keV electron excitation, which is optimal emission wavelength for red phosphors in warm white LEDs. The relaxation dynamics of Mn4+ luminescence in this host has a complicated nature. Under the intra-centre excitation of Mn4+ ions and charge-transfer band excitation the decay is non exponential in the studied temperature range, which indicates that there exists some additional mechanism of quenching, which is not related to intrinsic thermal quenching of Mn4+ luminescence.

AB The incorporation of small proportions of Cd in ZnO through solid state reaction is proven to be efficient to produce a strong redshift of the blue excited photoluminesce. Due to the diminutive proportion of Cd used, standard X-ray diffractometry is not sensitive to identify the resulting local structural changes, even though proving that long-range order is preserved. Alternatively, they manifest themselves in Raman spectra through the activation of forbidden modes and the strengthening of phonons localization. Through detailed analyzes of photoluminescence data, considering the decomposition of the spectra in emissions of different natures and their modifications as a function of temperature, is shown that the redshift caused by Cd incorporation is a consequence of the strengthening of the contribution of emissions in red-IR range associated to oxygen excess, which is corroborated by quantitative Raman analyses.

AB In this paper, diamagnetic lead borate magneto-optical glasses with an improved Verdet constant, high glassforming ability and good thermal stability were synthesized to meet the design requirements of fiber-optical current transducers (FOCTs). The structure and performance indexes of the glasses were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Verdet constant of the glass samples can reach 0.1757 min/(G cm) at 633 nm, indicating excellent magnetic rotation properties. In practical applications, FOCTs are often used in complex industrial environments that require high temperature stability. To test the temperature dependence of the diamagnetic lead borate glasses, we constructed a dual-lightpath variable-temperature magneto-optical modulation system. The experimental data show that the Verdet constant decreases slowly with increasing ambient temperature; thus, we theoretically analyzed the magneto-optical properties of the diamagnetic glass and the cause of its temperature dependence according to the discrepancy between the experimental results and the Becquerel formulas. We also obtained an empirical formula by fitting the Verdet-temperature curve, thereby providing an evaluation basis and a screening method for further development of FOCT materials.

AB This paper reports on the optical properties of new organic metal halide material [C6N2H5](3) BiCl6. The crystal structure is built up from the packing of distorted [BiCl6](3-) octahedra surrounded by organic cation [C6N2H5](+). Unlike the classical metal halide materials in which organic molecules are optically inactive, both organic and inorganic components in this structure are chromospheres. At ambient temperature, photoluminescence measurements show and intense emission in the yellow green region. This emission is believed to be due to it pi-pi* electronic transition within the organic cation [C6N2H5](+). Optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of this compound were analyzed and interpreted by comparison with those of the homologous hybrids on one hand and those of the organic molecules on the other hand. In addition, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) have shown that the intense emission is governed by a resonance energy and charge transfer process in which [BiCl6](3-) ions is assumed as a donor and organic cation plays the role of an acceptor. Moreover, photoluminescence study as function of temperature using the Arrhenius model, reveals the behavior a quasi-localized exciton with a binding energy of 73 meV, substantially lower than those found for homologous compounds but it reflects the localized character of the exciton and it may explain the stability of the exciton at ambient temperature.

AB The utilization of semiconductor nanocrystals as white light emission source draws intense attention since semiconductor nanocrystals are promising candidates to fabricate new generation light emitting diodes. However, to synthesize high quality white light emitting semiconductor nanocrystals under mild reaction conditions at single step is a challenge. Here, we synthesized tellurium doped cadmium selenide (Te-doped CdSe) nanocrystals by using two phase synthesis method under mild reaction conditions at single step. Random localization of tellurium atoms in cadmium selenide nanocrystals caused emergence of defect state emission. The defect state emission was controlled by tuning initial Te:Se molar ratio in aqueous phase of the two phase system. Luminescence behaviour of Te-doped CdSe nanocrystals was affected by defect state emission and therefore, dual light emission (composition of blue-green light, whitish color) was observed. The Te-doped CdSe had cubic structure with Te composition at most 10% with size ranging around 1.8 nm. The CRI 1931 coordinates of the Te-doped CdSe nanocrystals revealed that Te-doped CdSe nanocrystals can be a powerful constituent for new generation light emitting diodes.

AB An effective strategy to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by infrared radiations (IR) and near infrared radiations (NIR) harvesting, using upconversion crystalline microrods NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ is put forward. NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ crystals were prepared with varying compositions of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ and Tm3+, and then in three different morphologies including small hexagonal microprisms, big hexagonal microprisms and hexagonal microrods for the investigation of the role of composition and morphology on upconversion efficiency. Thus, the crystals with efficient upconversion can be to screened out for doping with TiO2 photoanode of solar cells. Crystalline microrods, synthesized by hydrothermal method, show better upconversion as compared to microprisms prepared in two different sizes. On the other hand, these crystals also show downconversion. Addition of small amount of these microrods in TiO2 electrode of DSSCs increases light harvesting ability of photoanode TiO2 and consequently, photocurrent conversion efficiency is enhanced. Moreover these rare earth ions, being p-type dopant, raise the energy level of the TiO2 film and resultantly increase the photovoltage. Maximum power conversion efficiency 7.03% was achieved at an optimized proportion of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ in TiO2 (by weight). This 7.03% efficiency is 14.7% higher than the efficiency of pure TiO2 photoanode (6.13%). This improvement in efficiency can be credited to upconversion characteristics of doping material.

AB The ETL layer is used to transport electrons and block holes in the perovskite solar cell (PSC), and the uniformity of the dense layer affects the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the battery. The PSC open circuit voltage prepared by the solution method was 0.68 V, and the open circuit voltage of the PSC prepared by the sol method was remarkably improved to 0.95 V. The quality of the perovskite layer is critical for obtaining high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSC). In the process of preparing PSC by sequential deposition, the MAI solution was formed by IPA-n-hexane instead of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as a solvent to grow CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI). The MAPI prepared by the mixed solvent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mixed solvent inhibited the Oswald ripening process, and the perovskite layer showed a uniform and dense morphology. The PL characterization implied that the MAPI film with low defect concentration, which prepared from the mixed solvent. Compared to the single solvent PSC (PCE = 4.2%), the efficiency was significantly improved by 1.5 times to 6.2%.This study provides the possibility to prepare ZnO-based high-efficiency solar cell devices in the air.

AB In recent years, three-dimensional (3-D) printing has presented a new manufacturing paradigm and attracted considerable attention since it allows for products to be fabricated as solid objects by printing successive layers of material following instructions produced through computer-aided design. Here, for the first time, the 3-D printing technology based on fused deposition modeling is demonstrated to be readily useful in the fabrication of a fiberized saturable absorber (SA) intended for use in ultrafast mode-locking of an all-fiberized laser. The fiberized SA was fabricated on a side polished fiber platform by printing a low-cost composite of graphene and polylactic acid (PLA). The insertion loss and modulation depth of the fabricated SA were measured to be similar to 3.8 and 1.2 dB, respectively. The saturation power and the modulation depth for the transverse electric (TE) mode were estimated to be similar to 16 W and similar to 2.2% respectively, while the values for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode were similar to 24 W and similar to 1.5%, respectively. Using the fabricated SA in an erbium fiber ring cavity, stable femtosecond soliton pulses was readily produced at 1560.2 nm. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first experimental demonstration using 3-D printing technology to implement a fiberized saturable absorber.

AB Aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films are deposited by economically-versatile fabrication method of electro-spraying onto two types of substrates glass and silicon wafer, at substrate temperature of 300 degrees C, voltage of 18 kV and emitter to collector distance of 6 cm, Zinc acetate dehydrate dissolved in a mixture of deionized water, ethanol and acetic acid is used for deposition of undoped ZnO film, while for Al-doping one two precursor materials are chosen - aluminum chloride and aluminum nitrate dissolved in ethanol. The doping levels are 5 and 10 wt% and the concentration dependence of films properties is investigated. All films exhibit polycrystalline structure with decreasing crystallites size from 21 nm for undoped films to 19 nm and 17 nm for AZO films doped with 5 and 10 wt% Al, respectively. The shift of the XRD peaks of doped samples towards higher diffraction angles reveals successful incorporation of Al into ZnO lattice. The optical properties are investigated by ellipsometric and photoluminescence measurements. A decrease of refractive index from 1.89 for undoped sample to 1.84 and 1.83 for 5 and 10% AZO films, respectively and an increase of optical band gap from 3.30 eV to 3.40 eV are observed. A substantial decrease of sheet resistance is measured for AZO films: 86 Omega/square and 61 Omega/square for 5 wt % and 10% doped samples, respectively. Simultaneously, the transmittance of the films is kept high. The average values in the visible range for films with thickness of 200 nm are 86% for undoped ones and 84% and 80% for 5 and 10% Al-doped films, respectively. Thus, the applicability of the studied films as transparent conductive electrodes is demonstrated.

AB As synthetized, zinc sulfide (ZnS) quantum dots have very interesting optical properties, such as a high intensity blue emission band. However, they also present a gradual degradation phenomenon dependent on the time under ultraviolet light exposure, called photo corrosion, where the optical properties of the material are severely affected. The photo corrosion process of ZnS quantum dots occurs under UV light exposure and in presence of the environmental humidity and temperature conditions. In order to avoid the degradation of the material, it is proposed to isolate the surface of the particles by protecting them from the environment with a silicon dioxide (SiO2) coating. This coating results in a higher intensity and stable blue light emission. Unlike most of the reported work, the development of this work was carried out following a simple, low temperature and low toxicity synthesis processes, obtaining the desired material with good optical characteristics. The stabilization of the optical properties of the ZnS quantum dots, brings the possibility to be used to develop long-term optical applications, such as UV to visible light conversion for illumination devices or solar cell's efficiency improvement.

AB High quality large-core As-Se chalcogenide fiber was fabricated via a novel extrusion method to peel off the outlayer of the core glass, and thus all the defects, such as deformations, interface bubbles between the core and cladding can be eliminated effectively. The raw materials were purified by the dynamic distilling and the glasses were prepared by the melt-quenching method. The preform was prepared by an improved isolated stacked homemade extrusion (ISE) machine. The fibers coated with polymer protection were drawn out with a core diameter of similar to 240 mu m. The core/cladding ratio of the fiber were kept approximately 1:2, and the optical loss was generally lower than 1.5 dB/m in a wavelength range of 5.6-9.7 mu m, with a minimum value of 0.6 dB/m at 8.3 Rm. The calculated fiber numerical aperture was approximately 0.55. Supercontinuum (SC) generation experiments of fiber at different wavelengths and pump powers were performed. A flattened SC spectrum can be obtained in this large-core fiber with femtosecond pumping.

AB Within this work, the undoped and Ce3+ doped Y2O3-Al2O3 double system crystals were grown from the melt by micro-pulling-down method and their basic luminescent properties have been investigated. Luminescent properties of the obtained crystal samples were studied by cathodo-and thereto-luminescence methods (CL and TL, respectively). The TL spectra were measured after the samples irradiation with both beta and alpha particles. It was found that the obtained cerium doped crystals exhibit dominant emission bands with maxima at around 380 nm in the centers of crystals, and low-intensive satellite band peaked at 560 nm at the boundaries of crystals, what corresponds to the well-known perovskite and garnet phases, respectively. For Y-Lu substituted crystals only the emission band of garnet phase was observed. It tends to suggest that even a small substitution of Y3+ by Lu3+ ions in the host lattice causes a strong suppression of the 380 net luminescence of the perovskite phase. This was also confirmed by TL spectra measurements performed over the different spectral ranges. A good agreement of CL and TL emission spectra suggests that the same emission centers are involved in both processes. The obtained results showed that, besides of the well-known scintillating properties, the materials under study can be also considered as the energy storage phosphors for dosimetric applications.

AB Lithium fluoride (LiF) crystals were irradiated with a proton beam. With nominal beam energies of 3 and 7 MeV, several irradiations were performed which delivered doses ranging from 10(3) to 10(7) Gy. The ionisation produced by the protons in the LiF samples induced the stable formation in the crystalline lattice of colour centres, two types of which, the F-2 and F-3(+) ones, possess broad photoluminescence bands in the red and green, respectively, when optically pumped in the blue at wavelengths close to 450 nm. At both proton energies, measurements of the distinct F-2 and F-3(+) contributions to the emission spectra showed a decrease of the F-3(+) integrated photoluminescence intensity at large doses, say from similar to 10(6)-10(7) Gy on. We try to explain such a behaviour by assuming the formation of absorption and/or quenching centres, and compare the predictions of an ad hoc developed model with experimental data.

AB Organic material (chalcone derivative 4-[(1E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl]phenyl 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonate {4MPMS}) has been grown by solvent evaporation technique. The structural properties have been carried out by powder XRD and single crystal XRD data. The linear optical properties (band gap, extinction co-efficient, optical conductivity and complex dielectric constant) were studied by UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer. In addition, defect states were identified and analyzed by creation of color center mechanism using photo luminescence spectroscopy. In Thermal analysis, crystal (4MPMS) is found to be stable up to 158 degrees C. Hence it may be used for the fabrication of device below the melting point. The electrical properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor) have been carried out. The electronic polarizability is the major contribution for the high frequency dielectric constant values. Therefore, using theoretical aspects, the electronic polarizability values were calculated using Clausius-Mossotti relation as well as band structure approach of Penn model. Laser damage threshold for 4MPMS crystal was determined by using Nd:YAG laser with 532 nm. The nonlinear optical absorption coefficient and third order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi((3))) values are reasonably larger than those of the other chalcone derivative crystals. High second order molecular hyperpolarizability enhances the third order optical nonlinear efficiency. Increased chi((3)) and coupling factor (less than 1/3) indicates that the optical nonlinearity is electronic in origin. The behavior of nonlinear optical absorption curve confirms that the mechanism belongs to reverse saturable absorption (RSA).

AB Low dimensional nanostructures such as 1-D nanoneedles, 2-D nanoplates, and 3-D agglomerated nanospheres have been synthesized by controllable direct precipitation method and tuning of low dimensional structure correlated surface defect state induced luminescence emission from bluish green to bluish white has been studied. Change in concentration of OH- ions in precursors tune the morphology from 3-D to 1-D nanostructures. At low concentration of OH-, coalescence process dominates leading to formation of agglomerated nano-spheres while at intermediate and high concentration of OH-, growth along c-axis is heavily suppressed by adsorption of OH(- )ion over (0001) plane leading to nanoplate formation or by capping of (0001) plane by low energy surface {0110} leading to the formation of nano-needle. Thus, the concentration of OH- ions in precursor tunes the aspect ratio of nanostructures based on adsorption of OH- ions on the polar surface (0001). Nanostructures correlated defect state emission based on available surface for impurity adsorption leading to introduction of surface defect states is established by a change in emission profile of the samples after prolonged storage. The samples were exposed to high energy UV radiation before the storage. Theoretical electroluminescence emission efficiency reveals the effect of structure correlated photoluminescence of ZnO nanopowders on possible device performance if ZnO nanopowders are used for device fabrication. Concentration of OH- ions, dimension of nanostructures, formation of surface defect states and storage of ZnO nanopowders should be optimized to achieve maximum luminescence efficiency for consideration of optoelectronic applications.

AB The present work illustrates a simple and cheap solution-based technique for the preparation of high conductive and transparent electrode based on graphene/carbon nanotube/gold nanoparticles (Gr/CNT/Au NPs) replacing indium tin oxide (ITO). The prepared nanocomposite was applied as anode in flexible polymer solar cells (PSCs). Anode was prepared with spin-coating Gr/CNT/Au NPs solution on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Functionalizing PET substrate guaranteed good adhesion of electrode to substrate and improved mechanical stability in bent condition. Thermal annealing was applied for 30 min and the highest transparency of 69% and lowest sheet resistance of 0.45 k Omega/sq was achieved. Photovoltaic parameters of prepared PSCs were analyzed with different Au NPs concentration in bent and rest condition. Sheet resistance and photovoltaic results confirmed that 17 W% CNT and 15 V% Au NPs solution had the highest short circuit current density (J(sc) = 3.1 rnA/cm(2)), open circuit voltage (V-oc = 1.0 V) and power conversion efficiency (PCE = 0.55%), and showed 139% improvement to Gr/CNT based devices. At 45 degrees of bending, photovoltaic parameters have not changed and it showed excellent mechanical stability of fabricated electrode. Impedance analysis revealed that after Au NPs addition resistance losses between anode and buffer layer decreases from 748 Omega to 423 Omega in GC17 and GCA15 respectively, which shows facilitated charge transfer and reduced charge recombination. Advantages of fabricated electrode is simple process of preparation using solution based technique, environmentally friendly method, excellent mechanical stability and high conductivity and transparency which makes the proposed electrode suitable for roll-to-roll production in optoelectronic devices.

These compounds were both prepared from 1-phenylvinyl-ferrocene and 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione under catalysis of manganese(III) acetate according to the radical addition mechanism. The prominent spectroscopic data of the target stereoisomers were provided by FT-IR, LC-MS, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR techniques, and their stereochemical identification was made primarily by NOESY analysis. The corresponding data (absorbance, transmittance and optical and transport energy gap) were collected from UV-vis studies. The optical properties of the glass slides coated with E-FerCycAc and Z-FerCycAc films were examined and consequently, the optical and transport energy band gap values of the E-FerCycAc were found significantly lower than Z-FerCycAc. The physicochemical and spectroscopic findings (HOMO-LUMO energies, bandgap values, UV-vis, FT-IR, (1) H, and (13) C NMR spectra) were also compared and supported with the acquired DFT calculations.

AB The attention towered the fabrication of graphene nanosheets/polymer composites have gradually boosted in the scientific research since these systems have exhibited improved thermal and mechanical stabilities and nonlinear optical properties compared to the pristine polymer. Herein, graphene nanosheets (GNS) were firstly synthesized through liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of graphite in isopropanol then mixed with epoxy resin (ER) creating a composite of GNS/ER. The properties of the as-obtained structure were evaluated by transmission electron and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopies. The nonlinear optical properties (NLO) of GNS/ER were investigated through single beam Z-scan technique using a continuous-wave (CW) laser beam obtained from a solid-state laser (SDL). The results reveal that GNS/ER composite shows a negative nonlinear refractive index of (-0.26 x 10(-8) cm(2)/W). Optical limiting (OL) measurements were performed on the GNS/ER and the mechanism of the OL is ascribed to the nonlinear refraction (thermal effects). These outcomes specify the potential use of cost-effective produced GNS/ER composite to boost the NLO and OL for future photonic applications.

AB Novel vertical light-emitting diodes (VLEDs) decorated with N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) have been fabricated, based on the metal organic chemical vapor deposition method (MOCVD), wafer bonding technique, laser lift-off (LLO) technique, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching and impregnation processing. There is an obvious luminescence enhancement and resistance reduction for VLEDs after coating N-GQDs. The results show an improvement of light output power (LOP), dependent on the improvement of optical extraction efficiency and current spreading. The improvement of external quantum efficiency (EQE) is mainly owing to the roughened surfaces. Meanwhile, an enhancement of electroluminescence (EL) intensity and photoluminescence (PL) intensity has been achieved when the VLEDs were immersed in 0.9 mg/mL of N-GQDs solution, 4 times that of bare VLEDs. After coating N-GQDs, the performance of VLEDs is greatly improved, which could be attributed to the photons recovered by extracting light from waveguide modes.

AB Fe2+:ZnSe films with high optical quality were fabricated by using electron beam evaporation method. Doping process was completed during crystallization process. Preferential crystalline orientation and phase purity of the ZnSe films were maintained after a certain amount of Fe2+ was doped. Surface morphology investigation shows obviously evolution process of grain size. The absorption peak around 3 mu m was observed through the transmission spectra, indicating the typical E-5 -> T-5(2) transition of Fe2+ that incorporated into ZnSe matrix. Implementation of the grown mirror based on Fe2+:ZnSe in a fiber laser successfully demonstrated high optical quality and application of this kind of thin films.

AB Spectral luminescence parameters of pure and Bi-doped YVO4 microcrystals with different bismuth content (from 0.1 to 20 wt%) are studied in the 4.2-500 K temperature range. The broad photoluminescence band peaked at 570 nm is caused by localized exciton, which is formed by the electronic transition from bismuth to vanadium states. The temperature dependence of luminescence decay kinetics provides additional evidence of the localized exciton luminescence of Bi-doped YVO4. Band structure calculations reveal location of bismuth 6s(2) states above the top of valence band formed by 2p oxygen states by similar to 0.4 eV.

AB Two new zinc complexes were prepared and their electro-optical properties in the fabrication of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) has been demonstrated. The Forster radius (R-F) is in the range of 2.79-2.87 nm, and the recorded absolute quantum yields are in the range from 0.69 to 0.73 for those complexes in the solution state. In this work, for the first time, we investigated the effect of various time measurements on the electron mobility of devices with space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The results of this study showed that mobility of the samples over time has declined. It has been proposed that this is due to increasing at the number of traps density of state (DOS). The results of the simulations were compared with experimental data of the current density-voltage. Finally, a good match between the simulation and experimental results has been achieved.

AB Nonlinear optical and limiting properties of nickel, cobalt metal-organic complexes and ligand (L) {L = N,N'-o-phenylenebis (4-hyrdoxy-salicylideneimine)} were studied using Z-scan technique using Q-switched Nd: YAG laser with nanosecond pulses at 532 nm. The results reveal that metal complexes exhibit large negative nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) of the order of 10(-11) esu. The metal complexes displays large nonlinearity than the ligand due to effective charge delocalization between metal ion and ligand. The magnitude of ground state absorption cross section is small compared to the effective excited-state absorption cross section implying the observed nonlinearity is due to reverse saturable absorption. Further, metal-organic complexes exhibit enhanced optical limiting behaviour at nanosecond laser pulses.

They also show high HOMO energy levels of - 5.44 eV and - 5.57 eV for effective hole injection and transportation from hole-transporting layer to the emitting layer. The non-doped OLEDs using these fluorene-cored derivatives as emitters by means of vacuum deposition process emit pure deep-blue electroluminescence with CIE coordinates of y <= 0.15, achieving maximum luminance efficiencies of 2.59 cd A(-1) for BFCz, 2.87 cd A(-1) for BFPCz.

Experimental results show that compared to BMQWs, the use of SLs in preparing layer allows us to better improve the crystalline quality of active region, trigger the formation and enlargement of V-shape pits at dislocations as well as to facilitate the vertical carrier injection and promote lateral current distribution, which in general leads to the reduced leakage currents, lower operating voltages and enhanced quantum efficiency/wall-plug efficiency.

AB A series of Dy (3+)/Eu3+ ions doped Ca-2(Mg0.75Al0.25)(Si1.75Al0.25)O-7 (denote as CMAS) phosphors were synthesized by conventional high temperature solid-state reaction method. The crystal phase was characterized by X-ray diffraction and crystal structure refinement employed the Rietveled method. The luminescence properties of CMAS host, CMAS:Dy3+/Eu(3+ )and CMAS:Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors were researched. The energy transfer phenomenon from CMAS host to Dy3+/Eu3+ ions in CMAS phosphors and from Dy3+ to Eu3+ ions in co-doped CMAS phosphors was studied and confirmed. The energy transfer efficiency was calculated and the energy transfer mechanism was identified. The color tunability and thermal stability were researched. All the studies of CMAS:Dy3+,Eu3+ phosphors showed a great potential application for solid state lighting and display application.

AB Nonradiative recombination (NRR) centers in GaAs:N delta-doped superlattice (SL) structure grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) are studied by two-wavelength-excited photoluminescence (PL) method. The PL intensity quenching due to the superposition of below-gap excitation (BGE) light at energies of 0.75, 0.80, 0.92, and 0.95 eV and an above-gap excitation (AGE) light either for the GaAs conduction band (1.69 eV) or E_ band excitation (1.45 eV), respectively indicates the existence of NRR centers inside the GaAs:N delta-doped SL and GaAs layers. The AGE density and BGE density dependence of the PL intensity have been studied for both excitation schemes. Recombination model based on two levels has been proposed to interpret the experimental results and energy distribution of NRR centers inside the GaAs:N delta-doped SLs and GaAs layers. The defect-related parameters are estimated systematically by solving the rate equations and fitting the results with the experimental data that give a phenomenological insight into the sample.

AB In this study, a much regular hollow tubular ordered porous structure (Tb3+-Yb3+) SSA/ZnO composite was prepared by hydrothermal method. In the prepared process, an ordered porous zinc oxide was necessarily used as precursor which was prepared by soft template method. The sulfosalicylic acid was used as an organic ligand to provide energy for the energy level transfer of rare earths, which also showed the effect of the structuredirecting agent for the structure. Yb3+ acted as a sensitizer which enhanced the luminescent intensity of Tb. Tb3+ was the luminescent center, it also acted a part of the mineralizer which influenced the morphology of samples. The sample showed a special hollow tubular structure which was assembled from many nanoparticles, and there were the ordered pores in the particles. The sample showed the emission peak at 489, 543, 585 and 620 nm, and the highest emission peak located at 543 nm. The optimum doping ratio of Tb3+ and Yb3+ was determined by the difference in fluorescence intensity. The porous ZnO promoted the emission intensity of rare earth ions, and greatly reduced the use of rare earth.

AB The present paper describes the production via a new modified sol-gel route and the characterization of yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with neodymium ions (Y2O3:Nd3+) aiming applications in temperature sensing of biological systems. The proposed synthesis route uses the chelating capability of natural humic substances present in river water to polymerize the departing metal solution, leading to well-crystalline nanoparticles after calcination at 450 degrees C. The produced samples were characterized by means of differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), optical absorption (OA) and temperature-dependent luminescence. The high values of relative sensitivity (S-r) of the produced Nd-doped Y2O3 nanocrystals indicates the potentialities of these materials for temperature sensing in nanoscale.

AB Novel La0.94Eu0.06Al11O18-x SiO2 luminescent glasses were successfully prepared by containerless processing. All the colorless and transparent glasses had remarkable electric insulation performance and mechanical hardness. The transmittance reached as high as 87% in a wide window from visible to infrared region. All the as-prepared glasses were highly thermally stable, with the glass transition temperature of over 875 degrees C. As the content of SiO2 increased, the glass-forming ability measured using the temperature gap Delta T was almost doubled from 72 degrees C to 140 degrees C. These photonic glasses were efficiently excited by near UV light, exhibiting the strongest D-5(0)-> F-7(2) red emission at 615 nm. The characteristic emission color was confirmed by the Commission International De I'Eclairage chromaticity coordinate (x = 0.61, y = 0.39). In conclusion, La0.94Eu0.06Al11O18-x SiO2 glasses are potentially applicable to near UV-based white light-emitting diodes as red-emitting components and optical devices.

AB High optical quality Tb1-xNdxVO4 (TNV) single crystal with dimensions of empty set29 x 39 mm(3) was grown by the Czochralski (Cz) technique. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was performed, indicating that as-grown crystal belongs to tetragonal system. The optical and magneto-optical properties have been investigated in detail. TNV possesses very high transmittance, especially in the near-infrared region. The Verdet constant of TNV at 1064 nm reaches 71 rad m(-1)T(-1),78% larger than that of reference compound TGG. The high magneto-optical figure of merit and extinction ratio also reveal the superior magneto-optical performances of TNV in comparison with TGG. Measurements of thermal conductivity and laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) were also carried out. These features make Tb1-xNdxVO4 a potential candidate for magneto-optical applications in the near-infrared (NIR) region.

AB We deposited nitrogen doped MgZnO ternary alloys by using Pulsed Laser Deposition technique assisted Radio Frequency plasma beam (RF-PLD) of varied nitrogen/oxygen ratios. We used a Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm wavelength and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The RF incident beam that was used for all deposited samples had a power and an energy density of 100 W and 3 J/cm(2), respectively. The structural and optical properties of deposited colloidals were investigated by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) techniques. As Mg concentration increases, the crystalline quality of the compounds is found to decrease. Furthermore, the band gap increases from 3.37 up to 3.57 eV while increasing the nitrogen/oxygen ratio. The Mg solubility is also shown to increase by 30% in nitrogen doped MgxZn1-xO nanostructures. Segregation of MgO phase in Mg0.3Zn0.7O nanostructures was detected by both XRD and SE. The optical refractive index had values between 1.7 and 2 in visible spectral range, it shows high dependence on both stoichiometry and degree of crystallinity of the compounds.

AB We demonstrate high performance WO3-TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis for the applications in electrochromic devices (ECDs). It is shown that the post-annealing process significantly improves the crystallinity of WO3-TiO2 nanoparticles. The WO3-TiO(2)nanoparticles exhibit a much higher transmittance compared to the conventional TiO2 nanoparticles. The optimized WO3-TiO2 nanoparticles are successfully adopted to the electrochromic devices. The WO3-TiO2-based ECDs show a higher transmittance than the TiO2 based ECDs due to the high transmittance of WO3 -TiO2. In addition, the electrochromic response of the WO3 -TiO2 -based ECDs is much faster than that of the TiO2-based ECDs. The WO3-TiO2-based ECDs show a much higher reflective property compared to the TiO2-based ECDs at the mirror state. These results indicate that the high performance WO3-TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a simple one-step flame spray pyrolysis process can be a promising material for highly efficient ECDs.

AB The localized surface plasmon enhanced luminescence behaviors of a radiating dipole in an all-inorganic perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) by incorporating a gold (Au)-silver (Ag) alloy nanoparticle (NP) in the electronic transport layer are demonstrated. The analyses of finite difference time domain (FDTD) show that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength mainly depends on the size and the material composition of NP. An increase of 25% of the luminescence efficiency can be achieved by selecting the proper size and the Au molar fraction of the alloy NP. This result can be attributed to the match between the LSPR wavelength of NP and emission peak of PeLED. And the luminous performance of PeLED can be improved by optimizing the thickness of functional layers. This finding indicates great potential of Au-Ag alloy nanoparticle in developing the efficiency of PeLEDs and provides a new method for the future improvement of PeLEDs.

AB This work presents the optical and luminescence properties of Dy3+ ions doped gadolinium borogermanate glasses (BGGDx) prepared by conventional melt-quench method in order to investigate their potential utilization as solid state lasers and white light-emitting diodes. The XRD pattern confirms the glassy character of the material. The calculated bonding parameters suggest the ionic bonding character of Dy3+ ions with the local host. The variation of the optical band gaps which were calculated from Tauc method have been correlated with the structural changes in the glass matrix. Using the emission spectra, Judd-Ofelt analysis were performed to determine the various radiative properties for different excited states. Higher branching ratio, optical gain bandwidth and optical gain values of F-4(9)/2 -> H-6(13/2) transition point to the possible laser action of Dy3+ in gadolinium borogermanate glasses in the visible region. The experimental decay times of F-4(9/2) excited state exhibit non-exponential behavior for all concentrations and decrease with increasing Dy3+ ion content. Decay times, multipolar interactions and energy transfer parameters for excited states of Dy3+ ions in BGGDx glasses have been evaluated through Inokuti-Hirayama model. As functions of concentration and excitation wavelength the yellow to blue ratios, CIE chromaticity coordinates (x,y) and correlated color temperatures (CCT) were also evaluated from the luminescence spectra of studied glasses. For all concentrations and excitation wavelengths the (x,y) and CCT values of BGGDx glasses take part in the pure white light region.

AB Ion irradiation is known to create structural disorder and crystallization improvement in the material. In the present study, focus is on the effect of high energy ion beam irradiation on the optical, surface morphological and structural properties of ZrO2 thin films of 200 nm grown on Si and glass substrate by RF sputtering technique. The prepared thin films were annealed at 600 degrees C and irradiated with swift heavy ions (SHI) of 120 MeV Ti9+ ion beam with varied fluences ranging from 5E11 to 2E13 ions/cm(2). SRIM simulation reveals that the electronic energy losses (S-e) dominate over the nuclear energy losses (S-n) and the projected range of the Ti ions was found to be 13.64 mu m. Optical properties were studied by using UV-Vis and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The transmittance of the ZrO2 samples lies in the range of (46-79%) and the Tauc's plot was used to calculate the optical band gap. PL spectroscopy demonstrates the emission spectrum using the excitation wavelength of 310 nm. The influence of SHI irradiation on the surface morphology of ZrO2 thin films was examined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The sectional analysis of AFM images reveals that the grain size decreases with increasing the ion fluences and lies in the range of 51-29 nm. The structural analysis of pristine and irradiated samples was done by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The crystallite size increases for the lower fluence up to 1E12 ions/cm(2) and decreases at higher fluence due to the development of fragmentation by the effect of SHI irradiation. XRD patterns were used to calculate strain, stress, dislocation density and texture coefficient of the ZrO2 samples. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) ensures the presence of Zr and O elements with the atomic fraction of 1: 2 and thickness (200 nm) of the samples was confirmed by simulating the ABS spectrum. The modifications induced in the properties of the ZrO2 thin films were mainly due to the electronic energy losses through the inelastic collision in the target material.

AB We report synthesis and characterization of L-valine capped Sn doped CuO nanoparticles (NPs). Pure and Sn doped CuO NPs were obtained by chemical co-precipitation method and were calcined at 500 degrees C for 2 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows formation of crystalline CuO having monoclinic phase with average particle size of 8 nm. Utraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy attests the formation of NPs and strong blue shift in the excitonic absorption has been observed for both uncalcined and calcined NPs. All samples show broad excitonic absorption in the wavelength range 351-654 nm due to inter band surface states transitions in CuO NPs. Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy confirms the role of L-valine as capping agent. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms Sn doping into CuO. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) attest the formation of CuO NPs having uniform near spherical shape. Third order NLO properties of undoped and Sn doped CuO NPs in the form of colloidal suspension have been investigated using Z-scan technique employing the fundamental wave at 1064 nm of a 7ns mode-locked Nd-YAG laser operating at 10 Hz. Sample with 5% Sn doping is found to possess strong nonlinear optical absorption and refraction due strong quantum confinement effect, TPA, ESA, etc. processess.

AB In this paper, Nd:SrF2 transparent ceramics co-doped with different concentration (from 1 at.% to 5 at.%) of La3+ ions were fabricated by hot-pressed sintering method. La3+ ions as buffer ions were introduced in the Nd:SrF2 nanopowders synthesized by co-precipitation method with the aim of modulating the spectral properties of Nd:SrF2 transparent ceramics. Phase composition, morphologies of nanopowders were measured and spectra properties of the transparent ceramics were analyzed. It was found that the absorption and emission intensity were enhanced and the FWHM of the strongest emission peak located in 1056 nm reached to 28.62 nm after the doping of La3+ ions. The broad bandwidth of Nd,La:SrF2 transparent ceramics are favorable to achieve ultra-short pulse laser output.

AB Far red-emitting Mn4+ activated oxide phosphors based on the substitution of Mn4+ for Sb5+ in the lattice of Sr3LiSbO6 (SLSO) was prepared via solid state reaction process. The phases and micrographs of powders were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The luminescent properties of the samples with varying Mn4+ concentrations were investigated, and the result indicates that prepared phosphor SLSO:Mn4+ can be excited by (UV) light and exhibit intense far red emission at 698 nm. This emission band is well matched with the absorption band of phytochrome P-FR. The mechanism of quenching concentration has been investigated. The thermal stability and thermal quenching concentration of SLSO:Mn4+ were discussed. In addition, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has been tested and calculated. All the above results suggest that the SLSO:Mn4+ phosphors have great potential applications in plant growth n-UV LEDs.

AB Appropriate characterisation methods are necessary to probe the photoluminescence properties of phosphor particles, in order to develop new and more efficient materials and broaden the scope of their application. In this work, experiments show that the relative luminescence signal level of different phosphor particles obtained from studies of bulk powder bears no relation to the relative signal of the same materials when probed as dilute liquid dispersions. Characterisation of particles suspended in a liquid is shown to deliver appropriate spectroscopic data including the photoluminescence emission intensity per particle, allowing the rapid evaluation of phosphors using milligram quantities of powder. This characterisation technique is relevant to applications involving optically thin arrangements of particles as found in, for example, medical bioimaging, thin coatings for lighting, solar cell sensitisation and temperature measurements in fluids. Quantitative benchmark results are reported for the thermographic phosphors BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+, ZnO, Mg4FGeO6:Mn4+, (Sr,Mg)(3)(PO4)(2): Sn2+, Y3Al5O12:Pr3+, La2O2S:Eu3+ and Y3Al5O12:Dy3+.

AB In this work, we have studied theoretically the optical transmissivity spectra in graphene-based quasiperiodic dielectric multilayers made of SiO2 and TiO2 which are juxtaposed in accordance with the Octonacci sequence, with a graphene monolayer between them. Our results show that all the optical spectra are affected, and their band gaps are slightly displaced for high frequencies. We also show that the properties of fractality and self-similarity of the spectra are maintained for high frequencies. We have also analyzed the influence of the incident angle and the chemical potential, and shown that when one changes the chemical potential, there is not an appreciable difference between TE and TM transmission spectra for angles close to the normal incidence. The absorption is also calculated as a function of the frequency, and is shown that sharp peaks will appear at the edges of the allowed band frequencies when we increase the Octonacci generation number. Our model can be used in the study of polarizing filters based on photonic crystals, in order to perform an angular selectivity in the incident light. Also, it is possible to tune the chemical potential of graphene layers and set up an angular selective filter using these phenomena.

ID ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS; CALCIFICATION; SYRINGOMYELIA
AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoiditis ossificans (AO) is a rare condition often associated with previous spine surgery. Here we describe a unique case of a patient affected by ankylosing spondylitis (AS), presenting with progressive neurologic deterioration due to AO. We also review the literature on evaluation and management of patients suffering from AO.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The 65-year-old patient had a history of previous spinal trauma and related thoracolumbar surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiloculated intradural/extramedullary cysts on the posterior surface of the spinal cord at Th9-L1, with clustered nerve roots. Computed tomography, with 3-dimensional reconstruction, demonstrated a likely ossification of both the dura and arachnoid from Th9 to S1. Microsurgical debridement of scar tissue from previous surgery, drilling of posterior ossified plaques at Th11-Th12-L1, and marsupialization and drainage of arachnoid cysts at Th11-Th12 were performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: We submit that AS, spinal trauma, epidural hematoma, and related surgery may be synergistic and independent factors in the etiopatho-genesis of AO. This should be considered in patients with AS and/or a history of spinal surgery who present neurologic worsening.

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions are large space-occupying infarctions involving massive edema, herniation, and frequently death. Survivors are disabled. Management involves medical treatment, with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy and later duraplasty. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether surgery is worthwhile with particular regard to views on quality of life of professionals and patients.
   METHODS: A Medline search was performed with the search terms "decompressive surgery," "craniectomy," "hemicraniectomy," "decompressive hemicraniectomy," and " middle cerebral artery," "MCA," "infarct,*" "stroke,*" "embolus," "emboli," "thrombosis," "occlusion," "infarction," and "middle cerebral artery stroke," A second search was also done for views on postoperative quality of life. Studies retrieved were randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. We compared patients who received only medical treatment with those who had decompressive surgery. Participants were adult patients presenting with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction.
   RESULTS: 270 abstracts were reviewed. 40 articles were identified: 8 randomized controlled trials and 4 observational studies. There were a total of 692 patients: 268 surgical and 424 medical. The 2 groups were comparable, with similar demographics. In most trials, mortality was lower with surgery. However, morbidity tended to be higher, particularly in the elderly population. Morbidity was lower with medical treatment. Twelve articles on postoperative quality of life were reviewed; views differed between professionals, and survivors and caregivers. A patient-level comparison could not be made between all studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical decompression results in lowered mortality but high morbidity, especially in the elderly. There is an increase in Quality Adjusted Life Years but at high costs. Professionals think that surgery is not worth the high disability rate. However, patients and caregivers are satisfied with their postoperative quality of life. Survey data from healthy study participants who are not professionals in stroke care were not available. The decision to treat surgically needs to be decided on an individual basis.

DE Carotid endarterectomy; Malleable metal; Omnidirectional retraction
   supporting ring; Tin alloy
ID SUPPORTING RING
AB OBJECTIVE: To resolve problems with retraction instruments in order to obtain shallow and flat operative field in procedures such as carotid endarterectomy, we developed a new malleable tin alloy omnidirectional retraction supporting (ORS) ring.
   METHODS: The new ORS ring has an ellipse-shaped (major axis: 275 mm; minor axis: 192 mm) bar frame (4 mm x 6 mm). The bar has 22 equidistant outward protrusions (length, 12 mm; diameter, 2.5 mm). The frame is made of tin alloy with approximately 1% silver, which provides sufficient malleability to fit different cervical surgical approaches. Rubber bands ending with hooks are attached around the protrusions. The new ORS ring can be placed closer to the skin surface, and skin incision edges are horizontally retracted by the hooks attached in the desired direction. The hooks are repositioned in a stepwise fashion at deeper layers of the surgical wound following dissection for carotid artery exposure.
   RESULTS: The tin alloy ORS ring was used in 30 carotid endarterectomies. As this ring could be closely positioned in all cases, the real depth of the operative fields (with all instruments in place) was reduced by the omnidirectional horizontal retraction without interference with surgical manipulations. Working on the distal internal carotid artery, such as putting a tacking suture in place and arteriotomy closure, could be easily performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed malleable tin alloy ORS ring can be a valuable instrument for the easy performance of surgery for cervical carotid lesions. Considering its advantages, it is better than conventional retractors and existing stainless steel ORS rings.

ID INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approach is emerging as a valid option for treating selected tumors in the infratemporal fossa. Compared with traditional open approaches, the endoscopic endonasal approach presents more difficulty in controlling bleeding and less choice in surgical instruments for endoscopic tumor dissection, which is often performed with bipolar forceps or steel dissectors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the use of an ultrasonic scalpel device for performing endoscopic endonasal resection of 2 rare infratemporal fossa tumors (mature teratoma and hemangiopericytoma), which has not been reported in the literature so far. We also review the literature on endoscopic ultrasonic scalpel use.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasonically activated scalpel is a safe, effective and simple to use device, which achieved excellent hemostasis and did not damage adjacent neurovascular structures.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present retrospective comparative analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of affected-vertebrae fixation versus short-segment fixation to treat thoracic spinal tuberculosis.
   METHODS: The present study included 110 patients receiving treatment for thoracic spinal tuberculosis at our hospital from January 2006 to June 2013. All cases involved the use of posterior spinal correction, posterior lateral fusion, internal fixation, anterior decompression, radical debridement, and intervertebral supporting bone grafts. The cases were divided by the scope of posterior internal fixation into the affected-vertebrae fixation group (n = 62) and the short-segment fixation group (n = 48). Statistical analysis was used to compare the clinical effectiveness, laboratory test results, and imaging findings.
   RESULTS: The mean surgical blood loss, mean operating time, and mean inpatient expenditures were all significantly less in the affected-vertebrae fixation group than in the short-segment fixation group (P < 0.05). The affected-vertebrae fixation group had a lower mean graft fusion time (5.21 vs. 5.06 months), mean healing time (5.73 vs. 5.91 months), mean degree of correction of thoracic vertebrae kyphosis Cobb angle (16.9 degrees vs. 18.4 degrees), and mean loss of angle (2.6 degrees vs. 2.1 degrees) compared with the short-segment fixation group. However, these differences all lacked statistical significance. Postoperatively, neurological deficits and pain were effectively relieved in all patients, and the lesion had healed at the final follow-up evaluation (>= 5 years postoperatively).
   CONCLUSIONS: As long as the surgical indications are strictly observed, posterior affected-vertebrae fixation in posterior-anterior surgery for thoracic spinal tuberculosis is safe, effective, and feasible; entails minimal surgical trauma; and has a lower inpatient cost.

DE Bibliometric study; Citation analysis; Elderly fracture management; Most
   influential; Odontoid; Odontoid fracture
ID CITED ARTICLES; IMPACT
AB OBJECTIVE: Management of odontoid fractures has improved and evolved due to advancing diagnostic guidelines and understanding of long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to quantify the most frequently cited publications pertaining to odontoid fractures and determine their validity as a tool to practice evidence-based medicine.
   METHODS: A Clarivate Analytics Web of Science search was used to identify all articles related to odontoid fractures. The 50 most cited articles were reviewed. Criteria included the frequency of citation, year of publication, countries of origin, journal, levels of evidence (LOE), article types, and supporting authors and institutions.
   RESULTS: The top 3 most cited papers were " Radiological and anatomical evaluation of the atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation technique" (Madawi 1997), " Atlantoaxial fixation using, plate and screw method: A report of 160 treated patients" (Goel 2002), and " The anatomical suitability of the C1-2 complex for transarticular screw fixation" (Paramore 1996). Spine (n = 13; 26%) was the most common journal, and the most frequent decade was 2000-2009 (n = 18; 36%). The United States was associated with the greatest number of publications, and the most common article type was clinical outcomes (n = 16; 32%). The most recurring LOE was IV (n = 20; 40%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the historical literature pertaining to odontoid fracture management. There is a paucity of high LOE publications regarding this topic, and clinicians should strive to provide more high-level studies. This article can help practitioners navigate the vast body of literature about this topic and identify high-impact publications.

ID SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; CERVICAL-CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the third most common cause of female cancer mortality. It frequently metastasizes to the osseous spine and has been rarely reported to cause cutaneous metastases at gynecologic surgical scars.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old woman with known metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma presented with a pathologic fracture of the L2 vertebra, unrelenting back pain, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and inability to ambulate. The patient elected to undergo an L2 corpectomy with intervertebral cage placement via the right-sided retroperitoneal approach followed by percutaneous L1-L4 pedicle screw instrumentation in the same operative setting. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful. Eight weeks after surgery, both her flank and posterior incisions became painful and swollen. She underwent irrigation and debridement of the right flank incision due to elevated inflammatory markers and concern for surgical site infection. Multiple intraoperative cultures were obtained and were ultimately negative for bacterial or fungal growth. Several weeks later, the patient presented with worsening painful growths of her incisions. Excisional biopsy and debulking of the masses in the operating room revealed squamous cell carcinoma with areas of cystic change and tumor necrosis consistent with progression of the patient's metastatic cervical cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical squamous cell carcinoma can metastasize regionally via surgical planes and manifest as cutaneous lesions. Local metastasis should be included in the differential in cases of postoperative wound complications.

TI Vessel Wall Injury After Stent Retriever Thrombectomy for Internal

AB BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence that stent retriever thrombectomy (SRT) may cause arterial wall damage is increasing, although histopathologic findings focused on vessel wall injury after SRT have not fully been reported in humans.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe an autopsy case of an 82-year-old woman who presented with acute left intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion and received SRT. When we attempted to catheterize the M1 segment of the normal middle cerebral artery (MCA), we were not aware of a duplicated MCA and advanced the microcatheter into the main MCA trunk with a smaller caliber than that of the normal M1 segment. A 6-mm Trevo thrombectomy device was deployed from the main MCA trunk but was insufficiently expanded in the MCA segment. Two passes with a Trevo resulted in failed recanalization. The patient died on postoperative day 4 because of extensive infarction. Autopsy revealed a duplicated MCA and subintimal arterial dissection in the proximal segment of the main MCA trunk. The supraclinoid internal carotid artery also revealed endothelial denudation and mural thrombus.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide a histopathologic report of vessel wall injury after SRT that caused failed recanalization. Anatomic variations of the MCA should be considered when selecting suitable thrombectomy devices in order to avoid vessel wall injury.

AB BACKGROUND: Ischemic symptoms caused by traumatic vertebral artery dissection after cervical maneuvers are treated medically and surgically. This is a report of the infrequently documented occipital to vertebral artery bypass to stop the transient ischemic attacks following traumatic vertebral artery dissection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old man presented with a sudden right posterior neck pain following a sudden neck movement, accompanied by left lower quadrant anopsia and rotational vertigo. The neurologic symptoms had already been resolved on arrival. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography revealed an extracranial vertebral artery dissection with no evidence of cerebral infarction. Although medical therapy was initiated, he repeatedly complained of ischemic symptoms. A bypass was performed from the occipital artery to the atlas loop of the vertebral artery with distal occlusion of the lesion. The patient was neurologically intact after the surgery, and magnetic resonance imaging showed no cerebral infarction.
   CONCLUSION: A bypass from the occipital artery to the atlas loop of the vertebral artery is an effective procedure for traumatic extracranial vertebral artery dissection with ischemic symptoms.

AB The combined transpetrosal approach enables wide exposure around the petroclival region by lifting of the middle fossa dura and cutting of the tentorium. However, interruption of the venous drainage on the middle skull base during the transpetrosal approach has been reported to lead to temporal lobe damage. 1,2 Video 1 demonstrates a microsurgical technique for the preservation of various venous drainage in the middle fossa including the sphenobasal and sphenopetrosal veins during the combined transpetrosal approach for treatment of a petroclival meningioma. The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a petroclival meningioma extending into the cavernous sinus. The superficial middle cerebral vein drained into the foramen ovale as the sphenobasal vein, and the sphenopetrosal vein draining into the superior petrosal sinus coursed on the middle skull base. A developed middle meningeal vein was also identified on the middle skull base. While preserving the venous drainage in the middle fossa by a modified incision of the middle fossa dura, sufficient decompression of the brainstem was achieved by removal of the cisternal part of the tumor. The patient developed diplopia after the surgery, but her headache and dizziness were improved without other neurologic deficits. The patient's diplopia improved within 1 year after the surgery, without any other neurologic deficits or tumor regrowth during the follow-up period of 3 years. Informed consent was obtained from the patient.

ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MENINGEAL HEMANGIOPERICYTOMA; MANAGEMENT;
   NEOPLASMS; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare vascular tumors that resemble meningiomas on imaging and have a high rate of local recurrence and metastases. There remains a paucity of data to guide management decisions of intraspinal dissemination of HPCs in the literature, and none specifically related to anaplastic HPCs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 34-year-old woman with locally and distantly recurrent anaplastic HPC (World Health Organization grade III). She initially presented with tinnitus in her right ear. A well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing lesion was identified in the right cerebellopontine angle. Treatment consisted of subtotal resection and postoperative radiation therapy (RT) to a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After a 3-year disease-free interval, 7 lesions recurred intra- and extracranially. The extracranial lesions were drop metastases of the original HPC through the cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal canal. Of note, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography scan was not sensitive enough to detect these new lesions. The intracranial recurrence was on the edge of the prior radiotherapy field, representing a marginal failure having received less than 50 Gy. The intracranial recurrences were treated with salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with local control. She underwent intradural extramedullary hemilaminectomy of a thoracic spine metastasis followed by fractionated proton beam therapy (PBT) with a boost to unresected lesions. Within a few months of PBT, she became pregnant. Pregnancy did not affect recurrence or ameliorate tumor growth.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report discusses the role genetics, adjuvant RT, SRS, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET scan played in this unique clinical scenario of anaplastic HPC.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical intervention in a case of internal carotid artery stenosis with moyamoya vessels has not been well described. We present a case with detailed description of the surgical procedure and perioperative management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old man with symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis had concurrent moyamoya vessels intracranially. He had motor weakness and numbness in the left upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an ischemic lesion in the right frontal lobe and right chronic subdural hematoma. On day 18 after surgery for subdural hematoma, carotid artery stenting was performed under proximal balloon protection and distal filter protection. After carotid artery stenting, systolic blood pressure was maintained at <120 mm Hg. Hyperperfusion syndrome or hemorrhagic complication did not occur. The patient was discharged without any neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our patient with internal carotid artery stenosis with moyamoya vessels, strict control of blood pressure likely contributed to prevention of hyperperfusion syndrome or hemorrhagic complications.

DE De novo disc prolapse; Discography; Inside-out PELD; Percutaneous
   endoscopic lumbar discectomy
AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is regarded as an alternative treatment for lumbar disc herniation. Although the indication for PELD has expanded with remarkable evolution of the technique, sometimes unexpected complications have occurred during PELD. We report 3 cases of de novo disc prolapse during PELD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In 3 patients who underwent PELD for lumbar disc herniation with local anesthesia, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated newly developed up-migrated disc herniation. Compared with their preoperative states, these patients experienced decreased intensity of both leg and back pain. There were no neurologic deficits. PELD was repeated for L1-L2 disc herniation only to relieve compression of the conus medullaris.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence was very low (0.3%) and the lesions were nonsymptomatic, de novo disc prolapse may be associated with an inside-out PELD technique. Discography and insertion of the obturator should be handled gently. The possibility of de novo disc prolapse should be kept in mind when performing PELD.

DT Article
DE Chronic occlusion; Distal occlusion; Ischemic stroke; Mechanical
   thrombectomy
AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular therapy has been increasingly recommended for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation. However, occlusions of the distal cerebral artery are not uncommon and may cause clinical deficits, especially when combined with ipsilateral chronic large vessel occlusion. Therefore in this patient population, the recognition of chronic occlusion and recanalization of the distal occlusive artery might be of great value for flow compensation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old male with a history of stroke was transferred to the emergency department with a severe right hemiplegia and aphasia syndrome. Head computed tomography demonstrated an old infarction focus of the left basal ganglia, and digital subtraction angiography revealed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). After careful attempts, the microguidewire could not pass through the left MCA. On consideration of the patient's previous stroke history and the angiographic neovascularization, the left MCA was recognized as a chronic occlusion and its territory was supposed to be partly compensated by the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA). A super-selective angiography of the left ACA demonstrated an occlusion of the callosomarginal artery. After a mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever, an angiogram showed complete recanalization and good antegrade reperfusion of the ACA supplying the partial MCA territory. The patient had a positive prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The recognition of chronic occlusion is crucial during acute mechanical thrombectomy, and distal thrombectomy may be beneficial after a careful full-scale assessment.

AB OBJECTIVE: High-grade stenoses of the common carotid artery (CCA) are rare and represent a therapeutic dilemma for the treating physician. Endovascular treatment through antegrade access has been proposed as a less invasive treatment option. The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on such a procedure.
   METHODS: A meta-analysis of all studies reporting on endovascular treatment for the treatment of CCA was performed.
   RESULTS: Six studies, including 227 patients, were identified. Forty-nine percent of the patients were male, and 55% symptomatic. Lesions were located in CCA in 237 cases, in innominate artery in 4 cases, combined with internal carotid artery in 28 and subclavian artery in 5 cases. The reported technical success of the procedure was 97.9%. In the 234 successful endovascular treatments, a stent was implanted. Thirty-day mortality and stroke rate were 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 8.4 to 31.7 months, 4 patients presented symptoms of cerebral ischemia and 18 died (none related to the procedure). Thirty-one patients developed restenosis of the CCA lesion; successful repercutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in 9 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reported the largest collection of patients having undergone endovascular treatment of CCA stenosis or occlusion. Results from this study showed that 30-day mortality and stroke rate were 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The procedure is absolutely effective, and no significant change of stroke was found with or without an embolic protection device. In sum, balloon angioplasty with stenting of the component of this disease should be pursued to decrease the risk of stroke.

AB OBJECTIVE: Gender disparity in academic and organizational settings has been the topic of numerous studies and they have tried to extract its causes using H-index as the prime metric. The primary objective of our study was to assess gender disparity in leadership positions in neurosurgical societies worldwide. A second objective was to evaluate scholarly output among neurosurgeons in neurosurgical societies worldwide, utilizing H-index as a predominant metric.
   METHODS: The World Federation of Neurosurgeons database was used to gather details on the neurosurgical societies present worldwide. Online data present for leadership positions were extracted from each of the respective societies. Neurosurgeons holding leadership positions were arranged according to their academic and hierarchical ranks. The Scopus database was used to calculate H-index along with other bibliometric variables.
   RESULTS: H-index was statistically significant between both genders, with male neurosurgeons having significantly higher H-index than female neurosurgeons. A positive correlation was also found between H-index and academic ranks of neurosurgeons. However, no statistical significance was found between H-index and executive committee positions. Female neurosurgeons held 29% executive committee positions globally.
   CONCLUSIONS: A paucity of female neurosurgeons was seen in leadership positions in neurosurgical societies worldwide. Significant disparity present in research productivity between genders is a highlighted statistic further discussed in this study, considering variables such as H-index among others. The increase in female neurosurgeons to neurosurgical organizational echelons can be achieved by enhancing institutionalized support, setting up networking platforms, and identifying mentorship opportunities for prospective leaders.

ID SPLIT CORD MALFORMATION; TETHERED CORD; PROPOSAL
AB BACKGROUND: Split cord malformation (SCM) is a rare congenital anomaly of the spinal cord. Rarely, SCM coexists with a variety of dysraphic pathologies that occur at the same or different spinal level in a patient. Exceptionally rare is the occurrence of SCM type 1 and lipomeningomyelocele of each hemicord.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-month-old girl presented with gradually progressive, painless swelling in the lower back since birth. Spinal imaging showed the presence of type I SCM associated with lipomeningomyelocele of each hemicord. Surgical exploration and detethering was done.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of such complex cases of spinal dysraphism is challenging. Delineating their embryologic basis, detailed radiologic assessment, and meticulous microneurosurgical techniques are the cornerstone for successful management.

TI Superficial Siderosis Associated with Craniopharyngioma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Craniopharyngioma; Endoscopic endonasal approach; Superficial siderosis
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Superficial siderosis (SS) associated with craniopharyngioma is an extremely rare occurrence. To our knowledge, only 3 cases have been reported in literature. Two of the cases occurred following resection of the tumor. Similar to the present case, 1 of the cases was discovered before surgical intervention, "pure tumor-related" SS. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcome are discussed in this article.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man presented with an 11-month history of left-sided tinnitus, hearing impairment, and a 2-month history of visual disturbance. Cerebellar ataxia and gait disturbance were found on examination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with SS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis before surgery revealed xanthochromia confirming an existing chronic sustainable subarachnoid hemorrhage. He underwent a tumor resection in endoscopic endonasal approach followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. On follow-up, the visual symptoms resulting from craniopharyngioma subsided, whereas hearing impairment, cerebellar ataxia, and gait disturbance associated with SS did not progress but were unchanged despite subsequent evidence of watery-clear CSF.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, SS could be associated with craniopharyngioma on the basis of CSF findings and clinical symptoms. Detection and early treatment aimed at eliminating the bleeding source offer the best chance of halting the disease process.

AB Large broad-based basilar artery (BA) apex aneurysms involving multiple arterial origins are complex lesions commonly not amenable to direct clipping or endovascular management. BA proximal (Hunterian) occlusion with extracranial-to-intracranial bypass is a supported strategy if 1 or both posterior communicating arteries are small. Hunterian ligation risks sudden aneurysm thrombosis and thromboembolism in the perforator-rich BA apex. There currently exist no guidelines for antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after Hunterian ligation for complex BA apex aneurysm treatment. We present a literature review and an illustrative case of an 18-year-old man who presented with progressive headaches and was found to have a large unruptured BA apex aneurysm involving the origins of the bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. Given the small posterior communicating arteries and complexity of the aneurysm, proximal BA occlusion with unilateral superficial temporal artery-to-superior cerebellar artery bypass was recommended. Despite antiplatelet treatment with acetylsalicylic acid before and after operation, the patient experienced acute ischemia of the brainstem and cerebellum and an embolic left temporal lobe infarct. The patient received dual antiplatelet therapy starting on postoperative day 6, after which he experienced no new infarcts and made a significant neurologic recovery. The current evidence suggests that proximal BA occlusion in complex BA apex aneurysm cases is thrombogenic and can be especially dangerous if thrombosis occurs suddenly in aneurysms without pre-existing intraluminal thrombus. Dual antiplatelet therapy during the first postoperative week presents a possible strategy for reducing the risk of ischemia due to sudden aneurysm thrombosis.

ID MULTIPLE BRAIN METASTASES; PHASE-II; SCHWANNOMA; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcomas. MPNST intracranial metastasis is exceedingly rare with only 22 documented cases in the literature and, to our knowledge, only 1 case with intraparenchymal brain metastasis. Most have been managed surgically; however, 2 documented cases were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Excluding this case report, there are no other documented cases of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to treat MPNST brain metastasis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old man with MPNST of the lung initially underwent tumor resection. He developed multiple systemic metastases that were managed with directed radiation therapy. A parietal brain metastasis was treated with linear accelerator-based SRS. Following SRS therapy, the patient was treated with a tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitor. Complete resolution of brain metastasis was seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging 5 months after treatment with SRS. At 11 months after SRS, there was no evidence of recurrence or progression of the intraparenchymal disease. The patient continued to have stable extracranial disease on his ninth cycle of systemic treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report provides important insights into efficacy of linear accelerator-based SRS to treat MPNST brain metastases.

DE Antifibrinolytic agent; Brain hemorrhage; Tranexamic acid; Traumatic
   brain injury
ID HEMORRHAGE; PREVENTION; CARE
AB OBJECTIVE: Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces hemorrhage volume and consequently the need for operative intervention. However, its effectiveness and safety in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unclear. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TXA in patients with TBI.
   METHODS: In July 2018, a systematic search for studies including patients with TBI treated with TXA was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. Only related randomized controlled trials were included. Main outcomes included hematoma expansion, surgery rate, death rate, neurologic outcome, and any thrombosis events.
   RESULTS: Of the identified 426 studies, 5 randomized controlled trials involving 917 patients met our inclusion criteria. For hematoma expansion, pooled results showed that TXA significantly decreased hemorrhage growth rate and total hemorrhage growth in patients with TBI. Regarding clinical outcomes, pooled results of surgery, mortality, and neurologic outcome showed no significant difference between the groups, and rate of thrombosis events was similar. Following sensitivity analysis, one study was excluded due to low quality. Then, results of TXA effect on mortality and neurologic outcomes became significant. We confirm that the earlier the TXA treatment is performed, the smaller the size of hematoma will be.
   CONCLUSIONS: TXA demonstrates significant effect in reducing the risk of hematoma expansion by lowering the mortality rate and improving favorable neurologic outcomes in patients with TBI while not affecting thrombosis event rates. In addition, early TXA treatment is more effective in decreasing hematomas.

DT Article
DE Stereotactic radiosurgery; Tethered effect; Transient tumor expansion;
   Trigeminal neuralgia; Vestibular schwannoma
ID GAMMA-KNIFE SURGERY; EXPANSION
AB BACKGROUND: Compression of the trigeminal nerve by vessels and tumors causes trigeminal neuralgia. However, a tethering effect, provoking an abnormal root-stretching force, has been previously reported to play a role in trigeminal nerve hyperexcitability. We report 2 patients with vestibular schwannomas treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who presented with typical manifestations of trigeminal neuralgia after tumor shrinkage. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms of trigeminal neuralgia.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients without a history of trigeminal dysfunction, including trigeminal neuralgia, underwent SRS for vestibular schwannomas. Both patients demonstrated tumor shrinkage after transient tumor expansion following SRS. Neither patient presented with facial pain or dysesthesia at the time of peak tumor volume. However, trigeminal neuralgia occurred after tumor shrinkage. One patient underwent surgery, as the neuralgia was refractory to medical treatment; although the trigeminal nerve was adhered and tethered to the tumor, no neurovascular conflict was identified between the tumor and the nerve. We removed the tumor partially, dissecting between the nerve and the tumor, and relieved the tethered effect. Trigeminal neuralgia was relieved without medication after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present cases demonstrate a tethered effect of tumor shrinkage after SRS, which was considered to play a role in trigeminal neuralgia. Surgical dissection surrounding the nerve root is effective for medically resistant neuralgia, even if the tumor shrinks. Partial tumor removal is adequate in such cases, as the tumor has been controlled by radiosurgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Nanotechnology is a promising field with numerous applications across various branches of medicine. The unique innate physical, chemical, and biological properties of nanoparticles enable them to serve as appropriate agents performing diverse functions at cellular and subcellular levels. Spinal pathologies constitute one major field where its applications are being explored.
   METHODS: A critical review of literature was performed to identify the current role of nanotechnology in spine surgery. A PubMed search was done using the following key words: "nanotechnology in neurosurgery," "nanotechnology in surgery," "nanotechnology in spine," "nanotechnology in spine surgery," "nanotechnology in disc regeneration," "nanotechnology in spinal injury," "nanotechnology in spinal cord regeneration," "nanotechnology in spine fusion," "nanotechnology in osteoporosis," "nanotechnology in spinal drug delivery," and "nanotechnology in spinal infection." Initial search revealed 347 articles. Articles were further screened. Duplicate articles, articles on non-nanotechnologic topics, nonspine articles, or articles with details not pertaining to the current field of interest and non-English language studies were excluded.
   RESULTS: A total of 76 articles were finally included. Nanotechnologic advancements in spine surgery include applications in spinal fusion, central nervous system drug delivery, neuronal regeneration, disk regeneration, spinal infection prophylaxis, management of osteoporosis, sutureless vascular anastomosis, molecular imaging, and theranostic medicine.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nanotechnology in spine surgery is still in its early stages. Eventually, we may see the implementation of nanotechnology as an alternative to existing treatment options. Concerns regarding safety of this technology need to be addressed through future research projects. Although promising, the exact role of nanotechnology in spine surgery remains to be seen.

   A 55-year-old female presented with diplopia, partial ptosis, and facial dysesthesia in the left ophthalmic territory. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion in the left cavernous sinus. Microsurgical resection was performed through an approach that included a fronto-orbital craniotomy, an extradural clinoidectomy, and intradural resection of the lesion through the anteromedial triangle. This maneuver expands the optic-carotid and carotid-oculomotor space, therefore the operative corridor.(1,2) Both the carotid and optic nerves are untethering and can be gently and safely mobilized. The result of the histopathologic study was hemangioma.
   Despite the complex anatomy and surgical challenges, it is possible to treat lesions in the cavernous sinus region without causing major deficits, mainly in the nonmeningioma tumors. This is why it is important to choose a safe route to the sinus, such as the anteromedial or Parkinson triangle.(3)

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review

   Pathologic laughter; Petroclival meningioma
ID TRIGEMINAL SCHWANNOMA; BRAIN-STEM
AB BACKGROUND: Pathologic laughter is inappropriate, involuntary, and unmotivated laughter episodes that may or may not be associated with mirth or amusement. Although associated with many diffuse brain pathologies, its association with intracranial focal mass lesions causing ventrolateral brainstem compression, like petroclival meningioma, is very rare. The exact pathophysiology of this interesting and unusual clinical symptom is unknown, but probably involves disinhibition and release of the so-called coordination center located in the upper brainstem due to compression by the tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of inappropriate and involuntary laughter, which significantly affected her quality of life, for 2 years. These episodes did not resolve, and a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a giant petroclival meningioma causing upper brainstem compression. Near-total excision of the tumor was done using an extended middle fossa approach. To our surprise, the pathologic laughter subsided immediately after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic laughter may be the only symptom of a focal mass lesion causing ventrolateral upper brainstem compression, like petroclival meningioma, well before other neurological sign/symptoms appear. Tumors causing ventral brainstem compression must be ruled out before the patient is sent for a psychiatric evaluation.

DT Article
DE Anatomy; Cervical atlas; Regional circulation; Spine; Variations
ID VERTEBRAL ARTERY; GROOVE; PREVALENCE
AB BACKGROUND: The retrotransverse foramen (RTF) is a nonmetric variant of the atlas vertebra that consists of an abnormal accessory foramen located on the posterior root of the transverse process and it extends from the posterior root of the transverse process to the root of the posterior arch. Its presence has been related to regional variations of the venous circulation. It is currently unknown whether the RTF is a modern or an ancient anatomic variation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We analyzed the skeletal remains from the late-ancient Roman necropolis (II-VI centuries AD) of La Boatella (Valencia, Spain) and we found a well-preserved individual skeleton that presented with a left retrotransverse foramen in C1.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RTF is not a modern anatomic variation. As a result, ancient individuals had the same modifications in the regional circulation as modern subjects present today.

TI Bundled Payment Models in Spine Surgery: Current Challenges and

   FUSION; COSTS; REIMBURSEMENT; COMPLICATIONS; ANTERIOR; TEXAS
AB BACKGROUND: Bundled payments offer a lump sum for management of particular conditions over a specified period that has the potential to reduce health care payments. In addition, bundled payments represent a shift toward patient-centered reimbursement, which has the upside of improved care coordination among providers and may lead to improved outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE: To review the challenges and sources of payment variation and opportunities for restructuring bundled payments plans in the context of spine surgery.
   METHODS: We reviewed episodes of care over the past 10 years. We completed a search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study Design) model in PubMed and Ovid databases to identify studies that met our search criteria.
   RESULTS: Ten studies met the search criteria, which were retrospective in design. The primary recipient of reimbursement was the hospital associated with the index procedure (59.7%-77% of the bundled payment), followed by surgeon reimbursement (12.8%-14%) and post-acute care rehabilitation (3.6%-7.3%). On average, the index hospitalization was $32,467, ranging from $11,880 to $107,642, depending on number of levels fused, complications, and malignancy. Readmission was shown to increase the 90-day payment by 50%-200% for uncomplicated fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of spine surgery in bundled payment models offers opportunity for health care cost reduction. Patient heterogeneity, complications, and index hospitalization pricing are among factors that contribute to the challenge of payment variation. Development of standard care pathways, multidisciplinary coordination between inpatient and outpatient postoperative care, and empowerment of patients are also key elements of progress in the evolution of bundled payments in spine surgery. We anticipate more individualized risk-adjusted prediction models of payment for spine surgery, contributing to more manageable variation in payment and favorable models of bundled payments for payers and providers.

   FORMATION; RUPTURE; ENLARGEMENT; PROGRESSION; ORIGIN
AB BACKGROUND: Infundibular dilations are funnel-shaped widenings at the origin of a cerebral artery, most commonly the posterior communicating artery. Controversy exists as to whether an infundibulum represents a normal anatomic variant or a lesion with the potential for rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   METHODS: We reviewed all reported cases of infundibular dilations and SAH in the world literature and present an illustrative case.
   RESULTS: Most infundibula in the context of SAH were associated with an aneurysm either on or near an infundibulum. However, there have been 7 reports in which the infundibulum could have been the primary site of rupture and no associated aneurysm was identified. Close review reveals significant limitations of those 7 reports.
   CONCLUSIONS: The literature, and our own experience, do not support the treatment of infundibula, even in SAH patients. Treatment should be directed toward an associated aneurysm, not the infundibulum.

ID CONSENSUS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CRITERIA; ANGIITIS
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasculitis owing to chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is very rare. To our knowledge, only 2 cases have been reported. We describe the first case of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass for cerebral vasculitis owing to GVHD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old woman presented with right upper extremity weakness and dysarthria 33 months after undergoing matching allogenic bone marrow transplantation. The patient had STA-MCA bypass for MCA occlusion and resting cerebral blood flow in the left MCA area improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanism of cerebral vasculitis after chronic GVHD is not known, cerebral vasculitis that causes cerebrovascular disease long after bone marrow transplantation should be considered. In this case, an STA-MCA bypass was efficient for the repeated ischemic attacks owing to cerebral vasculitis. Moreover, it is important to select the optimal recipient vessels to area originated neurologic symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) remains a common neurodegenerative disorder. Functional neurosurgery largely arose with the introduction of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a potential option for PD unresponsive to medical management. Biomarkers are clinical and laboratory indicators of therapeutic success or failure.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the current and published literature relating to the development and use of biomarkers in monitoring and determining the efficacy of DBS in PD.
   METHODS: The PubMed database was systematically searched using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systemic reviews. Studies that examined current or potential biomarkers measurable after DBS were included. Articles from 1952 to date were examined.
   RESULTS: The initial search identified 49 articles. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles were subdivided into those addressing biomarkers with proven clinical usefulness and potential biomarkers that have future application.
   CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers have been identified that can help to determine the effect of DBS on patients with PD. Current studies show that there are measured differences in electrophysiologic oscillations, gene expression, neuropeptide levels, metabolic function, inflammatory activity, and others in the central nervous system after DBS in PD. Local field potential and beta-band analysis stand as the clinically proven biomarkers of choice for DBS in PD. Many of the identified changes noted could be implemented as clinically useful biomarkers through which DBS may be monitored. Future studies are needed to determine which noted physiologic changes are most appropriately used as biomarkers and in which contexts they are most helpful.

TI Nontraumatic Myositis Ossificans as an Uncommon Cause of Scoliosis: Case
   Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Myositis ossificans; Nontraumatic ossificans; Scoliosis
ID TRAUMATICA; MUSCLE
AB BACKGROUND: A 5-year-old pediatric patient developed scoliosis associated with nontraumatic myositis ossificans in the lumbar region. Although there have been reports in literature of syndromes leading to widespread muscle ossifications resulting in shoulder deformities owing to impaired movement in the facet joints, to the best of our knowledge there has been no report of scoliosis associated with myositis ossificans.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The case presented is of a 5-year-old girl who developed scoliosis associated with nontraumatic myositis ossificans in the lumbar region. On the thoracolumbar radiograph, a hyperintense lesion was seen at the right-side L2-L3 level and scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 16.2 degrees to the right side. The decision for surgery was made with the consideration of the existing scoliosis and that the complaints were associated with paravertebral calcified lesions adjacent to the facet joints. After surgery, the scoliosis improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nontraumatic, paravertebral myositis ossificans at an early age is a very rare pathology. Therefore, it must be recognized that spine deformities such as scoliosis and kyphosis can develop in neglected cases of paravertebral myositis ossificans. In addition, there is a high risk of confusion with malignant pathologies, such as osteosarcoma, in this area. Removal of the mass eliminates both the pain of myositis ossificans and prevents the development of scoliosis.

TI Intraneural Ewing Sarcoma of Fibular Nerve: Case Report, Radiologic
   Findings and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Diagnosis; Ewing sarcoma; Extraosseous Ewing sarcoma; Intraneural Ewing
   sarcoma; Nerve sheath tumor; Primitive neuroectodermal tumor; Treatment
AB BACKGROUND: Intraneural Ewing sarcoma (ES) was first described in 1918 by Stout in a tumor of the ulnar nerve. These tumors are in the category of ES family of tumors, together with ES of bone, extraosseous ES, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. ES typically occurs in the second decade of life; only 20% of cases affect elder people. The most frequently involved sites are the craniospinal vault and cauda equina, while the peripheral nerve location is extremely rare (only 11 cases mentioned in the literature to date).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This case report documents a rare case of a 46-year-old woman with an intraneural extraosseous ES and offers a complete radiologic documentation including contrast magnetic resonance imaging and microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic data. A review of the literature about diagnostic and treatment management is presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: The challenge of intraneural extraosseous ES consists of the right balance between the necessity to consider a potential malignant nature of the lesion and perform adequate surgical excision in a relatively brief time from the first clinical examination and the fact that these are extremely rare pathologic entities among most frequent cases of completely benign tumors, which could even have the same clinical and radiologic presentation. For this reason, a multidisciplinary setting with a team of neurosurgeons, orthopedic specialists, radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists should manage these cases as soon as a pathologic diagnosis is available. More attention should be focused on other therapies that effectively manage microscopic pathologic involvement, without increasing the risk of postoperative morbidity.

DE Frontal sinus; Meningitis; Osteoma
ID INTRACRANIAL MUCOCELE; PARANASAL; PATTERNS; ABSCESS
AB BACKGROUND: Osteomas are benign lesions of bone, most frequently seen in the paranasal sinuses; however, they are typically asymptomatic and without complication. We report a rare case of large frontal sinus osteoma with intracranial extension, associated with meningitis and the development of seizures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 38-year-old man with a prolonged history of headache and seizures, who was seen by multiple specialists previously, all of whom deferred treatment. After years of worsening seizure activity, he finally underwent surgical resection of the lesion at our institution in a joint operation with neurosurgery and otolaryngology. We examine his course, presentation, and management, and examine the literature for cases of complicated sinus osteomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: This represents the fourth reported case of frontal sinus osteoma associated with meningitis. We believe this case demonstrates the value of a robust differential and a multidisciplinary approach.

TI Multiple Brain Metastases from Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Manifesting

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intratumoral hemorrhage; Metastatic brain tumor; Pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma
ID LONG-TERM SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma rarely metastasizes to the brain, and clinical features of brain metastasis in such cases remain elusive. To the best of our knowledge, only 21 cases of brain metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been previously reported in the English language literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and began chemotherapy 1 year 4 months before the current admission. Three days before the current admission, she developed acute dysarthria. She was referred to a cancer center, where neuroradiologic examination showed multiple metastatic brain tumors, including a 30-mm-diameter tumor in the right cerebellar region. She was transferred to our institute. Three days after admission, she developed sudden-onset disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed that the metastatic lesions had increased in size with development of intratumoral hemorrhage and obstructive hydrocephalus. She underwent urgent removal of the tumor in the cerebellum. Obstructive hydrocephalus was relieved, and her consciousness improved immediately after surgery. She was transferred to the palliative care unit of the cancer center and died under hospice care 3 weeks after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that brain metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma can enlarge suddenly and simultaneously with intratumoral hemorrhage even without coagulation disorders, resulting in neurologic deterioration in a short time. Surgical resection of metastatic brain lesions from pancreatic adenocarcinoma has an extremely limited role, but such treatment can remove neurologic symptoms and temporarily improve the patient's quality of life in selected cases.

   INSTRUMENTATION
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the preoperative presence of degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) worsens the outcome of patients undergoing decompression alone for degenerative lumbar stenosis.
   METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. All comparative studies were included in this meta-analysis. The literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted by 2 independent reviewers. The functional outcomes were clinical scores and reoperation rate. The radiologic outcomes were slippage rate and postoperative instability rate.
   RESULTS: A total of 11 studies with 1081 cases, including 469 cases of degenerative lumbar stenosis with DS (DS group) and 612 degenerative lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis (noDS group), were enrolled in our meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for functional outcomes in terms of Japanese Orthopedic Association score, Japanese Orthopedic Association recovery rate, Oswestry Disability Index score, visual analog scale back/leg, and reoperation rate after decompression alone. For the radiologic outcomes, slippage rate was found not changed significantly before and after minimally invasive decompression alone in the DS group and the postoperative instability rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups after decompression alone by a minimally invasive method.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis revealed that concomitant DS (Meyerding grade I-II) does not influence the outcome of decompression alone in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, especially when a minimally invasive procedure was performed and patients did not have predominant symptoms of mechanical back pain. The presence of DS should not be an indication for fusion surgery in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.

   Report and Review of the Literature

LA English
DT Review
DE Endonasal approach; Endoscopy; Pituitary stone
ID CHROMOPHOBE ADENOMA; STONE; HYPERPROLACTINEMIA; CALCIFICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Large calcified intrasellar masses, called pituitary stones, have been reported as calcified pituitary adenomas in the literature. Although relatively rare, calcified pituitary adenomas appear in various formations. Thus, whether the lesion is removable-and, if so, which approach is appropriate-mainly depends on its formation and quality.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old woman presented with visual loss and amenorrhea. Although computed tomography showed a uniformly calcified sellar tumor, magnetic resonance imaging displayed heterogenous intensity on T2-weighted images and mild gadolinium enhancement, suggesting that the lesion was a mixture of pituitary adenoma and fine calcification. Thus, we undertook tumor resection via an endoscopic endonasal approach, which resulted in total removal. The pathological diagnosis was a pituitary adenoma with rich calcification.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of a large pituitary stone that was successfully removed via an endoscopic endonasal approach. This could therefore be a feasible, effective technique for the removal of pituitary stones, although careful analysis of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging is required.

ID MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of surgical microvascular decompression (MVD) of the vertebral artery (VA) for treating conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm is well known. However, the use of MVD for a case in which the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is directly compressing the high cervical cord has not been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old male was diagnosed with a rare case of myelopathy due to the PICA directly compressing the high cervical cord. The patient had a C-2 segmental type of VA that penetrated the intradural space at the C1 level. The VA-PICA portion was located just after where the intradural space was penetrated, and the branching PICA strongly and vertically compressed the high cervical cord.
   CONCLUSIONS: MVD of the PICA was performed, and the patient experienced rapid improvement of myelopathy. The patient immediately improved postoperative day 1 and was doing well at his 1-year follow-up. This is a rare case of the PICA directly compressing the cervical cord and causing myelopathy. MVD of the PICA resulted in good patient recovery.

AB Primary intracranial fibrosarcoma (PIF) is an exceedingly rare tumor. Only about 50 cases have been reported in the literature. Here, we present a case of a 20-year-old male who presented with a sudden-onset headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a hemorrhagic extra-axial space-occupying mass. The mass was surgically resected, and biopsy was consistent with PIF. The patient was lost to follow-up and presented with recurrence 3 months later. He expired from complications of the tumor. PIF is a diagnosis of exclusion: More common intracranial tumors should first be excluded. Biopsy is necessary to diagnose PIF.

AB BACKGROUND: Transclival meningoceles and related primary spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks at the clivus are extremely rare lesions, with only a few cases reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An infant presented with nasal airway obstruction and meningitis secondary to cerebrospinal fluid leak from a transclival meningocele. The radiologic investigation and surgical repair of the lesion are reported, along with intraoperative findings. Basic anatomy, embryology, and development of the clivus are reviewed to clarify the relationship of anatomic variants with the formation of transclival meningoceles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transclival meningocele should be considered in patients with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. The existing classification of meningoencephaloceles based on the location of the defect in the cranium should probably be reconsidered, taking into consideration the described entity.

ID RIGID SPINE SYNDROME; MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; NECK HYPEREXTENSION; OSTEOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: There is no gold standard surgical treatment for cervical hyperextension deformity, especially in case of muscular dystrophy. Special considerations and caution should be taken as they carry a high risk of early mortality and spinal cord injury. Only a few case reports are available in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of surgical correction of an iatrogenic cervical hyperextension deformity following sagittal balance correction in a patient with congenital limb-girdle myopathy. The patient was successfully treated by posterior cervical release and fusion after verification of the range of motion, reducibility of the deformity, and absence of any positional spinal cord compression with dynamic radiographic examination and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the desired postoperative position.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest posterior cervical release and fusion in case of a radiologically and clinically reducible cervical hyperextension deformity under both motor and sensory spinal evoked potential monitoring. In cases of long-standing, rigid, nonreducible cervical hyperextension, laminectomy and concomitant duroplasty could be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Bean syndrome (BS) is a rare congenital low-flow angiomatosis affecting multiple organ systems. About 200 cases with heterogeneous clinical presentation have been reported worldwide. The exact etiopathology is still not known. Most reported cases have occurred sporadically, although autosomal dominant inheritance has been suggested. BS predominantly presents with characteristic multifocal mucocutaneous lesions and often leads to refractory anemia caused by occult blood loss from the alimentary tract. Apart from the mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal tract involvement, this syndrome may rarely affect the central nervous system in the form of multiple venous anomalies. Patients often approach a dermatologist or gastroenterologist for treatment and this entity is usually less known among neurosurgeons. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of sinus pericranii and 12 cases with orbital hemangioma as a presenting feature in BS have been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Keeping neurosurgical management of this rare entity in mind, we discuss a case of a young female who presented with congenital naso-orbital swelling with a history of multiple-stage embolization and surgical excision of the orbital mass in her childhood. Now, she presented with recurrent swelling involving the right side of the forehead for cosmetic concerns and was subsequently diagnosed to have BS at 23 years of age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a lesser known entity among neurosurgeons that requires a high index of clinical suspicion for diagnosis. Red herrings, such as in our case, must prompt a search for characteristic mucocutaneous lesions and other associated lesions of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. A timely diagnosis may improve the quality of life and help avoid life-threatening complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation on chromosome 17, which affects the skin, vascular system, nervous system, and skeleton system. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is one of the recognized complications of NF-1.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 33-year-old woman with NF-1 with cervical spine AVF inside the cervical spinal canal who presented with progressive spinal cord compression which was abnormal. After sufficient preparation, the patient underwent vascular embolization, and then symptoms of spinal cord compression significantly improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report reminds readers of the possibility of AVF if there is a space-occupying lesion inside the cervical spinal canal and to do computed tomography angiography examination when necessary.

DE Colloid cyst; Endoscopic resection of third ventricular mass; Lymphoma
   mimicking colloid cyst; PCNSL
AB BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma is a rare malignant tumor of the central nervous system. It is associated with poor prognosis and accounts for 0.7%-0.9% of all lymphomas and only 0.3%-1.5% of intracranial tumors. Typically, these lesions are in the cerebral white matter near the corpus callosum, the central gray matter, the basal ganglia-thalamus-hypothalamic region, the posterior fossa and the periventricular region. Only 2 cases with pure third ventricular lymphoma have been reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old female patient known to have type II diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and obesity presented with a history of acute confusion and urinary incontinence. No headache was reported on admission, but previously she had intermittent mild headaches and generalized body aches. She had no history of visual symptoms. Her family said she was mildly confused and had memory difficulties that started acutely 2 days before presentation to the hospital. The patient had urgent computed tomography of the brain, which showed a hyperdense lesion in the region of the foramen of Monro. Pre-operative images diagnosed the case as colloid cyst, but post-operative histopathology proved the lesion to be primary CNS lymphoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Eleven months after surgery, the patient is fully consciousness and oriented, with no memory issues or neurologic deficit. She is back to her baseline activities. We are reporting this case for the rarity of the disease and the unusual location of it.

AB BACKGROUND: Among all trauma-related injuries globally, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and traumatic spine injury (TSI) account for the largest proportion of cases. Where previously data was lacking, recent efforts have been initiated to better quantify the extent of neurotrauma in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This information is vital to understand the current neurosurgical deficit so that resources and efforts can be focused on where they are needed most. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum number of neurosurgeons to address the neurotrauma demand in LMICs and evaluate current evidence to support facility needs so that policy-based recommendations can be made to prioritize development initiatives to scale up neurosurgical services.
   METHODS: Using existing data regarding the incidence of TBI and TSI in LMICs and current neurosurgical workforce and estimates of case load capacity, the minimum number of neurosurgeons needed to address neurotrauma per population was calculated. Evidence was gathered regarding necessary hospital facilities and disbursement patterns based on time needed to intervene effectively for neurotrauma.
   RESULTS: There are 4,897,139 total operative cases of TBI and TSI combined in LMICs annually. At minimum, there needs to be 1 neurosurgeon only performing neurotrauma cases per approximately 212,000 people. Evidence suggests that patients should be within 4 hours of a neurosurgical facility at the very least.
   CONCLUSIONS: The development of neurotrauma systems is essential to address the large burden of neurotrauma in LMICs. The minimum requirements for neurosurgical workforce is 1 neurotrauma surgeon per 212,000 people.

ID ANEURYSM; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of endoscopic endonasal surgery. Herein, we describe 2-staged stent-assisted coil embolization for posterior communicating artery pseudoaneurysm after endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old man had a history of severe adult growth hormone secretion deficiency, requiring growth hormone replacement therapy; secondary adrenocortical hypofunction; hyperthyroidism; hypertension; constipation; glaucoma; and hyperuricemia. Five years ago, after initial endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma, he was hospitalized for reoperation. Posterior communicating artery injury was observed during second endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, and pressure hemostasis was performed using a hemostatic preparation. Immediately post surgery, a localized subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed. Sudden-onset impaired consciousness and respiratory disturbances ensued on postoperative day 7, and computed tomography of the head was performed. Recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage was confirmed, and acute hydrocephalus secondary to third ventricular blockage was identified. Cerebral angiography was performed after urgent bilateral cerebral ventricular drainage under general anesthesia. A pseudoaneurysm was identified in the left posterior communicating artery, and coil embolization was performed. Six weeks post surgery, a low-profile visualized intraluminal stent called an LVIS Jr. stent was placed in the posterior communicating artery. Recurrence of the aneurysm was not detected 6 months post surgery. He underwent lumboperitoneal shunting for secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus after dual antiplatelet therapy discontinuation and is being followed up as an outpatient with a modified Rankin scale score of 2 ten months post surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two-staged stent-assisted coil embolization using a low-profile visualized intraluminal stent was effective for a posterior communicating artery pseudoaneurysm occurring after posterior communicating artery injury following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for follicle-stimulating hormone-producing pituitary adenoma.

ID PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; CERVICAL-SPINE; SKULL BASE; SURVIVAL; PATTERNS;
   PATIENT; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Proton therapy has proven to be effective and safe in the treatment of radioresistant skull base tumors such as chordomas. Thanks to the peculiar physical properties of the proton beam, radiation energy is delivered in a narrow space called the Bragg peak and the surrounding normal tissues receive a minimal amount of the radiation dose. This is important to lower the risk of radiation-induced damage, especially in children. However, local adverse effects in proximity to the target volume may occur. In particular, the development of moyamoya syndrome (MMS) has been rarely reported in children receiving proton beam therapy for brain tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a child who developed rapidly progressive MMS after proton beam therapy for a clivus chordoma. A combined indirect revascularization procedure by encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis and encephalo-myo-synangiosis was performed with good neuroradiologic and clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the presence of known risk factors for MMS, strict neuroimaging surveillance is indicated in all patients treated with radiotherapy including those receiving proton beam therapy. We suggest that an early revascularization procedure should be considered in patients with worsening symptoms and/or sign of neuroradiologic progression of cerebral vasculopathy. This management of MMS could lower the risk of permanent neurologic deficits and improve patients' quality of life.

TI Unilateral Lumbar Facet Dislocation: Case Report and Review of the
   Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Dislocation; Lumbar facet; Spine
ID LOCKED FACET; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Facet dislocations of the lumbar spine, particularly without neurologic injury, are rare occurrences after major trauma. Although there are documented cases of lumbosacral dislocation in the published literature, strictly lumbar unilateral facet dislocation is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a unilateral facet dislocation at L4-L5 after a single vehicle motorcycle accident. This injury was treated with posterior open reduction and instrumented stabilization with good results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the rarity of this injury pattern, the management of this type of injury is not established. Careful imaging to make the diagnosis is crucial, and we recommend a surgical treatment in the form of an open reduction and instrumented stabilization. In our case, we achieved good outcomes with a posterior approach.

TI Detection of Germline Mutations of the SMARCB1 Gene in a Chinese Family
   with Intraspinal Schwannomatosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE INI1; Intraspinal; Multiple schwannomas; Schwannomatosis; SMARCB1 gene
ID TYPE-2
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannomatosis is the third subtype of neurofibromatosis. Because the tumor is multiple and prone to recurrence, it often brings challenges to clinical diagnosis and treatment. In the past decade, researchers have come to realize the relationship between the SMARCB1 gene and schwannomatosis, which is expected to improve the current level of diagnosis and treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We collected the clinical data of intraspinal schwannomatosis in the same family, which is rare, and carried out the genetic tests on 3 generations of family members (N = 25). We found that 8 family members had germline mutations of the SMARCB1 gene, manifested as mutation at the splice site between SMARCB1 gene exon 8 and 9 (c.1118 D 1G > A).
   CONCLUSIONS: The structural and functional abnormalities of proteins caused by the mutations of the SMARCB1 gene may be the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of schwannomatosis in this family. This study may provide clues for the study of schwannomatosis in the future.

ID CLOSURE DEVICE FAILURE; ARTERY ANEURYSM; DANLOS-SYNDROME; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Isolated cervical pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients with Marfan syndrome are extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old female with Marfan syndrome and history of multiple aortic aneurysms presented to an outside hospital with dysphagia, a mass in her neck, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. A computed tomography angiogram showed bilateral cervical ICA pseudoaneurysms, more significant on the right side. A laryngoscopy demonstrated edematous vocal cords and a significant mass effect on the right side. She suffered from significant respiratory distress and aspiration, for which she had to be intubated and transferred to our institution for definitive care. The patient was taken for angiography for carotid artery test occlusion and endovascular trapping with coils and onyx embolization of the carotid pseudoaneurysm. The hospital course was complicated with femoral closure device failure, leading to groin hematoma, pneumonia, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The patient was discharged to rehabilitation 34 days after admission. Stable exclusion of the large right pseudoaneurysm was observed at 3 months' follow-up with computed tomography angiography, as well as significant improvement in the last clinical follow-up obtained 6 months after the procedure.
   CONCLUSION: Pseudoaneurysms of the cervical ICA associated with Marfan syndrome are rare. Carotid test occlusion and endovascular permanent embolization are possible in a patient with life-threatening symptoms. Cautious use of vascular closure devices, especially collagen plug-based ones, are required in such patients, given their abnormal extracellular matrix structure.

AB BACKGROUND: Acute hemorrhagic occurrence of pilocytic astrocytomas is extremely rare but has become increasingly recognized and often presents in clinically emergent situations. The precise significance of hemorrhage in these tumors and its pathogenetic mechanisms have not yet been defined. Nothing is known about the natural history of bleeding pilocytic astrocytomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old man presented with acute biventricular hydrocephalus for repeat bleeding of a midbrain lesion that had been diagnosed 18 years earlier after a similar acute hemorrhagic episode. The patient had been initially treated conservatively, considering the high risk of surgery. He underwent urgent biventricular external shunt surgery and, subsequently, total removal of the lesion. Histopathological analysis revealed pilocytic astrocytoma. Including the present case, 59 cases were analyzed and reviewed, including 5 cases with a pilomyxoid variant. Different pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed, including histological characteristics, rupture of the bridging veins torn by the neoplastic mass, and vascular instability determined by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the presented case is completely unique owing to the long-term observational follow-up data available. The hemorrhagic potential did not decrease over time, representing a specific feature of this tumor. The occurrence of bleeding might not reflect either malignancy or aggressiveness. However, the worse prognosis is related to the clinical behavior, with life-threatening complications often associated. Surgery remains the standard treatment and will influence the final prognosis.

ID INTRASELLAR ANEURYSM; PANHYPOPITUITARISM
AB BACKGROUND: Hypopituitarism is not well known after the treatment of a cavernous carotid aneurysm extending to the sellar region by the parent artery occlusion and bypass surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old female presented with a 2-year-old progressive visual disturbance. The patient had no pituitary hormone-related symptoms or signs, but elevated prolactin and decreased free thyroxin levels are shown on blood examination. Neuroimages revealed a right giant partially thrombosed cavernous carotid aneurysm compressing the sella turcica markedly. The aneurysm was treated by the right cervical internal carotid artery ligation with the right superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery double anastomoses. The patient had headache, general fatigue, chilling, and hypoactivity on postoperative day 6, when aneurysmal mass effects were transiently increased on neuroimages, associated with hypocortisolism and hyponatremia. Hydrocortisone administration improved the symptoms and was tapered off at 8 months post surgery, as the aneurysm shrank and pituitary hormone values were normalized except for prolactin.
   CONCLUSION: Hypopituitarism should be taken into consideration even after the parent artery occlusion with bypass surgery for a giant carotid aneurysm compressing the sella turcica.

ID SPACE; CONCURRENT; LUMBAR; ORIGIN
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal subdural hematoma (SDH) concomitant with cranial SDH is extremely rare. Although some theories have been proposed, the pathophysiology underlying this condition remains unclear. We present a case of traumatic subacute spinal SDH followed by symptomatic subacute cranial SDH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman was admitted with severe back pain 2 weeks after sustaining a minor head injury. The pain was worse with walking or standing and was relieved a little bit by sitting. There was no clinical evidence of back injury. There was no neurologic deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed subacute spinal SDH from T12 to S1. Owing to progressive worsening of back pain, bilateral laminectomy of L1-S1 and drainage of subacute spinal SDH were performed. The pain was completely relieved after surgery. On postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to be unconscious with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 (E2V3M5). Computed tomography scan of the head showed subacute bilateral cranial SDH. Burr hole drainage was performed. The patient experienced a complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests the possibility that spinal SDH can develop as a result of cranial SDH migration to the most dependent spinal subdural space. The physician should be aware of the possibility of symptomatic cranial SDH developing following spinal SDH evacuation.

AB We report an 8-month-old female infant with complaints of irritability and recent inability to sit in a stable position. On physical examination, a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant of her abdomen was evident. Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant cyst, consisting of 2 communicating compartments: dorsal and ventrolateral. The dorsal part compressed the conus medullaris, and the ventrolateral part compressed the left kidney.
   Partial cyst wall resection and imbrication for the dorsal pouch were done, and diagnosis of Tarlov cyst was confirmed via the visualization of the endocystic nerve root during surgery.
   Familiarizing physicians with this unusual presentation of Tarlov cyst may help them in early recognition of this lesion, and subsequent surgery might be considered to prevent clinical sequela. To our knowledge, a lumbar Tarlov cyst presenting as a giant abdominal cyst in an infant has not been reported in the English-language literature.

ID 3RD VENTRICLE; ACUTE DETERIORATION; NATURAL-HISTORY; SUDDEN-DEATH
AB BACKGROUND: Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are rare, slow-growing lesions of neuroepithelial origin. Although histopathologically benign, third ventricular colloid cysts are a well-known cause of sudden, unexpected coma and death. Several theories have been proposed to describe the rare, sudden onset of severe symptomatology and rapid clinical decline due to colloid cysts. Moreover, there is currently no clear consensus regarding the most suitable neurosurgical technique or the most effective approach for resection, nor do guidelines or standardized clinical indications exist to recommend observation versus intervention and/or resection in the asymptomatic patient. To highlight this conundrum, we present a clinical case of a hemorrhagic colloid cyst that resulted in fatality and discuss the relevant literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old male presented to an outside hospital with an acute onset of a severe headache, nausea, and vomiting, which started while jogging. A few hours later, he precipitously declined into a comatose state. Radiographic imaging demonstrated a hemorrhagic third ventricular colloid cyst causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus, severe increased intracranial pressure, and downward herniation. He was then transferred to our institution for neurosurgical intervention. Despite aggressive cerebrospinal fluid drainage and medical management, he was declared brain dead several days later.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the only case report to describe sudden-onset coma and death due to a hemorrhagic third ventricular colloid cyst occurring after exercising. We review the literature on fatal colloid cysts emphasizing the proposed mechanisms of sudden death and current neurosurgical management in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.

AB Central neurocytomas are rare tumors, typically found in the third ventricle. We present the unusual case of a fourth ventricular central neurocytoma in a 70-year-old female presenting with imbalance and headaches, with an enhancing fourth ventricular mass on imaging. We examine the details of her clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, histopathologic analysis, and post-operative course. We performed a critical literature review of fourth ventricular central neurocytoma, identifying 6 previously reported cases. In contrast to our patient, the majority of these cases were in young males. The 2 females with fourth ventricular neurocytoma developed it at a much later age (mean 63.5 years) than their male counterparts (mean 22.8 years; P = 0.005). Despite being a rare cause for a fourth ventricular lesion, given the appropriate clinical context and radiographic findings, this should remain part of the differential diagnosis.

His most important work is recognized to be the Al-Taysir fi al-Mudawat wa al-Tadbir (On Preventive Regimen and Treatment), and its Latin version, Alteisir scilicet regiminis et medelae, which was in use for centuries in Europe.
   METHODS: The Arabic (Rabat, Morocco, in 1991) and Latin (Venice, Italy, in 1530) versions of Avenzoar's work were perused, relevant sections were separately translated into English, and both translations were then compared. An English version was prepared and is given in our results.
   RESULTS: The location of liquid collection was described as the anterior ventricles of the brain and around the brain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Avenzoar might have noted one of the earliest records on the clinical state called idiopathic adult hydrocephalus and postulated liquid collection in the ventricles of the brain in hydrocephalus before Vesalius.

AB OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for treating cavernous malformations.
   METHODS: PubMed, Ovid Embase, and Ovid Medline electronic databases were searched. The primary outcome is hemorrhage rate and this meta-analysis is performed.
   RESULTS: Nine studies are included in this meta-analysis. The overall risk ratio (RR) of hemorrhage rate of pre-GKRS and post-GKRS is 6.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.04-7.35). The overall RR is 3.03 (95% CI, 2.65-4.11) between the hemorrhage rate of pre-GKRS and the first 2 years postradiosurgery, and the overall RR is 12.13 (95% CI, 1.73-85.07) comparing pre-GKRS with 2 years after GKRS. There is no significant difference of the hemorrhage rate between the first 2 years postradiosurgery and 2 years after GKRS (RR [2.81; 95% CI, 0.20-13.42). The neurologic deficiency is the most common radiosurgery-related complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cerebral cavernous malformations, especially ones that were deep seated and surgically inaccessible, seem to benefit from GKRS owing to a reduction of annual hemorrhage rate in the first 2 years and 2 years after, despite several cases that suffer from negative side effects of radiation.

ID AGGRESSIVE OSTEOBLASTOMA; BENIGN OSTEOBLASTOMA; OSTEOID OSTEOMA; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Epithelioid osteoblastoma of the cranium is extremely rare and can mimic other etiologies on radiographic imaging, pathology, and symptomatology.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old male patient had a 3-week history of a palpable left temporal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large, extra-axial, hypervascular mass in the left temporal bone, with bony erosion and intracranial extension. The patient underwent surgical near gross-total resection of the mass. Initial frozen microscopic examination of the tumor was inconclusive. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged a few days later. Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid osteoblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epithelioid osteoblastoma of the skull base is exceedingly rare but should be included in the differential diagnoses of all extra axial tumors. Preoperative radiographic clues are limited, and final diagnosis relies solely on accurate pathologic examination. A diagnosis of epithelioid osteoblastoma should be considered for all cranial bone-based tumors, as an incorrect diagnosis of another radiographic and histologic mimic could lead to the patient receiving unnecessary and harmful neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

DT Review
DE Biopsy; Malignant lymphoma; Neuropathic pain
ID MALIGNANT-LYMPHOMA; REGION
AB BACKGROUND: Extraaxial lymphoma involving the trigeminal nerve, an uncommon condition that presents as a trigeminal schwannoma, resulted in misdiagnosis and a flawed surgical strategy. We report 2 cases: a primary lymphoma of the Meckel cave and a metastasis lymphoma in the prepontine cistern arising from the supraclavicular lymph node.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient presented with a 3-month history of persistent, sharp facial pain across the area innervated by the V2 nerve. She was misdiagnosed with primary trigeminal neuralgia and underwent microvascular decompression. Intraoperatively, the trigeminal nerve was swollen to a large extent and surrounded by red granuloma-like tissue. The second case was a 75-year-old woman; she had a history of a malignant lymphoma of the supraclavicular lymph node and presented with right facial pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the cisternal portion of the right trigeminal nerve was swollen. A specimen was taken from the 2 patients, and histopathologic examinations revealed a diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of a malignant lymphoma should be considered for lesions in the trigeminal region. Extracting a specimen for biopsy is the most suitable surgical strategy. Our report indicates that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for malignant lymphomas is essential.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of a surgical protocol for infections, nonhealing wound prophylaxis, and analgesia among patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion at a single tertiary-care neurosurgical center.
   METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in the neurosurgery department of a tertiary-care neurosurgical center and compared a control group of patients who had posterior spinal fusion within 3 months before implementation of a surgical protocol with a study group of patients enrolled within 1 year after protocol implementation. The protocol included a surgical safety checklist, control of modifiable risks associated with surgical site infection, administration of intrawound vancomycin and local analgesia, and standard closure. Postoperative pain, demand for analgesics, and postoperative surgical site infections were assessed among patients before and after the introduction of the protocol.
   RESULTS: The control group (n = 35; 30 women; median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 31-54 years]) experienced a higher-than-predicted rate of minor surgical infections and nonhealing wounds (12 patients; 34%). In the study group (n = 113; 74 women; median age, 45 years [interquartile range, 37-54 years]), 11 patients (10%) had minor surgical infections and nonhealing wounds. Introduction of the protocol was associated with a 24% absolute risk reduction for minor surgical site infection and a significant decrease in pain on postoperative days 1 and 2 (P < 0.01 for both). Interpersonal communication improved among specialists involved in patient management.
   CONCLUSIONS: The protocol was effective in reducing postoperative pain and the rate of surgical site infection among patients with posterior spinal surgeries.

ID INTERBODY FUSION; DISKECTOMY
AB The transforaminal corridor in the lumbar spine allows access to the traversing and exiting nerve roots, the thecal sac, and the intervertebral disc space. Surgeons performing midline and minimally invasive approaches for lumbar interbody fusion access the disc space within the boundaries created by the exiting root of a segment and the traversing root after a complete facetectomy and removal of the pars interarticularis and lamina. Endoscopic surgeons and interventional pain management physicians approach the lumbar segment through a similar corridor, but with the bony anatomy intact. Although the boundaries of the corridor may seem the same, the angle of the trajectory and the bone work between the two differ.
   The overlap between these 2 distinct access corridors has led to an openhanded application of the term Kambin's triangle. Initially described for endoscopic approaches to the lumbar spine for microdiscectomy, this working triangle has been grafted into the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion literature. Given the similarities between these corridors, it is understandable how the lines of this nomenclature have blurred. The result has been an interchangeable application of the term Kambin's triangle for a variety of procedures in the spine literature. The objective of the current work is to add clarity to the various lumbar transforaminal corridors. The term Kambin's triangle should be limited to percutaneous access to the disc space for endoscopic procedures in the intact spine and should not be applied to transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion after laminectomy and facetectomy. Instead, the term expanded transforaminal corridor should be applied.

AB BACKGROUND: Applying vancomycin into the surgical site has been well-described in spinal neurosurgery, with extensive institutional experience and systematic reviews describing its effectiveness in reducing surgical site infections (SSIs). Its use in nonspinal neurosurgical procedures is a logical extension of those findings; however, recent studies have described varying degrees of success. We have summarized the effect of local vancomycin application on SSIs in nonspinal neurosurgical procedures and describe the quality of the supporting evidence.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched through June 2018. Information on study design, demographic data, exposure, and outcomes was extracted. The estimates were combined using random-effects models.
   RESULTS: Our search retrieved 9 studies for quantitative analysis. They assessed vancomycin use in craniotomy, cranioplasty, deep brain stimulator-related procedures, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. Most of the studies had serious methodological shortcomings that introduced confounding. We found an overall beneficial effect on SSI incidence (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.52), which was seen across all subspecialties, except for cranioplasty. The use of vancomycin did not result in the emergence of resistant infections or in a significant increase in the proportion of infections caused by gram-negative organisms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin use in nonspinal neurosurgery is not supported by high-quality evidence, limiting the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn on the topic. Nonetheless, we found an overall favorable effect on SSIs (except in the context of cranioplasty), which should be reproduced in a randomized controlled fashion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, reduced vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND) but did not improve outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in clinical trials. However, a lack of dose-dependent analysis and potential overestimation of clazosentan's effect are concerning. We used stratified analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) of existing data to investigate the effects of clazosentan on SAH outcome.
   METHODS: Studies from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were reviewed for eligibility. Primary outcomes were DIND requiring rescue therapy, all-cause mortality, and vasospasm-related morbidity at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes were moderate-to-severe angiographic vasospasm, new cerebral infarction, and poor clinical outcome at 3 months. TSA was performed to assess the required information size and the alpha-spending monitoring boundary effect of relative risk (RR) reduction. A stratified analysis of clazosentan dosage was performed.
   RESULTS: Five studies (N = 2317) were included. Clazosentan significantly reduced the risk of DIND requiring rescue therapy (RR, 0.625; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.462-0.846) and vasospasm (RR, 0.543; 95% CI, 0.464-0.635), but did not significantly affect mortality or vasospasm-related morbidity (RR, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.578-1.039), new cerebral infarction (RR, 0.604; 95% CI, 0.383-0.952), or outcome (RR, 1.131; 95% CI, 0.959-1.334). TSA revealed that the studies were underpowered to evaluate the effects of clazosentan on mortality and vasospasm-associated morbidity. We found 10-15 mg/h of clazosentan administration was associated with lower rates of vasospasm and new cerebral infarctions compared with 5 mg/h.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clazosentan reduced the risk of DIND requiring rescue therapy and moderate-to-severe vasospasm. Further meta-analyses based on individual patient data with different clazosentan doses and more refined outcome measures are necessary to clarify clazosentan's efficacy in improving post-SAH outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Isolated cerebral mucormycosis is a rare and serious infection associated with intravenous drug abuse.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of cases reported in studies and have included an unreported case from our institution. We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Databases, and our institution's electronic medical health records from inception through March 31, 2018. The cases were considered isolated (only affecting the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brainstem) if the absence of other primary sources of infection had been documented. Continuous variables were summarized using the median and interquartile range and categorical variables using frequencies and proportions. The relationships between variables were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson chi(2) tests.
   RESULTS: A total of 130 studies (141 patients) met the eligibility requirements and were screened; 68 patients were included. The median age was 28 years (interquartile range, 24-38); 57% were men. Most patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse (82%), and 20% had positive human immunodeficiency virus findings. The lesion location was mostly supratentorial (91%), especially in the basal ganglia (71.2%). The cultures were positive in 38%, with Rhizopus the most common organism (59%). The mortality rate was 65%. The survivors were significantly more likely to have received amphotericin B (92% vs. 43%; P < 0.001) or to have undergone stereotactic aspiration (58% vs. 25%; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cerebral mucormycosis has a pooled mortality rate of 65%. The presence of lesions in the basal ganglia, rapidly progressive symptoms, and a history of intravenous drug abuse should raise suspicion for the early initiation of amphotericin B and stereotactic aspiration.

AB BACKGROUND: This systematic review aims to identify and analyze the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of surgical revascularization for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and moyamoya disease (MMD).
   METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Scopus. Studies included in the review were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals in which individual participant data were available. The articles were thoroughly examined and compared on study design, outcomes, and results. The authors reviewed their institution's database to identify pediatric patients with SCD and MMD who underwent surgical revascularization and were included in the analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were included and 82 hemispheres were intervened with direct or indirect surgical revascularization. Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) was the most common procedure performed (42/82; 51.2%) followed by pial synangiosis (31/82; 37.8%). There was 1 intraprocedural complication. The median clinical follow-up was 37 months (interquartile range, 24.1-73.5 months) and during this period, 3 of 52 patients (5.8%) had ischemic strokes. All ischemic strokes occurred within the first 30 days after the surgery and the rate of ischemic stroke-free survival was 94.3% (95% confidence interval, 83.3-98.1). The estimated incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 1.42 events/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval, 0.46-4.4).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that surgical revascularization in pediatric patients with SCD and MMD is safe to perform and results in a low rate of future ischemic insults.

AB INTRODUCTION: Optimal surgical strategy for patients with tremor remains uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating randomized controlled trials of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesion surgery (LS) in the treatment of tremor.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database to include randomized clinical trials with either LS, deep brain stimulation, or controls. The outcomes were the change in tremor score, quality of life, cognitive function, and neuropsychiatric function. We used standardized mean differences (SMDs) to pool the outcomes.
   RESULTS: Fifteen trials, including 1508 patients, met eligibility criteria. We observed no significant difference in change of tremor scale (SMD -0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.38 to 0.24), quality of life (SMD -0.21, 95% CI: -0.69 to 0.27), cognitive function (SMD 0.06, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.39), or neuropsychiatric function (SMD -0.15, 95% CI: -0.49 to 0.19) between LS and stimulation surgery. We observed heterogeneity across studies during indirect comparison of quality of life. We identified a possible effect modifier: improvement in quality of life correlated with duration of disease (P = 0.035). We found that focused-ultrasound LS was associated with a 0.70 SMD increase (P = 0.014) in quality of life versus DBS in an exploratory subgroup analysis by separating 2 studies with focused-ultrasound LS from other LS studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the main analysis showed that LS and DBS were equally effective in the treatment of patients with tremor, an exploratory subgroup analysis indicated an improvement in quality of life with noninvasive focused-ultrasound surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior thoracic spinal cord herniation (ATSCH) is a rare cause of progressive myelopathy. Early surgery is essential, but there is no agreement about the best surgical approach.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine surgical results and to find evidence for the most favorable technique to correct ATSCH.
   METHODS: To find relevant literature, computed databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science were searched. The study comprised case reports published between 1974 and 2018, and the data set was completed with 12 cases treated in our own institute. Patient characteristics were analyzed following the principles of an individual participant data meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: Brown-Sequard-like neurologic deficit before surgery was associated with postoperative motor function improvement compared with patients with paraparesis (P = 0.04). In the univariate analysis, widening of the dura defect (WDD) was more prevalent among improved patients, whereas anterior dura patch and application of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring were not. In the multivariate analysis, the favorable association with WDD disappeared, which is explained by the dominant influence of a Brown-Sequard-like deficit on outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: In general, postoperative results after surgery for ATSCH are favorable, with a high percentage of patients experiencing postoperative improvement. Postoperative motor function improvement is more likely to occur in patients with a Brown-Sequard-like neurologic deficit. The WDD should be favored above the application of a patch as the technique of choice in surgical treatment of ATSCH.

ID TREMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare neurological condition of trans-synaptic degeneration caused by disruption of the dentatorubro-olivary pathway. We present new radiologic findings of HOD in 2 cases of brainstem lymphoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman (Case 1) and a 69-year-old man (Case 2) presented with remarkably similar clinical courses. The primary lesion was located at the dorsal pons extending to the midbrain. Pathologic diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was obtained after surgical resection. Complete remission of the primary lesion was achieved by treatment with 3 courses of high-dose methotrexate and radiotherapy. Arterial spin-labeling and T-2-weighted imagings showed high signal intensity in the inferior olive (IO) at some time after the operation. Slight contrast enhancement in the IO was also found in Case 1. These radiologic findings nearly misled us into a diagnosis of recurrence of lymphoma. Signal intensity in the IO on arterial spin-labeling imaging changed with time. Normalized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the IO was defined as a percentage of rCBF to the global cerebral blood flow calculated using automated software. Chronologic change in normalized rCBF in the IO revealed a large peak in Case 1, but only a mild increase in Case 2. Neurological findings demonstrated severe oculopalatal tremor in Case 1 and mild palatal tremor in Case 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hyperperfusion and contrast enhancement in the IO were found in 2 patients with HOD. These findings may be confused with recurrence of malignant tumor.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas are uncommon in the pediatric population. Although medical treatment can be effective in treating prolactinomas and some growth hormone-secreting tumors, resection is indicated in the setting of pituitary apoplexy, large or giant pituitary adenomas causing mass effect or visual loss, or when medical therapy becomes ineffective or intolerable. Modern microsurgical transsphenoidal approaches are potential avenues for resection in pediatric patients. We evaluated the outcomes and safety of this approach.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed from February 2002 through May 2017 for patients younger than 19 years of age that underwent a transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenoma resection.
   RESULTS: Among a total of 634 patients who underwent transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenoma resection, 24 pediatric cases were identified. Prolactinomas (29.2%) and adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting (20.8%) pituitary adenomas were the most commonly encountered histologies. Gross total resection was achieved in 75.0% of patients, and complete hormone function normalization was seen in 91.7% of patients. Eight patients (33.3%) required postoperative hormone replacement therapy. Twelve patients (50.0%) underwent fat/ fascia use and 1 patient (4.2%) underwent lumbar puncture perioperatively for management of cerebrospinal fluid leak. There were no tumor recurrences during a follow-up period of 24.7 +/- 32.1 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: A modern transsphenoidal microsurgical approach proved to be a safe, well-tolerated, and effective modality in the setting of pediatric pituitary adenomas.

TI Extended Length of Stay After Lumbar Spine Surgery: Sick Patients,

   Hospitals and Physicians?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Enhanced recovery pathway; Length of stay; Lumbar fusion; Postoperative
   complications; Spine surgery
ID ENHANCED RECOVERY; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: The degree to which extended length of stay (LOS) after surgery represents patient illness or postoperative complications is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of postoperative complications and patient comorbidities on variance in extended length of hospital stay after lumbar spine surgery.
   METHODS: Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were analyzed from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014. Study participants were 23,102 patients undergoing a 1-level or 2-level lumbar decompression and fusion procedure. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio for risk-adjusted extended length of hospital stay, defined as patients with a hospital stay greater than the 75th percentile (LOS > 5 days) for the cohort. The primary outcome was the extent to which extended LOS represented preoperative patient illness or postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Of 23,102 participants, 3794 (16.42%) had extended LOS. Most patients (2849 patients; 75.10%) with extended LOS did not have a documented postoperative complication. Only a minority of patients with extended LOS had a history of comorbidities known to influence outcomes in patients undergoing spine surgery, including diabetes (24%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%), congestive heart failure (0.69%), myocardial infarction (0.20%), acute renal failure (0.26%), and stroke (2.23%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that much of the variation in LOS after lumbar spine surgery is not attributable to baseline patient illness or complications and most likely represents differences in practice style or surgeon preference.

DE Angioplasty; Intracranial atherosclerosis; Stents; Stroke
ID THERAPY; WARFARIN; ASPIRIN; DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: The optimal management of intracranial arterial stenosis is unclear, particularly in patients who have failed medical management. We report a multicenter real-world experience of endovascular recanalization of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis refractory to aggressive medical therapy.
   METHODS: Retrospective multicenter case series of consecutive endovascularly treated patients presenting with symptomatic (transient ischemic attack [TIA] or stroke) intracranial stenosis who had failed medical therapy. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with recurrent TIA or stroke despite medical management (group 1) versus patients presenting with a stroke and worsening symptoms (progressive or crescendo stroke) despite medical management (group 2).
   RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were treated in 8 stroke centers from August 2009 to May 2017. Sixty-nine presented with recurrent TIA or stroke and 32 with stroke and worsening symptoms. Successful recanalization was achieved in 84% of patients. Periprocedural stroke occurred in 3 patients and 2 had a recurrent ischemic stroke at the 90-day follow-up. Symptomatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage secondary to reperfusion injury occurred in 3 patients and 1 had a hemorrhagic stroke after discharge. There were 2 periprocedural perforations that resulted in death. At 90 days, 86% of patients (64/74) did not have a recurrence of stroke and the 90-day cumulative ischemic stroke rate was 6.7% with 90-day mortality of 11.2%. The 90-day favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, <= 2) rate was 77.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization of unstable intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in patients who have failed medical therapy is feasible. Future randomized trials need to determine if recanalization is of any value for this population.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify independent risk factors for nonhome discharge in patients undergoing laminectomy for intradural extramedullary spinal tumors.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2014. Adult patients who underwent laminectomy for the excision of intradural extramedullary spinal tumors were included and divided into 2 groups based on home or non-home discharge disposition. We compared baseline patient characteristics, comorbidities, and operative factors between the 2 groups, and then performed multivariate regression analyses to identify independent risk factors for non-home discharge.
   RESULTS: A total of 1232 patients were included, of whom 248 (20.1%) were discharged to a non-home facility. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients discharged to a non-home facility were more frequently aged >= 65 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >= 3 with obesity, diabetes, dyspnea, functional dependence, cardiac comorbidity, renal comorbidity, and anemia. Operative factors correlated with non-home discharge were operative time of >= 4 hours and tumor location in the cervical or thoracic spine. Multivariate regression analysis identified age >= 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.73; confidence interval [CI] 1.80-4.13; P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >= 3 (OR 2.36; CI 1.53-3.65; P < 0.001), dependent functional status (OR 4.30; CI 1.95-9.48; P < 0.001), hospital-acquired conditions (OR 2.32; CI 1.15-4.68; P = 0.019), and prolonged length of stay (OR 4.05; CI 2.72-6.03; P < 0.001) as predictors of non-home discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of patients at risk for non-home discharge is important in order to implement comprehensive discharge planning protocols that reduce inpatient length of stay, as well as associated complications and costs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe microsurgical anatomy of the rhomboid lip (RL) and to consider its role by presenting histology and clinical cases.
   METHODS: We examined 10 (20 sides) formalin-fixed adult human cadaveric heads injected with colored silicone. A total of 20 RLs were examined posteriorly. We examined the expansion of the RL in the cerebellopontine cistern. We assessed the relationship between the RL and choroid plexus and the RL and cranial nerve IX and classified the RL. We also observed these relationships in clinical cases during surgeries and examined histologic assessments of the RL.
   RESULTS: The RL was divided into 3 types, non-extension type, lateral extension type, and jugular foramen type, according to the relationship between the RL and choroid plexus. There were many variations of the extension of the RL. The jugular foramen type was rare.
   CONCLUSIONS: Histologically, the RL is the remnant of the fourth ventricle covered with ependymal cells. Knowledge of the detailed anatomy and proper dissection of the RL may help surgeons to obtain good visualization of structures around the foramen of Luschka.

AB INTRODUCTION: Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (IA-tPA) has been widely used in conjunction with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) or as rescue therapy. Data on the safety of IA-tPA as a rescue therapy are scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: To report the safety outcome of IA-tPA during MT with respect to hemorrhage and functional outcome.
   METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively maintained data and identified patients who received mechanical thrombectomy between November 1, 2014, and January 30, 2018. Collected variables included demographics, comor-bidities, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, procedural variables, and outcome variables, which were subjected to a matched and unmatched analysis. Hemorrhagic transformation was classified based on European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study criteria. Functional outcome was assessed based on modified Rankin Scale.
   RESULTS: A total of 486 patients were treated with MT during the study period, of whom 67 patients received IA tPA as a rescue therapy. IA tPA was used at the discretion of neuroendovascular surgeon if complete recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia >= 2c) was not achieved with ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique) or for distal occlusion that could not be reached with thrombectomy catheters. Both groups did not differ in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, or admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. There was no significant difference in good outcome (modified Rankin Scale <= 2), death, any hemorrhage, or parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 between groups in matched and unmatched analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: IA-tPA administration during MT was not associated with increased risk of hemorrhage in selected patients with incomplete recanalization after thrombectomy.

AB INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. There is limited data regarding the occurrence and impact of AKI in the setting of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). Considering this, we sought to determine the incidence and risk factors for AKI in patients with SICH and to determine the role of AKI on SICH mortality in our population.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the data recorded in the stroke registry maintained by the Department of Neurosurgery, Kasturba Hospital, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education after ethical committee clearance. Information regarding clinical features, demographics, laboratory data, prescribing patterns, and the use of contrast-mediated imaging were collected. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Logistic multivariate regression was used to determine predictors of AKI. Analysis of variance was used to measure the effect of AKI on SICH outcome.
   RESULTS: Of 316 patients with SICH admitted to the hospital, 20% of patients developed AKI. It was found that risk factors for AKI were lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 SICH 2.2; P < 0.001) and infectious complications (odds ratio, 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-5.7; P < 0.001). The incidence of 30 days' mortality was higher in the group with AKI (14% vs. 5.5%). There was a significant association between AKI severity and short-term mortality (P < 0.001). Patients with AKI had a lower Glasgow Coma Scale on admission (11.81 +/- 3.17 vs. 10.83 +/- 3.2) and discharge (12.44 +/- 3.44 vs. 10.38 +/- 3.2) compared to patients without AKI (P < 0.001). Greater severity of AKI was associated with worse neurologic outcome (P < 0.001).
   DISCUSSION: Various studies in literature have evaluated the incidence of AKI after a stroke episode. The incidence of AKI was ranging from 8%-21% in those studies. In our study, we found that 20% of SICH patients developed AKI. The incidence of AKI in our study falls along the spectrum described in these previous studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: AKI is a common complication of SICH. Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission and infections were the significant risk factors. Patients with AKI had poor neurologic outcome and higher mortality and it increased with the severity of AKI.

TI Effect of Intra- and Extraoperative Factors on the Efficacy of
   Intraoperative Neuromonitoring During Cervical Spine Surgery

ID PATIENT; CORD
AB INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of various extra- and intraoperative factors on the ability of neuromonitoring to predict neurological complications.
   METHODS: We reviewed the data from 592 patients who had undergone cervical spine surgery with neuromonitoring at Assuta Medical Center from 2006 to 2013. We compared the somatosensory evoked potentials, transcranial electric motor evoked potentials, and electromyographic signals collected throughout surgery with the patient surgical outcome measures, demographic data, preexisting pathological features found on neurological examination, and radiographic findings. Descriptive and inferential analyses were used to estimate the relative explanatory power contributed by these factors.
   RESULTS: We included 468 patients in the present study. Neuromonitoring changes occurred in 100 patients, and the appropriate clinical intervention was undertaken in all 100, with recovery of the signals in 69. A transient neuromonitoring change was not associated with a poor outcome (only 8 of 69 patients). However, a permanent neuromonitoring change was associated with a new neurological deficit (13 of 31 patients) Changes occurring during positioning or decompression were associated with better clinical outcomes than were changes occurring during the rest of the procedure. Extraoperative factors were not associated with an increased risk of neuromonitoring changes during surgery or poorer surgical outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Permanent neuromonitoring changes predicted for new neurological deficits. However, transient changes were not associated with a new deficit. Neuromonitoring changes occurring during positioning and decompression had better clinical outcomes compared with those occurring during the rest of the procedure.

AB BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) are uncommon malignancies of the central nervous system and are often difficult to distinguish radiographically and pathologically from other common tumors. We present the first case of sellar ATRT presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old woman, who had presented with symptoms of headache, diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, and seizures, was found to have a sellar tumor with hemorrhagic transformation. Surgical resection was performed. The pathological examination findings were consistent with ATRT. Despite early surgical intervention, she later died before starting craniospinal radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, although known to present with intratumoral hemorrhage, to date, no cases of sellar ATRT have presented with SAH or IVH have been reported. Considering our finding that ATRT can present with SAH and IVH, establishing the correct diagnosis using radiographic imaging, gender, pathological findings, and molecular markers is paramount for speedy treatment and management.

AB BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene were identified in nearly 20% of families with familial isolated pituitary adenoma. Some variants of AIP have been confirmed to induce tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness; however, the mechanism is still unclear.
   METHODS: A novel missense mutation (c.512C>T, p.T171I) was discovered in 3 patients from a Chinese family with familial isolated pituitary adenoma. In silico and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis predicted the mutation to be pathogenic. GH3 and 293FT cell lines were used to verify the variant's effect on cell proliferation (Cell Counting Kit-8), invasiveness (Transwell) and growth hormone (GH) secretion (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) by transfection with different vectors: control, blank vector, wild-type AIP, p. T171I variant (experimental group), p. Q315* variant, and AIP small interfering RNA. Furthermore, Zac1, Sstr2, interleukin (IL)-6, and Stat3/phosphorylation-Stat3 expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot) in each group was also evaluated.
   RESULTS: The experimental group, p. Q315* variant group, and AIP small interfering RNA-overexpressing group promoted cell proliferation at 24 and 48 hours, respectively (compared with the control group; P < 0.01 for both). Similarly, the cells in the experimental group manifested more invasion and GH secretion compared with the control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the experimental group cells expressed less Sstr2 (a prerequisite for the responsiveness to somatostatin analogues) and Zac1 (tumor suppressor gene), but more IL-6 and phosphorylated-Stat3 (GH-secretion related).
   CONCLUSIONS: The novel AIP mutation c. 512C>T (p.T171I) is a pathogenic variant that promoted cell proliferation, invasiveness, and GH secretion through regulation of Sstr2, Zac1, and IL-6/phosphorylated-Stat3 expression.

AB OBJECTIVE: The latest World Health Organization data showed that stroke was the highest mortality in China, accounting for 23.7% of the total mortality from 2000 to 2012. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was the most deadly and incurable type of stroke. In the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the incidence of stroke was relatively higher. Several studies showed that the shape and heterogeneity of hematoma and image markers on brain computed tomography scan had predictive effects on hematoma expansion (HE). The study aimed to find relative factors and established a nomogram model to predict the HE of ICH.
   METHODS: All patients with ICH in Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital from January 1, 2012, to May 22, 2018, were continuously collected. A total of 402 patients were included in the study. This was a single-center retrospective study. Univariate and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to screen out the independent predictors that were significantly associated with HE.
   RESULTS: The total incidence of HE in ICH was 30.9%, whereas the incidence of HE in the basal ganglia and nonbasal ganglia was 36.4% and 17.2%, respectively. Diabetes, basal ganglia hemorrhage, time of onset to baseline computed tomography, island sign, blend sign, black hole sign, and swirl sign were independent predictors of HE. Based on these predictors, a nomogram model was established and the accuracy was 81.6%, the sensitivity was 91.1%, and the specificity was 70.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This model had a high accuracy of predicting HE in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Because this model is noninvasive, rapid, and low cost, it is easy to promote and has wide application prospects in clinical practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite no clear evidence from randomized trials, surgical intervention of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) still occurs. We sought to describe the characteristics of patients undergoing surgical intervention in ICH.
   METHODS: Data from the ERICH (ERICH Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage) study were analyzed, and patients with ICH were categorized into surgical intervention or nonoperative management groups. Patients with primary intraventricular hemorrhage and those without data regarding the use of surgical intervention were excluded.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 2947 patients, and surgical intervention was performed in 289 (10%). Younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.967; P < 0.001), lower baseline modified Rankin Scale score (OR, 0.728; P < 0.001), higher admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 1.059; P = 0.007), larger ICH volume (OR, 1.037; P < 0.001), infratentorial ICH location (OR, 5.966; P < 0.001), lobar ICH location (OR, 1.906; P = 0.001), lack of intraventricular hemorrhage (OR, 0.567; P = 0.001), intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (OR, 5.022; P < 0.001), and mannitol use (OR, 2.389; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of surgical intervention. Younger age (OR, 0.953; P < 0.001), lower baseline modified Rankin Scale score (OR, 0.713; P = 0.002), larger ICH volume (OR, 1.033; P < 0.001), lobar ICH location (OR, 2.467; P < 0.001), ICP monitoring (OR, 3.477; P < 0.001), and mannitol use (OR, 2.139; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of surgical interventions in supratentorial ICHs. Larger ICH volume (OR, 1.078; P < 0.001), ICP monitoring (OR, 6.099; P < 0.001), and mannitol use (OR, 2.952; P = 0.005) were independent predictors of surgical interventions in infratentorial ICHs.
   CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple factors associated with surgical intervention for patients with ICH. Younger age, good neurologic function at baseline, large ICH volume on presentation, and lobar or infratentorial hematomas were independently associated with surgical intervention in patients with ICH .

   SAGITTAL BALANCE; OSTEOTOMIES; COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior column realignment (ACR) is a new emerging minimally invasive surgical technique for adult spinal deformity (ASD) that has the potential to provide similar corrective ability to traditional posterior approaches. This article reviews the current literature on the clinical efficacy and safety of ACR and illustrates an additional use of this technique in a case of sagittal imbalance after posterior spinal fusion with segmental instrumentation.
   METHODS: We performed a literature search of all published ACR reports using PubMed, including only clinical studies describing the ACR technique and reporting radiographic and/or clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Improvement in lumbar lordosis after ACR ranged from 12.7 degrees to 39 degrees, and increases in focal segmental lordosis at each ACR level ranged from 1 degrees to 34 degrees. Good clinical and functional outcomes have consistently been reported after ACR. The complication rate has been comparable to or lower than traditional posterior-based techniques. We also illustrate the use of ACR in a patient with sagittal imbalance after a prior posterior instrumented spinal fusion. ACR in combination with a posterior osteotomy allowed for the induction of lordosis by cantilevering of rods and compression of pedicle screws.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic and clinical outcomes after ACR have been promising so far. In addition to primary ASD surgery, ACR can also be effectively used in cases with prior posterior instrumented spinal fusion to correct sagittal imbalance.

AB OBJECTIVE: The new direct gradual cranial expansion surgical technique has been used to treat children with postshunt microcephaly and slit ventricle syndrome. To evaluate the feasibility of this new surgical treatment, we studied intracranial pressure (ICP) in microcephalic children with developmental delay.
   METHODS: Mean ICP, age, sex, head size, and developmental assessments were compared in 24 microcephalic children with developmental delay who had had continuous ICP monitoring.
   RESULTS: Children studied included 9 boys and 15 girls with a mean age of 4.9 +/- 2.0 years. Mean ICP was 18.7 +/- 8.6 mm Hg. Children with high ICP had significantly lower age and higher B wave ratios than children with low ICP. There were no statistically significant differences in developmental scores and head sizes between children with high ICP and children with low ICP. In multiple linear regression analysis, we observed significantly increased risk of mean ICP elevation by B wave ratio and developmental score and decreased risk of mean ICP elevation by age, but not significantly increased risk of mean ICP elevation by head circumferences (z score).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a portion of microcephalic children with developmental delay have high ICP that cannot be expected from head sizes, and high ICP has decreasing tendency with age.

AB BACKGROUND: Extensive evidence supports mechanical thrombectomy using stentrievers (SR) for acute large vessel occlusion (aLVO). Aspiration is also used as a first pass or adjunct technique during clot removal. Here we report technical results from mechanical thrombectomy cases using SR alone, aspiration alone (AD), or a combination of SR and aspiration (SA) as a first pass for aLVO.
   METHODS: An institutional stroke database was reviewed for patients presenting to a single academic institution with anterior circulation aLVO and who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy from 2011 to 2017. Patients managed with SR alone, AD, or a combination of these 2 techniques (SA) were identified. The rate of successful recanalization after the first thrombectomy attempt was compared between the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 353 patients were analyzed, including 215 in SR, 32 in AD, and 106 in SA groups. There was no significant difference for age and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale between the groups. Successful recanalization rates after the first pass were 35.8% in the SR group, 34.4% in aspiration as a first pass technique, and 55.7% in SA, with a statistically significant higher rate of first pass success in the SA group (P = 0.002). Using balloon-guide catheter doubled the rate of successful first pass recanalization from 21.3% to 41.6% in the SR group (P = 0.005); however, the SA technique was more effective for first pass recanalization when compared with an SR and balloon-guide catheter combination (55.7% vs. 41.6%, P = 0.025).
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of SR and catheter aspiration can increase the rate of single pass successful recanalization compared with these techniques individually.

TI Single-Center Case Series of Temporary Stent Assistance for Coiling of
   Acutely Ruptured Aneurysms
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Balloon; Endovascular; Solitaire; Stent
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; EMBOLIZATION; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Wide-necked intracranial aneurysms continue to pose a challenge for endovascular surgeons. Flow diversion and stent-assisted coiling are 2 techniques that have improved the ability to manage these lesions, but these require the use of dual antiplatelet therapy. In patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, dual antiplatelet therapy is relatively contraindicated, and many surgeons prefer to use open techniques or balloon assistance for coiling, although at times the latter is not feasible. We describe temporary stent assistance using retrievable stents for coiling of ruptured intracranial aneurysms as an endovascular management option.
   METHODS: Surgeon case logs were retrospectively reviewed for cases of temporary stent assistance for aneurysm coiling. Cases were identified and compiled into a case series.
   RESULTS: Seven cases were identified, including 6 using the Solitaire FR device in an off-label manner as a temporary stent for assistance with coiling of wide-necked aneurysms. One patient experienced intraoperative aneurysm rupture (planned stent coiling; stent placement aborted after rupture), but otherwise no hemorrhagic complications were noted. Two patients experienced radiographic thromboembolic complications, with 1 patient requiring intervention during the index operation, but neither patient experienced demonstrable neurologic deficits postoperatively. After mean follow-up of 9 months, the average Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14, and the average modified Rankin Scale score was 1.2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stents and stent retrievers can be temporarily used for technically challenging aneurysms as an alternative to balloon assistance for treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms without needing to use dual antiplatelet therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: The infarct volume is associated with the clinical outcome after ischemic stroke. We investigated the factors associated with infarct growth and its effect on functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: The present retrospective study included 158 patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving endovascular treatment at the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center from 2011 to 2016. The patients' clinical parameters were collected. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before treatment and 24 hours after endovascular treatment to calculate the infarct volume. The infarct sizes were measured using apparent diffusion coefficient maps. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores at discharge and 90 days after discharge were used to evaluate the functional outcomes. An mRS score of 0-2 was defined as a good outcome. The predictors of infarct growth and mRS score at 90 days were analyzed using regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Patients with smaller infarct growth had significantly better clinical outcomes as measured by the mRS score at discharge and at 90 days and mortality at 90 days (P < 0.001). Infarct growth of 12.11 cm(2) was defined as the optimal cutoff to predict the clinical outcome using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (computed tomography) score (odds ratio [OR], 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.665-0.962; P = 0.017) and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score (OR, 0.259; 95% CI, 0.120-0.559; P = 0.001) were independent factors that predicted for infarct growth. Infarct growth (OR, 1.044; 95% CI, 1.024-1.064; P < 0.001) and baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale score (OR, 1.070; 95% CI, 1.008-1.136; P = 0.027) were independent factors that predicted the mRS score at 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Infarct growth was associated with the functional outcome. Smaller infarct growth correlated with better outcomes. A greater Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score and better perfusion predicted for smaller infarct growth.

ID TRAUMA CARE; INDIA; SYSTEMS; NEUROSURGERY; DELAYS
AB BACKGROUND: With the increasing population, motorization, and road traffic accidents, neurotrauma has been increasing in India. Inadequate triage and underusage of locally available resources at all healthcare levels has led to nonuniform neurotrauma care delivery. We present our experience at a tertiary care hospital. We evaluated the referral pattern of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) cases to enable adequate care to patients with moderate and severely injured TBI.
   METHODS: All patients with head injury (n = 3891) referred to the emergency department of our institution during a 4-month period were evaluated. The demographic characteristics, ambulance usage, and time management during in-hospital patient flow were evaluated using the Lean Six Sigma approach. We have also provided solutions for optimal usage of available resources.
   RESULTS: Patients with mTBI comprised 77% of head injury referrals. Of all the patients referred from peripheral hospitals, 48% had normal head computed tomography (CT) scan findings. The CT waiting and lead (arrival-to-discharge) times were 35 +/- 44 minutes and 114 minutes, respectively. No clinical to radiological correlation was found between the head CT scan findings and a decision to refer a patient to our institute. Only 10% of the patients with abnormal head CT scans (41%) required neurosurgical intervention. The mean duration from CT imaging to the initiation of surgery was 192.7 +/- 172.1 minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with mTBI were referred to a tertiary care center, leading to secondary overtriage and overburdening of the existing resources at a specialized care hospital, possibly owing to ineffective triage at the primary and secondary healthcare centers. This would limit the adequate management of moderate to severe TBI cases in such a hospital.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulant therapy (ACT) after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage may lead to progression of hemorrhage, but in the presence of thromboembolic events, the clinician must decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. Currently, no data exist to guide therapy in the acute setting.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients admitted to our institution with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage that received intravenous heparin, full-dose enoxaparin, or warfarin during their initial hospitalization over a 3-year period. We reviewed their demographics, hospital course, clinical indication and timing for initiation of ACT, and complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were identified. The median age and Glasgow Coma Scale score of these patients was 50.5 years and 9.5, respectively. Twenty-two patients required neurosurgical procedures for their presenting injury, including intracranial pressure monitors and/ or open surgeries. Fifty-four patients had deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism prior to initiation, and the remaining 20 patients had preexisting conditions or other indications for initiating ACT. The median time from injury to starting ACT was 8 days. Immediate complications occurred in 6 patients; however, none of these patients required a neurosurgical intervention. Delayed complications included progression of acute to chronic subdural hematoma that required intervention in 2 patients. One patient died from delayed hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: For this patient population, the risk of immediate and delayed intracranial hemorrhages from initiating ACT therapy in intracranial injury must be weighed against the morbidity of delaying treatment. Although further studies are needed, our review provides the first rates of complications for this patient population.

AB BACKGROUND: Smoking is a known risk factor for inferior health outcomes. Retrospective analyses of large datasets may assesswhether such risk is manifested or mitigated in clinical practice. Although many risk factor analyses use the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), such investigations have seldom been directly compared.
   METHODS: NIS and NSQIP datasets were used. Primary outcome measures were perioperative complications. NSQIP complications were stratified based on occurrence before versus after discharge. Multiple logistic regression was employed in adjusted analyses.
   RESULTS: Among NSQIP (N = 56,145) and NIS (N = 1,311,426) patients, 24.0% and 31.8% were identified as tobacco users, respectively. Before discharge, NSQIP smokers had increased odds of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.43), postoperative intubation (aOR = 1.40), and sepsis (aOR = 1.71) and decreased odds of pulmonary embolism (aOR = 0.57) (all P < 0.05). After discharge, NSQIP smokers exhibited increased odds of cardiac arrest (aOR = 2.53) and surgical site infection (aOR = 1.25) and decreased odds of urinary tract infection (aOR = 0.68) and deep venous thrombosis (aOR = 0.61) (all P < 0.05). In adjusted analysis of NIS data, tobacco users exhibited increased odds of inpatient pneumonia (aOR = 1.57), myocardial infarction (aOR = 1.29), and postoperative intubation (aOR = 1.15) and decreased odds of pulmonary embolism (aOR = 0.80) and deep venous thrombosis (aOR = 0.78) (all P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of tobacco use undergoing spinal fusion were at increased risk of pneumonia and intubation but decreased risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during the inpatient postoperative stay. After discharge, smokers exhibited increased odds of cardiac arrest and surgical site infection. NIS and NSQIP results were similar, with 9 of 12 outcomes exhibiting identical inpatient conclusions. Qualitative comparison of NIS and NSQIP yields results that offer increased validity over single-source studies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Medpor porous polyethylene implant is reported to be safe and effective for sellar reconstruction after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). However, we have observed several cases of delayed chronic sphenoid sinusitis related to the implant. The purpose of this study is to describe the presentation and management of implant-related sphenoid sinusitis after sellar reconstruction.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent endonasal TSS with Medpor sellar reconstruction between December 2008 and January 2013 at a tertiary care institution. Patient demographics, initial surgical management, sinonasal symptoms, postoperative imaging, sinusitis management, and resulting outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: From 2008-2013, 139 patients underwent sellar reconstruction using Medpor. Five patients (3.6%) presented between 8 and 60 months after surgery with chronic sphenoid sinusitis that required surgical management. All 5 patients presented as outpatients for management of headaches and nasal drainage, 4 patients experienced chronic nasal congestion, and 3 patients noted recurrent sinusitis. At the time of revision surgery, all 5 patients were found to have mucosal inflammation and edema surrounding the implant, and 4 of the 5 had an exposed or partially extruded implant that was removed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of the sellar floor may be performed after TSS to prevent postoperative complications. Although porous polyethylene implants have previously been described as safe and effective for this purpose, surgeons should be aware of the risk of subsequent implant extrusion and chronic sphenoid sinusitis that can occur in a delayed manner.

TI The Volume of Ischemic Brain Predicts Poor Outcome in Patients with

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant middle cerebral artery stroke is a life-threatening condition. The outcomes of surgical treatments have presented strong evidence in favor of decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC). A significant subpopulation of patients still experience very poor outcomes. In particular, indication for DHC is based on few objective parameters to facilitate decision making. We hypothesized that larger ischemic brain volume would have a large impact on the outcome.
   METHODS: A cohort study of 34 patients undergoing DHC was performed using a volumetric analysis of infarction volume (measured preoperatively and again on postoperative day [POD] 1 and POD 3). Outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and a favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score <= 3.
   RESULTS: Median age of patients was 53.5 years (range, 25-72 years), the median time from onset of first symptoms to surgical intervention was 38 hours (range, 10-150 hours), and male-to-female ratio was 2:1. The median ischemic volume was 250 cm3 preoperatively, 315 cm(3) on POD1, and 349 cm(3) on POD3. Modified Rankin Scale score <= 3 after 6 months was attained in 7 (20%) patients. Within the first 24 hours after DHC, ischemic volume increased significantly (P = 0.0003) and was associated with a worse outcome (P < 0.0001) after exceeding a cutoff volume of 300 cm(3).
   CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric analysis of infarction can predict the outcome of patients. DHC should be reserved for patients with prognosticated good outcome, which was observed only in patients with a volume <301 cm(3).

ID PINEAL-REGION; JUNCTION; TUMORS; CRANIOTOMY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas arising at the pineal region are a rare entity and still represent a great neurosurgical challenge given their deep location and critical neuroanatomic relationships. The optimal surgical approach to treat these lesions is still under debate. Our objective is to review the topographic and diagnostic features of these lesions, which can help to guide an optimal surgical outcome.
   METHODS: We present 2 clinical cases of falcotentorial meningiomas successfully treated at our institution (2016-2017) with different surgical approaches. A literature review is performed, and a description of the classification, anatomic relationships, clinical features, diagnosis, and different surgical options and outcomes of these lesions is presented.
   RESULTS: The first patient was treated via a supracerebellar infratentorial approach, and the second patient was treated via a parieto-occipital interhemispheric approach. In both tumors, a gross total resection was achieved with no permanent neurologic deficits. In the literature review, gross total resection rates range from 33% to 100%, with no differences regarding the type of meningioma or the surgical approach performed. Permanent neurologic morbidity varies from 0% to 50%, and mortality rates range from 0% to 23%. The distortion and displacement of the vein of Galen and straight sinus represent the most important feature in the decision of optimal surgical approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pineal region meningiomas represent very infrequent, challenging lesions, and their description in the literature is scarce. The systematic topographic classification of these tumors and evaluation of the neuroanatomic structures involved are crucial to guide a safe and optimal surgical approach and achieve satisfactory outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A (MICA) is one of the natural killer group 2D ligands. Soluble major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A (sMICA) mediates tumor immune escape, but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the expression of phospho-p38, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and MICA and their relationships among each other in pituitary adenoma tissues to provide a histologic basis for the mechanism of pituitary adenoma immune escape.
   METHODS: We applied immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot to detect phospho-p38, MMP-9, and MICA expression at the mRNA and protein levels in pituitary adenoma tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to examine the expression levels of MMP-9 and sMICA in peripheral blood serum from patients with pituitary adenoma.
   RESULTS: We found that p38, MICA, and MMP-9 mRNA levels were greater in pituitary adenomas than in normal tissues. The phospho-p38, MMP-9, and MICA proteins were overexpressed in pituitary adenomas, and the expression of MMP-9 and MICA were positively correlated with the expression of phospho-p38. In addition, the serum levels of sMICA and MMP-9 proteins in pituitary adenoma patients were significantly greater than those in normal controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that activation of the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may increase MICA expression and induce MMP-9 expression. MMP-9 is involved in the shedding of sMICA from MICA to promote tumor immune escape. Furthermore, p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase could potentially represent a novel target for inhibiting pituitary adenoma immune escape.

TI Outcome of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Human Immunodeficiency

DT Article

ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HIV-INFECTION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; PROFILE;
   UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND: In 2000, we advised against insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) complicated by hydrocephalus. However, this was in the era when combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) was not freely available in South Africa. In this subsequent preliminary report, we describe the outcome of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients with TBM and hydrocephalus who are HIV positive and receiving ART.
   METHODS: We compared a group of 15 HIV-positive patients with TBM and hydrocephalus on ART with a retrospective control group of 15 patients (demographically and clinically matched) but not on ART. All patients were otherwise managed similarly and evaluated at 1 month after VPS insertion.
   RESULTS: In historical controls, 10 patients died (66.7%) and no patient showed any improvement 1 month after shunting. In contrast, in the current group on ART, 4 patients died (26.7%), with 11 patients (73.3%) having a good outcome. Eight of 12 patients with grade 3 TBM had a good outcome, whereas all 3 with grade 1 TBM made a good recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of VP shunting in HIV-positive patients with TBM and hydrocephalus is markedly improved in patients on ART. Based on limited data from this study, we recommend that better grades of TBM (1 and 2) undergo immediate VPS surgery. Patients with grade 4 TBM should undergo a trial of external ventricular drainage and those who improve should undergo a definitive procedure. Further research is required for patients with grade 3 TBM to identify characteristics associated with better outcomes to allow for effective use of limited resources.

   ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial arachnoid cysts are generally benign and can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. When symptoms are indicated, the effects of arachnoid cysts can be disabling to the patient. Quantitative assessment on the effectiveness of surgical intervention to relieve symptoms is inconsistently reported throughout the literature and is often contradictory. Due to this lack of direct evidence and disagreement among practitioners, nonsurgical treatment, such as pain management, is often prescribed. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effectiveness of the 3 most common surgical treatments (craniotomy, endoscopic fenestration, and shunting) in relieving patient symptoms and to provide a resource of case study information for doctors and patients considering surgical intervention.
   METHODS: A worldwide literature review was performed using the PubMed database to collect reported data on case studies describing surgical intervention for intracranial arachnoid cysts. A meta-analytic review was performed on the viable data to investigate the overall surgical effectiveness for an adult population (aged 18 years or older). To increase the number of patient outcomes, some mixed data (case studies containing both adult and pediatric patients) were included in this study.
   RESULTS: The meta-analytic results show that, for the mixed adult and pediatric population, surgical treatment improves patient outcomes ((r) over bar = 0.828; P < 0.01), and the specific effects for craniotomy, shunting, and endoscopy are <(r)over bar> = 0.890, 0.738, and 0.892. For the adult-only population, the meta-analytic results show that surgical treatment also improves patient outcomes ((r) over bar = 0.667; P < 0.01), and the specific effects for craniotomy, shunting, and endoscopy are <(r)over bar> = 0.638, 0.684, and 0.727.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that surgical intervention is an effective approach to reduce or eliminate symptoms caused by intracranial arachnoid cysts.

ID COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS; TITANIUM-CAGES; SUBSIDENCE; ALLOGRAFT
AB OBJECTIVE: The nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide66 (nHA/PA66) cage is a novel biomimetic nonmetal cage, whereas the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage has been widely used for decades with excellent clinical outcomes. However, there has been no long-term comparison of these 2 cages in anterior cervical reconstruction.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 98 patients who underwent single-level anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) from January 2009 to June 2011 with at least 7 years of follow-up; the PEEK cage was used in 51 patients (PEEK group), whereas the n-HA/PA66 cage was used in 47 (n-HA/PA66 group). The groups were compared regarding radiographic (cage subsidence, fusion status, cervical lordosis, and segmental sagittal alignment) and clinical (10-point visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores) parameters preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the final follow-up.
   RESULTS: The n-HA/PA66 and PEEK cages had similar fusion rates at the final follow-up (97.9% vs. 98.0%). The respective cage subsidence rates in the PEEK and n-HA/PA66 cage groups were 9.8% and 10.6%. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in mean cervical lordosis, mean interbody height, segmental sagittal alignment, cervical lordosis, and 10-point visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores at the final follow-up. The n-HA/PA66 cages resulted in high fusion and low subsidence rates during long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: After single-level ACDF, the n-HA/PA66 cage showed similar radiographic fusion, subsidence rate, and clinical results compared with the PEEK cage during 7 years of follow-up. These results suggest that the n-HA/PA66 cage could be comparable with the PEEK cage for ACDF.

AB BACKGROUND: We have introduced a new operation for isthmic spondylolysis in adolescents and evaluated its clinical efficacy.
   METHODS: A total of 30 adolescent patients with isthmic spondylolysis and chronic low back pain underwent "temporary" short-segmental pedicle screw combined with transverse device fixation and isthmic bone graft repair treatment. Radiograph and computed tomography images were evaluated during regular follow-up examinations to confirm successful bone graft fusion, after which the fixation was removed. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 1 year after fixation surgery and 1 year after fixation removal. Modic and Pfirrmann grading standards were used to observe the effect of " temporary" fixation on the corresponding vertebral endplate and intervertebral disc.
   RESULTS: All 30 patients had complete follow-up data available at 2 years postoperatively. The low back pain symptoms had disappeared completely, and radiographs and computed tomography showed that the isthmus in all patients had achieved bony fusion. With removal of the internal fixation, motion of the fixed segment recovered. "Temporary" rigid internal fixation did not increase the corresponding vertebral endplate or intervertebral disc degeneration.
   CONCLUSIONS: "Temporary" short-segmental pedicle screw combined with transverse device fixation is a simple and effective method for adolescent isthmic spondylolysis with rigid internal fixation and accelerated bone graft fusion.

The median tumor volume was 2.60 cm(3) (range, 0.06-32.40 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose was 14.0 Gy (range, 11.0-20.0 Gy). Postradiosurgery peritumoral edema (PRPTE) was developed in 43 lesions (29.9%).
   RESULTS: New seizure attacks developed in 16 patients (12.0%) after SRS (first seizure attack in 14 [87.5%]; seizure aggravation in 2 [12.5%]). In 15 patients with new seizure attacks (93.8%), PRPTE was proved on magnetic resonance imaging. The mean interval between SRS and new seizure attack was 6.6 +/- 7.1 (range, 0.23-28.8) months. Simple partial seizure was the most common type of seizure (n = 9 [56.3%]). Five patients (31.3%) were seizure-free with antiepileptic drug (AED) medication (3 [18.8%] withdrew AEDs during the follow-up period); however, the remaining 11 patients (68.7%) did not achieve seizure-free outcomes even with AED medication. Moreover, seizures became intractable in 8 patients (50.0%). From multivariate analysis, the significant predictors of post-SRS seizure attack were PRPTE (odds ratio, 53.99; 95% confidence interval, 5.214-559.1; P = 0.001) and brain-tumor contact-surface index (odds ratio, 2.466; 95% confidence interval, 1.183-5.138; P = 0.016).
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes of seizures after SRS for ST-MNGs fall short of our expectation, and seizures seem to be uncontrollable and even intractable.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior atlantoaxial fusion is an important armamentarium for neurosurgeons to treat several pathologies involving the craniovertebral junction. Although the potential advantages of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) are well documented in the lumbar spine, its indication for C1-C2 fusion has not been well characterized. In our institution, we apply rhBMP-2 to the C1-C2 joint either alone or with hydroxyapatite, locally harvested autograft chips, and/or morselized allogenic bone graft for selected cases-without conventional posterior structural bone graft. We report the clinical outcomes of the surgical technique to elucidate its feasibility.
   METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective review of data from 2008 to 2016 and identified 69 patients who had undergone posterior atlantoaxial fusion with rhBMP-2. The clinical records of these patients were reviewed, and the baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative complications were collected and statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: The average age of the 69 patients was 60.8 +/- 4.5 years, and 55.1% were women. With an average follow-up period of 21.1 +/- 4.2 months, the C1-C2 fusion rate was 94.3% (65 of 69), and the average time to fusion was 11.4 +/- 2.6 months (range, 5-23). The overall reoperation rate was 10.1% (7 of 69), with instrumentation failure in 7 patients (10.1%), adjacent segment disease in 2 (2.9%), and postoperative dysphagia and dyspnea in 2 patients (2.9%). No ectopic bone formation or soft tissue edema developed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although retrospective and from a single center, our study has shown that rhBMP-2 usage at the C1-C2 joint without posterior structural bone grafting is a safe and reasonable surgical option.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to study the outcome of brain metastases in a cohort of patients undergoing a second course of stereotactic image-guided robotic radiosurgery and to identify predictors corelated with survival.
   METHODS: A total of 63 patients with primary malignancies underwent a second course of CyberKnife radiosurgery for intracranial progression, including recurrence and new metastases after initial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Overall survival (OS) and control rate were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze predictive factors for survival.
   RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 12 months after second SRS, the median OS of the second course of radiosurgery was 18 months. On multivariate analysis, the sum of total planned target volume (hazard ratio, 2.112; 95% confidence interval, 1.069-4.173) and minimum dose (hazard ratio, 1.990, 95% confidence interval, 1.017-3.892) were significantly associated with OS. Median intracranial progression-free survival was 23 months. The 6-month and 12-month local control rates of the targets were 97.0% and 94.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that only tumor number significantly influenced intracranial progression-free survival (P = 0.012). Nine patients (14.2%) developed brain necrosis. Median time to brain necrosis in regions in which brain necrosis occurred after a single course of SRS was not reached, compared with 16 months for those treated with repeat SRS (P = 0.041).
   CONCLUSIONS: A second course of CyberKnife radiosurgery seems to be an effective salvage option for brain progression after initial SRS. The total planned target volume shows prediction for OS. Tumor volume of initial SRS may influence selection of the potential population that may benefit from salvage radiosurgery.

   ISODOSE; VOLUME
AB OBJECTIVE: Shot-within-shot (SWS) optimization is a new planning technique that relies on various combinations of shot weighting and prescription isodose line (IDL) to reduce beam-on time. The method differs from other planning techniques that incorporate mixed collimation, multiple stereotactic coordinates, and traditionally low prescription IDLs (<60%). In this work, we evaluate the percentage of brain metastasis for which the method can be applied, the magnitude of the resultant time savings, and the possible tradeoffs in plan quality.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 75 patients treated for 241 metastatic lesions in the brain. For each lesion, the original planning metrics related to target coverage, conformity, gradient, and beam-on time were recorded. A subset of lesions were selected for replanning using the SWS technique based on size, shape, and proximity to critical structures. Two replans were done, a reference plan was prescribed at the 50% IDL, and an optimized plan was prescribed at an IDL typically >50%. Planning metrics were then compared among the original plan and the 2 replans.
   RESULTS: More than a third (39%) of the brain metastases were eligible for the SWS technique. For these lesions, the differences between the original plan and reference SWS plan were as follows: Delta V-12Gy < 0.5 cc in 93% of cases, Delta V-12Gy < 0.5 cc in 100% of cases, Delta selectivity < 0.1 in 79% of cases. Negligible differences were seen between the 2 replans in terms of Delta selectivity and Delta V-12Gy; Delta GI < 5% in 99% of cases. After optimization, beam-on time was reduced by 25% -30% in approximately 40% -50% of eligible lesions when compared with the reference SWS plan (Delta T-max = 42%). In comparison with the original plan, beam-on time was reduced even further, Delta T > 50% in 20% of cases (Delta T-max = 70%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates clinically that optimization using the shot-within-shot technique can reduce beam-on time without degrading treatment plan quality.

ID PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; SERUM-ALBUMIN; MORTALITY; HYPOALBUMINEMIA; RISK;

AB BACKGROUND: None of the existing prognostic scoring systems for spinal epidural abscess (SEA) include albumin despite albumin's established role in inflammation, nutrition, lipid peroxidation, and regulation of apoptosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prognostic value of albumin in SEA.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective, case-control study of 2 independent data sets: patients with SEA in an institutional population and patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Bivariate analyses and multivariate analyses were used to determine whether albumin is an independent prognostic factor for survival in both data sets.
   RESULTS: For the 1053 patients with SEA in the institutional cohort, the 90-day postdischarge mortality was 134 (12.7%). Overall, 633 (60.1%) underwent surgery in the initial admission, with a 30-day postoperative mortality rate of 5.5% (n = 35). For the 1154 patients with SEA in the NSQIP database, the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 3.6% (n = 42). The rate of 90-day postdischarge mortality in the institutional cohort for patients with albumin <2.3 g/dL was 25.1%. In contrast, the rate for patients with albumin >3.3 g/dL was 4.5%. On multivariate analysis of the NSQIP database, hypoalbuminemia was an independent prognostic factor for 30-day postoperative mortality. On multivariate analysis of the institutional cohort, hypoalbuminemia remained a prognostic factor for 90-day postdischarge mortality.
   CONCLUSION: Albumin was validated as an independent prognostic factor in patients with SEA. The lack of this marker in existing scoring systems underscores the need for updated models to optimize risk stratification and shared decision-making before surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Epidemiology in upper extremity peripheral nerve injury (PNI) has not been comprehensively evaluated. The aim of this study was to calculate updated incidence of upper extremity PNIs in the United States and examine clinical trends and costs using a national database.
   METHODS: The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample was used to evaluate patients with upper extremity PNI (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 9534, 9550-9559) in 2001-2013.
   RESULTS: A weighted total of 170,579 patients experienced upper extremity PNI, representing a mean incidence of 43.8/1 million people annually. Mean (+/- SEM) age of patients was 38.1 +/- 0.05 years, 74.3% of patients were male, and 49.0% were Caucasian. PNIs occurred to the ulnar (17.8%), radial (15.1%), digital (18.0%), median (13.0%), multiple (11.5%), and other (10.1%) nerves and brachial plexus (14.5%). The number of upper extremity PNIs decreased overall. Average care charge was $ 47,004 +/- $ 185, with an average increase of $ 4623/year and compound annual growth rate of 9.59%. Although surgical nerve repair and home disposition were common with isolated PNIs, patients with brachial plexus PNIs did not have nerve surgery and were more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facilities. Multivariate analysis showed that length of stay (beta = 0.677, P = 0.0001) and number of procedures (beta = 0.188, P = 0.0001) most affected total patient charges.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an overall decrease in number of PNIs, suggesting lower incidence or frequency of detection; however, the cost of care has increased. Despite advances in nerve repair techniques, nerve surgery rates have not increased, especially for brachial plexus injuries, which may be undertreated.

AB BACKGROUND: In the modern, increasingly pay-for-performance era, unplanned return to the operating room (ROR) is gaining attention as a surgical quality metric. However, large-scale data on the appropriateness and usefulness of this measure in neurosurgery are scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive description of all RORs after neurosurgical procedures in a national surgical registry and identify factors associated with ROR.
   METHODS: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program multicenter database for patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures during 2012-2016. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with 30-day unplanned ROR after the 3 most common inpatient cranial and spinal operations: craniotomy for intra-axial neoplasm, convexity/falx meningioma, or skull base tumors; anterior cervical discectomy and fusion; and posterior lumbar decompression and posterior lumbar fusion.
   RESULTS: A total of 193,459 cases were identified, of which 7067 (3.7%) had at least 1 unplanned ROR within 30 days after the index procedure (inpatient, 4.3%; outpatient, 1.5%). Overall, the most common reasons were wound complication/surgical site infection (0.7%), hematoma evacuation (0.6%), and repeat surgery (0.5%). On multivariable analysis, the relative amount of variation in reoperation risk was found to be 1%-24% for demographics, 1% -19% for comorbidities, 1%-6% for preoperative laboratory values, and 4%-58% for operative characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform stakeholders on the optimal parameters that need to be taken into account when crafting, endorsing, and implementing quality metrics for neurosurgery that aim to assess surgical performance and reward or penalize hospitals and providers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the differences between robot-guided (Mazor X, Mazor Robotics Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) and 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) navigation (O-arm Surgical Imaging System, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) for the insertion of pedicle screws.
   METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 50 patients who underwent robot-guided pedicle screw insertion (between May 2017-October 2017), and 49 patients who underwent 3D-CT navigation pedicle screw insertion (between September 2015-August 2016). Variables included were age, sex, body mass index, blood loss, length of stay, lumbar level(s), operation time, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, accuracy, and time-per-screw placement.
   RESULTS: Mean ages were 59.3 years in the robotic group and 58.2 years in the 3D-CT navigation group. Mean was 30.7 kg/m(2) in the robotic group and 32.1 kg/m(2) in the 3D-CT navigation group. Mean time-per-screw placement was 3.7 minutes for the robotic group and 6.8 minutes for the 3D-CT navigation group, P < 0.001. In the robotic group, 189 of 190 screws were placed with Ravi grade I accuracy, and 1 was grade II. In the 3D-CT navigation group, 157 of 165 screws were Ravi grade I, and 8 were grade II (P = 0.11). Fluoroscopy time (P < 0.001), time-per-screw placement (P < 0.001), and length of stay (P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the robotic group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both technologies are safe and accurate. Robotic technology exposed patients to less fluoroscopy time, decreased time-per-screw placement and shorter hospital stay than 3D-CT navigation. Further studies are warranted to verify our results.

   EPILEPSY; DIAGNOSTIC METHODS; POSTERIOR CORTEX; TASK-FORCE; FDG-PET
AB OBJECTIVE: Multilobar resection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-negative drug-resistant epilepsy warrants attention because they account for up to one third of MRI-negative epilepsy surgery. Despite their high prevalence, data are sparse, and the risk/benefit ratio continues to be debated. The present study investigated the postoperative seizure outcomes in this especially challenging subgroup.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 4 consecutive patients with 3T MRI-negative findings and drug-resistant focal epilepsy who had undergone multi-lobar epilepsy surgery at our institution.
   RESULTS: The mean age at first surgery was 28.5 years (range, 14-48); 1 patient required 2 consecutive reoperations. The final resection was in the frontotemporal and temporo-parieto-occipital regions in 2 patients each. Histopathological examination revealed mild malformations of cortical development in 2 patients and focal cortical dysplasia type Ia and type IIa in 1 patient each. At the last follow-up examination (median, 3.3 years; range, 1-11), 2 patients were completely seizure free (Engel class Ia), 1 patient had experienced some disabling seizures after surgery but had been free of disabling seizures for 2 years at the last follow-up examination (Engel class Ic), and 1 patient had experienced worthwhile improvement (Engel class IIb) and had been seizure free for 1 year at the last follow-up examination. No surgical complications developed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have demonstrated that multilobar epilepsy surgery is effective for lasting seizure control for selected 3T MRI-negative candidates, leading to favorable outcomes for all 4 of our patients. Comprehensive multimodal preoperative evaluation is a prerequisite for postoperative success. Reevaluation should be considered for patients with seizure recurrence, because reoperation could be especially beneficial for selected patients who have not responded to an initially limited resection.

   Lumbar pelvic relationship; Major curve Cobb angle; Sagittal balance
ID SUCCESS; PROGRESSION; CAD/CAM
AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors affecting in-brace correction in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with AIS receiving Gensingen brace treatment in our scoliosis center from July 2015 to October 2017 was performed. The selection of patients was in accordance with the Scoliosis Research Society inclusion criteria for a bracing study. Some radiographic and clinical parameters, including the Cobb angle, rib-vertebra angle difference, coronal and sagittal balance, lumbar-pelvic relationship (LPR), Risser sign, curve type, age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, and menstrual status were collected. The correlation and difference analyses were performed to identify the factors influencing in-brace correction.
   RESULTS: A cohort of 112 patients with AIS (94 girls and 18 boys) were included in the present study. The mean in-brace correction was 59.29% +/- 22.33% (range, 16.22%-100.00%). In-brace correction showed a significantly negative correlation with the major curve Cobb angle, minor curve Cobb angle, total curve Cobb angle, and LPR (P < 0.05 for all). Sagittal and coronal imbalance could reduce the curve correction (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). The remaining parameters were not related to in-brace correction.
   CONCLUSIONS: In-brace correction in the present study was 59.29% +/- 22.33% (range, 16.22%-100.00%). Some factors, including the Cobb angle, sagittal and coronal balance, and LPR, have an effect on in-brace correction. The results from the present study can provide some useful information for brace design and fabrication.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fast and secure access to intracranial vessel occlusion is essential for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. We compared 2 intermediate distal access catheters (DAC: Distal Access Catheter [C1] and SOFIA: Soft torquable catheter Optimized For Intracranial Access [C2]) for procedural speed and safety of MTas well as clinical outcome at discharge and after 90 days.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all 398 consecutive patients receiving MT with C1 or C2 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke between September 2010 and June 2016, using a propensity score matched cohort. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcome, and procedural factors such as the number of retrieval attempts or duration of procedure were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 282 patients (70.9%) underwent MT with C1 and 116 patients (29.1%) with C2. MT with C2 was faster with an average duration of 69.8 +/- 51 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation) compared with 80.6 +/- 54 minutes with C1 (P < 0.05). The average number of necessary stent-retriever maneuvers was significantly lower with C2 (1.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 3.2 +/- 2.5, P < 0.0001). Successful MT with aspiration only yielded higher modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction rates (mTIC 2b/3 69.9% vs. 31.5%, P < 0.0001) with C2. Modified Rankin Scale at discharge was significantly lower with C2 (3.5 +/- 1.9) versus C1 (3.9 +/- 1.7, P < 0.05). No significant differences of modified Rankin Scale 90 were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of C2 resulted in reduced procedural times with less stent-retriever maneuvers. Clinical outcome at discharge was better for C2 catheters, whereas no significant difference of outcome was apparent after 90 days.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate differences between thicknesses of the ligamentum flavum (LF) and diameter of the spinal canal in different neck positions in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and patients with cervical degenerative spondylosis (CDS) using cervical dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   METHODS: Eighty-eight patients (66 CDS and 22 OPLL) who underwent neutral and dynamic MRI at our institute from February 2014 to July 2017 were the subjects of this retrospective study. Canal diameters and LF thicknesses were measured and Muhle's grades were determined in neutral and dynamic MRI from C2-C3 to C7-T1. Patients with CDS and OPLL were compared with respect to changes in morphometric parameters. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software and statistical significance was accepted for P values < 0.05.
   RESULTS: Mean ages in the CDS and OPLL groups were 68.2 +/- 12.27 and 63.1 +/- 9.36 years, respectively. Mean canal diameters were smaller in extension than in neutral at all measured levels, especially between C3-C4 and C6-C7 in patients with CDS. LF thickness in extension was significantly greater than in neutral and flexion positions in the CDS group, but not in the OPLL group. In addition, positional changes in Muhle's grades in the CDS group were significantly greater than in the OPLL group (P = 0.042).
   CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic morphometric changes were found to be significantly greater in the CDS group than in the OPLL group. The study shows dynamic MRI may provide additional information in CDS patients.

   potentials; Somatosensory evoked potentials
ID INTRAOPERATIVE MOTOR; RESECTION; INFUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is used as an adjunct to total intravenous anesthesia. However, its effect on intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IOM) during brain tumor surgery remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of DEX on IOM during brain tumor surgery.
   METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive patients (DEX group, n = 40; control group, n = 38), who underwent brain tumor surgery with IOM, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes included the predictability, laterality of alterations, and stimulation parameters of transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).
   RESULTS: The predictability of tcMEPs for postoperative motor outcomes showed a higher false-positive rate in the DEX group than in the control group (27.5% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.047). Bilateral alterations were observed only in the DEX group (31.3%; P = 0.053). Compared with the control group, the DEX group required significantly higher intensity (377.5 +/- 48.0 vs. 347.1 +/- 30.0 mV; P = 0.001) and repetition rate (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.5 pulse/train; P = 0.001) of transcranial electric stimulation to evoke adequate tcMEPs. The SSEP results were comparable between both groups. In the DEX group, false-positive tcMEPs changes occurred 222.2 +/- 70.5 minutes (range, 95-342 minutes) after the induction of anesthesia. In addition, the patients who were administered DEX under bispectral index monitoring (n = 12) showed a significantly higher false-positive rate than shown by the control group (50.5% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that DEX had significant effects on tcMEPs during IOM in brain tumor surgery. Because the high false-positive rate could decrease the accuracy of IOM, outcomes after using DEX should be cautiously interpreted.

AB INTRODUCTION: Treatment of symptomatic intracranial cysts remains a controversial issue. We present a risk/benefit profile of a minimally invasive, not yet described, stereotactic internal shunt implantation technique. The provided data might serve as a reference against which other treatment modalities could be compared.
   METHODS: From our prospective database, we identified a consecutive series of patients with symptomatic, untreated cysts who had undergone internal shunting from 2009 to 2017. We estimated the rates of clinical symptom improvement (RCSI), cyst reduction, total complications, and long-term complications. A minimal follow-up of 6 months was required. The prognostic factors were obtained from logistic regression models. Cyst recurrencefree survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The outcomes data were compared with those from reported alternative treatment strategies using chi(2) statistics.
   RESULTS: We included 38 patients. The cyst locations differed greatly and included the cerebellum (n = 2), brainstem (n= 5), and pineal area (n = 4). Cyst-associated hydrocephalus (n = 6) resolved after treatment. The 2-year cyst recurrence-free survival rate was 97%. The RCSI and rate of cyst reduction, total complications, and long-term complications was 91%, 97%, 11%, and 2.6%, respectively. We did not find any risk factors associated with the rate of total complications. The RCSI and rate of total and long-term complications compared favorably (P < 0.01) with the corresponding estimates of alternative treatments (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The described stereotactic internal shunt implantation technique is safe and can be successfully applied for treatment of cystic formations in any location in the brain.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate construction of an aneurysm on a curved vascular segment of a carotid siphon model for testing endovascular devices.
   METHODS: Preshaped carotid siphon models of polytetrafluoroethylene were constructed from a human cadaver for confining canine common carotid artery (CCA). The canine right external jugular vein was isolated and harvested to make a venous pouch by suturing 1 end. The right CCA was isolated, and the venous pouch was sutured onto the right CCA to make an aneurysm. The right CCA segment containing the aneurysm was excised and guided through the preshaped polytetrafluoroethylene carotid siphon model using a guidewire with the aneurysm adjusted to protrude out of the round window of the siphon model. The siphon model together with the aneurysm was sutured end-to-end onto the left CCA to form a carotid siphon model in vivo.
   RESULTS: Five canine models were successfully constructed; the average construction time was 120 minutes. All aneurysms and siphon models remained patent 7 days and 2 weeks later. Five covered stents for intracranial use were tested for flexibility and apposition to the vascular wall in the curved segment of the carotid siphon model in vivo. All the covered stents passed the tortuous siphon model without much difficulty and were deployed successfully to cover the aneurysm orifice without endoleak.
   CONCLUSIONS: The carotid siphon model in vivo can simulate well the geometry of the human carotid siphon segment and can be used to test endovascular devices for interventions.

ID LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transformational lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) with unilateral pedicle screw (UPS) fixation was controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the stability between UPS and bilateral pedicle screw (BPS) fixation before and after graft fusion.
   METHODS: An L3-L5 finite element model was modified to simulate L4/5 MI-TLIF. Five different statuses of posterior instrumentation were simulated: UPS fixation or BPS fixation before and after graft fusion and removal of posterior instrumentation after graft fusion. Range of motion and Von Mises stress were evaluated for intact and instrumentation models in all loading planes.
   RESULTS: Range of motion of the L4/5 segment with UPS fixation was 2.1, 1.3, and 1.7 times greater than those with BPS fixation before fusion in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, respectively, while it was 1.3, 1.1, and 1.4 times greater after fusion. The peak Von Mises stresses on posterior instrumentations with UPS fixation ranged from 1.0 to 1.7 times greater than those in BPS fixation before fusion, while it ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 times greater after fusion. The peak Von Mises stresses on intervertebral graft with UPS fixation ranged from 1.9 to 3.5 times greater than those with BPS fixation before fusion, while it ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 times greater after fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fusion of graft improved the fixation effect of posterior instrumentation system. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation could provide similar biomechanical stability to bilateral pedicle screw fixation in 1-level MI-TLIF after fusion.

LA English
DT Article
DE Endovascular treatment; Intraprocedural rupture; Unruptured intracranial
   aneurysms
ID COIL EMBOLIZATION; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Intraprocedural rupture (IPR) is a rare complication that can occur during endovascular treatment (EVT) of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). However, it universally leads to poor outcomes if not properly managed. In the present study, we sought to illuminate the risk factors for IPR during EVT of UIAs.
   METHODS: The data from patients with UIAs who had undergone EVT in our center from January 2010 to March 2017 were retrospectively collected and reviewed. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analysis were performed to analyze the risk factors for IPR.
   RESULTS: A total of 1232 patients with 1312 unruptured aneurysms were included in the present study. IPR occurred in 11 patients (0.9%). Univariate analysis showed that cardiac comorbidities, irregular morphology, and location at the anterior communicating artery (AcomA) were significantly associated with the development of IPR (P < 0.05). In addition, stent placement was related to a lower risk of IPR compared with no stent placement (P = 0.024). The multivariate analysis showed that cardiac comorbidities (odds ratio [OR], 6.320; P = 0.016), irregular morphology (OR, 9.562; P = 0.001), and location on the AcomA (OR, 6.971; P = 0.006) were independent risk factors for IPR.
   CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence rate of IPR was relatively low. Cardiac comorbidities, irregular morphology, and location on the AcomA are independent risk factors for IPR. Stents and flow diverters are safe and feasible in treating UIA, with a significantly low risk of IPR.

ID VERTEBRAL COLUMN RESECTION; SCOLIOSIS; COMPLICATIONS; OSTEOTOMIES;
   KYPHOSIS; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Three-column osteotomies were developed to treat severe spinal deformities but result in high neurologic complications and require further risk stratification. The present study investigated whether the combination of spinal cord function classification (SCFC) and deformity angular ratio (DAR) could further stratify the neurologic risks in the surgical correction of severe and stiff kyphoscoliosis.
   METHODS: The patients with kyphoscoliosis who had undergone posterior 3-column osteotomies at the spinal cord level were reviewed. Using our SCFC system, the preoperative neurologic function (type A, B, or C) was classified. The sagittal DAR (S-DAR), coronal, and total DARs were calculated. Intraoperative monitoring events and new neurologic deficits (NNDs) postoperatively were documented and analyzed using the SCFC and DAR or both combined.
   RESULTS: The NND rates increased significantly from type A to C (P = 0.000) and increased exponentially with an increase in S-DAR in types B and C but not type A. They also increased exponentially with aggravation of the SCFC in the medium and high but not low S-DAR group. All NNDs had recovered at 3 months for type A and most had recovered at 6 months for type B or C.
   CONCLUSIONS: The NNDs in type A SCFC usually experienced better recovery even with high S-DARs. Type B SCFC with an S-DAR >20 degrees and type C SCFC with any S-DAR resulted in significantly greater intra- and postoperative neurologic risks. The combination of SCFC and S-DAR can further stratify the intra- and postoperative neurologic risks with these procedures.

   in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity; Severe traumatic brain injury;
   Tracheostomy
ID MANAGEMENT; TRACHEOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an uncommon complication of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). The clinical risk factors for PSH have not been fully characterized, especially regarding tracheostomy, which has usually been recommended for patients with sTBI to facilitate treatment. We examined the effects of tracheostomy on PSH incidence in patients with sTBI.
   METHODS: The present single-center, retrospective study included consecutive patients with sTBI who had been admitted to the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital from January 1, 2013 to March 31, 2018. The potential risk factors related to the occurrence of PSH was explored by univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independence of the factors associated with PSH development.
   RESULTS: Of the 120 patients with sTBI, 17 with PSH were identified (14.16%). We found 3 risk factors were significantly associated with PSH on univariate and multivariate analyses: 1) tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR], 5.368; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.102-26.151; P = 0.038); 2) age (OR, 0.916; 95% CI, 0.874-0.960; P < 0.001); and 3) hydrocephalus (OR, 6.715; 95% CI, 1.708-26.408; P = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that tracheostomy is independently associated with an increased incidence of PSH.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to introduce our initial experience with the use and feasibility of the Willis covered stent (WCS) in the treatment of blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) and to present a systematic review of the reported data on the treatment of BBAs with covered stents.
   METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with BBAs had been treated with WCSs at West China Hospital from January 2015 to August 2017. The patient medical records, angiographic findings, and endovascular treatment reports were reviewed by interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to obtain relevant clinical and angiographic information. We conducted a systematic review of all reports of BBAs treated with covered stents. We searched the reported data using PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases and commercial Internet search engines. We included BBAs located at nonbranching portions of the internal carotid artery (ICA).
   RESULTS: The present study included 9 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 54.5 years (range, 30-79). All patients had complete occlusion found on immediate postoperative angiography. The ophthalmic artery was occluded in 2 patients (14.3%). No mortality or morbidity had occurred during the procedure. Two patients (14.3%) experienced a mild recurrence. One patient (7.1%) had developed mild in-stent stenosis. The clinical follow-up period was 6e15 months for all the patients. Of the 14 patients, 11 (78.6%) had a modified Rankin scale score of 0, and 1 (7.1%) had a modified Rankin scale score of 1 during the follow-up period. One patient (7.1%) experienced sub-arachnoid hemorrhage at 7 days postoperatively and had died 10 days after surgery. None of the patients experienced visual defects. Of our 14 patients, 13 (92.9%) survived, as determined by outpatient department visits or telephone interviews. A total of 8 reports, including 38 patients, met our criteria. Of these 38 patients, 37 (97.3%) had successful delivery to the diseased ICA, and 34 (89.5%) had experienced complete occlusion during follow-up. The overall rate of complete occlusion was 83.0% (95% confidence interval, 68%-91%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ruptured BBAs treated with WCSs can achieve satisfactory clinical results. Therefore, for BBAs, the implementation of the WCS could be safe and feasible. This strategy could be a promising option for this type of high-risk aneurysm. However, patients with tortuous ICAs or aneurysms close to essential branch arteries should be carefully evaluated before the WCS is used.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a lack of precise methods for predicting the risk of aneurysm rupture. Therefore, prophylactic treatment is used, which leads to unnecessary potential complications. A new modality enabling a more accurate risk assessment is needed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new-generation imaging technology that has astonishing resolution for vascular imaging. In this study, OCT was used for the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: In vivo OCT imaging was performed for aneurysms induced in 6 rabbits and in 9 intracranial aneurysm patients. Catheters were cut short to prevent any extra length from damaging aneurysms and tissues. Images of both the parent artery and the aneurysm at multiple viewing angles were obtained using rotational OCT scanning.
   RESULTS: The OCT images of rabbits correlated well with histologic sections. The 3-layered architecture of the parent arteries was explicitly shown. Ruptured intracranial aneurysms manifested complete breakdown of the wall structure; however, this was not observed in any unruptured aneurysms. The OCT images of unruptured intracranial aneurysms demonstrated a trend of degradation by showing the gradual disappearance of the demarcation between the layers or incomplete apoptosis in layer structures.
   CONCLUSION: OCT is the most precise imaging modality because it provides detailed information regarding the aneurysm structures, thus enabling more distinct insight into the vascular construction of intracranial aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the same patient with primary dystonia.
   METHODS: Patients with primary dystonia from the department of functional neurosurgery in Beijing Tiantan Hospital were recruited for the study. Four electrodes were bilaterally implanted in the GPi and STN. A trial stimulation was applied to determine the preliminary therapeutic effects. Five evaluations were conducted: preoperative, postoperative (before stimulation), after sham stimulation, and after stimulation for 24 hours of GPi and STN using optimal parameters, judged by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).
   RESULTS: The BFMDRS movement score decreased after both short-term GPi stimulation (from 15.3 +/- 6.9 to 7.6 +/- 4.2, P < 0.05) and short-term STN stimulation (from 15.3 +/- 6.9 to 8.6 +/- 5.0, P < 0.05). There were significant reductions in facial (eyes and mouth) movement scores after short-term GPi and STN DBS compared with baseline (P < 0.05), but not in cervical symptoms (P > 0.05). The cervical symptoms of tonic dystonia had an improvement after long-term DBS treatment (P < 0.05). There were more adverse events with STN DBS; however, most side effects could be ameliorated by adjusting stimulation parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both short-term GPi and STN stimulation improved the motor symptoms of dystonia, but there was no significant difference between GPi DBS and STN DBS. There were more side effects associated with STN stimulation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of miR-128b on apoptosis and BCL-2 and CAPASE 3 expression in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model.
   METHODS: The MCAO model was established by the thread embolism method. miR-128b agomir and antagomir were injected into the ventricle of MCAO rats by stereotaxic intracerebral injection. Then the rats were divided into a sham group, model group, miR-128b agomir group, and miR-128b antagomir group. Zea Longa was used to score the modeling rats. The area of cerebral infarction was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. The miR-128b relative expression was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of BCL-2 and CAPASE 3 were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.
   RESULTS: The MCAO model was constructed successfully. The expressions of miR-128b in the MCAO groups were higher than that of the sham group (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the cerebral infarction area in the miR-128b agomir group was significantly bigger and that of the miR-128b antagomir group was smaller (P < 0.05). The number of apoptotic cells in the miR-128b agomir group was more and that of miR-128b antagomir group was less (P < 0.05 vs. model group). The BCL-2 expression reduced and CAPASE 3 expression increased in the MCAO groups (P < 0.05 vs. sham group). Compared with the model group, the Bcl-2 expression decreased and Caspase 3 expression increased in the miR-128b agomir group, and those in the miR-128b antagomir group were opposite.
   CONCLUSIONS: miR-128b promoted cerebral infarction in MCAO rats by regulating Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 expression.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent literature has denoted care in an inpatient facility after discharge to be linked with worse outcomes after elective primary lumbar and cervical fusions. No study has explored the risk factors and associated postdischarge outcomes after discharge to inpatient facility after revision posterior lumbar fusion.
   METHODS: The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes for posterior lumbar fusions (22630, 22633, 22614) combined with Current Procedural Terminology codes for revision-22830 (exploration of spinal fusion), 22849 (reinsertion of spinal fixation device), 22850 (removal of posterior nonsegmental instrumentation), and 22852 (removal of posterior segmental instrumentation).
   RESULTS: Of 1170 patients who underwent revision posterior lumbar fusion, 253 (21.6%) were discharged to an inpatient care facility and 917 (78.4%) were discharged to home. Significant risk factors associated with discharge to inpatient care facility were age 60-69 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.62), age >= 70 years (OR 7.46), female gender (OR 1.61), partially dependent functional health status before surgery (OR 2.94), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.92), a length of stay >3 days (OR 3.13), and the occurrence of any predischarge complication (OR 4.10). Discharge to inpatient care facilities versus home was associated with a higher risk of experiencing any postdischarge complication (8.3% vs. 3.2%; OR 2.2).
   CONCLUSIONS: Providers should understand the need of construction of care pathways and reducing discharge to inpatient facilities to mitigate the risks of experiencing adverse outcomes and consequently reduce the financial burden on the health care system.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare disease affecting the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, or vitreoretinal compartment, without evidence of systemic disease. Prognosis is still poor after intensive methotrexate-based chemotherapy.
   METHODS: Clinical data of 91 patients treated in a tertiary referral center during a 13-year period were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: The estimated median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 39.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.1-64.0 months) and 54.5 months (95% CI, 28.9-80.1 months), respectively. Estimated 5-year progression-free survival and OS were 37.0% +/- 6.5% and 47.5% +/- 7.5%. Survival was associated with cycles of methotrexate only in multivariate analysis. Seventy-four patients received methotrexate-based chemotherapy after diagnosis. Thirty-nine patients experienced disease progression. Patients with relapsed/refractory disease had a poor survival, with median second OS (calculated from the date of first disease progression to the time of death from any cause) being 7.2 months (95% CI, 2.5-12.00 months). Three patients responded to ibrutinib after disease progression and incurred no fungal infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of patients with PCNSL treated in our cohort are still poor. Relapse or refractory PCNSL and those not tolerating aggressive chemotherapy urgently require new approaches to improve their still dismal prognosis. Novel agents such as ibrutinib have shown promising clinical activity. Future studies should focus on the predictive biomarkers for the treatment of PCNSL with novel agents to provide precision medicine for PCNSL.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary lymphoma of the skull base (PLSB) is an extremely rare neoplasm and not much is known regarding the clinical features of, treatment strategies for, and prognoses of these lesions. We investigated the manifestations and clinical outcomes of Chinese patients with PLSB.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 8 consecutive patients with PLSB who had been treated at our center from October 2008 to December 2016 and analyzed their clinical features, treatment strategies, and prognoses.
   RESULTS: Of the 8 patients, 3 were men and 5 were women, with a male/female ratio of 0.6. The median age was 53.5 years. In most instances, the onset was characterized by headache, followed by dysfunction of the cranial nerves. The most frequently affected region was the cavernous sinus. On magnetic resonance imaging, the main characteristic was that the internal carotid artery was encased by the tumor without an obvious tendency to be deformed, dislocated, or narrowed. All patients underwent surgical biopsy via a transsphenoidal or sublabiale-transmaxillary approach. The pathological diagnosis was non-Hodgkin lymphoma for all 8 patients, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 7 patients. The patients underwent chemotherapy and involved-field radiotherapy. The median overall survival was 52 months, and the 1-year progression-free survival rate was 87.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: PLSB is a rare disease and a diagnostic challenge, with most cases in the Chinese due to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We found that the incidence peaked in middle and old age, and the cavernous sinus was usually affected. Multidisciplinary treatment involving surgical biopsy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy was an effective therapeutic strategy.

ID TUBERCULOSIS; INSTRUMENTATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Complexity in ventral surgical exposure and presence of scapula and large parascapular musculature during posterior surgery are the main obstacles in operative treatment of upper thoracic spine compressive lesions (UTSCLs), such as trauma, tuberculosis, and neoplasm. Recently, the advantages of combined ventrodorsal surgery could be successfully gained using a 1-stage posterior salvage technique with enough accessibility to all 3 spinal columns. This was a retrospective evaluation of 35 patients with UTSCLs treated by the posterior extensive circumferential decompressive reconstructive (PECDR) procedure.
   METHODS: Traumatic, tuberculosis, and neoplastic lesions were involved between 2009 and 2012. All patients were examined pre- and postoperatively and during follow-up clinically (pain by visual analog scale), neurologically (sensory and motor deficit by American Spinal Injury Association grading), functionally (Oswestry Disability Index), radiologically (kyphosis correction, loss of correction, and fusion time), and with laboratory investigations in patients with tuberculosis. Two authors plus an independent observer performed the final clinical, neurologic, and radiologic examination. Operative time, hospital stay, blood loss, and complications were documented.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 36 +/- 5.5 months. Local symptoms, deformity correction, and neurologic recovery significantly improved postoperatively. Solid fusion was evident in 32 cases. No major complications were reported. Three patients developed wound infection and 3 had intercostal neuralgia; both complications were resolved uneventfully and did not influence the outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of difficult ventral exposure, the PECDR technique is a feasible tool for maintained deformity correction, bony fusion, thecal decompression, and functional improvement in surgical treatment of UTSCLs. However, tuberculosis had better satisfactory results than traumatic and neoplastic lesions.

ID BAND ACTIVITY; EEG; MEG; LOCALIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES
AB BACKGROUND: Most surgical treatments for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy are helpful. When a patient has persistent symptoms after surgery, there are no tests that accurately predict whether a patient will have remnant epileptic foci. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a prognostic tool in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.
   METHODS: From July 2012 to July 2016, 21 patients underwent preoperative and postoperative MEG at our center. Postoperative MEG was performed within 2 weeks after surgery. We analyzed MEG by estimating the time-frequency component of the signal to define gamma oscillations (GOs), which are an indicator of epileptogenic foci. We analyzed the relationship between GOs on MEG and surgical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 28.3 months (range, 13-44 months). At the last follow-up visit, patients were divided into 2 groups according to surgical outcome. All patients showed spike waves and GOs on preoperative electroencephalography and MEG. In the seizure control group (16 patients), spike waves (2 patients) and GOs (2 patients) were seen postoperatively despite absence of symptoms. In the recurrent seizure group (5 patients), whereas 3 patients showed spike waves, all 5 patients showed GOs on MEG postoperatively. There was a significant association between presence of GOs on postoperative MEG and surgical outcome (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: MEG can provide valuable postsurgical information on epileptic foci in patients with recurrent symptoms; GOs on postoperative MEG were especially correlated with epileptic recurrence. Our data show that GOs on postoperative MEG may have prognostic value.

AB BACKGROUND: The present meta-analysis was conducted to explore and identify the risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) after spinal surgery based on qualified studies and to gain insight into the management of SSI among patients undergoing spinal surgery.
   METHODS: We searched the following electronic data-bases, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Embase database, updated to May 2018, to identify eligible studies according to the index words with associated publications. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to analyze the main outcomes.
   RESULTS: We found 27 studies with a total of 2175 patients in the SSI group and 41,536 patients in the control group for the present meta-analysis. The pooled results revealed that the risk factors for SSI included diabetes, obesity, hypertension, >= 3 hours operative time, and transfusion. In addition, no significant association was found between SSI and the following risk factors: female gender, age >60 years, smoking habit, bone autograft, bone allograft, prophylactic antibiotics, and steroid therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that diabetes, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2)), hypertension, >= 3 hours operative time, and transfusion have a strong association with a remarkable increase in the risk of SSI after spinal surgery. In conclusion, more high-quality trials with larger sample sizes and long-term randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the risk factors for SSI among patients undergoing spinal surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor. Surgical resection is the first choice of treatment, whereas the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is still unclear. Aim of the study was to evaluate prognostic factors influencing the local recurrence rate.
   METHODS: Patients who had grade I-II meningiomas and underwent surgery were included in the present study. The extent of surgical resection was defined according to Simpson criteria, and were dichotomized as gross total and subtotal resection (STR). Adjuvant RT was considered in case of STR. Clinical outcome was evaluated by neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed every 6 months for the first year and yearly thereafter.
   RESULTS: From January 2000 to December 2015, 296 patients were analyzed. Most were women (65.9%), with a Karnofsky performance status >= 80 (94.6%), grade I meningioma (79.4%), and symptoms at diagnosis (91.5%). STR was performed in 58%, followed by adjuvant RT in 10%. Improvement or stability of neurological status was obtained in 90.4% of patients. The median follow-up time was 79 months (range, 24-214 months). Local recurrence occurred in 87 (29.4%) patients, at a median time of 56 months (range, 6-214 months). No patients, who underwent surgery plus adjuvant RT, had local relapse. The median, 2-, 5-, 10-year progression-free survival were 172 months, 91.1%, 80.7%, and 67.2%, respectively. On univariate and multivariate analysis factors impacting on progression-free survival were grade, extent of surgical resection, and adjuvant RT in case of STR, regardless of meningioma grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that recurrence rates are influenced by grade, extent of surgical resection, and use of adjuvant RT in not completely resected meningioma, regardless of tumor grade.

AB BACKGROUND: To date, no evidence-based treatment algorithm is available for fractures of the subaxial spine. The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the management strategy for traumatic subaxial fractures among German and Dutch spine surgeons.
   METHODS: In our web-based multicenter study, German and Dutch spine surgeons evaluated the computed tomography data of traumatic subaxial fractures (C3-C7). Supplementary case-specific information was provided. The fractures were classified using the AO spine classification. Next, 9 questions concerning the treatment algorithm were evaluated. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: Ten surgeons (5/country) evaluated 31 cases (310 votes). The fractures were classified as AO type A in 37% (114 votes), type B in 50% (155 votes), and type C in 13% (41 votes). German spine surgeons had a lower threshold concerning the indication for surgical treatment (German, 94.2% vs. Netherlands, 58.1%; P < 0.05). A consensus was present for operative stabilization for type B and C injuries, but a discrepancy was found in the therapeutic algorithm for type A fractures. The most significant difference was seen in the treatment of type A2 and A3 fractures (surgery for type A2/A3 fracture: German, 92.9% vs. Netherlands, 5.3%; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: We found a consensus for the stabilization of AO type B and C fractures but country-specific differences in the treatment of type A fractures, especially for A2 and A3 fractures. Further evidence is necessary to ensure more consistent international treatment strategies.

ID SYMPTOMATIC GLIAL CYSTS; NATURAL-HISTORY; CASE SERIES; MANAGEMENT;
   PREVALENCE; DEATH; GLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Pineal cysts (PCs) are histologically benign lesions of the pineal gland. Although the majority of PCs are asymptomatic, some cases are ambiguous and accompanied by nonspecific symptoms of variable severity. We suggested that disabling headache in non-hydrocephalic patients with PCs is associated with cerebral aqueduct (CAq) stenosis.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients with PCs suffering from headache without secondary hydrocephalus who underwent surgical resection at Burdenko Neurosurgery Center between 1995 and 2016. All available medical records and radiographic images were retrospectively assessed in these patients. The comparison groups included 22 patients with nonoperated PCs and 25 healthy individuals. Specific magnetic resonance imaging measures were selected to assess the morphometry of the CAq and degree of the stenosis.
   RESULTS: In 25 patients (82%) we observed clinical improvement after surgery in a follow-up period. Among those with improvement, 10 of them (40%) experienced total relief and 15 of them (60%) had marked headache diminishment. In 5 patients the headache remained persistent. The preoperative rostral CAq diameter appeared to be significantly narrower (P = 0.0011045), and the preoperative rostral/caudal diameter ratio (Rd/Cd) was found to be lower (P = 0.004391) in patients who recovered from headache versus those who did not.
   CONCLUSION: The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between the changes in the CAq morphometrics and the clinical outcome in postoperative period. Surgical removal of symptomatic pineal cysts in patients without hydrocephalus can be considered as an effective treatment. However, a thorough preoperative examination and patient selection should be conducted in every case.

AB BACKGROUND: The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is a new treatment modality developed for broad-necked unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) but shows potential for the treatment of ruptured IAs as well. Our aim was to describe 6-month aneurysm obliteration rates, clinical outcomes, and procedure-related complications after WEB treatment for ruptured IAs from 2 academic centers.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study, including all consecutive patients treated with the WEB device (WEB single layer and single-layer sphere) for a ruptured IA causing acute subarachnoid hemorrhage between 2014 (start of use) and 2017. Primary outcome was angiographic aneurysm obliteration (Beaujon Occlusion Scale Score) rate. Secondary outcomes were early re-bleedings, complications, and patient outcome (death and modified Rankin Scale).
   RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with ruptured IAs were treated 0-4 days from IA rupture. Of 27 survivors, 6-month angiographic follow-up was available for 26 patients, of whom 81% showed complete occlusion. Of the 27 survivors, 24 patients (89%) had a favorable neurologic outcome at 6 months after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two aneurysms were retreated (8% of all). There was 1 fatal procedure-related complication. No early aneurysm re-bleedings were noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: For anatomically suitable ruptured IAs, WEB device treatment seems to be safe and results in acceptable occlusion rates. Still, larger studies with long-term results are needed before recommendations can be made.

   INFECTION; SAFETY; RATES
AB BACKGROUND: Freehand bedside ventriculostomy placement can result in catheter malfunction requiring a revision procedure and cause significant patient morbidity. We performed a single-center retrospective review to assess factors related to this complication.
   METHODS: Using an administrative database and chart review, we identified 101 first-time external ventricular drain placements performed at the bedside. We collected data regarding demographics, medical comorbidities, complications, and catheter tip location. We performed univariate and multivariate statistical analyses using MATLAB. We corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure.
   RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses revealed that revision procedures were more likely to occur after drain blockage (odds ratio [OR] 17.9) and hemorrhage (OR 10.3, FDR-corrected P values < 0.01, 0.05, respectively). Drain blockage was less frequent after placement in an "optimal location" (ipsilateral ventricle or near foramen of Monroe; OR 0.09, P = 0.009, FDR-corrected P < 0.03) but was more likely to occur after placement in third ventricle (post-hoc P values < 0.015). Primary diagnoses included subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 30, 29.7%), intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extravasation (n = 24, 23.7%), tumor (n = 20, 19.8%), and trauma (n = 17, 16.8%). Most common complications included drain blockage (n = 12, 11.8%) and hemorrhage (n = 8, 7.9%). In total, 16 patients underwent at least 1 revision procedure (15.8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Bedside external ventricular drain placement is associated with a 15% rate of revision, that typically occurred after drain blockage and postprocedure hemorrhage. Optimal placement within the ipsilateral frontal horn or foramen of Monroe was associated with a reduced rate of drain blockage.

AB OBJECTIVE: Differentiation of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from glioblastoma using arterial spin labeling perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 31 patients with a provisional diagnosis of PCNSL and glioblastoma who underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging, DTI, and arterial spin labeling of the brain. The tumor blood flow (TBF), mean diffusivity (MD) plus fractional anisotropy (FA) of the mass were measured. The final diagnosis was confirmed by pathological examination.
   RESULTS: The TBF of PCNSL (26.41 +/- 4.03 mL/100 g/minute) was significantly lower than that of glioblastoma (51.08 +/- 3.9 mL/100 g/minute; P = 0.001). The TBF cutoff (35.73 mL/100 g/minute) used for differentiation showed area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, accuracy of 95.2%, sensitivity of 91.7%, and specificity of 100%. The MD of PCNSL (0.87 +/- 0.2X 10(-3) mm(2)/second) was significantly lower than that of glioblastoma (0.87 +/- 0.2 3 10(-3) mm(2)/second; P = 0.01). The MD cutoff (0.935 3 10(-3) mm(2)/second) used for differentiation showed an AUC of 0.73 and accuracy of 66.7% and a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 55.6%. The FA of PCNSL (0.253 +/- 0.05) was significantly greater than that of glioblastoma (0.135 +/- 0.06; P = 0.001). The FA cutoff (0.185) used for differentiation revealed an AUC of 0.944 and accuracy of 85.7% and a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 88.9%. The combined TBF, MD, and FA cutoffs revealed an AUC of 0.96 and accuracy of 95.5% and a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 100%.
   CONCLUSION: The noninvasive imaging parameters using TBF and DTI might help in differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes of cranioplasty (CP) with a customized three-dimensional (3D) titanium mesh plate and identify the relationship between various clinical variables and complications after CP.
   METHODS: Twenty patients who underwent surgery with customized 3D titanium mesh plates and had followup for > 6 months from January 2015 to December 2017 were enrolled. Complications related to CP were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into 2 groups (no complication group and complication group), and clinical variables related to complications were compared between the 2 groups. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the clinical variable significantly correlated with complications after CP with a customized 3D titanium mesh plate.
   RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 11 developed complications, including extrusion, intracranial infection, severe operative site pain, and wound dehiscence. Among the clinical variables, only the presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was significantly correlated with the overall complication rate (odds ratio = 18.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-222.92; P = 0.021).
   CONCLUSIONS: A customized 3D titanium mesh plate is associated with a lower risk of intracranial infection, but the rate of postoperative complications, mainly cosmetic problems, such as forehead mesh extrusion and dehiscence, was high at 55%. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was significantly correlated with the overall complication rate after CP with a customized 3D titanium mesh plate.

AB BACKGROUND: Since its introduction in the early 1990s, endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms has had a steady upward trend and is the primary mode of treatment for most intracranial aneurysms. Concurrently, the need for retreatment of aneurysms after previous endovascular treatment has continued to increase, some of which can only be treated with microsurgical techniques. The factors that dictate outcomes in this group of patients are incompletely understood.
   OBJECTIVE: To study factors contributing to patient outcomes after microsurgical treatment of aneurysms with previous endovascular treatment.
   METHODS: The records of the senior author (D.L.B.) since 2002 were retrospectively reviewed for aneurysms treated after previous endovascular treatment. Demographics, treatment details, and imaging were reviewed for all patients. A systematic review of the literature on microsurgical treatment of aneurysms previously treated by endovascular therapy was also conducted.
   RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were identified from the retrospective review. Mean age at the time of initial treatment was 49 +/- 12.68 years. Most patients initially presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage before initial endovascular treatment, with only 11 patients (12%) presenting with incidentally discovered lesions. Modified Rankin Scale score at discharge after initial treatment was good (0-3) in 81.4% of cases. Functional outcomes at the last known follow-up showed a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3 in 77 patients (84.6%). Only aneurysm neck size was found to be a significant predictor of surgical complications (Wald chi(2) = 10.79; P = 0.0010) with an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.40-3.83) for a 2-mm increase in neck size. Systematic review identified 37 studies who were used to pool data on 370 patients. Although type of surgery was identified as a predictor of poor outcomes, this was significantly confounded by Hunt and Hess grade in the systematic review.
   CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes can be obtained even for highly complex cerebral aneurysms that have failed endovascular treatment at high-volume cerebrovascular centers. Initial presentation grade and aneurysm size are important predictors of final patient outcomes.

   MORBIDITY; INTERVENTION; EFFICACY; STENOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy has led to indications for spine surgery in patients older than 90 years, but data on associated risks and outcome are lacking.
   METHODS: Indication, type of surgery, complications, functional outcome, and mortality were retrospectively collected from all patients aged 90 years or older operated between 2006 and 2016 at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.
   RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included, of which 55% had degenerative, 36% traumatic, and 9% other pathologies. Most surgeries (84%) were performed electively and 16% as emergencies. More than a third (36%) of elective and 58% of emergency surgeries required stabilization. The complication rate was 54% in the elective surgery group (ELSG) and 125% in the emergency surgery group (EMSG). Stabilization (P = 0.006) and emergency surgeries (P = 0.032) were significant risk factors for experiencing complications. Six weeks after surgery, 80% of the patients reported symptomatic improvement. More than half (58%) of the patients in the ELSG reached their specific median life expectancy, compared with 38% in the EMSG. Seventeen percent of patients in the EMSG versus 0% in the ELSG died in the first 3 months after surgery. In the nonstabilized group, 67% of the patients reached their median life expectancy, compared with 38% of the stabilized group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Elective spinal surgery in patients older than 90 years of age does not reduce life expectancy and has a good functional outcome for well-selected patients, whereas emergency surgery and stabilization surgery in this age group are associated with a high rate of complications and higher mortality.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients who under- went short-segment posterior instrumentation with screw augmentation at the fracture level and long-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar junction fractures.
   METHODS: Sixty-three patients were retrospectively evaluated by being divided into the following 4 groups: Groups A, B, C, and D included patients who had undergone 4-level instrumentation without insertion of screws at the fracture level, 3-level instrumentation by insertion of screws at the fracture level, 4-level instrumentation by insertion of screws at the fracture level, and 5-level instrumentation by insertion of screws at the fracture level, respectively.
   RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in preoperative local kyphosis angle (LKA) (P > 0.05), whereas there was a significant decrease in early postoperative LKA in Group C compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference of LKA in the 4 groups measured on radiographs obtained at the final follow-up (P > 0.05). Anterior corpus height loss, Cobb angle of the fractured vertebra, and sagittal index, measured pre- and postoperatively and at the final follow-up, showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between clinical scores of the 4 groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment posterior instrumentation with screw augmentation at the fracture level provides at least as much mechanical stability as long-segment instrumentation. Moreover, there is no difference between short-segment instrumentation with screw augmentation at the fracture level and long-segment instrumentation in terms of clinical outcomes.

   atlantoaxial dislocation; Retrolisthesis
ID ODONTOID FRACTURE; REDUCTION
AB OBJECTIVE: Posterior C1-2 dislocation secondary to fracture of the dens or os odontoideum is uncommon. Little is known about posterior dislocations in which close reduction fails, requiring intraoperative maneuvers. The objective of this retrospective study was to analyze clinical presentations, factors causing irreducibility, and nuances in the achievement of intraoperative reduction.
   METHODS: The clinicoradiological features of 10 patients with irreducible posterior C1-2 dislocation were studied. Six were posttraumatic, with odontoid fractures, and 4 had os odontoideum. The radiologic images were studied to analyze the cause of irreducibility, and the operative management of these cases was discussed.
   RESULTS: The patients with traumatic dislocation had persistent neck pain (n = 6) and early onset (n = 1) or delayed onset (n = 4) myelopathy. The fracture line was oblique, extending anterosuperiorly to posteroinferiorly in all except 1 patient, with fracture fragments distracted in 4 and interlocked in 2. There was associated lateral translation in 2. All patients had facet locking. Intraoperative reduction was achieved in all by unlocking the facets, intrafracture reduction, or both. All 4 patients with congenital posterior dislocations had retrolisthesis of dens with lateral translation. They presented with neck tilt (n = 4) and severe myelopathy (n = 3). They were easier to reduce intraoperatively, but the improvement lesser in comparison with the traumatic fractures.
   CONCLUSIONS: The posterior C1-2 dislocation associated with fracture of the dens or os-odontoideum is a distinct entity. Lateral translation is often seen with retrolisthesis of the os odontoideum and occasionally in traumatic posterior dislocations. It is necessary to address the cause of irreducibility and achieve multiplanar realignment for a good outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess nasal morbidity of endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches (ETAs) for treatment of sellar and parasellar diseases through evaluation of quality of life (QoL) and nasal function. The impact of different ETAs, according to extent and reconstruction technique, was also studied.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing ETA for treatment of sellar or parasellar lesions were prospectively recruited and examined preoperatively and at 6 months after surgery according to the following workup: nasal endoscopy, rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12, Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22, and Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36).
   RESULTS: Of 34 patients initially recruited, 29 completed follow-up examinations. Seven patients (24.14%) developed turbinoseptal synechiae; anterior septal perforations were observed in 3 patients (10.35%). More extended surgical dissection was associated with the presence of postoperative septal perforation and synechiae. No significant difference was noted between preoperative and postoperative results on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, acoustic rhinometry, Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22, or Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12. There was a significant increase in nasal airflow after surgery and improvement of the Short-Form Health Survey-36 score in 4 of 8 domains.
   CONCLUSIONS: The modular ETA technique is associated with minimal morbidity and preserves nasal patency, airflow, and olfactory function. Quality of life is not affected and although small septal perforations and synechiae can be observed, nasal physiology is not compromised. Nonetheless, careful manipulation of sinonasal structures is recommended to minimize postoperative sequelae.

AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary tumors are a heterogeneous group of lesions that are usually benign. Therefore, a proper understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology is mandatory to achieve favorable outcomes. Accordingly, diagnostic tests and treatment guidelines should be determined and implemented. Thus, we decided to perform a multicenter study among Italian neurosurgical centers performing pituitary surgery to provide an actual depiction from the neurosurgical standpoint.
   METHODS: On behalf of the SINch (Societa Italiana di Neurochirurgia), a survey was undertaken with the participants to explore the activities in the field of pituitary surgery within 41 public institutions.
   RESULTS: Of the 41 centers, 37 participated in the present study. The total number of neurosurgical procedures performed in 2016 was 1479. Most of the procedures were performed using the transsphenoidal approach (1320 transsphenoidal [1204 endoscopic, 53 microscopic, 53 endoscope-assisted microscopic] vs. 159 transcranial). A multidisciplinary tumor board is convened regularly in 32 of 37 centers, and a research laboratory is present in 18 centers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing pituitary/hypothalamus disorders and treating them is the result of teamwork, composed of several diverse experts. Regarding neurosurgery, our findings have confirmed the central role of the transsphenoidal approach, with preference toward the endoscopic technique. Better outcomes can be expected at centers with a multidisciplinary team and a full, or part of a, residency program, with a greater surgical caseload.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present meta-analysis was conducted to provide an update on the efficacy and safety profile of clazosentan with different doses in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive and electronic search updated to September 2018 of The Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed to identify relevant clinical trials. Trials of the effectiveness of clazosentan in treating cerebral vasospasm after aSAH were studied. The main outcomes included new cerebral infarction (NCI), delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND), vasospasm associated with morbidity/mortality, angiographic vasospasm, rescue therapy, and adverse events. We applied RevMan 5.3 software for this meta-analysis to analyze the combined pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-or random-effects model on the basis of heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: A total of 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Beneficial outcome was found in patients who received higher doses of clazosentan (> 5mg/h) after aSAH based on decreased incidence of DINDs (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.16-2.69; P = 0.008), NCIs (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.34-3.95; P = 0.002), and angiographic vasospasms (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.19-2.89; P = 0.007). Meanwhile, other parameters, such as vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality, rescue therapy, and adverse events, showed no statistical significance (P > 0.05) between high and low doses of clazosentan.
   CONCLUSIONS: The significant beneficial outcomes of high-dose clazosentan have been proven in preventing cerebral vasospasm and subsequent cerebral infarction compared with low-dose clazosentan, with a manageable safety profile. However, high doses of clazosentan had no significant effect on rescue therapy and vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported the usefulness of intraoperative corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) for preserving language function during brain surgery.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the influence of depth of anesthesia on CCEP to establish its clinical utility.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with brain tumors or epilepsy who underwent awake craniotomy were included in this study. Before resection, the electrode plates were placed on the frontal and temporoparietal cortices, and 1-Hz alternating electrical stimuli were delivered to the pars opercularis/pars triangularis in a bipolar fashion. Electrocorticograms from the temporoparietal cortices time-locked to stimuli were averaged to obtain CCEP responses from a state of deep anesthesia until the awake state. The correlation between CCEP waveforms and bispectral index (BIS) was evaluated.
   RESULTS: CCEP amplitude increased with the increase in the BIS level. CCEP latency decreased in 5 patients and increased in 15 patients under anesthesia compared with the awake state. CCEP amplitudes decreased by 11.3% to 75.2% (median 31.3%) under anesthesia with <65 BIS level. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). With respect to CCEP latencies, there was no significant difference between the awake and anesthetic states.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCEP amplitudes were correlated with depth of anesthesia, whereas CCEP latencies were not affected by anesthesia. The influence of anesthesia should be considered when applying this technique to intraoperative monitoring.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are heterogeneous, with differences in anatomical, histopathological, and clinical characteristics. Such spatial variability in meningioma biology is thought to result from differences in the expression of critical developmental regulators. We hypothesized that the variability in meningioma biology would follow gradients such as in embryology and tested a cohort of 366 meningiomas for histopathological and immunohistochemical gradients.
   METHODS: The medical records from 366 patients treated for meningiomas from 2003 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed for age, gender, anatomical localization, recurrence-free survival, overall survival, histopathological diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry findings for 6 markers: epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), progesterone receptor (PR), CD34, S100, p53, and Ki-67 labeling index.
   RESULTS: EMA, PR, S100, p53, and CD34 were expressed in 94%, 73%, 49%, 26%, and 23% of the tumors, respectively. p53 expression correlated positively with Ki-67 and World Health Organization (WHO) grade (r(tau) = 0.31 and r(tau) = 0.4, respectively). PR positivity correlated inversely with S100, p53, Ki-67, and WHO grade (r(tau) = -0.19, r(tau) = -0.14, r(tau) = -0.15, and r(tau) = -0.16, respectively). All secretory meningiomas were positive for EMA and PR and negative for S100, and this pattern exhibited a rostrocaudal gradient. The overall proportion of EMA(+)PR(+)S100(-) cases was significantly lower in the cranial vault (30.3%) than in the skull base (45.89%; P = 0.021). The proportion of WHO grade II-III tumors was greater in cranial vault than in skull base meningiomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised methods detected an association between the anatomical location and tumor biology in meningiomas. Unlike the categorical associations that former studies had indicated, the present study revealed a rostrocaudal gradient in both the cranial vault and the skull base, correlating with human developmental biology.

AB BACKGROUND: In 2001, a 27-year-old man was diagnosed with a meningioma with skull bone involvement. A craniectomy was performed and a CMW-3 poly(methyl methacrylate) cranioplasty was manually manufactured to reconstruct the remaining cranial defect. In 2016, he complained about progressive neurologic impairment. A computed tomography scan revealed that the cranioplasty had fractured into 4 dislocated pieces. Removal was indicated, and during the same operation a polyetheretherketone patient-specific implant was inserted.
   METHODS: The fractured cranioplasty was compared with freshly prepared CMW-3 specimens to determine whether the material properties had changed during 15 years in vivo. Gel permeation chromatography, microcomputed tomography, and flexural strength tests were performed. The fracture itself was analyzed using finite element analysis.
   RESULTS: The polydispersity index and molecular weight were not significantly different for the fractured cranioplasty and CMW-3. The fractured cranioplasty contained a total porosity of 10.7%, fresh CMW-3 cured at atmospheric pressure contained 4.1%, and 0.06% when cured at 2.2 bar. The flexural strength of the CMW-3 cured at 2.2 bar was significantly higher than both the fractured cranioplasty and CMW-3 cured at atmospheric pressure. Finite element analysis showed stress of 12.2 MPa under a load of 100 N on a weak spot.
   CONCLUSIONS: This ex vivo study shows that CMW-3 after 15 years in vivo was not influenced in molecular weight or flexural strength. However, the design of the implant and the handling of the poly(methyl methacrylate) seem to be important factors to improve mechanical properties of cranial reconstructions.

AB BACKGROUND: A cadaveric feasibility study was carried out. Osteotomies to correct fixed sagittal imbalance are usually performed at L-3/L-4.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of S-1 pedicle subtraction osteotomy to correct spinal deformity and spinopelvic parameters, achieving better results with more limited exposure. The data obtained will allow a fixation construct specific for this osteotomy to be designed.
   METHODS: S-1 pedicle subtraction osteotomy was performed on 12 cadaveric specimens. Baseline and post-procedural computed tomography and biomechanical studies were performed. Data were analyzed with a fixation system SolidWorks model, and the redesigned fixation construct was described and analyzed with an ANSYS model.
   RESULTS: S-1 pedicle subtraction osteotomy is technically feasible. The fixation can be achieved with L-4, L-5, and iliac screws connected with bars. The system can be reinforced with a polyetheretherketone cage placed anteriorly in the S-1 body osteotomy site, a cross-connecting bar, a double iliac screw, or an anterior interbody cage placed at the L-5-S-1 disc. The fixation strength is improved by angulating the iliac rod channel 10 degrees, adding a semi-sphere to the locking screw contact surface and 2 fins to its saddle. The redesigned construct showed suitable stress and deformation levels, achieving the expected biomechanical requirements.
   DISCUSSION: Compared with surgery on higher levels, S-1 pedicle subtraction osteotomy allows greater correction with shorter fixation, because the osteotomy is performed at a more caudal level, modifying the spinopelvic parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: S-1 pedicle subtraction osteotomy is technically feasible. Finite element analysis results indicate that it has appropriate biomechanical properties.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients with ankylosing spinal disease, including ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, even low-impact trauma can lead to complex injuries. The injuries seem to be highly unstable and associated with greater mortality rates compared with the general spine trauma population.
   METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of a consecutive series of 41 patients (34 men, 7 women) with ankylosing spinal disease and unstable traumatic spine injuries who were admitted to our department from 2007 to 2016.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 73.4 +/- 12.7 years. Of the 41 patients, 24 (58.5%) had ankylosing spondylitis and 17 (41.5%) had diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Low-velocity accidents were documented in 38 patients (92.7%). The most frequent injuries were type B spine fractures (61.0%). Accompanying spinal epidural hematoma was detected using magnetic resonance imaging in 12 patients (29.3%) but was not found by radiography or computed tomography. Of the 41 patients, 24 (58.5%) presented with American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale (AIS) grade E, 6 (14.6%) with grade D, and 8 (19.6%) with grade C or worse. All the patients had undergone internal fixation. All but 1 (97.6%) had received posterior fixation. In 25 (61%), a combined approach was performed. Five patients died of early complications. Of the 36 discharged patients, 11 died during the follow-up period and 1 was lost to follow-up. The surviving 24 patients had a median follow-up of 733 +/- 576 days; 21 had AIS grade E, 2 had AIS grade D, and 1 had AIS grade C.
   CONCLUSIONS: A thorough diagnostic evaluation with multislice computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can reveal injuries that would remain undetected on conventional radiographs. A combined approach or posterior-only fixation seems safe.

   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysms are rare with no optimal consensus on management strategies. When treatment requires parent artery occlusion, postoperative ischemic or neuropathic complications can occur. This study evaluated the feasibility of direct revascularization of premeatal AICA using the middle meningeal artery (MMA) as the donor through an anterior petrosectomy window.
   METHODS: Ten specimens were used for surgical simulation of MMA-AICA bypass. MMA was harvested from the dura down to the foramen spinosum. An anterior petrosectomy approach was performed on each specimen, and AICA was exposed up to its origin from the basilar artery. The lateral pontine (A2) segment was mobilized laterally, and the end-to-end anastomosis was completed. Measurements of the required length of the AICA, MMA, and their calibers at the anastomotic site were recorded.
   RESULTS: MMA-AICA bypass was feasible in all specimens. The mean length of AICA from the origin at the anastomotic site was 7.3 +/- 1.7 mm, and mean length of MMA from the foramen spinosum was 34.6 +/- 5.1 mm. Mean calibers of MMA were 2.1 +/- 0.2 mm at the foramen spinosum and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mm at the anastomosis. A2 caliber was 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm with average lateral mobilization of 7.6 +/- 2.7 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the feasibility of MMA-AICA bypass via a middle fossa approach. The matching caliber of the 2 arteries makes end-to-end anastomosis easy to achieve. The MMA is a suitable donor artery that avoids the use of an interposition graft and the complications of extracranial-intracranial bypass.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pipeline embolization device (PED) has expanded the range of aneurysms amenable to endovascular treatment, including some that were previously untreatable. The PED contains several metals, including nickel, cobalt, chromium, platinum, and tungsten. The safety of PED implantation in patients with cutaneous metal allergy is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and angiographic outcomes of PED treatment in patients with cutaneous metal allergy.
   METHODS: A single-institution neurointerventional database was retrospectively reviewed for patients with documented cutaneous metal allergy who were treated with the PED. Patient, aneurysm, and procedural data were collected, including perioperative and delayed complications. Posttreatment angiograms were reviewed for in-Pipeline stenosis and aneurysm occlusion.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients with metal allergy underwent 23 PED treatments for 26 aneurysms. The cohort was 95% (19/20) female; mean age was 55.7 years. Aneurysms were primarily anterior circulation (92%, 24/26) and saccular (92%; 24/26); mean size was 8.8 mm (range, 2-32 mm). One PED was implanted in 70% (14/20) of patients, 25% (5/20) had 2 devices placed, and 1 patient had 3 devices. One major procedural complication occurred (4.3%, 1/23) in which a stroke was caused by perioperative PED thrombosis. Angiographic follow-up was available for all patients (mean duration 15.7 months; range, 6- 64 months),which demonstrated a complete aneurysm occlusion rate of 88% (23/26). Asymptomatic in-Pipeline stenosis occurred in 2 cases, resulting in 65% and 50% parent artery stenosis, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that PED implantation in patients with cutaneous metal allergy is safe and effective.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of anterior controllable ante-displacement and fusion (ACAF) as a revision surgery after posterior decompression surgery (PDS) in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   METHODS: From June 2016 to May 2017, 15 patients (7 men; 8 women) had undergone ACAF as revision after PDS. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was used to evaluate the pre-and postoperative neurological function. The kappa line and complications were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: The 15 patients were followed up for 15.1 +/- 1.8 months (range, 12-18). The mean interval between the initial PDS and revision ACAF was 40.3 +/- 11.3 months (range, 24-62). The JOA score improved from 8.9 +/- 1.6 (range, 5-11) before revision ACAF to 13.9 +/- 1.6 (range, 11-16) at the final follow-up evaluation (P < 0.05). The JOA recovery rate was 61.9% +/- 15.8% (range, 37.5%-90.9%). The kappa line of 7 patients improved from negative values to positive values after ACAF. Five complications (33.3%) developed in 5 patients. No instrument failure or neurological deterioration was observed during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSION: In the present study, the outcomes of ACAF for revision surgery for OPLL were satisfactory. ACAF could improve neurological function significantly and is an alternative surgical procedure for revision of PDS for OPLL.

AB OBJECTIVE: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our experience in the surgical management of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)/hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) of the spinal cord.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients with SFT/HPCs of the spinal cord were enrolled in this study. Data on clinical presentation, radiologic findings, histopathologic features, surgical treatment, adjuvant therapy, and prognosis were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to identify the prognostic factors for recurrence and overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: Our series included 6 men and 10 women, with a male/female ratio of 1:1.7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slightly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images for all 16 patients. All tumors showed positive immunohistochemical staining for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6. Statistical analysis of clinical data showed that age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, medullary compartment location, and Ki-67 index were not associated with recurrence and OS (P > 0.05). However, World Health Organization grade III was significantly associated with recurrence (P < 0.01). Gross total resection (GTR) and postoperative radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but only GTR showed remarkable benefits to improve OS (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: SFT/HPCs of spinal cord are rare neoplasms with a propensity to recur. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging combined with positive immunohistochemical staining for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 are important clues for classification and differentiation of these tumors. The extent of resection, World Health Organization grade, and postoperative radiotherapy might be predictive factors for recurrence. Complete tumor resection should be sought whenever possible, and adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended after surgical resection. Moreover, regular and long-term follow-up is mandatory to monitor recurrence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop finite element models of spine following osteotomy and evaluate the effect of number and location of cross-links (CLs) on long-segment instrumentation.
   METHODS: A finite element model of instrumented spine following osteotomy was created from computed tomography images of a postoperative male patient with thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity. Five fixation models were established to simulate different number and location of CLs. Four loading conditions (flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation) were applied on the models. Range of motion (ROM), maximum value and distribution of stress on implants, and stress on vertebrae were compared between models.
   RESULTS: With increased number of CLs, average ROM of instrumented segments was reduced by 2.37%, 1.89%, and 2.49% in flexion, extension, and lateral bending. ROM was reduced by 21.98% in loading axial rotation condition. With increased number of CLs, ROM tended to be limited. Peak stresses were located on rods during axial rotation, on proximal pedicle screws during flexion, and on the osteotomy site during extension and lateral bending. CLs had an effect of dispersing stress concentration.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of CLs enhanced the rigidity of the construct. With increased number of CLs, ROM of the construct was decreased, especially in axial rotation. CLs can also disperse the stress concentration. After comparing various CL configurations in different motion conditions, we believe that the optimal method is to place 2 CLs at the osteotomy site and the proximal segment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patients with spinal metastases have broad variability in morbidity, mortality, and survival. Existing prognostic scoring systems have limited predictive value. Our aim is, given recent advances in surgical and medical care for patients with cancer and spinal metastases, to develop a new survival index with superior prognostic value.
   METHODS: We completed a retrospective analysis on 77 patients who received surgery for metastatic tumors to the spine, of patient factors like pathologic subtype, age, neurologic examination, type of surgical procedure, Hauser Ambulation Index, and a novel scoring system for degree of tumor burden in several organ systems, among others. A survival index will be derived from the patient factors that, when measured preintervention, best predicted survival post intervention.
   RESULTS: Although primary organ or pathologic type was not predictive of survival for patients with metastatic disease in this population, the degree of lung tumor burden (LTB) and preoperative Hauser Ambulation Index were predictive of survival. After a multivariable analysis of >20 different patient factors, the Jenkins Survival Index (JSI, a 0-21 scale) was constructed using a machine-learning system as the sum of the HAI (0-9 scale) and LTB score (0-3 scale) multiplied by 4 (JSI = HAI + 4 . LTB, Rho = -0.588, P < 0.0001). The JSI had a positive predictive value of 92% compared with 54.1% and 56.9% for Tokuhashi and Tomita scales, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The JSI predicts in a meaningful way survival outcomes for patients symptomatic from spinal metastases, which will be of value to oncologists and other clinicians treating patients with metastatic disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomic relationship between ureter and oblique lateral interbody fusion access by using contrast-enhanced computed tomographic urography.
   METHODS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic urography data of 234 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The angle of inclination (angle alpha) of bilateral ureters, the angle between bilateral surgical accesses (angle beta), the insertion angle of surgical access (angle gamma), and the angle between ureter and outer margin of ipsilateral surgical access (angle epsilon) at L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5 levels were measured and analyzed.
   RESULTS: angle alpha gradually increased from L2/3 to L4/5. angle beta gradually decreased from L2/3 to L4/5, and at each level the left-sided angle beta was larger than right-sided angle beta. angle epsilon were positive at L2/3 and left-sided L3/4. The right-sided angle epsilon at L3/4 and the bilateral sided angle epsilon at L4/5 were negative, and the right-sided angle epsilon at L4/5 had the largest absolute value.
   CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral ureters gradually descents from the lateral margin to the anteromedial margin on the surface of psoas major muscle. The range of bilateral surgical accesses for oblique lateral interbody fusion gradually decreases from L2/3 to L4/5, and the left-sided access is larger than the right-sided when at the same level. Ureters at the right-sided L3/4 level and bilateral L4/5 levels are at high risk of being injured. In particular, the right ureter at the L4/5 level is most likely to be injured.

AB OBJECTIVE: To quantify the low- to high-frequency range of abnormal brain activities and assess the histopathologic and clinical correlation in patients with glioma.
   METHODS: Twenty-five patients with glioma and 20 healthy controls were examined with a magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. MEG data collected in 6 frequency bands, including 1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz, 12-30 Hz, 30-45 Hz, and 55-75 Hz, were analyzed by neuropathology to assess neuromagnetic signatures of glioma grade.
   RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with glioma showed greatly altered brain activities in 4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz, and 55-75 Hz. Magnetic source power of brain activities in 4-8 Hz and 55-75 Hz in patients with high-grade gliomas significantly differed from that in patients with low-grade gliomas. The magnitude of source power of brain activities in 4-8 Hz and 55-75 Hz had marked correlation with the grading of gliomas in histopathological analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: The degree of neuromagnetic source abnormality is a potential biomarker for noninvasive assessment of glioma grade. Because MEG tests can be performed noninvasively and preoperatively, MEG may play an important role in clinical biopsies and surgical planning for patients with brain gliomas in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic biopsy is a standard procedure in neurosurgery. In addition to or even replacing frame-based stereotaxy, some centers also use frameless imaging-based techniques and more recently robotic systems. Here we report a retrospective analysis of our experience with 102 consecutive biopsies performed in our institution using the neuromate robotic device.
   METHODS: Between March 2013 and April 2018, 102 robot-assisted frameless biopsies were performed in 100 consecutive patients (median age/range: 66/7-86 years, male: 64). Target lesions were deep-seated (insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, cerebellar peduncle) in 29 (28.4%) and/or small (<15 mm) in 24 (23.5%) cases. We retrospectively analyzed the histopathologic results as well as complications and the duration of the procedures.
   RESULTS: A definite histologic diagnosis could be established in 94 of 102 procedures (92.2%; 94/100 patients = 94.0%), including 67 glial and glioneuronal tumors, 16 central nervous system lymphomas, 7 metastases, 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and 5 cases with inflammatory or infectious disorders. There were no infectious complications. A total of 13 cases (12.7%) suffered from biopsy-related hemorrhages >10 mm; however, persistent surgery-related neurologic worsening was seen in only 3 (2.9%). The average operating time was 10 minutes for placement of the localizing device under local anesthesia and 30 minutes for the actual biopsy procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted fameless stereotactic biopsies using the neuromate robot are an alternative to frame-based stereotaxy with a similar diagnostic yield and comparable complication rates.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of vertebral fractures.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2010 to 2014. Adult patients who underwent ORIF of vertebral fractures were included and divided into 2 groups based on the occurrence of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. Baseline patient and operative characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Multivariate regression (MVR) analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for pulmonary complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 900 patients were included in our cohort. The overall 30-day pulmonary complication rate was 5.67%. Patients who had a pulmonary complication after vertebral ORIF were more often men and more often had diabetes, functional dependence, American Society of Anesthesiologists score classification of 3 or higher, pulmonary comorbidity, renal comorbidity, and preoperative anemia. The pulmonary complication group also had a higher incidence of 30-day mortality, prolonged hospitalization, pneumonia, cardiac complications, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, and sepsis. The MVR analysis found that pulmonary comorbidity (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-11.5; P < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2; P = 0.037), partial or dependent functional status (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2-10.2; P < 0.001), and cervical spine involvement (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.7-8.0; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of pulmonary complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications is important in the evaluation of patients with vertebral fractures for surgical decision-making, preoperative optimization, and subsequent postoperative care to improve patient outcomes and minimize morbidity.

ID SURGICAL-SITE INFECTIONS; RISK-FACTORS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Gram-negative surgical site infections (SSI) following spine surgery are becoming increasingly more common owing to a broad perioperative antibiotic usage targeting gram-positive organisms. Enterobacter species have been reported to be the most common gram-negative bacteria following spine surgery.
   METHODS: We queried our institutional database for Enterobacter SSIs after spine surgery at a single institution from 2009-2016. Relevant demographic, clinical, and operative variables were collected. We compared this cohort to patients who had non-Enterobacter SSI during the same period.
   RESULTS: Enterobacter species were isolated in 16 patients (9 males) diagnosed with SSI after undergoing spine surgery. This group represented 0.2% of all spine cases and 14.5% of all spinal SSIs. Seven patients (43.8%) required multiple irrigations and debridements (I&Ds) (range: 2-8), whereas only 17 of 94 patients (18.1%) with non-Enterobacter SSI required multiple I&Ds (range: 2-5, P = 0.043). Those infected with Enterobacter were associated with higher BMI (37.6 +/- 12.7 vs. 31.7 +/- 8, P = 0.036), earlier wound dehiscence (14.8 vs. 24.6 days, P = 0.01), polymicrobial infections (37.5% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.012), and longer length of stay (18 days [9.5-31.5] vs. 5 days [3-8], P = 0.01) when compared to non-Enterobacter SSI cohort. At an average of 24.2 months follow-up, all 15 surviving patients were infection free with no further revision surgeries needed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacter SSI cases were associated with higher BMI, earlier wound breakdown, polymicrobial infection and longer length of stay. Nevertheless, with vigilant surveillance and timely I&Ds, these challenging infections can be treated successfully with original implant retention in almost all cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Plaque characteristics play pivotal roles in ischemic events, but stenosis severity does not accurately reflect carotid plaque volume due to expansive remodeling in some patients with low-grade stenosis (LGS). This study aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and durability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic LGS.
   METHODS: Study participants comprised 61 consecutive patients who underwent CEA for symptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients were divided into an LGS group (<50%, n = 17) and a non-LGS group (>= 50%, n = 44). Patient characteristics and short-term (within 30 days of CEA) and long-term outcomes were compared between groups for selective usage of internal shunt and known complications of CEA.
   RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging-detected intraplaque hemorrhage was more significant in LGS than in non-LGS (P = 0.04). For short-term outcomes, no symptomatic infarcts, hyperperfusion syndrome, or acute myocardial infarction was confirmed in either group. Internal shunts were used in 4 LGS (23.5%) and 6 non-LGS (13.6%). Asymptomatic diffusion-weighted imaging-positive lesions were confirmed in 2 LGS patients (11.8%) and 5 non-LGS patients (11.4%), neck hematoma in 1 LGS patient, and transient cranial nerve palsy in 1 LGS patient and 2 non-LGS patients, with no significant differences apparent between groups. For long-term outcomes, 5 non-LGS patients showed restenosis (P = 0.17). Hemorrhagic stroke was not observed in either group. No significant differences were seen for infarct in the ipsilateral carotid territory, any ischemic stroke, AMI, or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: CEA represents a safe and feasible therapeutic option for a subset of patients with symptomatic LGS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine cement distribution patterns on therapeutic efficacy after percutaneous vertebroplasty treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with intravertebral cleft (IVC).
   METHODS: Patients who were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty for single OVCFs with IVC and met this study's inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. The follow-up period was at least 2 years. Distribution patterns of cement in the IVC area were respectively specified into 2 groups: group 1: solid lump distribution pattern (n = 22); group 2: the comparatively diffused pattern (n = 90). Radiologic and clinical parameters were analyzed and compared. Then, associations of recollapse with covariates and a risk score were further analyzed and developed to predict recollapse of the augmented vertebrae.
   RESULTS: At the immediate postoperative period, all patients benefited from significant improvement in vertebrae height and kyphotic angle correction. However, significant recollapse was observed at the 2 years postoperative follow-up for the patients in group 1. Furthermore, we found that preoperative severe kyphotic deformity (a cutoff value of 12.5 degrees), solid lump cement distribution pattern, and larger reduction angle (a cutoff value of 8.3 degrees) was significantly associated with increased risk for recollapse. A risk score was developed based on the number of risk factors present in each patient and the receiver operating characteristic curve of the risk score generated an area under the curve of 0.788 (95% confidence interval 0.702-0.873, P = 0.000).
   CONCLUSIONS: The comparatively diffused pattern shows better long-term radiologic and clinical outcomes for the treatment for OVCFs with IVC. A risk score can be used to predict the incidence of recollapse.

ID SPOT SIGN; EXPANSION; CT; DENSITY; BRAIN
AB OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a type of stroke that leads to high mortality. Hematoma growth (HG) happens in about one third of all patients with ICH and is independently related to poor outcome. Previous studies have shown that an indicator on noncontrast computed tomography, called hypodensities, can predict HG in patients with ICH. Thus, this study was done to assess the predictive validity of this marker.
   METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched, without language restriction, for original investigation on hypodensities and HG in ICH. Data were extracted, and study quality was assessed by 2 reviewers independently. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, diagnostic odds ratio, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve was depicted.
   RESULTS: Five cohorts with 2157 patients in 4 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 0.58 (95% CI 0.46-0.68) and the pooled specificity was 0.71 (95% CI 0.62-0.79). In addition, the pooled positive LR was 2.0 (95% CI 1.6-2.5) and the pooled negative LR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.49-0.73). The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 3 (95% CI 2-5) and the area under summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.69 (95% CI 0.65-0.73).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that hypodensities on noncontrast computed tomography can be helpful in HG prediction, although its pooled predictive values are not very satisfying in the current study. The role of hypodensities in predicting HG should be confirmed by further studies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy is an effective way to treat lumbar disc herniation. Traditional preoperative planning based on a 2-dimensional method by magnetic resonance/computed tomography may cause inaccuracy of puncture during surgery. We used virtual reality to stimulate a surgery environment and measured relevant 3-dimensional data. We then explored its applicability for increasing puncture accuracy during actual surgeries.
   METHODS: A prospective randomized trial of lumbar disc herniation was conducted. Both conventional and virtual reality methods were used for preoperative planning and relevant data (planned puncture point and entry angle) were measured. Data were used during surgery and adjusted to complete the operation. The final entry point and entry angle were recorded and compared with relevant planned data statistically. Fluoroscopic times and location time also were included to access the puncture accuracy during surgery.
   RESULTS: Thirty cases were included in our study. Both groups achieved good results after surgery, except for 1 case of postoperative dysesthesia in the traditional planning group and 1 case of residual disc in the virtual reality group. The use of virtual reality can predict a surgeryrelated angle and distance accurately except for depth. Compared with the traditional planning group, the fluoroscopic time (13.18 +/- 4.191 vs. 32.00 +/- 4.52) and location time (17.91 +/- 4.74 vs. 33.22 +/- 3.90) were statistically different, which indicates that this method can increase puncture accuracy.
   CONCLUSIONS: A virtual reality planning system is an accurate preoperative planning method that can significantly improve the puncture accuracy of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy and reduce fluoroscopic and location times.

ID MANAGEMENT; EFFICACY; SAFETY
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of endovascular treatment for ruptured aneurysms at distal cerebral arteries.
   METHODS: A total of 30 ruptured aneurysms at distal cerebral arteries in 30 patients received endovascular treatment (EVT). Distal cerebral arteries were defined as arteries distal to the A2 or M2 segmentations in the anterior circulation, distal to the P2 segmentation in the posterior circulation, or other small branches or perforating arteries. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed using Raymond classification immediately after the procedure and during angiographic follow-up. Clinical follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed and categorized using the modified Rankin scale (MRS).
   RESULTS: Thirty aneurysms were classified as distal anterior circulation in 17 aneurysms and posterior circulation in 13 aneurysms. EVT technically succeeded in all 30 (100%) aneurysms, with stent assistance in 1 aneurysm and coiling only in 29. Aneurysm sac coiling was done in 25 aneurysms, whereas parent artery occlusion was done in 5 aneurysms. Raymond I occlusion were immediately achieved in 19 of 30 (63.3%) aneurysms. Complications occurred in 1 patient because of aneurysm rupture. Angiographic and clinical follow-up data were obtained from 28 patients. Follow-up angiography (mean, 10.14 +/- 5.31 months) revealed Raymond I classification in 22 aneurysms (78.6%). At the end of clinical follow-up (mean, 11.89 +/- 5.07 months), clinical monitoring using the MRS showed a score of 0 in 18 patients, score of 1 in 5 patients, score of 2 in 2 patients, score of 3 in 2 patients, and score of 4 in 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: EVT is a feasible and effective therapy to treat ruptured aneurysms located at distal cerebral arteries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effects of the hematocrit (Hct) in patients with traumatic brain injury after decompressive craniectomy (DC).
   METHODS: Demographic data, inspection and treatment procedures, and 30-day prognosis were obtained for 158 patients with head injury who underwent unilateral DC in our hospital between January 2013 and June 2018. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression was applied to analyze independent risk factors for 30-day outcome. The quantitative analysis of postoperative Hct, DHct (postoperative Hct minus initial Hct), and their combination for the prognosis of patients with TBI was displayed graphically using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Multiple linear regression was used to explore factors influencing postoperative Hct and Delta Hct.
   RESULTS: Short-term mortality was 29.7%. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.064; P = 0.024), Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.711; P = 0.027), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (OR, 1.156; P = 0.047), midline shift in millimeters (OR, 1.809; P < 0.001), postoperative Hct (OR, 0.743; P = 0.001), and Delta Hct (OR, 1.242; P = 0.048) were independent risk factors for short-term death. In ROC curves, a combination of postoperative Hct and Delta Hct showed the highest sensitivity (77.5%) and highest specificity (89.4%). When using this combination to predict prognosis, we could achieve an accuracy of 94.5%. ISS (beta = -0.172, P = 0.022), initial Hct (beta = 0.243, P = 0.001), principal hematoma location (beta = -2.628, P < 0.001), hours of operation (b = -0.884, P = 0.048), and colloid quantity (beta = -0.002, P = 0.001) were independent contributing factors for Delta Hct, which was similar to postoperative Hct.
   CONCLUSIONS: A combination of postoperative Hct and Delta Hct could better predict short-term survival of patients with TBI. Developing an appropriate treatment strategy to increase postoperative Hct and reduce the Delta Hct may be good for the short-term prognosis of patients with TBI after DC.

ID INTRACRANIAL STENT; COIL; EMBOLIZATION; TRIAL
AB PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment of neurovascular disorders is now well established as effective and safe; however, the nature of the intracranial vasculature poses unique challenges. The unintentional dislodgement or fracture of a device and its migration within cerebral vessels is a complication with serious potential morbidity that must be managed urgently. In this series, the authors describe 7 cases of a stentriever being used to remove foreign objects from within the cerebral vasculature.
   METHODS: A retrospective search of all interventional neurovascular procedures performed in 2017 at a tertiary metropolitan hospital was performed to identify cases of dislodged devices.
   RESULTS: Five dislodged endovascular coils, 1 microcatheter, and 1 fractured stentriever were technically successfully retrieved. In 6 of the cases, the foreign object was successfully removed with a stentriever alone, whereas 1 case used a J-tip wire and a "J-tip flick" to manipulate the coil and facilitate retrieval.
   Stentrievers, particularly when used alone, confer the advantages of speed, cost, as well as being tailor-made for cerebral vessels. They also allow continuous blood flow when deployed, a critical advantage when considering cerebral perfusion. Critical techniques include the gradual deployment of the stentriever alongside the foreign object to allow its entanglement and partial resheathing, so that the foreign object can become pinned within the microcatheter. Stentrievers do remain limited by vessel caliber and are less able to entangle larger, stiffer devices.
   CONCLUSION: The migration of foreign devices during neurointerventional procedures is a serious complication requiring urgent treatment. This case series highlights the efficacy and advantages of using a stentriever and suggests its consideration as a first-line technique in recovering dislodged foreign bodies in the cerebral vasculature.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the outcomes and complications of patients with metastatic thoracic spinal tumors (MTTs) who underwent posterior corpectomies.
   METHODS: Ninety patients with MTTs who underwent posterior corpectomies were retrospectively analyzed. Characteristics evaluated included number of MTTs per year, location, involved vertebrae numbers, sex, histology, pre-and postoperative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay.
   RESULTS: The average follow-up was 20.8 +/- 27.9 months (range, 0.5-139.4 months). Of the patients, 76.67% had a single metastasis and 23.33% had multiple metastases. For histology, 16.67% were breast, 15.56% were lung, 12.22% were prostate, and 12.22% were renal cell carcinoma. Of the patients with paraplegia and paraparesis, 74% improved. One patient improved from ASIA grade A to D, 3 patients improved fromgrade B to C, 8 patients improved from grade C to D or E, and 25 patients improved from grade D to E. Three patients (6%) with ASIA grade A and 1 patient (2%) with ASIA grade B had no improvement. One patient with ASIA grade C and 8 patients (16%) with grade D had no improvement. After surgery, VAS pain scores decreased from 8.45 +/- 1.57 to 1.211 +/- 1.81. In terms of complications, 2 patients (2.22%) had deep vein thrombosis and 1 patient had pulmonary embolism (1.11%). Other complications included wound infection (4.44%), cerebrospinal fluid leak (4.44%), pleural effusion (3.33%), wound dehiscence (2.22%), cellulitis (1.11%), epidural hematoma (1.11%), and pneumothorax (1.11%). Of the patients, 2.22% had implant failure and pseudoarthrosis, with 1 patient needing revision surgery. One patient (1.11%) had tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that posterior thoracic corpectomies for MTTs have a reasonable complication rate with favorable outcomes.

ID AUTUMNALIS ACARI; TROMBICULIDAE; LARVAE
AB Trombiculids parasitize a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates, including domestic animals, throughout the world. They are parasites only during their larval stages, causing several dermatological lesions on their hosts, such as acute dermatitis, erythema, excoriation, erosion, papules, crusts and alopecia on the ear margins, face, interdigital spaces and abdomen. Neotrombicula is one of the several genera in Trombiculidae family, which cause trombiculosis. The most common species implicated in clinical cases is Neotrombicula autumnalis. However, several reports have shown that Neotrombicula inopinata (Oudemans, 1909) can also play a role in trombiculosis. Here, we describe the first case of N. inopinata infestation in domestic cats from mainland Portugal. Since nucleic acids of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi have been found in Neotrombicula autumnalis and Rickettsia spp. in Neotrombicula inopinata, a correct taxonomical identification is essential to understand the role of these mite species as possible vectors of pathogens.

AB The objective of present studies was to evaluate and compare the anticoccidial activity of triazine compounds in broiler chickens infected with E. tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, and two field mixed Eimeria species. The anticoccidial efficacy was evaluated using the anticoccidial index (ACI). The results showed that Aminomizuril (AZL) and Ethanamizuril (EZL) were active metabolites of nitromezuril, which demonstrated excellent effectiveness against E. tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, and the field Eimeria isolates in broiler chickens at a dosage of 10 mg/kg in feed. The anticoccidial activities of AZL and EZL at dose 10 mg/kg were roughly equivalent to the parent nitromezuril at a dosage of 3 mg/kg in feed. The decrease in metabolite anticoccidial activity is probably due to an increasing polarity of compounds in the metabolic processes. The sensitivity of two field Eimeria isolates to triazines EZL, diclazuril and toltrazuril was tested using 4 indices including anticoccidial index (ACI), percent of optimum anticoccidial activity (POAA), reduction of lesion scores (RLS) and relative oocysts production (ROP). Results showed that the sensitivity of EZL treatment against the two field Eimeria isolates were relatively superior to that of diclazuril and toltrazuril treatment. The field Eimeria isolates from Gansu Province was determined to be slightly, moderately and highly resistant to EZL, diclazuril and toltrazuril respectively. The field Eimeria isolates from Zhejiang Province was slightly, highly and slightly resistant to EZL, diclazuril and toltrazuril respectively. The results above indicated that the anticoccidial activity of metabolites was lower than that of the parent nitromezuril and there was partial cross-resistance among triazines EZL, diclazuril and toltrazuril. However the field Eimeria isolates had higher sensitive to EZL than the triazines diclazuril and toltrazuril. It was suggested that the site of C4 substituents of phenol of triazine anticoccidials may have important biological functions and the metabolite EZL would be a potential novel anticoccidial agent worthy of more attention.

AB Porcine cysticercosis is an endemic parasitic disease caused by infection with Taenia solium that is found predominantly in developing countries. In order to aid in the development of simple diagnostic approaches, identification and characterization of potential new antigens for immunodiagnostic purposes is desired. The cysteine protease family has previously been found to have important immunodiagnostic properties. These proteases are expressed as zymogens which contain a signal peptide, pro-peptide, and an active domain. Subsequent catalytic cleavage of the pro-peptide converts these zymogens into enzymes. With the use of bioinformatic tools we identified an active domain of a novel cathepsin L-like cysteine protease (TsolCL) in the T. solium genome. The TsolCL gene includes 705 nucleotides (nt) within a single intron and a 633 nt exonic sequence encoding an active protein of 211 amino acids. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the TsolCL gene is closely related to genes found in Echinoccocus granulosus and E. multiloculars. In addition, TsolCL was found to have a 61.9%-99.0% similarity to other cathepsin L proteins found in other helminths and mammals.
   We cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the recombinant active TsolCL (27 kDa) using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. TsolCL showed cysteine protease enzymatic activity with the capacity to hydrolyze the Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate as well as bovine serum albumin. However, TsolCL was not able to hydrolyze human immunoglobulin. In addition, TsolCL has cathepsin L conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic site (Gln8, Cys14, His159, Asn179 and Trp181) and the motif GCNGG.
   Using ELISA, TsolCL was able to distinguish circulating IgG antibodies between healthy animals and naturally infected pigs with cysticercosis, showing a moderate sensitivity of 83.33% (40/48; 95% CI: [69.8%-92.5 %]), and a specificity of 83.78% (31/37; 95% CI: [67.9%-93.8%]).
   In conclusion, a novel cathepsin L-like cysteine protease from a T. solium metacestode was expressed successfully in Baculovirus system and was evaluated as a candidate antigen to diagnose porcine cysticercosis using the ELISA immunoassay.

AB Tritrichomonas foetus is a flagellate protist which commonly causes a waxing and waning large bowel diarrhoea in young cats. We report severe T. foetus infection of the colon, cecum and ileum with concurrent feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) in a 3-month-old Bengal kitten with an 8-day history of vomiting, diarrhoea, failure to thrive and coughing. Protozoa filling the lumen and crypts and occasional invading into lamina propria were identified within the affected colon and confirmed by PCR as T. foetus 'feline genotype'. Assessment of faeces by PCR revealed concurrent infection with FCoV and FPV. It is possible that immunosuppression by FPV played a role in the unprecedented T. foetus infection intensity observed histologically. Studies during and after resolution of FPV infection, will be critical to determine if T. foetus co-infection affects long-term prognosis of FPV survivors.

ID EFFICACY
AB In a previous attempt, an experimental model of bovine besnoitiosis was established in calves that were intravenously inoculated with different doses of Besnoitia besnoiti tachyzoites. Despite the fact that all infected calves developed the acute stage of disease, only microscopic findings characteristic of chronic besnoitiosis were reported. In the present study, calves were inoculated by subcutaneous and intradermal routes with B. besnoiti tachyzoites with the aim of developing clinical signs and macroscopic lesions characteristic of chronic besnoitiosis.
   Nine 3-month-old male calves were randomly distributed into three groups of three animals each. Next, 10(6) tachyzoites were inoculated by either the subcutaneous (G1) or intradermal route (G2). The negative control group (G3) was inoculated with PBS. Daily clinical monitoring and regular blood collection were performed. At 70 days post-infection (pi), animals were euthanized, and tissues were collected to investigate lesions and parasites.
   Infected animals developed mild-moderate acute besnoitiosis characterized by lymphadenopathy from four days to 47 days pi, and sporadic fever peaks were only observed in one calf from G2. However, other clinical signs and macroscopic lesions characteristic of chronic besnoitiosis were not detected. Only nine tissue samples were B. besnoiti-DNA-positive, eight of which belonged to reproductive and respiratory tracts tissues from G1. Finally, the kinetics of the immune responses were similar in both infected groups. However, delayed and lower cellular and humoral immune responses were observed in G1 followed by G2 and were compared with intravenously inoculated calves. The differences observed among the three inoculation routes could be due to different effector mechanisms of the host early innate immune response against B. besnoiti.
   Accordingly, the inoculation route of B. besnoiti tachyzoites does not significantly influence the clinical outcome of the infection in calves. Thus, a further refinement of this experimental model of bovine besnoitiosis is needed to reproduce macroscopic lesions characteristic of chronic stage disease.

AB Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are vector-borne parasites of dogs and cats, with zoonotic potential, endemic in many parts of Europe, including Italy. Control and prevention of dirofilariosis are essential points to reduce their diffusion in animals and humans and veterinarians are the main subjects involved in this "battle". With the aim to better understand current practice by veterinarians, an online questionnaire on different aspects of D. immitis and D. repens was sent to companion animal veterinary facilities registered with the Italian Veterinary chamber. The overall response rate was 25%. Approximately 47% had diagnosed at least one case of Dirofilaria spp. in dogs in the last year and approximately 6% had diagnosed at least one case of Dirofilaria spp. in cats. Of the 662 facilities surveyed, 83.8% used serology to diagnose heartworm infection. For the diagnosis of D. repens infection in dogs and cats, a high percentage of facilities relied on an external laboratory. Most recommended beginning prevention of canine heartworm disease in April-May. Topical and injectable moxidectin and oral ivermectin were the two most commonly used preventives for D. immitis in dogs. The drug most commonly used for heartworm adulticide treatment in dogs was melarsomine. This study show that veterinary facilities ians working in an endemic area for D. immitis and D. repens are aware of recent developments in adulticide therapy. Results would suggest however that diagnosis is not always carried out according to what is currently recommended by international guidelines and that the timing for starting prevention may not be optimal.

AB Infections with the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica may result in considerable economic losses in the dairy livestock industry worldwide. Infections have been associated with detrimental impacts on milk production and milk quality as well as reduced fertility. However, most related data rely on examinations on herd level and the rather few studies on individual cow level are based solely on antibodies as measure for F. hepatica infections. This entails the risk of including false-positives as anti-F. hepatica antibodies persist for months even if the infection is cleared. Therefore, the presented study aimed to overcome this issue by assessing the association between F. hepatica infections measured via faecal egg counts (FEC) and milk production as well as fertility parameters in individual dairy cows. In total, 2006 faecal samples from 1166 Black and White dairy cows from 17 small and medium-sized German grassland farms were examined in July and September 2015. The relationship between patent F. hepatica infections and the milk production parameters milk yield, milk protein content, milk fat content and somatic cell score (SCS) was assessed in a linear mixed model using test-day records of individual cows. Patent F. hepatica infections were found on 35.3% (7/17) of farms with an individual cow prevalence of 10.1% (97/963) in July and 9.1% (95/1036) in September. Patent rumen fluke infections were detected on 17.6% (3/17) farms with an individual cow prevalence of 0.4% (4/963) in July and 0.7% (9/1036) in September. No significant association was found between F. hepatica infection status and either SCS as an indicator of udder health or milk production parameters, despite 0.06 and 0.10% lower values for milk protein and fat content in patently infected cows. Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models were established to estimate the impact of fasciolosis on the fertility parameters calving to first service (CTFS), calving interval (CI), success in first insemination (SFI) and 56-day nonreturn rate (NRR56). A significantly higher average CTFS of 4.69 days was detected in F. hepatica infected cows (P = 0.025), but no significant relationship was found for the other fertility parameters.

AB Optimisation and use of a device for the on-hen in vivo feeding of all hematophagous stages of Dermanyssus gallinae is described. The sealed mesh device contains the mites and is applied to the skin of the hen's thigh where mites can feed on the bird through a mesh which has apertures large enough to allow the mites' mouth-parts to access to the bird but small enough to contain the mites. By optimising the depth and width of the mesh aperture size we have produced a device which will lead to both reduction and refinement in the use of animals in research, allowing the pre-screening of new vaccines and systemic acaricides/insecticides which have been developed for the control of these blood-feeding parasites before progressing to large field trials. For optimal use, the device should be constructed from 105 mu m aperture width, 63 mu m depth, polyester mesh and the mites (irrespective of life stage) should be conditioned with no access to food for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C for optimal feeding and post-feeding survival.

AB Haemonchosis commonly occurs as chronic and subclinical infection in small ruminants, and understanding of immunological response against subclinical haemonchosis is of paramount importance for designing and implementing effective control strategies. The present study was designed to evaluate immunological response during subclinical haemonchosis, experimentally established in goats. Sixteen 5-6 month-old helminth naive kids were randomly allocated into one of two groups, infected and uninfected; the infected group being infected per os with 250 Haemonchus contortus larvae per kg body weight. Faecal, blood and serum samples were collected every third day up to 30 days post-infection (DPI), thereafter weekly up to 58 DPI to record changes in faecal egg count (FEC), haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), peripheral eosinophil percentage and immunological parameters, such as macrophage cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12), Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, 13, 25, 33) and immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE). Pre-patent period of H. contortus in the present study was 18 days and eggs per gram (EPG) peaked on 30 DPI. The total reduction in body weight gain in the infected group was 26 g per day when compared with uninfected animals. Hb (7.35 +/- 0.34 g/dL in infected animals compared with 9.76 +/- 0.67 in control animals) and PCV levels (22 +/- 1.54 g/dL in infected animals compared with 29.2 +/- 1.27 in control animals) decreased significantly up to 44 DPI in infected group (P = 0.000). IL-4, IL-13, IL-33, IgG and IgE showed significant increase in infected animals at different periods. IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-25 did not show any significant changes barring a steep rise of IFN-gamma on 27 DPI. A positive correlation was observed between IgE and IL-4 in subclinical haemonchosis. Of particular note was that all the major cytokines, such as IFN-gamma (P = 0.000), IL-4 (P = 0.000), IL-13 (P = 0.009), and both IgG (P = 0.000) and IgE (P = 0.003), were observed at the lowest concentration on 24 DPI. The effect of infection was found to be significant on cytokines with a strong interaction with time. Taken together, the data suggest that Th2 immune response is predominating in subclinical haemonchosis. The economic loss in term of body weight gain due to subclinical haemonchosis was considerable.

AB Plant essential oils and its chemical compositions are commonly applied in medicinal and other industries due to their broad advanced pharmacological activities. In the present study, we systematically evaluated the acaricidal activities of twelve compounds of essential oils against Psoroptes cuniculi in vitro and in vivo. In addition, to support the clinic uses, their toxicities against immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human liver cells (HL-7702) and skin irritation were studied for evaluating the liver and skin safety. The possible mechanism of action of certain chemical were investigated by determining the inhibitory activities against cytochrome P450 (P450) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Among all tested compounds, eugenol exhibited the best acaricidal activity with LC50 value of 56.61 mu g/ml in vitro. Meanwhile, after the treatment of eugenol for five times within 10 days, the P. cuniculi were eliminated in the naturally infested rabbits, no skin irritation was found in rabbits treated by eugenol. Moreover, eugenol presented no or weak cytotoxicity against HaCaT cells and HL-7702 cells with IC50 values of greater than 100 mu g/ml. Furthermore, the moderate inhibitory activities of eugenol against mites P450 and AChE were demonstrated. Above results indicated that eugenol presented the promising acaricidal activity against P. cuniculi in vitro and in vivo, is safe for both humans and animals at the given doses. This work lays the foundation for the development of eugenol as an environmentally friendly acaricide agent.

AB Vaccination has the potential to be the most cost-effective control measure for reducing the economic burden of neosporosis in cattle. In this study, the immune-stimulatory effect of recombinant Neospora caninum dense granule protein 6 (NcGRA6) was confirmed via its triggering of IL-12p40 production in murine macrophages. BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant NcGRA6 fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein with or without oligomannose-coated-liposomes (OMLs) as the potential adjuvant. Specific IgG1 antibody production was observed from 21 and 35 days after the first immunization in NcGRA6 + GST- and NcGRA6 + GST-OML-immunized mice, respectively. However, specific IgG2a was detected 1 week after the infection, and IgG2a levels of the NcGRA6 + GST- group were higher than those of the NcGRA6 + GST-OML-group. Moreover, spleen cell proliferation with concomitant interferon-gamma production was detected in mice immunized with NcGRA6 + GST, indicating that a significant cellular immune response was induced. Mouse survival rates against N. caninum challenge infection were 91.7% for NcGRA6 + GST and 83.3% for NcGRA6 + GST-OML, which were significantly higher than those of control groups (GST-OML: 25%, phosphate-buffered saline: 16.7%). This indicates that naked NcGRA6 + GST induced protective immunity. Thus, our findings highlight the immune-stimulating potential of NcGRA6 and the ability to induce protective immunity against N. caninum infection in mice.

AB Quantifying eggs from Haemonchus and other trichostrongyle genera in sheep and goat fecal samples is important for evaluating control and treatment strategies for this family of nematodes with divergent pathologies, capabilities for anthelmintic resistance and environmental susceptibilities. Unfortunately, egg morphology among most of the genera do not differ enough to support the accurate identification of these genera with standard microscopic techniques. Several studies have identified specific lectins which bind selectively to sugars located on the egg surfaces for individual genera among the trichostrongyles. To detect lectins binding to these eggs, they must be directly or indirectly bound to fluorophores, and observed with an epi-fluorescence microscope. The binding of multiple lectins to isolated eggs from a fecal sample can be simultaneously detected if fluorophores are used whose excitation and emission spectra do not overlap, and this would enable the development of a fluorescence-based diagnostic test that identifies multiple trichostrongyle genera within each sample. The present study compared the usefulness of different, commercially available detection systems for use in detecting lectin binding to trichostrongyle eggs. Comparisons were made using the detection of PNA binding to H. contortus eggs with the goal of finding three systems with color spectra that do not overlap. These evaluations included both fluorophores directly conjugated to PNA in a one-step incubation protocol and a two-step incubation protocol involving biotinylated PNA and streptavidin conjugated to different fluorophores. Autofluorescence can affect the efficiency of any fluorescence-based detection system, and significant auto fluorescence was observed among the unstained H. contortus eggs with the DAPI-type fluorescence filter, but it was significantly lower with the FITC-type filter and was virtually absent with the rhodamine-type filter. This study demonstrated that all the PNA detection methods tested with H. contortus eggs generated fluorescence intensities (FIs) that were significantly above the autofluorescence generated by the eggs among the three different fluorescence filters. Fluorescence intensities from PNA directly conjugated to either the FITC or rhodamine fluorophores were not different, but the lower autofluoresence in the rhodamine-type filter will enable this fluorophore to be detected more efficiently. Use of biotinylated PNA combined with streptavidin-conjugated to synthetic fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 405, 488 and 546) significantly increased FIs over that of the directly conjugated PNA, but there were no significant differences in FIs among these three biotin-avidin conjugation fluorophores. This biotin-avidin system required two incubation steps. Doubling the concentration of PNA also provided increased FI, at least for the biotin-avidin system. Adding an additional amplification step to the biotin-avidin system involving biotinylated anti-streptavidin followed by the streptavidin-Alexa Fluor complex also provided additional fluorescence.

AB Macrocyclic lactone-resistant Parascaris have been reported throughout the world. In part, the drug resistant phenotype is hypothesized to be associated with ATP-binding cassette transporters known as P-glycoproteins. In many systems, P-glycoproteins efflux drugs out of cells thereby precluding drug binding to target receptors. Parascaris may evade macrocyclic lactone-mediated death by effluxing drugs away from target receptors in the nervous system. Alternatively, P-glycoprotein expression in the gut or body wall could prevent penetration of drugs into the body of the parasite altogether. In the present study, we evaluate expression of Peq-pgp-11 and Peg-pgp-T-16 using a novel multiple nucleic acid hybridization method. This method allowed for visualization of individual mRNA transcripts within fixed tissue sections of Parascaris adults. Our investigation revealed expression of Peq-pgp-11 and Peq-pgp-16 in the intestine, body wall, nerves, lateral cords, and reproductive tissues of male and female parasites. These results suggest that Pgp could efflux drugs locally at the level of parasite neuronal tissue as well as at sites of entry for drugs such as the hypodermis and intestine. The multiple nucleic acid hybridization method could be useful for providing tissue context for gene expression in a variety of nematode parasites.

AB Bovine Trichomonosis, an endemic sexually transmitted disease in countries with extensive livestock and natural service, represents one of the most common causes of reproductive failure. 5-nitroimidazoles and their derivatives are used for its treatment, mainly metronidazole (Mz). The emergence of resistance mechanisms adopted by the parasites against the drug and failure of the treatments suggest the need to investigate susceptibility and obtain current values. The available information of in vitro susceptibility of these drugs comes from the use of a diversity of methodologies and criteria, especially observation of the mobility of the parasite under the optical microscope to evaluate its viability. These techniques are arduous and time consuming and lead to a subjective assessment dependent on the operator, the methodology used, and the morphology adopted by the protozoan. In this sense, flow cytometry has proven to be a fast and efficient method to evaluate viability in other protozoa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of six bovine isolates of Tritrichomonas foetus to Mz in aerobic (AC) and anaerobic (ANC) conditions by means of the calculation of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), by flow cytometry, and also to analyze minimum lethal concentration (MLC) by means of recovery tests post-treatment in vitro. IC50 values ranged from 1.06 to 1.25 mu M in ANC and from 1.44 to 3.03 mu M in AC, these being the only ones reported at 48 h for these protozoa. With respect to MLC at 48 h, the results were from 3.67 to 7.35 mu M in ANC, and from 7.35 to 14.7 mu M for AC, where two isolates (Tf0 and Tf2) for AC and one (Tf2) for ANC showed higher values than those described in the literature. Flow cytometry has proven to be an effective, rapid and objective methodology and very useful in susceptibility tests. The data obtained through these tests allow us to describe the susceptibility exhibited by these protozoa, this being valuable information when establishing dosages in Mz treatments.

AB The immunogenicity and efficacy of Fasciola DNA vaccines have not yet been comprehensively summarised in the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis. Though multiple vaccine studies with respect to Fasciola vaccines exist, the variance in the experimental parameters has made comparison difficult.
   We conducted a bibliographic database search in Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases, limited to publications from 1998 to 2017. The key words: Liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica, DNA vaccination, and immunogenicity were used in combination to form search strings. A total of 4760 studies were identified after initial screening, of which 14 qualified for systematic review and 7 for meta-analysis. The mean Odds Ratio (OR) for all studies was 0.565 (95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.293 to 1.087), which means the percentage of protection in terms of decreased fluke burden in animals vaccinated with DNA vaccines was 43.5%. A moderate protective efficacy was observed for cysteine protease and phosphoglycerate kinase vaccine antigen candidates (pooled OR and 95% CI, [0.542; 0.179-1.721] and [0.616; 0.219-1.735], respectively). Vaccine effectiveness was observed in individual studies and cohorts; however, the overall pooled efficacy for all vaccine candidates was found to be non-significant.
   Despite multiple individual studies showing promising results for various DNA vaccine candidates against fascioliasis, the pooled studies showed the non-significant effect of the vaccine formulations against fluke burden, and displayed minimal protective efficacy against Fasciola infection. Though promising results are observed in isolated studies, further animal trials with standardised experimental parameters are required to develop new vaccine candidates effective against Fasciola.

AB Recently, it has been shown that the resolution in cryo-tomography could be improved by considering the sample motion in tilt-series alignment and reconstruction, where a set of quadratic polynomials were used to model this motion. One requirement of this polynomial method is the optimization of a large number of parameters, which may limit its practical applicability. In this work, we propose an alternative method for modeling the sample motion. Starting from the standard fiducial-based tilt-series alignment, the method uses the alignment residual as local estimates of the sample motion at the 3D fiducial positions. Then, a scattered data interpolation technique characterized by its smoothness and a closed-form solution is applied to model the sample motion. The motion model is then integrated in the tomographic reconstruction. The new method improves the tomogram quality similar to the polynomial one, with the important advantage that the determination of the motion model is greatly simplified, thereby overcoming one of the major limitations of the polynomial model. Therefore, the new method is expected to make the beam-induced motion correction methodology more accessible to the cryoET community.

TI Bending and branching of calcite laths in the foliated microstructure of

AB Foliated calcite is widely employed by some important pteriomorph bivalve groups as a construction material. It is made from calcite laths, which are inclined at a low angle to the internal shell surface, although their arrangement is different among the different groups. They are strictly ordered into folia in the anomiids, fully independent in scallops, and display an intermediate arrangement in oysters. Pectinids have particularly narrow laths characterized by their ability to change their growth direction by bending or winding, as well as to bifurcate and polyfurcate. Electron backscatter analysis indicates that the c-axes of laths are at a high, though variable, angle to the growth direction, and that the laths grow preferentially along the projection of an intermediate axis between two a-axes, although they can grow in any intermediate direction. Their main surfaces are not particular crystallographic faces. Analyses done directly on the lath surfaces demonstrate that, during the bending/branching events, all crystallographic axes remain invariant. The growth flexibility of pectinid laths makes them an excellent space-filling material, well suited to level off small irregularities of the shell growth surface. We hypothesize that the exceptional ability of laths to change their direction may be promoted by the mode of growth of biogenic calcite, from a precursor liquid phase induced by organic molecules.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with severe diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. During an extensive search for novel essential genes, we identified tgpA (locus PA2873) in P. aeruginosa PAO1, as a gene playing a critical role in bacterial viability. TgpA, the translated protein, is an internal membrane protein with a periplasmic soluble domain, predicted to be endowed with a transglutaminase-like fold, hosting the Cys404, His448, and Asp464 triad. We report here that Cys404 mutation hampers the essential role of TgpA in granting P. aeruginosa viability. Moreover, we present the crystal structure of the TgpA periplasmic domain at 1.6 angstrom resolution as a first step towards structure-activity analysis of a new potential target for the discovery of antibacterial compounds.

   MECHANISM
AB Aminotransferases catalyze reversibly the transamination reaction by a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. Various aminotransferases acting on a range of substrates have been reported. Aromatic transaminases are able to catalyze the transamination reaction with both aromatic and acidic substrates. Two aminotransferases from C. albicans, Aro8p and Aro9p, have been identified recently, exhibiting different catalytic properties. To elucidate the multiple substrate recognition of the two enzymes we determined the crystal structures of an unliganded CaAro8p, a complex of CaAro8p with the PLP cofactor bound to a substrate, forming an external aldimine, CaAro9p with PLP in the form of internal aldimine, and CaAro9p with a mixture of ligands that have been interpreted as results of the enzymatic reaction. The crystal structures of both enzymes contains in the asymmetric unit a biologically relevant dimer of 55 kDa for CaAro8 and 59 kDa for CaAro9p protein subunits. The ability of the enzymes to process multiple substrates could be related to a feature of their architecture in which the active site resides on one subunit while the substrate-binding site is formed by a long loop extending from the other subunit of the dimeric molecule. The separation of the two functions to different chemical entities could facilitate the evolution of the substrate-binding part and allow it to be flexible without destabilizing the conservative catalytic mechanism.

AB RCK (regulating conductance of K+) domains are common regulatory domains that control the activity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic K+ channels and transporters. In bacteria these domains play roles in osmoregulation, regulation of turgor and membrane potential and in pH homeostasis. Whole-genome sequencing unveiled RCK gene redundancy, however the biological role of this redundancy is not well understood. In Bacillus subtilis, there are two closely related RCK domain proteins (KtrA and KtrC) that regulate the activity of the Ktr cation channels. KtrA has been well characterized but little is known about KtrC. We have characterized the structural and biochemical proprieties of KtrC and conclude that KtrC binds ATP and ADP, just like KtrA. However, in solution KtrC exist in a dynamic equilibrium between octamers and non-octameric species that is dependent on the bound ligand, with ATP destabilizing the octameric ring relative to ADP. Accordingly, KtrC-ADP crystal structures reveal closed octameric rings similar to those in KtrA, while KtrC-ATP adopts an open assembly with RCK domains forming a super-helix. In addition, both KtrC-ATP and -ADP octamers are stabilized by the signaling molecule cyclic-di-AMP, which binds to KtrC with high affinity. In contrast, c-di-AMP binds with 100-fold lower affinity to KtrA. Despite these differences we show with an E. coli complementation assay that KtrC and KtrA are interchangeable and able to form functional transporters with both KtrB and KtrD. The distinctive properties of KtrC, in particular ligand-dependent assembly/disassembly, suggest that this protein has a specific physiological role that is distinct from KtrA.

AB The 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole (Choi) moiety is a hallmark of aeruginosins, a class of cyanobacterial derived bioactive linear tetrapeptides that possess antithrombotic activity. The biosynthetic pathway of Choi has yet to be resolved. AerE is a cupin superfamily enzyme that was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of Choi, but its exact role remains unclear. This study reports the functional characterization and structural analyses of AerE. Enzymatic observation reveals that AerE can dramatically accelerate 1,3-allylic isomerization of the non-aromatic decarboxylation product of prephenate, dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (H2HPP). This olefin isomerization reaction can occur non-enzymatically and is the second step of the biosynthetic pathway from prephenate to Choi. The results of comparative structural analysis and substrate analogue binding geometry analysis combined with the results of mutational studies suggest that AerE employs an induced fit strategy to bind and stabilize the substrate in a particular conformation that is possibly favorable for 1,3-allylic isomerization of H2HPP through coordinate bonds, hydrogen bonds, pi-pi conjugation interaction and hydrophobic interactions. All of these interactions are critical for the catalytic efficiency.

AB The interpretation of cryo-electron tomograms of macromolecular complexes can be difficult because of the large amount of noise and because of the missing wedge effect. Here it is shown how the presence of rotational symmetry in a sample can be utilized to enhance the quality of a tomographic analysis. The orientation of symmetry axes in a sub-tomogram can be determined using a locked self-rotation function. Given this knowledge, the sub-tomogram density can then be averaged to improve its interpretability. Sub-tomograms of the icosahedral bacteriophage phiX174 are used to demonstrate the procedure.

However, strong interactions between the electrons and the materials limit the application of the electron crystallographic method on large protein crystals with micrometer or larger sizes. Here, we used the focused ion beam (FIB) equipped on the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to mill a large crystal to thin lamella. The influences of the milling on the crystal lamella were observed and investigated, including radiation damage on the crystal surface during the FIB imaging, deformation of the thin crystal lamella, and variation in the diffraction intensities under electron radiation. These observations provide important information to optimize the FIB milling, and hence is important to obtain high-quality crystal samples for routine structure determination of protein crystals using the electron cryo-microscope.

AB Mucopolysaccharidosis III B (MPS III-B) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiencies in Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) for which there is currently no cure, and present treatment is largely supportive. Understanding the structure of NAGLU may allow for identification of novel therapeutic targets for MPS IIIB. Here we describe the first crystal structure of human NAGLU, determined to a resolution of 2.3 angstrom. The crystal structure reveals a novel homotrimeric configuration, maintained primarily by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions via domain II of three contiguous domains from the N- to C-terminus. The active site cleft is located between domains II and III. Catalytic glutamate residues, E316 and E446, are located at the top of the (alpha/beta)(8) barrel structure in domain II. We utilized the three-dimensional structure of NAGLU to map several MPS III-B mutations, and hypothesize their functional consequences. Revealing atomic level structural information about this critical lysosomal enzyme paves the way for the design of novel therapeutics to target the underlying causes of MPS III-B.

AB A recently identified mutant of human gamma S-crystallin, G57W is associated with dominant congenital cataracts, the familial determinate of childhood blindness worldwide. To investigate the structural and functional changes that mediate the effect of this cataract-related mutant to compromise eye lens transparency and cause lens opacification in children, we recently reported complete sequence-specific resonance assignments of gamma S-G57W using a suite of heteronuclear NMR experiments. As a follow up, we have determined the 3D structure of gamma S-G57W and studied its conformational dynamics by solution NMR spectroscopy. Our structural dynamics results reveal greater flexibility of the N-terminal domain, which undergoes site-specific structural changes to accommodate W57, than its C-terminal counterpart. Our structural inferences that the unusual solvent exposure of W57 is associated with rearrangement of the N-terminal domain suggest an efficient pathway for increased aggregation in gamma S-G57W and illuminates the molecular dynamics underlying cataractogenic aggregation of lens crystallins in particular and aggregation of proteins in general.

AB The Hetao region of China is noted for research on ancient humans. However, a lack of detailed records of vegetation and climate changes in this region has hindered understanding of human dispersal. We reconstructed the vegetation and climate changes during the last Pleistocene using pollen records from a continuous lacustrine sediment section in the Hetao Basin. The vegetation type was forest-steppe dominated by Pinus and Artemisia during the last interglacial periods. During the last glacial periods, the vegetation shifted to a Chenopodiaceae - Artemisia desert steppe with an Artemesia steppe between 44 and 34 ka BP. The steppe ecosystem, in the Hetao region during milder periods of the last glacial, was suitable for herbivores that may have provided sufficient prey for ancient humans. The vegetation changes indicate an altered climate characterized by colder and drier conditions that were probably influenced by global cooling and a decline of northern insolation variations from the last interglacial to glacial periods.

AB The Tarim large igneous province (TLIP) comprises a complex suite of lithologies including voluminous ferrobasalts, although the petrogenetic relation of these rocks is still poorly understood. In this study, we report the chemical compositions of olivine in two types of olivine pyroxenites (porphyritic and coarse-grained) from the Wajilitag mafic-ultramafic intrusion in the northwestern TLIP, aiming to characterize the mantle sources of magmas. Olivine in the porphyritic olivine pyroxenites shows low 100 * Mn/Fe (similar to 1.3) and Mn/Zn ( < 13) ratios, whereas that in the coarse-grained olivine pyroxenites is characterized by markedly higher ratios of 100 * Mn/Fe ( > 1.9) and Mn/Zn ( > 14), suggesting a heterogeneous mantle source beneath the Wajilitag area. The low olivine V/Sc values ( < 1.5) in the two types of olivine pyroxenites reflect high oxygen fugacity conditions during magma crystallization. The maximum temperatures of crystallization of porphyritic olivine pyroxenites and olivine pyroxenites estimated based on the A1-in-olivine thermometer are 1350 degrees C and 1190 degrees C, respectively. A comparison of the results from our study in terms of mantle source and oxygen fugacity suggests less potential for metallogeny in this region, as against the Panxi area in the Emeishan Large Igneous Province.

AB For the first time a dense seismic network (AcehSeis) consisting of 30 short-period seismic stations was installed for 10 months from July 2014 in order to record crustal earthquakes in Central Aceh, Northern Sumatra, following the hazardous earthquake with magnitude Mw. 6.1, July 2nd, 2013. The objective of this research is to investigate the active fault characteristics derived from local earthquake data combined with a digital elevation model. The network recorded more than 1790 local events occurring along the main Great Sumatran Fault (GSF) and its secondary faults. Local earthquakes with azimuthal gap angles greater than 180 degrees were excluded to avoid non-unique earthquake locations. Therefore from all recorded earthquakes, 1127 local earthquakes were used for further seismological analysis. A method of simultaneous earthquake relocation and 1D velocity determination was applied to obtain better location of earthquakes. The output of the first relocated seismicity was then relocated again by using a double difference relocation method. After relocation, earthquakes are concentrated in a narrow zone along the active fault, indicating the reliability of the earthquake location. We then determined the focal mechanism of earthquakes, based on the first polarity picks.
   The seismicity distribution correlates with the well-known GSF and its main secondary faults. Earthquake locations also clearly revealed several active segments which include the Batee, Beutong, Tangse-Geumpang, Lampahan, Aceh and Seulimeum, and Nisam faults. Also less-known faults as the Pamue and the Lintang-Peusangan faults are imaged. In Northern Aceh an unknown earthquake cluster associated with an active fault, the Nisam Fault was detected, which is also visible in the topography. The seismicity along GSF is offset at around 96.7 E, constrained by the nearly N-S striking Atu Lintang-Peusangan Fault confirming the segmentation of GSF at this longitude. The Aceh segment and the Seulimum Fault in the northernmost region of the network are both active and clearly imaged by the seismicity. The Pamue and the Lampahan Faults seem to be the splay of GSF as indicated by identical strike direction as the GSF. The Lampahan fault is characterized by NW-SE seismicity lineation, which is in agreement with the focal mechanisms. The Laut Tawar Lake could be a part of the Lampahan Fault that is also offset at similar to 96.7 E at the line of the Atu Lintang-Peusangan fault. The Burni Geureudong Fault on the other hand strikes ENE-WSW which suggests a conjugate fault of the Lampahan Fault.

AB The Lower Eocene siliciclastics in the northern steep slope of the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, are described and interpreted as subaqueous fans associated with a thick succession of lacustrine deposits. As a whole, the complicated interplay between the depositional process of these lacustrine fans and slope topography is underrepresented. An integrated study of cores, well-logs, seismic sections and seismic attribute maps have enabled the identification of three types of subaqueous fans at the root of slope, including channelized near-shore subaqueous fans, non-channelized near-shore subaqueous fans and slump turbidity fans. Channelized near-shore subaqueous fans, characterized by straight or slightly curved multi-distributary channels in N-S direction, are mainly filled with conglomerates or pebbly sandstones interbedded with mudstones. In contrast, nonchannelized near-shore subaqueous fans are lobate in plane-view, lacking major channels. Slump turbidity fan typically shows an elongate shape with a single, straight-to-weakly meandering channel fronted by terminal splay. Spatial distribution and the types of these subaqueous fans varied through time along the strike of steep slope during the Eocene Es4s depositional time. Slope geomorphology from which the sediments were derived has been reconstructed. The steep slope, evolved from the joining points of extensional fault scarps, preserves numerous gullies incised downdip the whole slope. These gullies, acting as conduits for transporting sediments through the steep slope into the lacustrine basin, are downslope - oriented, ca 4 km long, ca 1 km wide and < 300 m deep. Differences in the types and distribution of subaqueous fans are not only in response with the intensity of fault movement and climatic change, but also controlled by the heterogeneity in slope topography and source supply. Understanding the spatial distribution of subaqueous fans and morphological control on the depositional process of lacustrine fans is important to the new exploration strategies for the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin.

AB Global marine ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts host immense metal resources, and the metal enrichment mechanism is still in dispute. The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the largest marginal seas in the western Pacific, and its northern slope is a passive continental margin with high sedimentary rate. A large amount of ferromanganese nodules and crusts have been discovered in the SCS northern slope. Previous investigations shown that the SCS nodules/crusts are often smaller and thinner, and contain higher Si and Al but lower Mn, Co and Ni than the Western Pacific nodules and crusts. In this study, high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were performed to explore the microorganism activities with respect to the nodules/crusts formation. Various biogenic signature and microfossils in the SCS FeMn nodules/crusts are recorded. These bio-marks and microfossils present several morphological types: tubiform burrows, bulbiform organism fossils, mould structures, cylindrical protozoan, globular growth structures, isolated spheroidal bacteria and biofilms. These mineralized bio-marks and microfossils are mostly protozoans belonging to various bacteria, biofilm, diatoms and coccoliths with Mn and/or Fe on their surface. Using the electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA), the microfossil-rich areas contain higher Mn than the surrounding microfossil-poor areas are observed. The abundance of bio-marks and microfossils and their geochemical features support a dominant role of microorganism activities in the SCS nodule/crustal formation. We proposed that microorganisms may have served as seeds/templates to induce mineral deposition in the nodules and crusts, and chemical oxidation and other abiotic mechanisms also contribute to the Fe-Mn oxide formation. The biogenic hypothesis provides another perspective to further understand the formation of deep marine Fe-Mn nodules/crusts, and will be important for exploration of Fe and Mn metals in the future.

AB A systematic geochemical analysis of samples from newly drilled wells in the Lufeng Sag, Pearl River Mouth Basin has been carried out to characterize source rock quality, determine organic matter input and reconstruct the depositional environment of the Enping and Wenchang formations. Total organic carbon (TOC) content ranges from 0.46 to 1.57 wt% in the Enping formation, and from 0.53 to 6.10 wt% in the Wenchang formation. Kerogen types I-II were identified in the Wenchang formation samples, while kerogen types II-III were identified in the Enping formation samples. Maturity parameters suggest marginally mature to mature levels for most samples with higher maturity for the Wenchang formation samples. Biomarker assemblage and trace element ratios of the Wenchang and Enping formations are distinctively different, indicating predominantly aquatic origin organic matter input under suboixc-anoxic water conditions for the Wenchang formation and more allochthonous terrestrial organic matter input under oxic water conditions for the Enping formation. Moderate to high primary productivity and temperature drove water stratification, together with weak detrital material dilution led to the enrichment of organic matter in the Wenchang formation. While the low primary productivity, poor preservation conditions and high dilution led to the relatively poor source rock quality in the Enping formation.

AB Deep water bottom current (DWBC) plays a central role in global climate. Relative to the Atlantic, due to poor preservation of marine carbonate in the Pacific sediments, the evolution of Pacific deepwater circulation is still unclear. The South China Sea (SCS), connection to the Pacific through Luzon Strait, at a depth of about 2400 m, offers a unique opportunity to monitor the changes of western Pacific deep water circulation. We present a magnetic and grain size analysis of two sediment cores (PC111 and PC83) located in Xisha Trough, northern SCS in order to reconstruct past changes of DWBC during the last 150 kyrs. Variations in the mean size of sortable silt are interpreted to indicate past changes of DWBC, which suggest abrupt, millennial-scale increasing DWBC strength during Heinrich Stadials (HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS6, HS7, HS8, HS9, HS10, HS11) for past 150 kyr. The flow orientation of DWBC revealed by the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) are mostly NW-SE direction in Core PC111 and Core PC83, which are both parallel to the local topography. Combined with the published studies, we suggest the increase bottom current in northern SCS during the Heinrich Stadials (HS1 to HS11), times of weak North Atlantic Deep Water formation, demonstrating the tight coupling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

AB The Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB), the largest basin in the northern continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS), has been one of the key areas to characterize geothermal field and thermal evolution of a passive continental margin. The thermal history of the Pearl River Mouth Basin is related to the seafloor spreading of the SCS in the late Early Oligocene. Heat flow measurements show that the PRMB is characterized by a high background heat flow with average heat flow of 71.8 +/- 13.6 mW/m(2). The present-day heat flow of the northern SCS increases from the northern shelf with the thick crust to the southern slope with the thinned crust. This study employs forward and inverse modeling to simulate the rift and post-rift processes exampled by four wells at different structural settings. Two thermal evolution models of the PRMB are established for continental shelf and continental slope. In the continental shelf, heat flow increased rapidly twice during the syn-rift stage, and then followed by continuous thermal subsidence with heat flow value decreased during the post-rift stage. While the heat flow in the slope continuously increased due to lithospheric thinning, mantle upwelling and resulting multiepisode seafloor spreading in SCS during the Neogene post-rift stage, which is different from the previously proposed decreasing heat model for the slope during the post-rift. Heat flow gradually reduced after the cessation of the sea floor spreading (10 Ma). The local multi-staged magmatic activities mainly contribute to the high level of maturity in the Liwan Sag located in the lower slope.

AB Information about ocean evolution and material-energy exchange between the ocean and surrounding continents can be preserved in marine sediments. The Southwest Sub-basin, located among the Xisha Islands, the Zhongsha Islands, and the Nansha Islands, is an ideal tectonic unit to analyze the sedimentary environments of the South China Sea. In this paper, the distribution patterns of lipid biomarkers and their compound-specific stable carbon isotopes in surface sediments from the Southwest Sub-basin of the South China Sea were analyzed. Lipid biomarkers are composed of different proportions of aliphatic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, alcohols and series of sterols, indicating that the organic matter of the Southwest Sub-basin was derived from marine bacteria, algae and terrestrial higher plants. The average concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in the study samples was 0.5 +/- 0.16%. TOC, total n-alkanes, and total carboxylic acids (TFA) decreased gradually from the margins to the center of the sub-basin, whereas the content of total n-alkanols increased. The spatial distribution trends resulted from varying water depths and the contribution of terrestrial organic matter. The concentration of TFA and the TFA/TOC revealed that the accumulation of organic matter in this area was generally low. The strong correlation between TOC and TFA of surface sediments in the study area may be related to a balance between the ocean production and ocean deposition rates.

AB The slope of the northern South China Sea (SCS) is one of the world's most active areas of modem marine sedimentary processes. A rapidly deposited sediment drift (RDSD) was identified on the slope near Dongsha Island. The sources of this body have been studied and discussed by several authors, but no consensus has been achieved. Based on multi-channel seismic profiles interpretation and data analysis of long-term observation of bottom currents, we identified that although the amounts of sediments input from the Pearl and Hanjing Rivers, and from Kao-ping and Tseng-Wen Rivers are large, considering the current situation of northern SCS, none of the Pearl River, the Hanjiang River, the Kao-ping River and the Tseng-Wen River can maintain the deposition pattern of the northern SCS margin as the single source, especially to maintain the supper high sedimentation rate at the RDSD area. The Miocene drape formation (MDF) calmly draped over an unconformity after rifting stage resulting in a relatively constant thickness of about 2000 m throughout the overall northern SCS continental margin, and followed by a standard configuration of a clinoform, the Pliocene formation and another clinoform of about another 700 m in total thickness. Due to Dongsha uplift since 3 Ma, roughly 1/2 of MDF and the N-2 formation in the Dongsha area measures 150 km by 200 km were denudated resulting in an average annual denudation rate of 60 x 10(6)t/y. If these sediments were deposited on a slope region within an area measuring 100 km by 100 km, the sedimentation rate could reach 250 cm/ky. This is clearly an impressive new sediment source that has never been discussed before. Moreover, the RDSD is near the Dongsha Uplift and on the adjacent slope. We believe that this new sediment source should be the main contributor for the RDSD development.

AB Variations in n-alkanes proxies (L/H, C-31/C-27 and ACL), molecular abundances of n-alkanes and stable carbon isotopic compositions of n-alkanes (delta C-13(alk)) from the core STD235 (20 degrees 21.15'N, 118 degrees 22.56'E) have been used to trace characterize the climatic changes that occurred in the northern South China Sea (SCS) during the last glacial period. The ratio of low to high molecular-weight n-alkanes (L/H) and the concentration of n-alkanes indicated that organic matters in the sediments were derived from the mixture of both marine and terrestrial sources, but dominated by marine autochthonous input over the past 20 ka. Total n-alkanes were higher during the last glacial stage relative to the interglacial stage, implying the low sea level and the strengthened East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) during the glacial time. The delta C-13(alk) data indicated that the terrestrial plants on the adjacent continent of the present study area were dominated by C-3 plants during the Holocene and experienced the expansion of C-4 plants during the last glacial period. This similar result can be proved by the chain length parameter of n-alkanes (C-31/C-27, ACL) and the content of the herb pollen. In addition, n-alkanes distributions and C4 vegetation proportion calculated by delta C-13 of long-chain n-alkanes in the core STD235 recorded a short arid duration paralleled by the Heinrich event 1. Thereby we deduced that the occurrence of the dry event and the variation of regional vegetation community at the adjacent lands of the northern SCS were likely under the influence of the climate change emanated from the boreal high-latitudes.

AB The Z21 gas field is the only one gas field in the Huizhou depression. The distributions of sandstone and mudstone in the adjacent west zone control the extent of the Z21 gas field, making the confirmation of the reservoir connectivity between the west zone and main zone (RCWM) crucial. In this study, a practical workflow was proposed to confirm the RCWM. First, the sandstone and mudstone distributions were modeled by a sequential indicator simulation, using the vertical proportion curves as constraints. The porosity and permeability distributions were then predicted using a sequential Gaussian simulation based on sandstone and mudstone models. The sandstone, mudstone, and physical property models were treated as components of a geological embryonic model (GEM) prior to the RCWM confirmation. Different hypotheses on the RCWM of the GEMs were drawn, bringing variations to the GEMs and the GEMs turned to be different new models. These new models were then applied to numerical simulations, not only to perform quality checks, but also to attain the simulated formation pressure coefficients (Pfcs) and couple the study with the current formation pressure coefficients (Pfcc) derived from the modular formation dynamics tester (MDT). A hypothesis is negated if the Pfcs is not equal or approximately equal to the Pfcc. A coupled result was iteratively generated until the RCWM was confirmed. This coupling study on reservoir connectivity makes use of general geological reservoir models and highlights the ingenious designs based on different hypotheses of the RCWM to generate reliable results. Coupling study shows that distributions of formation pressure in the west zone of Z21 field are largely affected by a low-permeability belt and RCWM is proved weak due to the existence of the low-permeability belt.

AB Post-spreading intraplate volcanism has widely affected the South China Sea (SCS) region including Indochina, the northern margin of the SCS, and the SCS basin itself. In the SCS basin, several off- and on-fossil spreading center seamounts formed between 3.8 and 7.9 Ma. Based on previously published geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data, the intraplate volcanism is widely related to the Hainan mantle plume, whose existence has been evidenced by recent geophysical studies. To test this petrogenetic model, new Hf isotope data have been obtained from volcanic rocks from a suite of compositionally representative seamounts in the SCS basin. Compared to published Nd isotope ratios (0.512675-0.512965, 5 epsilon Nd units),Hf- 176/Hf-177 ratios span a much larger range (0.282876-0.283097, 8 epsilon Hf units), even within individual seamounts (e.g., Zhangzhong seamount). These features, combined with previous studies, clearly confirm mantle heterogeneity beneath the SCS region. Similar to the trends in Sr-Nd-Pb isotope space, Nd-Hf isotope ratio show a relatively narrow, elongate mixing trend between a depleted Indian MORB-type mantle endmember and an enriched EMI-type mantle end member. We propose that this narrow trend is inconsistent with the origin of the enriched end member from a heterogeneous sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) and instead suggests a plume-related origin. As a conceptual model for the post-spreading tectonic scenario of the Hainan plume affecting the SCS region, we propose that a plume ascends to the bottom of the lithosphere beneath Hainan and its northern Leizhou peninsula at the northern margin of SCS, from where it migrates along sloping rheologic boundary layers to lithospheric faults under an extensional setting towards the central SCS where the magmas erupt at the young spreading centers.

AB Throughout the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, the Nansha Block experienced stretching and extension and moved southwards away from the South China continent. As an exotic micro-continent, the Nansha Block has markedly different lithospheric rheological properties from its surrounding regions. The temperature represents one of the key parameters controlling the dynamics and rheological behaviors of the lithosphere and mantle. Therefore, we calculated the 3D temperature field of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Nansha Block using two methods, namely, solving the heat conduction equation and inverting the S-wave velocity structure. The results show that the ratio of the crustal heat flow to the seafloor heat flow is greater than 50% in the central Nansha Block. The crustal temperatures in the Nansha Block are low. The temperature at the Moho discontinuity is approximately equal to the Curie temperature (523 degrees C). The temperatures of the shallow mantle (50 km) beneath the Nansha Block (800 degrees C) are lower than those of the surrounding areas. However, the cool mantle below the Nansha Block gradually transitions into a warm mantle with increasing depth. At a depth of 150 Km, the mantle temperatures beneath the Nansha Block (1600 degrees C) are higher than those of the surrounding areas. The bottom boundary of the "thermal" lithosphere beneath the Nansha Block is at approximately 100 km, which is deeper than that in the surrounding areas. This result is different from the bottom boundary of the "seismic" lithosphere at a depth of 80 km under the Nansha Block, which is similar to that in the surrounding areas. The low lithospheric temperatures beneath the Nansha Block imply that the lithosphere of the Nansha Block experienced a rapid cooling process.

AB The South China Sea (SCS) is an important moisture and heat source in the Asian monsoon system, and its environmental changes influence economic and social stability in Southeast Asia and East Asian. Previous records on sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) were mostly from one sediment core, and/or only showed fragmentary information. It is hard to provide insights into the mechanisms of the overall paleoceanographical environmental variability in the northern SCS. In this study, paired delta O-18 and Mg/Ca records of planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from Core S0204B nearby the Luzon Strait (21 degrees 13.818'N, 118 degrees 3.077', water depth 1822 m), and Core GHE 27L (19.85 degrees N, 115.34 degrees E, water depth of 1533 m) in the central northern SCS, were analyzed, so as to better understand the physical process of the SST and SSS changes in the northern SCS and its relationship with the tropical Pacific. The results demonstrate that the SST is relatively stable and seawater delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) values, a salinity proxy, shows a decrease trend since 7.0 ka BP in Core S02048. By contrast, SST and delta O-18(sw) in Core GHE 27L exhibit an overall increasing trend at the same time, indicating apparent regional discrepancy on the changing trend of the SST and SSS in the northern SCS. We suggest that the thermal and hydrographic conditions in Core S0204B were primarily influenced by the outer western Pacific water. However, the thermal and hydrographic conditions in Core GHE 27L may be predominantly controlled by the weakened Asian monsoon during the mid-late Holocene, which was induced by the southern migration of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and stronger EI Nino Southern Oscillation.

AB This study presents two long-cable, deep-penetration, multi-channel seismic reflection images and associated gravity modeling to delineate structures and magmatic features that occur along the margins of the eastern and western Dongsha Rise in the northeast South China Sea (SCS). These data show approximately symmetrical sags imaged on the shelf, but the structures begin to vary in multiple ways along the eastern and western Dongsha Rise after crossing the continental shelf. At the slope break, an anticline with two thrust faults and a Mesozoic unconformity are imaged on the eastern Dongsha Rise, whereas negative flower structures are detected on the western Dongsha Rise. Most large-scale normal faults sole into a mid- or lower-crustal detachment below the lower slope on the eastern Dongsha Rise whereas some uplifts with small fault offsets were imaged at the lower slope and seaward-dipping tilted fault blocks were imaged between the lower slope and oceanic basin on the western Dongsha Rise. Magmatism, expressed by different types, such as intrusions, volcanoes and sills, was active since at least 5.5 Ma; and magmatic deposits appear to be well-developed on the eastern Dongsha Rise of the northeastern SCS margin.
   Gravity modeling showed that the crust below the lower slope/oceanic basin in the eastern Dongsha Rise is hyper-extended continental crust underplated by a high velocity layer with a maximum thickness of 9.4 km below the slope break, rather than thickened oceanic crust. The continent-ocean transition zone (COT) has a broader extent on the eastern Dongsha Rise compared to the western Dongsha Rise. Pure-shear deformation and lower crustal flow have led to the formation of the crustal structural contrasts and the wide northeastern continental margin of the SCS.

AB The Qiongdongnan Basin (QB) is an important prospecting area for gas hydrates in the South China Sea (SCS). However, it is difficult to infer gas hydrates using a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) under the influence of flat seabed, multiples and bubble effects. In the QB, the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and the distribution of gas hydrates in the shallow seabed are still not well understood. A marine controlled-source electromagnetic (MCSEM) survey was completed in order to collect electric resistivity information along a 4.5-km profile. Electromagnetic data were acquired and processed at nine sites. The seafloor receiver orientations were evaluated using the orthogonal procrust rotation analysis (OPRA) method. As a result of isotropic, vertical transverse-isotropic (VTI), and triaxial anisotropic inversion of electric field Pmax data, a 2-D resistivity image of the seabed was presented. Preliminary results show that the shallow seabed can be divided into four electric layers. According to thermodynamic conditions in the QB, the estimated thickness of GHSZ is approximately 320 m for biogenic methane and 272 m for thermogenic gas in the study area. The BSR and hydrates were interpreted by integrating the resistivity model along with thermodynamic calculation and seismic reflection data. The MCSEM result indicates there are abundant natural gas originating or partly originating from a microbial source beneath the GHSZ.

AB Sediment grain size is an important proxy to detect sedimentary process and record paleoenvironmental variations in continental slopes. Grain size measurements were performed for 298 samples of the 5.96-m-long core PC338 spanning the past 36 kyr recovered from the northern South China Sea (SCS). Results show that sea level and climatic influences on grain size distributions are crucial. A turbidite formed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is ascribed to the favorable topography close to the Red River estuary induced by the low sea level. Four end-member (EM) components for the normal sediment layers were unmixed using a lognormal parametric end member modeling (EMM). With the sea level decreasing, more EM4 ( similar to 15-100 mu m) and less EM1 ( similar to 0-2 mu m) supplied the SCS slope. Because EM2 ( similar to 2-10 mu m) consisted of fluvial suspension is dominated by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation, it has the potential to substitute for the EASM intensity. EM2 varied in-phase with many south China paleoclimate records and the 30 degrees N July insolation over the past 36 kyr, and cooling climate events (including the LGM, Heinrich events H1 and H3, Younger Dryas, 8.2 ka and 10.3 ka) lowered the EM2 content. Our results further confirm the synchronous EASM evolution in the South China continent mainly forced by the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.

AB In this study, an ionospheric logTEC model has been constructed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition method. The main orders (1-9 orders) of this EOF model represent the ionospheric background, while the rest high orders represent ionospheric TEC perturbations. Based on this model, logTEC data during 16 Ms >= 8.0 earthquakes from 2000 to 2012 have been analyzed. We found that ionospheric disturbances occurred in 10 earthquakes. Ionospheric abnormities were clearly observed 5 days before the earthquakes, but ionospheric disturbances can also be seen 1 day before, and 1 day and 2 days after the earthquakes. For the TEC data, the possibility of positive (enhanced TEC) and negative (decreased TEC) abnormities is almost the same. Furthermore, by using the simulation results of ionospheric electric field and SAMI2 model, we show that an abnormal westward electric field can lead to electron density enhancements equatorward and decrease polarward of the epicenters, and vice versa for an eastward abnormal electric field.

AB Few studies have been conducted on the activity of the Mengzi fault system, which is located to the southeast of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. The Mengzi fault is distributed along the eastern margin of the Mengzi basin. However, little is known about the location, length, and activity of the fault or the occurrence of paleo-earth-quakes during the late Quaternary. This paper studies the geometric distribution and activity of the fault via remote sensing imagery interpretation, fault outcrops in the area, faulted landforms and chronological analyses. The results show that the Mengzi fault extends from Nandong (Kaiyuan basin) in the north through the eastern margin of the Mengzi basin to Pingbian in the southeast, eventually intersecting with the Honghe fault. The Mengzi fault is approximately 250 km long and is characterized as a reverse strike-slip fault. We survey and calculate the offset gullies and terraces dislocated by the fault; combined with sample dating, we calculate the horizontal slip rate of the fault since 30 ka BP to be 0.91-1.56 mm/a. Three paleo-events since 30-40 ka BP are observed with a 10-ka major earthquake recurrence period. We analyze the relationships among the Mengzi fault, southern Xiaojiang fault, and Qujiang-Jianshui fault and note a slip rate loss of >= 8 mm/a from the southern Xiaojiang fault that was absorbed by reverse dextral strike-slip faulting and lateral shortening of the Qujiang-Jianshui fault and the Mengzi fault. The Mengzi fault plays an important role in the adjustment of the large slip rate reduction along the southern Xiaojiang fault. Moreover, the Mengzi fault has a similar tectonic position to the seismogenic faults of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, 2013 Lushan earthquake and 2014 Ludian earthquake, and the Mengzi fault and southern Xiaojiang fault both accumulate the energy generated by the southeastward movement of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. Studies on the Mengzi fault are helpful for renewing our understanding of the tectonic patterns of the southeastern Sichuan-Yunnan block and delimiting the boundary of the southeastern block margin. Furthermore, because the cities of Mengzi and Kaiyuan are located along the Mengzi fault, this study has practical significance for earthquake disaster mitigation.

AB The frequent occurrence of catastrophic landslides caused by excavation in a loess slope is one of the commonly encountered engineering problems in the Loess Plateau. Middle Pleistocene loess slopes were selected as a case study for current research. The distribution of excavation-induced loess landslides was studied by field investigation. On the basis of centrifuge model tests, the deformation features and failure mechanism of a homogeneous loess slope and a double paleosol-interlayer loess slope under different excavation slope angles were analyzed and compared. It was shown that the response of horizontal earth pressures in the lateral region of the excavation zone has a close relationship with the failure of the slope. Displacement measurements showed that the deformation stages of loess slopes due to excavation are independent of the paleosol interlayer. The excavation slope inclinations and soil properties significantly affected the failure process and division of the slope. The characteristics, that excavation-induced loess landslides always occur in hysteresis and abruptness, were interpreted by the analysis of the failure process. The influence of blade penetration during the excavation performed was quantitatively estimated. Finally, based on the result of stress path tests, an improved unloading constitutive model was proposed to simulate the deformation of soils in the lateral and bottom of the excavation area.

AB In the Heifangtai terrace, NW China, flooding irrigation is common for the cropland production and has increased the groundwater table by 20-30 m over the past five decades. It is believed that excessive irrigation has induced a large number of loess landslides in this area. However, these loess landslides responses to hydrological changes have still not been well understood. Therefore, 43 boreholes and 51 2D Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles with a total length of 40 km have been investigated to analyze the hydrological characteristics for the whole terrace and characterize the effects of hydrological changes on the occurrence of different types of loess landslides. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Three groundwater domes are found in the center and eastern part of the Heitai terrace and the groundwater table is gradually rising in the whole terrace based on the ERT results. (2) The rising rate of groundwater table at the center of the terrace is twice greater than that at the margin of the terrace and it takes approximately 4 months for irrigation water to penetrate from the top surface to the saturated layer. (3) Landslide deposits could block drainage channels of groundwater, increase the localized hydraulic gradient and result in rising of local groundwater table at the edge of the terrace. (4) The resultant hydraulic gradient impels the groundwater from the center to seep out on the eastern and southern margins and new landslides are prone to occur in the main scarp of landslides with rising groundwater table. The type and magnitude of landslides are affected by groundwater seepage and movement. In order to fundamentally control the occurrence of landslides, effective drainage system and the restrained amount of irrigation water are needed.

AB In the Boyali area (northern Anatolia), a thick succession of the Early Maastrichtian - Middle Paleocene Tarakli Flysch crops out. The Tarakh Flysch represents a foredeep sediment deposited during the final stage of collision between the Sakarya and Istanbul-Zonguldak continental margins, that developed as a consequence of the closure of the Intrapontide oceanic basin.
   The top of the Tarakli Flysch is characterized by a level of slide-block in shaly-matrix lithofacies that can be considered as the result of several fast catastrophic events predating the closure of the basin and its deformation. This level consists of slide-blocks surrounded by monomict pebbly-mudstones and pebbly-sandstones. Among the slide-blocks, the biggest one consists of quartz-monzonites and leucocratic granodiorites of Late Permian age (260.8 +/- 2.2 Ma) dated by zircon LA-ICP-MS method. By comparison with the regional data, the source area of these granitoids can be identified in the Istanbul-Zonguldak terrane. This evidence suggests a new picture for the paleogeographic setting of the ultimate stage of the continental collision between the Istanbul-Zonguldak and the Sakarya continental margins. In this scenario the coarse-grained deposits of the Tarakh Flysch are supplied by an orogenic wedge, consisting of oceanic units topped by the Istanbul-Zonguldak terrane. This orogenic wedge represented the north side of the foredeep, while the southern one was represented by the still undeformed Sakarya continental margin.

TI Magma origins and geodynamic implications for the Makran-Chagai arc from

AB Bazman is an isolated voluminous (3497 m elevation; > 300 km(2)) composite volcano that is located within the western segment of the Makran-Chagai arc. This arc obliquely tracks the modern EW-trending trench offshore the Oman sea coast of Iran and Pakistan, with several Quaternary stratovolcanoes (Bazman and Taftan in SE Iran, and Kuh-i-Sultan in western Pakistan) superimposed on a preexisting Neogene arc. High spatial resolution and high sensitivity U-Pb geochronology using Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) yielded four clusters of zircon ages for Bazman volcanic rocks which range from ca. 8.6 Ma to 41 ka. Lava and pyroclastic materials erupted between 8.6 and 5.9 Ma forming a thick Neogene volcanic succession (Ngv). These deposits were intruded by hypabyssal andesite-dacite domes at ca. 4.1 Ma. The next younger group of the Quaternary Bazman center comprises several eruptive pulses at 1.37 Ma, 1.13 Ma, 0.943 Ma, 0.853 Ma and 0.635 Ma, which constructed the main edifice around a central vent through alternating eruptions of lava and pyroclastic rocks (Qtv and Qa2). Subsequently, ignimbrite flows also sourced from the main vent erupted at 0.59 and 0.47 Ma, and covered the earlier erupted deposits. The youngest dated eruptive phase (Qa3) comprises the emplacement of dacitic to andesitic lava around the top of volcano. Based on Uranium-series (U-238-Th-230) disequilibrium in Qa3 zircons, model ages of ca. 41 ka define a maximum eruption age of these lavas, which tapped a long-lived magma reservoir with zircon crystallization ages predating eruption by 10's to 100's of ka. Low- medium-K calc-alkaline basaltic-andesitic eruptions formed parasitic cones located on northeastern flanks of the edifice as the youngest unit (Qa4) of Bazman. Both Neogene and Quaternary rocks from Bazman volcano exhibit homogeneous trace element characteristics, including enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE) relative to the high field strength elements (HFSE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE), respectively. High Th/Yb and negative anomalies of Ta, Nb and Ti are consistent with an enriched mantle source in a continental subduction zone. Trace element modeling for the most primitive basalts erupted at Bazman suggests an origin of parental magmas through similar to 15% partial melting of an enriched spinell-lherzolite mantle, whereas the genesis of Bazman acidic volcanic rocks with SiO2 > 62% involves partial melting in the middle/lower continental crust which became subsequently overprinted through assimilation - fractional crystallization (AFC) processes. Compositional continuity of Quaternary Bazman volcanic rocks with their Neogene precursors implies a steady magma source above the subducted Oman slab. Consequently, subduction geometry in the Makran-Chagai arc has experienced little modification over the past few million years.

AB Late Cretaceous felsic plutons in the Eastern Pontides orogenic belt of Turkey are found in varying ages, sizes and compositions. The Late Cretaceous syenitic bodies, namely Direkli and Yenikoy Tepe plutons in the Ordu area, intruded into the Late Cretaceous volcanics and volcanoclastics, and compositionally consist of syenite and minor quartz-syenite with mainly granular and rarely porphyric, poikilitic and perthitic textures. The studied plutons contain K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, clinopyroxene, biotite and minor hornblende, and Fe-Ti oxide, apatite, and zircon. Mineral thermobarometer estimations imply that the syenitic plutons were crystallized in P-T conditions representing mid to shallow crustal levels. Petrochemically, these syenitic plutons show I-type, metaluminous-peraluminous transitional (A/CNK = 0.85-1.04) and shoshonitic features. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating on the syenitic plutons yielded weighted mean ages of 78.5-72 Ma. Primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns of the studied plutons are characterized by negative anomalies of Ba, Sr, Nb, Ta and Ti, and enrichment in Rb, Th, K, Ce and La. The chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) plots of the studied plutons show moderately enriched concave-shaped patterns (La-N/Lu-N = 10.3-10.7 for the Direkli pluton; La-N/Lu-N = 6.8-11.7 for the Yenikoy Tepe pluton) with negative Eu anomalies. The plutons have Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.705368-0.706954), Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios (0.512600-0.512672), Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios (19.29-19.52) and Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios (15.65-15.67). The geochemical data, as well as regional geology, suggest that the Late Cretaceous syenitic plutons have formed in an extensional continental arc setting triggered by slab roll-back. The parental magma of syenitic plutons was derived from melts of lower crustal materials (metabasalt/metaandesite) and lithospheric mantle component.

AB The modern kinematics in and around the Tibetan Plateau have been widely investigated; however, the deformation distribution pattern describing the crustal kinematics in this region is controversial. Here, we quantify the deformation distribution in the southern Tibetan Plateau by adopting the partitioning ratio of internal to boundary potency rates instead of the individual slip rate data on major faults used in previous studies. The study area was divided into several blocks by major faults based on geological surveys, seismic data and a significance statistical analysis. For each block, the partitioning ratio of the potency rates was calculated by a microplate model using 294 GPS velocities from 13 studies. The deformation distribution derived from the GPS velocities was validated by surface-wave data from 407 earthquake events. After excluding the potency rates from the boundary between the Tibetan Plateau and Indian Plate, the ratio of intrablock potency rates within the southern Tibetan Plateau was 51%. This suggests that the Tibetan deformation is diffusely distributed over a large range. A seismic data analysis indicated that 53% of the historical seismic moments were released in the modeled blocks since 1901, which supported the conclusion based on the GPS velocities. The F-test indicated that the internal strain in most Tibetan blocks cannot be neglected to fit the surface velocities. Thus, the present day crust in southern Tibet is probably far from a pure rigid block. This is supported by the relatively slow strike slip rates of two major faults: the Karakorum fault (5.9 +/- 0.8 mm yr(-1)) and Karakorum-Jiali fault (4.4 +/- 0.8 mm yr(-1) in the east segment, 9.3 +/- 0.8 mm yr(-1) in the west segment). The large-scale diffuse deformation in the southern Tibetan Plateau reproduced by the microplate model with significant internal strain, with seismic imaging or structural analyses, could further clarify the geodynamic processes in the India-Asia collision zone.

AB In this study, we manually pick a total of 9197 high-quality Pn arrival-time data from seismograms of 457 events recorded at 271 provincial seismic stations and 69 NECESSArray portable seismic stations in Northeast (NE) China. Using these Pn arrivals, having much better crosscrissing coverage of ray-paths in the uppermost mantle, we determine a new high-resolution anisotropic tomographic model. Our new model shows distinct lateral heterogeneities in both velocity and anisotropy, which are closely related to surface geology. Obvious high Pn velocities are imaged under the Songliao, Hailar, and Erlian stable basins. Prominent low Pn velocities are observed under the Changbaishan, Jingpohu, Longgang, Wudalianchi, and Datong volcanic areas as well as the Halaha and Abaga volcanic groups. Furthermore, some low Pn velocities are well connected or they are separated by high Pn velocities but connected by the fast directions of Pn propagation. These results suggest the existence of some correlations among these volcanoes in the present day or the traces preserved in the past tectonic evolution history. We propose a possible dynamic model that illustrates the material and energy exchange among the volcanoes, which could be caused by a complicated rather than simple E-W horizontal flow of mantle convection in the big mantle wedge due to the stagnancy and dehydration of the western Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of genesis of active volcanoes and complex mantle dynamics of NE China.

AB The Linxi area is located in the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), which is the largest accretionary orogen on Earth. However, it remains highly debatable about the mechanism for crustal growth through the tectonic evolution history, in particular after the closure of the paleo-Asian Ocean. Early Triassic post-collisional granitoids (241-249 Ma) from the Linxi area in Inner Mongolia, NE China are distributed along the Xar Moron fault and comprise mainly granodiorite and monzogranite. These felsic rocks show peraluminous (aluminum index, A/CNK = 1.10-1.18, A/CNK = Al2O3 /(CaO + Na2O + K2O) in molar ratio) and magnesian affinities, and are characterized by enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth element (LREEs) but depletion in Nb-Ta. They also have radiogenic Nd (whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) = + 1.7- + 3.3) and Hf (zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) = + 8.9- + 15.2) and mantle-like O isotopic compositions (zircon delta O-18 = 5.4-6.8 parts per thousand). Compared with their Paleozoic and Cretaceous counterparts, the early Triassic granitoids have higher values of whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t), which requires a significant contribution of juvenile crustal components during their genesis. The combined results indicate that the early Triassic granitoids originated from melting of a mixed source consisting predominantly of mafic crust with minor pelagic sediment. These crustal components represent a lithologic assemblage typically observed in relict oceanic crust. The compositional similarities between the early Triassic igneous rocks and bulk continental crust, together with their spatial distribution along the Solonker-Xar Moron-Changchun suture, suggest that melting of relict oceanic crust may have been an important mechanism for Mesozoic crustal growth after continental collision.

AB The Paleocene-Eocene lignite sequences of Western India occur in the Bikaner-Nagaur (Barsingsar, Gurha and Kasnau-Matasukh lignite seams) and Barmer (Kapurdi and Giral lignite seams) basins of Rajasthan, whereas those in the Cambay (Vastan, Rajpardi and Tadkeshwar lignite seams), Saurashtra (Bhavnagar upper and lower lignite seams), and Kachchh (Matanomadh and Panandhro lignite seams) basins are located in Gujarat. The position of the Cambay basin (Gujarat), being closer to the equator during the Early Eocene period, makes it pertinent to understand the variations in petrographic and geochemical constituents of Gujarat and Rajasthan lignites in space and time. Floral growth, which largely depends on the climate of the region and its geographical location, has an important role in the formation of mire. Nevertheless, the peat forming plant communities, nutrient supply, bacterial activity, types of deposition, temperature, pH and redox potential impart various characteristics to coal and are reflected in macerals.
   Black bands, in Gujarat and Rajasthan lignites, are strongly gelified compared to brownish bands and are stratified in nature. They are dominantly composed of huminite maceral group, while liptinites and inertinites occur in subordinated amount. These lignites of Gujarat and Rajasthan have high values of gelification index (GI) and low tissue preservation index (TPI), indicating thereby a continuous presence of wet condition in the basin and slow subsidence rate. However, due to fluctuating water level in the basins, few sections experienced relatively oxic episodes indicated by relatively high inertinite content. Study of the ground water index (GWI) and vegetation index (VI) of these lignites indicates rheotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological condition. The study revealed that the lignites of Rajasthan and Gujarat were formed during the transgressive phase under coastal marshy setting. However, there were intermittent episodes of fluvial activities which gave rise to supratidal flood plains.

TI Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the East China Sea Shelf Basin and its

AB The East China Sea Shelf Basin is one of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic basins located in the edge of eastern China continent whose formation and evolution are closely related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate. However, the underlying correlations between the tectonic evolution of the East China Sea Shelf Basin and the Pacific Plate subduction (65 Ma to present) remain poorly understood. In this paper, the basin is divided into western and eastern depression groups to further study its tectonic evolution. In combination with the characteristics of Pacific Plate subduction, this paper performs a coupling analysis of the basin evolution regarding its migration direction and evolution rate. The results of balanced section and deformation rate analyses reveal that the East China Sea Shelf Basin experienced different regional activities during the Cenozoic, which could be summarized as four geologic periods and three tectonic evolution stages. In this interpretation, it is recognized that tectonic activity occurred in the western depression group and then shifted to depocenters of the eastern group. In contrast, the Pacific Plate subducted westwards beneath the Eurasian Plate over the same geologic time span. Surprisingly, a slightly negative correlation between the intensity of the tectonic deformation of the East China Sea Shelf Basin and the subduction rate of the Pacific Plate is demonstrated when the subduction rate is no more than 75 mm/a. However, the basin deformation intensity increases with the plate subduction rate after 75 mm/a. The results of this work have implications for explaining the major role that the subduction of the Pacific Plate played in the formation and evolution of the eastern China basins.

AB Geochronology of zircons from river-sediments in Sri Lanka has never been attempted. Here we present Rare Earth Elements (REE) and U-Pb isotopes of -700 zircon grains by laser ablation ICP-MS technique, from sediments of the major rivers in the Sri Lankan basement (rivers of Mahaweli, Kelani, Kalu, Walawe, Maduru Oya and Maha Oya). Most of the studied zircons display oscillatory zoning and Th/U > 0.1, confirming their igneous origin. U-Pb age distribution of these river-sand zircons exhibits two major populations depicting Mesoproterozoic to Archean ( similar to 30%; > 1100-3100 Ma) and Neoproterozoic to late Cambrian ( similar to 70%; > 430-1000 Ma) magmatism. The two populations could be further resolved into intensive and episodic magmatic peaks at 480-680 Ma, 680-1000 Ma, 1100-1300 Ma, 1300-1700 Ma, 1700-1900 Ma, 2100-2300 Ma, 2300-2600 Ma and 2600-3100 Ma. These river-sediment-zircon data are consistent with the principal episodes of global continental crustal growth and the recognized U-Pb ages of magmatism are mostly correlative with those obtained from basement rocks by previous studies of Sri Lanka. The older zircons found in this study may have mainly originated from reworked/recycled ancient (Palaoproterozoic to Archean) crust. A younger zircon group of 450-700 Ma with homogenous core-rim zoning texture and Th/U ratios < 0.1 were inferred to be of metamorphic origin, indicating their possible crystallization at late Neoproterozoic metamorphic events, associated with the final assembly of the Gondwana Supercontinent. Thus, our data imply that the present-day continental crust of Sri Lanka may have predominantly formed and grown in the Neoproterozoic, while there is evidence that crustal growth began at least in the Paleoproterozoic. Further, the Mesoproterozoic peaks of the frequency distribution of U-Pb ages of river-sand zircons at similar to 1.6 Ga and similar to 1.1 Ga might reflect triggering of subduction in a paleo tectonic setting forming the Wanni and Vijayan dual arc systems, respectively.

AB Rationale: The Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire (SHQ) is the first sarcoidosis-specific health status questionnaire ever developed. Worse health status, as evaluated by the SHQ, may indicate higher risk for deterioration in the following 5 years.
   Objectives: To evaluate the association between SHQ scores and deterioration defined clinically at 5-year follow-up.
   Methods: 122 patients with biopsy-supported sarcoidosis completed the SHQ and underwent evaluation with respect to organ involvement, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, serum biomarker measurements, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram. Of these 122, 88 (72.1%) were available for pulmonary, cardiac, and nonpulmonary, non-cardiac deterioration assessment during the following 5 years.
   Measurements and main results: Five-year deterioration was observed in 20 patients (23%). The SHQ total score was significantly associated with 5-year deterioration, after adjusting for cardiac involvement at baseline, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 (95% confidence interval 95% CI], 0.29-0.99). The association of the total SHQ with 5-year outcome was not significant when adjusted for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline (adjusted OR, 0.61 0.32-1.16]), whereas LVEF was significantly associated with 5-year outcome (adjusted OR, 0.92 0.86-0.99]). The association between total SHQ score and 5-year deterioration was marginal when adjusted for baseline usage of systemic corticosteroid (CS)/immunosuppressive (IS) agents (adjusted OR, 0.58 0.31-1.10]), whereas systemic CS/IS usage significantly predicted 5-year deterioration (adjusted odds ratio OR], 3.46 1.12-10.7]). There was a marginal correlation between the total SHQ and LVEF (rho=0.19, p=0.07) and a weak association between the total SHQ and systemic CS/IS usage (rho=-0.23, p=0.03). The Physical Functioning domain scores of the SHQ were significantly associated with 5-year deterioration (adjusted OR, 0.45-0.51).
   Conclusions: Worse health status, as assessed by the SHQ score, can be a risk factor for 5-year deterioration of sarcoidosis, although usage of the CS/IS at baseline and lower LVEF at baseline are more predictive of 5-year deterioration.

AB Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is an autosomal dominant dysplasia of the ectoderm and mesoderm with a variable clinical expression, but near-complete penetrance before the age of 5 years. The estimated incidence is 1 in 3000 births. NF-1 is characterized by collections of neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, and pigmented hamartomas in the iris (Lisch nodules). Pulmonary manifestations of NF-1, which usually include bilateral basal reticulations and apical bullae and cysts, are reported in 10-20% of adult patients. Clinically, neurofibromatosis-associated diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD) usually presents with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, and chronic cough or chest pain, at the time of diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) is highly accurate for the identification and characterization of NF-DLD; it is the most reliable method for the diagnosis of this lung involvement. Various CT findings of NF-DLD, including cysts, bullae, ground-glass opacities, bibasilar reticular opacities, and emphysema, have been described in patients with NF-1. The typical CT pattern, however, is characterized by upper-lobe cystic and bullous disease, and basilar interstitial lung disease. Currently, the goal of NF-DLD treatment is the earliest possible diagnosis, focusing on symptom relief and interventions that positively alter the course of the disease, such as smoking cessation. The aim of this review is to describe the main clinical, pathological, and imaging aspects of NF-1, with a focus on pulmonary involvement.

AB Introduction: Several drugs have been associated with druginduced sarcoidosis-like reactions (DISRs) that are clinically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to CD25 that has been studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). During MS clinical trials of daclizumab, 12 subjects developed clinical conditions potentially consistent with sarcoidosis. Therefore, an independent adjudication committee of individuals with expertise in sarcoidosis was organized to determine the likelihood of these cases representing sarcoidosis.
   Methods: The adjudication committee consisted of a pulmonologist, pathologist, and radiologist with clinical experience in sarcoidosis. The committee had access to the subjects' laboratory data, narratives of all suspect adverse reaction reports, radiographic imaging and histology from biopsies. A priori, a grading system was developed to determine criteria to establish the likelihood that the patient had developed sarcoidosis.
   Results: The adjudication confirmed sarcoidosis in 11/12 subjects. The committee's decisions were unanimous in all cases. Biopsies were available in 7/11 of these. In the 4 subjects who did not have a biopsy, they all had presentations, clinical findings, and/or laboratory findings that were highly specific for sarcoidosis. Alternative causes for these clinical findings were reasonably excluded in all cases. The lung (8/11) and skin (6/11) were the most common organs involved. The mean daclizumab dose given when signs or symptoms of sarcoidosis occurred was 5413 +/- 2704 mg and the median time from first daclizumab dose was 996 days. The incidence rate of developing sarcoidosis in those participating in these daclizumab trials was 154/100,000 patient-years compared with incidence rates of sarcoidosis in the United States of 3.2-17.8/100,000/year. These data suggest that these sarcoidosis cases may have represented DISRs related to daclizumab therapy.
   Conclusions: Given the clinical presentation and subsequent evaluation of these 11 subjects, we suspect that they had DISRs from daclizumab.

TI Sarcoidosis deaths in the United States: 1999-2016
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Pulmonary; Mortality; Epidemiology; Disease burden; Sarcoidosis
ID MORTALITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: It has been over a decade since a comprehensive study has been published that has examined sarcoidosis deaths at the national level. The purpose of this study was to analyze sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of death using current national death certificate data. Results from this project can be used to evaluate and compare trends of sarcoidosis reported deaths across the U.S.
   Methods: Mortality data from 1999 to 2016 were provided by the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) with sarcoidosis (ICD-D86.X) as the underlying cause of death from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). Data were analyzed using CDC WONDER, a web-based public health database and analysis tool. Queries were used to generate number of deaths, along with unadjusted and age-adjusted death rates with 95% confidence intervals and standard errors for groups including year, census region, gender, age group, race/ethnicity and state. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to test the significance of trends in race and gender-specific rates for the 1999-2016 study period.
   Results: From 1999 to 2016, there were a total of 16,665 sarcoidosis reported deaths in the U.S. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate increased from 2.1 (deaths per 1,000,000) in 1999 to 3.1 in 2002, but then remained relatively stable thereafter until the end of the study period. Female deaths increased 32.0% (from 2.5 to 3.3 per 1,000,000), while male deaths increased 73.3% (from 1.5 to 2.6 deaths per 1,000,000). The highest age-adjusted death rates were among black females (17.0 deaths per 1,000,000), and black males (12.4 deaths per 1,000,000). At the regional level, the southern U.S. had the highest overall mean age-adjusted mortality rate (3.7 deaths per 1,000,000), while black females in the Midwest (18.7 per 1,000,000) had the highest race-specific reported death rate.
   Discussion: The detected increase in the total number of deaths and age-adjusted rates of sarcoidosis deaths in the U.S. is a serious health concern. Factors that contribute to sarcoidosis deaths remain uncertain and more epidemiological research studies are needed to compliment current bench science to explore and examine factors that contribute to this multifactorial, chronic disease.

AB Introduction: Although the presence of familial sarcoidosis has been confirmed, clinical and epidemiological data on its characteristics are scattered and sometimes paradoxical. The objective of this review is to assess what is known on the clinical epidemiology of familial sarcoidosis, by combining data from early case reports with recent population based data; aiming to support in clinical decision making and providing information to patients.
   Method: A systematic review of the literature in PubMed was done and 27 studies with clinical or epidemiological data on familial sarcoidosis, published between 1947 and 2017, were included.
   Results: The pooled prevalence proportion of familial sarcoidosis, based on twelve study populations, was 9.5% (CI 4.6-16.1), highest in French, African American, Dutch and Irish patients. A heritability of 60-70% was estimated in diverse studies. Relative types and relationships most often reported in familial sarcoidosis were siblings and mother-child relationships. Familial risk is heterogeneous. In African Americans specific environmental factors have been associated with familial sarcoidosis (OR between 1.5 and 3.2). European American and African American subjects had different relative risks for first degree familial relationships (OR of 16.6 vs 3.1) and relative risk differed between relative types. Clinical findings in familial sarcoidosis are still obscure.
   Conclusions: Prevalence of familial sarcoidosis is high in specific study populations from countries worldwide. The estimated heritability of 60-70%, suggests a shared determinant, and the heterogeneous familial risk, associated with both genetic and environmental factors. Familial relative risks and clinical phenotypes may differ between ethnic groups and relative types, but require further study.

AB Background: Adherence rates among asthma patients are generally low and decrease during adolescence, resulting in poorly controlled asthma. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ADolescent Adherence Patient Tool (ADAPT), an interactive mobile health (mHealth) intervention, in supporting self-management and improving inhaled corticosteroid adherence in adolescents with asthma.
   Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 66 Dutch community pharmacies. Asthma patients aged 12-18 years were invited to participate, based on pharmacy medication refill records. The main study outcome was self-reported medication adherence, measured with the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Secondary outcomes were asthma control and quality of life. Outcomes were measured at start (t=0 months) and at the end of follow-up (t=6 months). Mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effect.
   Results: In total, 234 adolescents (147 in the control group and 87 in the intervention group) completed the study; mean age 15.1 +/- 1.9 years and 52.6% females. Adherence rates of patients with low baseline adherence (MARS scores <= 19; n=76) increased with 1.42 points in the intervention group (n=26). Adherence rates of patients in the control group (n=50) decreased with 0.70 points. Thus there was a positive effect of the intervention on medication adherence (MARS +2.12, p=0.04). This effect was stronger (MARS +2.52, p=0.02) in poor adherent adolescents with uncontrolled asthma (n=74). No effect of the intervention was observed on asthma control or quality of life.
   Conclusions: The ADAPT intervention increases medication adherence in adolescents with asthma having poor adherence rates at baseline. Healthcare providers should consider a tailored mHealth approach to improve the asthma treatment.

AB Rationale: Characteristics associated with adherence to long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in COPD remain unclear.
   Objectives: To identify patient characteristics at the time of oxygen initiation associated with its adherence.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 359 COPD participants assigned to oxygen in the Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. Participants were prescribed continuous (n=214) or intermittent (n=145) oxygen based on desaturation patterns at study entry. At the time of initial prescription, participants rated their perceived readiness, confidence, and importance to use oxygen on a 0-10 scale (0=not at all, 10=very much). During follow-up, they self-reported average hours per day of use (adherence). Adherence was averaged over short-term (0-30 days), medium-term (months 9-12), and long-term (month 13 to last follow-up) intervals. Multivariable logistic regression models explored characteristics associated with high adherence (>= 16 h/day [continuous] or >= 8 h/day [intermittent]) during each time interval.
   Results: Participant readiness, confidence, and importance at the time of oxygen initiation were associated with high short- and medium-term adherence. For each unit increase in baseline readiness, the odds of high short-term adherence increased by 21% (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.40) and 94% (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.45-2.59) in the continuous and intermittent groups, respectively. In both groups, high adherence in the medium-term was associated with high adherence in the long-term (continuous, OR 12.49, 95% CI 4.90-31.79; intermittent, OR 38.08, 95% CI 6.96-208.20).
   Conclusions: Readiness, confidence, and importance to use LTOT at initiation, and early high adherence, are significantly associated with long-term oxygen adherence.

AB Background: Asthma is an important public health issue in the United States. eHealth technology offers a potential solution to asthma treatment adherence, but the relative effect of various types of eHealth interventions has not been systematically studied.
   Objectives: To systematically review the effectiveness of eHealth in improving adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) among patients with persistent asthma, as well as the satisfaction of patients undergoing eHealth interventions.
   Methods: Literature searches were conducted in five databases in August 2018. Included studies were randomized controlled trials comparing eHealth interventions versus usual care in improving adherence among patients prescribed ICS for persistent asthma. Quantitative synthesis was performed using a random effects model.
   Results: Eighty records were identified after removal of duplicates. Fifteen trials were eligible for qualitative synthesis. Included trials utilized: social media (n=1), electronic health records (n=1), telehealth (n=6), and mHealth (n=7). Twelve trials were eligible for quantitative synthesis. Results show a small but significant overall effect of eHealth interventions on adherence to ICS (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=0.41, 95% CI=0.02-0.79). Among the different types of eHealth interventions, a significant improvement in adherence was observed for mHealth interventions compared to usual care in a pooled analysis of 4 trials (SMD=0.96, 95% CI=0.28-1.64). However, there was considerable heterogeneity among studies. Patient satisfaction was evaluated in 5 trials comparing telehealth (n=2) and mHealth (n=3) with usual care. Participants found the interventions to be helpful and satisfactory.
   Conclusion: eHealth interventions, especially mHealth interventions, are effective and acceptable in improving patient adherence to ICS.

AB Complex hydrological processes affect valuable water resources in inland regions across arid central Asia. Historically, this was a critical part of the Silk Road, and it is now named the modern Silk Road Economic Belt. Using the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor in China as a case-study of the inland region, we collected a total of 2311 water samples from the area and performed a comprehensive investigation of the water cycle. Results from stable isotope tracing indicate clear spatial patterns. In the upstream mountainous regions, glacier snow meltwater becomes groundwater at the periglacial belt. Supra-permafrost water develops into river runoff in the permafrost region. There are also frequent exchanges between groundwater and river runoff along the vegetation belt. In the middle/downstream region, river runoff becomes groundwater. Throughout these processes, both river runoff and groundwater are consumed by evapotranspiration, are recycled, and make a substantial contribution to precipitation. Overall, the upstream mountainous region is a critical part of the water resources. The cryosphere belt accounts for 44% of the mountainous region but contributes to about 80% of water resources. Recycling of moisture also plays an important role. During the summer months (May to September) moisture recycling accounted for 24% and 14% of precipitation in upstream and middle/downstream regions, respectively. The findings from the stable isotope tracing provide insights into hydrological processes and can help improve water management in inland regions of Central Asia.

TI Predictive performance of NMME seasonal forecasts of global

ID SYSTEM; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; SKILL; ENSO
AB Global climate models (GCMs) produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of the occurrence for hydrological forecasting. Meanwhile, the skill of GCM forecasts varies by location and initialization time. In this paper, we investigate the anomaly correlation, which indicates the correspondence between forecasts and observations, for 10 sets of global precipitation forecasts in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project. We propose to use principal component analysis to characterize the variation of anomaly correlation. We identify the existence of spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale. The spatial pattern reveals that high (low) anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high (low) anomaly correlation at other initialization times. In other words, for a grid cell, the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be similarly high, or low. It is observed that some of the regions where grid cells are with overall high anomaly correlation tend to exhibit tele-connections with global climate drivers. On the other hand, the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time. This pattern is attributable to data assimilation that bases forecasts at a later initialization time on more global observations and simulations. Generally, the two patterns are effective and explain 50% to 70% of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of NMME forecasts. The projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where and when the NMME precipitation forecasts are skillful.

AB The accurate determination of land surface water fluxes at various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge in hydrological sciences. It is intuitive that land surface net water flux (i.e., infiltration minus evapotranspiration) directly affects near-surface soil moisture. However, there exists no hydrological model suitable to calculate net water flux based on measured near-surface soil moisture data. This is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing models that use 'boundary conditions' to determine 'internal conditions', whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near-surface soil moisture data (an internal condition) to determine the surface water flux (a boundary condition). To pursue the idea of utilizing remotely-sensed or in situ (i.e., sensor networks) near surface soil moisture data for estimation of net water flux, we derived an analytical model via inversion of Warrick's 1975 analytical solution to the linearized Richards' equation for arbitrary time-varying surface flux boundary conditions. The applicability of the new analytical solution was evaluated based on actual water flux observations as well as HYDRUS-1D simulations for four vastly different sites in Arizona, California, Idaho, and Indiana. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model reasonably captures net water flux variations in natural settings, including layered and vegetated soils, especially at larger time scales (e.g., monthly). While the model works for a wide range of climatic conditions, the prediction accuracy is somewhat lower for extreme dry or wet conditions. A major advantage of the new model is that it does not require calibration, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for large scale estimation of land surface net water flux using remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture observations.

AB Joint monitoring of the variations of glaciers and lakes within a basin is essential for an accurate understanding of region-wide climate change and the water cycle process. The central Kunlun-KekeXili region is an ideal experimental field due to the wide distribution of glaciers and lakes. In this study, we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000-2015/16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high-resolution SPOT-6/7 stereo imagery and the SRTM DEM. The final results revealed an overall mass balance of - 0.16 +/- 0.05 m w.e./a. for the study region (with a total glacier area of 967 km(2)). Secondly, ICESat/GLAS altimetry data were used to quantify the water-level change of 2003-2008/09 for the two largest glacier-fed closed lakes (i.e., LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake) in this region. Based on this, we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water-level change for 2003-2008/09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area. We then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015. The results showed that the water storage of LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake increased by 1.82 +/- 0.14 km(3) and 1.90 +/- 0.38 km(3), respectively. For each lake basin, meanwhile, the glaciers lost - 0.18 +/- 0.03 km(3) and - 0.21 +/- 0.04 km(3) of water, accounting for 9.9% and 11.1% of the increase in lake water storage for LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake, respectively. Our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region, but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB The forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station, and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency. However, the forecasting error is inevitable, and it is influenced by the input, the structural parameters and many human factors, it is not only random, but also has great fuzziness. Therefore, it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station. In view of this, this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects. At the theoretical level, in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific, based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method, an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion, which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice. At the practical level, in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error, a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the Hamming closeness, Cauchy distribution, Normal distribution and Cusp Gamma distribution. Taking the Jinxi hydropower station of Yalong River basin as the research object, the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method. The results show that the optimized Cusp r distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution, and its average closeness can reach 0.979. So, the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized, which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation.

AB This study develops and evaluates a sensing system capable of measuring stemflow at high temporal resolutions. Leveraging affordable hobbyist grade electronics has allowed for the development of a system which is low-cost, easy to reproduce and adaptable. Eschewing classic stemflow measurement techniques, the system demonstrated herein utilizes a sensing payload which includes a wetness sensor and ultrasonic rangefinder. Combined, these sensors are capable of determining precise stemflow initiation and cessation times as well as capturing high temporal resolution stemflow volume measurements at 10 s intervals. A case study focusing on stemflow data collected by the sensing system from an isolated green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) during a May 2016 rainfall event in Kamloops, British Columbia is used to evaluate the performance of the sensing system, demonstrating the accuracy of the collected data and the potential research questions that can be addressed by large scale deployment of the sensor system.

AB Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) filled with zero-valent iron (ZVI) are a well-known remediation approach to treat groundwater plumes of chlorinated volatile organic compounds as well as other contaminants. In field implementations of ZVI-PRBs designed to treat these contaminants, nitrate consumption has been reported and has been attributed to direct abiotic nitrate reduction by ZVI or to denitrification by autochthonous microorganisms using the dissolved hydrogen produced from ZVI corrosion. Isotope tools have proven to be useful for monitoring the performance of nitrate remediation actions. In this study, we evaluate the use of isotope tools to assess the effect of ZVI-PRBs on the nitrate fate for the further optimization of full-scale applications. Laboratory batch experiments were performed using granular cast ZVI and synthetic nitrate solutions at pH 4-5.5 or nitrate-containing groundwater (pH = 7.0) from a field site where a ZVI-PRB was installed. The experimental results revealed nitrate attenuation and ammonium production for both types of experiments. In the field site, the chemical and isotopic data demonstrated the occurrence of ZVI-induced abiotic nitrate reduction and denitrification in wells located close to the ZVI-PRB. The isotopic characterization of the laboratory experiments allowed us to monitor the efficiency of the ZVI-PRB at removing nitrate. The results show the limited effect of the barrier (nitrate reduction of less than 15-20%), probably related to its non-optimal design. Isotope tools were therefore proven to be useful tools for determining the efficacy of nitrate removal by ZVI-PRBs at the field scale.

AB Surface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds. These connections are confined by topography and infrastructure, and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change, population growth, increasing energy and water demands. This study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections (i.e., stream flows, inter-basin water transfers, water withdrawals and return flows) among the 2099 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-8) watersheds across the conterminous United States. The framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress (the ratio of demand to supply). Our projections suggest that highly water-stressed areas may expand from 14% to 18% and the stressed population would increase from 19% to 24% by 2070-2099. Climate-change mitigation practices (e.g., energy structure reform, technology innovation) could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply, At the watershed scale, the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas. However, the detrimental future changes (e.g., depleting river discharges, larger demands of water withdrawal) may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system. This study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security, and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world.

AB The Lancang River (LR) in China (the upper portion of the Mekong River which is among the world's most important transboundary rivers) originates on the Tibetan Plateau and provides important freshwater resources for living, agriculture, industry, and hydropower generation for millions of people downstream. The natural flow regime of the LR is critical to sustain native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; however, it has been changing due to the combined effect of climate change and human activities. Accurate quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on changes in the flow regime is a prerequisite for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection. This study aims to evaluate climate- and human-induced impacts on the LR during 1980-2014. A distributed hydrological model CREST-snow combined with remote sensing and streamflow data and the Budyko framework were jointly used to address this scientific question during three time windows determined by the Mann-Kendall test and the history of dam construction. Results show that compared with the baseline period (1980-1986) when no dam was constructed, significant changes (similar to- 6%) in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987-2014, particularly after 2008 when the construction of the largest hydropower plant (Nuozhadu) in the Mekong River basin began. Climatic change contributed similar to 57% to streamflow changes during the transition period (1987-2007), whereas human activities contributed similar to 95% during the post-impact period (2008-2014). At the seasonal scale, climatic variation plays a more significant role during the dry season (December-May), with precipitation the most important factor among climate variables, whereas human activities contributed more during the wet season (June-November), benefiting the downstream areas through mitigating floods. Among human activities, reservoir construction is a dominant factor affecting streamflow over agricultural, industrial, and domestic water uses. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological changes in the LR basin that may impact the Lower Mekong River, serve as a basis for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection, and highlight the need for considering reservoir operation strategies in streamflow projections in similar basins globally under climate change scenarios.

AB Spatially representative estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s are needed for simulating catchment scale surface runoff and infiltration. Classical methods for measuring K-s are time-consuming so sampling campaigns need to be designed economically. Important insights can be obtained by experiments directed to understand the controls of K-s in an agricultural setting and identify the minimum number of samples required for estimating representative plot scale K-s. In this study, a total of 131 double-ring infiltrometer measurements were made on 12 plots in a small Austrian catchment. A statistical analysis of K, across the catchment suggests K-s to be only slightly influenced by physical and topographical soil characteristics while land use is the main control. The highest values of K-s were observed in arable fields, with a median of about 3 times and a coefficient of variation (CV) of about 75% of those in grassland areas. An uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of K-s measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of K-s over a given area with a specified accuracy suggests that, beyond a specific and plot-size dependent number of measurements, the benefit of any extra measurement is small. The confidence interval of the geometric mean of K-s decreases with the number of measurements and increases with the size of the plot sampled. Applications of these findings for designing field campaigns are discussed.

AB Quantifying uncertainty in projecting climate change impact on flood frequency analysis is particularly relevant for long-term water resources planning and management. This study examines uncertainties arising from (1) a climate model, with and without accounting of intermodel similarities, (2) a hydrological model with two different error model definitions, which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on flood response. Through a Bayesian modeling framework, a proposed statistical framework is utilized to explore various definitions of sources of uncertainty and to develop a series of nested formulations that can evaluate the leverage of specific uncertainty sources in quantiles of future streamflow. To be specific, climate model similarity, hydrologic prediction error, and frequency analysis are formally modeled with an appropriate likelihood function. The quantiles inferred by each formulation are compared in a case study of the Yongdam Basin in Korea. Results indicate that variance in hydrologic response is underestimated if climate model similarities are ignored, and in many cases, the inferred quantiles of streamflow projection are biased accordingly. Furthermore, a simple error model used in defining hydrologic uncertainty may create incorrect information in determining the quantiles in streamflow projection. The approach presented here of quantifying uncertainty has the potential to better depict overall multi-source uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on hydrologic response. Finally, our results also indicate that careful flood planning management may be required for the Yongdam Basin in future summers.

AB Forest stony soils have rock fragments and many macropores, the latter arising mainly from the activity of soil fauna and plant root decay. We still lack knowledge about the hydraulic properties of this type of soil, especially when considering the influence of both factors - rock fragments and macropores - on the saturated hydraulic conductivity. This research aims to supplement the method we proposed before to test the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed soil samples (Ilek and Kucza, 2014; Kucza and Ilek, 2016). We propose to enhance the method by taking into account the impact of rock fragments and macropores on the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils, particularly on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium conducting water in the soil, that is, soil matrix. We studied, using artificial samples, how rock fragments influence hydraulic conductivity. To test the enhanced method, we used 33 undisturbed samples taken from the top layers (0-12 cm) of forest stony soils. The results show that rock fragments in the soil can both increase and decrease the infiltration of water by the soil matrix. Rock fragments with diameters close to 20 mm had the least influence on water infiltration. Soil macropores in the samples always increased water infiltration. Empty macropores increased it from two to twenty-four times while filled macropores from three to five times. Our method gives the opportunity to study the hydraulic conductivity of macropores and their physical and chemical properties.

AB Information on vertical Soil Moisture Content (SMC) profile is important for several hydro-meteorological processes. This study borrows the idea of coupling the memory and forcing from a previous study and develops a spatially-varying Statistical Soil Moisture Profile (SSMP) model to estimate the vertical SMC profile. It uses only surface soil moisture (0-5 cm) values and Hydrological Soil Groups (HSGs) information of the location. The focus of the study is incorporation of the HSG information to ensure the spatial transferability of the proposed model by capturing the spatial variations of soil moisture profile with the change in soil hydraulic properties. The wide range of soil moisture data for model development as well as for spatial validation is obtained from 171 stations from different networks of International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) at five different depths, i.e., 5, 10, 20, 51 and 102 cm. The HSG information at the locations are extracted from the Web Soil Survey (WSS) database. The potential of spatial transferability of the SSMP model is assessed by applying it to the new stations within the corresponding HSG. Model performances are promising for all four depth pairs (5-10, 10-20, 20-51 and 51-102 cm) of all four HSGs during both model development and spatial validation given the model complexity. Hence, the spatially-varying SSMP model is suitable at the ungauged locations by incorporating the HSG information. The potential application of the proposed model shows the future scope to assimilate the satellite based surface SMC data into the model to develop a vertical soil moisture profile map over a large area.

AB Hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the Kosi basin, which covers parts of Nepal and India, were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics. The study revealed that similar to 56% of the discharge at Chatara (where all major tributaries of the Kosi meet) is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34% of the total basin area. In contrast, the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57% and 8% of the basin area but contribute similar to 38% and similar to 16% of the discharge at Chatara, respectively. The contribution of sediment load at Chatara from the different tributaries of the Kosi River also shows a similar pattern. Of a total of similar to 100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at Chatara, similar to 56% is transported from four tributaries: the Indrawati, Bhote Kosi, Tama Kosi (all draining from the west), and Tamor. The remaining similar to 44% is transported by other tributaries upstream of Chatara, the most important being the Arun, Dudh Kosi, and Sun Kosi. Sediment budgeting in this study, based on annual sediment load data, suggested that similar to 20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between Chatara and Birpur annually. This study also found that similar to 53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between Birpur and Baltara annually. Sediment dynamics in the Kosi basin emerges as the most important river management issue, and this is closely linked to channel instability and frequent flooding in the alluvial plains.

AB Expert systems adopted in real-time multi-scale runoff prediction are useful decision-making tools for hydrologists but the stochastic nature of any hydrological variable can pose significant challenges in attaining a reliable predictive model. This paper advocates a data-driven approach used to design two-phase hybrid model (i.e., CVEE-ELM). The model utilizes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) coupled with the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithms for better frequency resolution of the input datasets and the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm as the objective predictive model. In the first stage of the presented model design, notable frequencies in the predictor-target data series are uncovered, utilizing the CEEMDAN algorithm where the model's inputs are decomposed into their respective Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and the Residual (Res) series. The second stage entails a VMD approach, used to decompose the yet-unresolved high frequencies (i.e., IMF1 ) into their variational modes, further discerning and establishing the data attributes to be incorporated into the ELM model to simulate the respective IMFs, Res and VM data series, aggregated as an integrative tool for multiscale runoff prediction. In the model evaluative phase, the hybrid CVEE-ELM is cross-validated with a single-phase hybrid ELM and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to benchmark its accuracy for predicting 1-, 3- and 6-month ahead runoff in Yingluoxia watershed, Northwestern China. Two-phase hybrid model exhibits superior accuracy at all lead times, to accord with high degree of correlations between the observed and the forecasted runoff, a relatively large Nash-Sutcliffe and the Legate-McCabe Index. Taylor diagrams depict the two-phase hybrid CVEE-ELM model generated forecasts located close to a reference (i.e., a perfect) model, with a lower root-mean square centered difference, and a correspondingly large correlation for all forecast horizons, although the model's accuracy for shorter lead times (1-month), as expected, are better than the 3- and 6-month horizon. The study shows that the two-phase hybrid CVEE-ELM model where an integration of two frequency resolution algorithms are made, is a preferred data-driven tool that can be explored for real-life decision-system design, particularly for hydrological forecasting problems that have significantly stochastic data features, and thus, will require reliable forecasts to be generated at multi-step horizons.

AB Stable isotopes have been used to quantify lake and wetland pond water loss to evaporation by applying the modified Craig and Gordon (1965) model. This model and its derivatives employ simplifying assumptions that ignore the additions of precipitation and infiltration outputs and assume evaporation is the only loss term over the prediction period. Here we develop a coupled water and isotope mass-balance model to account for precipitation additions. Our model uses physical and isotopic observations to quantify pond evaporation and infiltration losses over the ice-free period. We tested and applied the model to four wetland ponds at the St Denis National Wildlife Research Area, Saskatchewan Canada, where we have long-term datasets. Modeled infiltration rates from the ponds ranged between 0.99 and 9.2 mm/d and open water evaporation rates ranged between 0.88 and 2.8 mm/d. Both were consistent with independent estimates. Infiltration amounts were highest in the ephemeral ponds (that dry out within days or weeks of the spring melt period). In these ponds, infiltration exceeded evaporation. In permanent ponds, that is ponds that do not dry out; evaporation exceeded infiltration. Evaporation amounts were most substantial for permanent ponds that were not sheltered by topography or riparian vegetation. Overall, our coupled water and isotope mass-balance model combined with physical and isotope observations was able to quantify the spatially and temporally variable evaporation and infiltration fluxes within and between ponds.

AB The Luanhe River basin, the mostly afforested river basin in North China, has exhibited significant land use/land cover change (LUCC) under climate change that could jointly affect water availability of the basin in the future. This study examines both impacts of LUCC and climate change on runoff over the upper reaches of the Luanhe River basin. First, the land use in 2020 is predicted based on the Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov). Second, a hydrological model (Soil Water Assessment Tools, SWAT) is set up for the baseline period 1961-1979 and driven primarily by outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) for the period 2020-2030. Results show that the ensemble mean annual precipitation may increase under four RCPs for the period 2020-2030, with the maximum (470 mm/yr) and minimum (444 mm/yr) for RCP8.5 and RCP6.0, respectively, 1-7% higher than the observed mean annual precipitation (441 mm/yr) during 1961-1979. The relationship between the runoff simulations and the RCPs under the 2020 land use scenario is nonlinear, with the maximum (57 mm/yr) and minimum (50 mm/yr) mean annual runoff depths under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios, respectively, similar to 58% and similar to 39% higher than the mean annual observed runoff depth (36 mm/yr) for the baseline period. The increase in forestland (similar to 56%) and decrease in agriculture land (similar to -30%) are remarkable for the period 1970-2020, driven primarily by afforestation implemented in the Luanhe River basin. LUCC would lead to a slight decrease in mean annual runoff, and the runoff only increases in summer but decreases in other three seasons. The decrease in surface runoff and groundwater discharge jointly results in the overall decrease in runoff due to LUCC. In general, the climate change impact will dominate runoff change for the study basin, though marked afforestation has taken place and is likely to continue in the future.

AB This work investigates regionalization techniques for large-scale model applications in the frame of a pan-European assessment of water resources covering approx. 740,000 km(2) in Western Europe. Using the SWAT platform, four variants of the similarity based regionalization approach were compared. The first two involved unsupervised clustering to define hydrological regions before performing hydrological model calibration, whereas the last two involved supervised clustering after performing calibration. Similarity is defined using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis that identifies watershed physiographic characteristics that are most relevant for the selected hydrological response indices.
   The PLSR results indicate that typically available watershed characteristics such as geomorphology, land-use, climate, and soil properties describe reasonably well the average hydrological conditions but poorly the extreme events. Regionalization variants considering unsupervised clustering and supervised clustering performed similarly well when using all available information. However, results indicate that supervised clustering uses data more efficiently and may be more suitable when data are scarce. It is demonstrated that parsimonious use of available data can be achieved using both regionalization techniques. Finally, model performance consistently becomes acceptable by calibrating watersheds covering only 10% of the model domain, thus, making the calibration task affordable in terms of time and computational resources required.

AB Accurate forecasting of lake level time series (LLTS) is an important but challenging problem with major economic, social and environmental implications. However, in recent years, the level of uncertainty in the existing LLTS forecast methods has increased significantly due to climate change, therefore, the need to develop more accurate models. The main research question for this study is whether it is necessary to use nonlinear methods in LLTS modeling or if linear methods can produce as accurate and reliable forecast tools. We introduce a new linear-based forecast method for LLTS using spectral analysis, seasonal standardization, and stochastic terms. The application of the new LLTS forecast method is tested on two case study Lakes, including the Van Lake, in Turkey and the Michigan-Huron Lake, in North America. A two-step preprocessing techniques based on standardization and differencing was used for the Van Lake, and spectral analysis and differencing was employed for the Michigan-Huron Lake. We then compared the accuracy and uncertainty of the proposed linear method with an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The uncertainty of the new linear LLTS forecast model was +/- 0.00455 and +/- 0.00264 for the Van Lake and the Michigan-Huron Lake, respectively, compared to +/- 0.00625 and +/- 0.00766 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Van Lake and +/- 0.00312 and +/- 0.00319 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Michigan-Huron Lake.

AB The hierarchy of one-dimensional equations and numerical methods describing the motion of floods and disturbances in streams is studied, critically reviewed, and a number of results obtained. Initially the long wave equations are considered. When presented in terms of discharge and cross-sectional area they enable the development of simple fully-nonlinear advection-diffusion models whose only approximation is that disturbances be very long, easily satisfied in most flood routing problems. Then, making the approximation that changes in surface slope are relatively small such that diffusion terms in the equations are small, various advection-diffusion and Muskingum models are derived. Several well-known Muskingum formulations are tested; one is found to be in error. The three families of governing equations, the long wave equations, and the advection-diffusion and the Muskingum approximations, are linearised and analytical solutions obtained. A dimensionless diffusion-frequency number measures the accuracies of the approximate methods. Criteria for practical use are given, which reveal when they have difficulties, for streams of small slope, for fast-rising floods, and/or when shorter period waves are present in an inflow hydrograph. They can probably be used in most flood routing problems with an idealised smooth inflow. However the fact that they cannot be used for all problems requires a general alternative flood routing method, for which it is recommended to use the long wave equations themselves written in terms of discharge and cross-sectional area, when a surprisingly simple physical stream model can be used. An explicit finite difference numerical method is presented that can be used with different inflow specifications and downstream boundary conditions, and is recommended for general use.

AB Among the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) equations, temperature-based and radiation-based equations have been accepted as promising approaches when the available meteorological data are limited. The present paper aimed at assessing this general implication in island environments, which might be generally volatile than the interior/coastal zones. Using data from five island locations of Iran, daily ETo values were calculated by the benchmark FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM) model, then the commonly used temperature-, radiation- and mass transfer-based ETo equations were evaluated against the benchmark values. An additional heuristic modeling of ETo was also performed through employing gene expressions programming (GEP), evaluated by k-fold testing. The obtained outcomes showed that the calibrated mass transfer-based equations and their corresponded GEP models generally surpassed the other applied models in the studied locations. This criticized the commonly accepted implication about applying temperature/radiation-based models in case of data scarcity for different locations. Nevertheless, analysis of the temporal variations of models performance among test years showed that fixing the minimum test size as 1 year for local k-fold testing (that is the case in similar studies) might be misleading as it could not show the fluctuations in modeling accuracy well. A minimum affordable size of at least one growing season was instead selected, tested and recommended in the current research.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in freshwater ecosystem functioning. The main sources of DOM in lakes are allochthonous inputs from the catchment and autochthonous in-lake production. This study focused on the role of catchment characteristics on the qualitative and quantitative properties of DOM in small temperate lakes along a gradient of alkalinity. We examined DOM properties based on the optical absorbance and fluorescence measurements of water from 34 Estonian lakes. The content and composition of DOM were highly diverse in the lakes studied, e.g. the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied from 3.2 to 53.0 mg L-1. Land cover, soil, and catchment hydrology and geology had substantial effects on DOM in lakes. Stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the catchment and water exchange rate (a descriptor of catchment hydrology, reciprocal of water residence time) had major positive effects on DOC concentrations. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM, i.e. the relative abundance of humic substances, and the dominance of allochthonous DOM increased with the drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area) and the percentages of bogs, and Dystric and Fibric Histosols (peat soils in transitional mires and bogs, respectively) in the catchments. Dominance of non-humic over humic substances and autochthonous over allochthonous DOM in lakes corresponded to calcareous catchments and higher percentages of Gleyic Rendzinas (thin soils on calcareous rock), Sapric Histosols (peat soils in mires) and open spaces (areas with little vegetation). Our results showed that soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover and were more informative for describing the role of catchment characteristics on DOM in lakes. Patterns in DOM quantity and quality found in our study were similar to patterns found in other temperate lakes; therefore, our results have important implications for understanding catchment-lake interactions across the temperate region.

AB As a boundary condition, the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the Budyko framework. However, the traditional lower bound i.e., the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary without considering realistic conditions. In fact, under real-word condition, the lower bound of Budyko curves, representing the maximum value of water yield, should be located above the horizontal axis due to complicated constraints from basin characteristics, especially the precipitation seasonality, a key driver of runoff yield and a dominant factor in constructing Budyko framework. Thus, this study focused on exploring the reasonable location of the lower bound by adequately analyzing potential influence of precipitation seasonality. To do that, multiple hydrological simulations in basins under different climate and topography conditions were developed based on various precipitation scenarios constructed by using Markov chain with full range of precipitation seasonality. To fully understand the influence from precipitation seasonality on the lower bound, the water-energy supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and hydrological model parameters, respectively. The results reveal a positive correlation between runoff coefficient and precipitation seasonality with an obvious higher location above the horizontal axis, indicating the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real-word condition. Furthermore, a potential location of the lower bound above the horizontal axis in Budyko space was found based on runoff yield mechanism under real basin condition, representing a more appropriate boundary condition of Budyko framework.

AB Uncertainty in climate forcings causes significant uncertainty in estimating streamflow and other land-surface fluxes in hydrologic model simulations. Earlier studies primarily analyzed the importance of reproducing cross-correlation between precipitation and temperature (P-T cross-correlation) using various downscaling and weather generator schemes, leaving out how such biased estimates of P-T cross-correlation impact streamflow simulation and other hydrologic variables. The current study investigates the impacts of biased P-T cross-correlation on hydrologic variables using a fully coupled hydrologic model (Penn-state Integrated Hydrologic Model, PIHM). For this purpose, a synthetic weather generator was developed to generate multiple realizations of daily climate forcings for a specified P-T cross-correlation. Then, we analyzed how reproducing/neglecting P-T cross-correlation in climate forcings affect the accuracy of a hydrologic simulation. A total of 50 synthetic data sets of daily climate forcings with different P-T cross-correlation were forced into to estimate streamflow, soil moisture, and groundwater level under humid (Haw River basin in NC, USA) and arid (Lower Verde River basin in AZ, USA) hydroclimate settings. Results show that climate forcings reproducing the P-T cross-correlation yield lesser root mean square errors in simulated hydrologic variables (primarily on the sub-surface variables) as compared to climate forcings that neglect the P-T cross-correlation. Impacts of P-T cross-correlation on hydrologic simulations were remarkable to low flow and sub-surface variables whereas less significant to flow variables that exhibit higher variability. We found that hydrologic variables with lower internal variability (for example: groundwater and soil-moisture depth) are susceptible to the bias in P-T cross-correlation. These findings have potential implications in using univariate linear downscaling techniques to bias-correct GCM forcings, since univariate linear bias-correction techniques reproduce the GCM estimated P-T cross-correlation without correcting the bias in P-T cross-correlation.

AB Streamflow recession analysis provides valuable insights into catchment functioning that can be related to runoff generation, storage retention and baseflow dynamics. As an integrated characteristic, recession analysis is particularly useful in catchment comparison studies to help explain drivers of spatial and temporal variability in hydrological behavior. Here, five years of hourly streamflow data from 14, partly nested, catchments within a 68 km(2) boreal forest landscape in Northern Sweden were used to explore spatiotemporal variation in hydrological processes through recession analysis. The aim of this study was to better understand spatial variation in runoff generation and storage-discharge dynamics across the landscape, as well as the relation to landscape properties. Due to high collinearity between variables, partial least square regression was used to quantify the associations between recession characteristics and catchment properties, as well as to identify key variables controlling recession behavior. We analyzed recession characteristics using both an aggregated approach including all recession data and individual recession events. The analyses based on individual recession events, indicated that catchment topography, quantified by indices such as mean slope or elevation above the stream network, is a primary control on the recession behavior during relatively high flows, whereas catchment area gains importance when flows are relatively low. The proportion of sediment and deep soils also controlled recession behavior. Furthermore, we found that recession characteristics are influenced by both evapotranspiration (ET) and proxies of antecedent catchment storage, but that the patterns were different depending on catchment properties. ET was less influential in catchments with deeper soils and larger catchment area. Shifts in recession rates were primarily related to variation in storage, with faster streamflow recessions occurring during periods with low storage. The results demonstrate the influence of catchment properties on recession behavior, and we found great value in analyzing individual recession events for an increased understanding of spatial and temporal recession characteristics. When recession properties were lumped together, the relationships to catchment characteristics were obscured. This indicates the value of more detailed analyses, at least under the strongly seasonal hydroclimatic conditions of this site.

AB Rainfall-induced shallow landslides cause significant damage involving loss of life and property. Many hydrological processes such as rainfall infiltration, soil water dynamics, and slope stability are controlled by unsaturated soil properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Natural soils often exhibit a certain degree of anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity due to stratification and compaction mechanisms in soil formation processes.
   In this paper we investigate the effect of soil hydraulic conductivity anisotropy (SHCA) on hillslope hydrology and stability using a three-dimensional hydrological model coupled with a probabilistic infinite slope stability model. The model is applied in two independent case studies. The first aims to quantify the combined effect of different anisotropy ratios (lateral/normal saturated hydraulic conductivity) and hillslope morphologies (convex, concave, and planar) on slope stability. Anisotropy ratios are assumed in this case higher than one (1, 2, 10). Results show that increasing the anisotropy ratio (from 1 to 10) anticipates the failure time (from 12 to 9 h after the start of rainfall) and that in concave morphologies the unstable area tends to be wider than planar and convex. The second application aims to simulate the soil moisture dynamic and the probability of failure at different depths (100, 500, and 900 mm) of a stratified volcanic soil, making leverage on the model flexibility to accommodate SHCA. No assumptions are made on the anisotropy ratio in this case study. Our results, based on model parameter calibration and verification against in-situ soil moisture measurements during the year 2009, showed good model performance in simulating the soil moisture dynamic (Kling-Gupta Efficiency higher than 0.78) and confirmed no failure for the simulated year. The promising results support the aspiration that the physically based hydrological model can complement and improve the current predictions of landslide early warning systems.

AB Reliable and precise multi-step-ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks. For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.

AB Dissipation of water (evapotranspiration and water vapor conversion in human water use activities) is one of the significant hydrological processes in urban area, which becomes more complicated with rapid urbanization. However, there are few systematic studies on water dissipation problems in urban area, and even the related concepts are unclear. This paper proposed the concept of urban water dissipation (UWD) to describe water vapor conversion in urban areas, and presented analysis on mechanism of UWD based on observing and monitoring experiments. The urban underlying surface was divided into five categories: buildings, paved ground, vegetation, water surface, and soil, in which the buildings have been scarcely discussed in terms of water dissipation. The dissipation of water in buildings plays a more and more important role in the urban water circulation system, as the water supply increases in urban areas. To reveal how much water is dissipated in the buildings, the main water dissipation processes in different kinds of buildings were analyzed, and the quantitative model was proposed. Based on the traditional evapotranspiration models for urban underlying surface and the proposed model for water dissipation in buildings, a new modelling system was built to simulate the total UWD. The new model system reflects the impact of human water use activities on urban water dissipation. It was applied in Xiamen city to simulate the UWD in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The results show that the UWD intensity increased with the urbanization process in Xiamen urban area in past 15 years. The UWD contribution rate increased for most land use types, except green land. For example, the water dissipation on residential land is the fastest growing one of all land use types, and its contribution rate surpassed that of green land to become the largest contributor in 2010. Because of the interference of strong human activities, the contribution rate of water dissipation on the social side continues increasing. The contribution rate of UWD on the social side was more than 40% in 2015, and it is still increasing.

AB Climate model simulations and observations show that there is a poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation (HC) as well as a strengthening of the hydrological cycle in a warming climate. However, to establish a relation between the two phenomena in present day climate, simultaneous investigations of the HC and hydrological cycle changes using observational/reanalysis data are necessary, which is limited as compared to model simulations. In this regard, the present study employs relative humidity (RH), cloud fraction (CF) and precipitation (RF) parameters of the hydrological cycle and analyse their long term changes within the HC ascending and descending regions, simultaneously. Long term RH and CF data (1979-2016) are obtained from ERA-I reanalysis, and RF from GPCP precipitation dataset. The boundaries of the HC are identified using the meridional Mass Stream Function (MSF) metric, a metric that can track the mass motion in the atmosphere in the meridional direction. The analysis brings out the spatial pattern of the distribution of trends in hydrological parameters within the HC boundaries. The trends are observed to be significantly positive at the edges of the HC ascending region and significantly negative in the regions near the HC edges, insignificant (and in some cases, negative) in the deep tropics. This pattern is more or less consistent in RH, CF, as well as RF parameters. Thus the study shows that there are regions of positive as well as negative trends within the both ascending and descending regions. The results are found to be in accordance with the poleward expansion of HC and strengthening of the hydrological cycle. Besides, a northward shift in the HC ascending regions are also indicated from the analysis of the annual cycle of trend in precipitation. The current investigation is thus envisaged to contribute to further exploration on the relation between the HC changes and the intensification of the hydrological cycle in a warmer climate.

AB The flexibility and parsimony of transpositioning hydrographs using geomorphology-based deconvolution-reconvolution frameworks is particularly adapted to prediction in ungauged basins. Although already tested in semi-arid and oceanic-temperate hydro-climates, its predictions must be reproducible in a variety of hydrological contexts. The present study explores the nivo-pluvial hydrological regime using geomorphology-based hydrograph transposition between 21 gauged catchments ranging from 1.1 to 4466.4 km(2) in Quebec, Canada, and constitutes a case study in prediction in ungauged basins. Three metrics were used to assess model performance for each donor-target pair: Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), NSE calculated for the square root of discharge (NSEsqrt), and Volumetric Efficiency (VE). The classic transposition of hydrographs using the specific discharge ratio, used as a reference, was almost always outperformed by the geomorphology-based approach. Good but seasonally variable performance values were obtained for several pairs of catchments, revealing simultaneous structural and circumstancial effects. The difference in size, the physical distance between the gauged donor and its target ungauged catchment, and the season influenced the performance of the geomorphology-based transposition.

AB Analysis of hydrological impacts of land use change raises questions about whether, and how much, such impacts are misrepresented because of errors in river flow observations. In this paper, land use change impacts (represented by changes in watershed storage) and different ranges of discharge measurement error are compared to assess how errors in discharge measurement can potentially mask a land use change impact. Using a watershed from the Ethiopian highlands to exemplify this, we simulated five different levels of land use change impacts with five levels of watershed storage reductions (from 10% to 50% change) and the associated time series of runoff. Different levels of observation error were then introduced into these artificial time series. Comparison was made between every pair, i.e. a time series derived from a certain level of land use change (storage reduction) versus a time series corresponding to a given level of observation error, using a step-change t-test. Significant step-changes between pairs define the detectability of land use change impact. The analysis was made for the entire 30-year time series as well as for the most extreme annual weather conditions. The results showed that for the average year and wettest year, 75% or more error in observed discharge masks the maximum simulated land use change impact on hydrology. In dry years, a 50% error in discharge is enough to mask the same impact. Knowing (and improving) the level of data quality contributes to a better understanding of hydrological uncertainties and improves the precision in assessing land use change impacts. Both of these are essential elements in water resources development planning.

AB Tropical montane areas of Southeast Asia are exposed to high-intensity rainfall during the monsoon period. This is particularly problematic in areas where soils on steep slopes are cultivated as it can lead to heavy runoff, high soil erosion, and water pollution. The objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the impact of raindrops on the dynamics of runoff on such steep fields. Experiments under simulated rainfall were performed at the plot scale (1 m(2)) to quantify water export from the surface of upland agricultural soils during overland flow events. Four 1 m(2) plots were divided in duplicated treatment groups: (a) control with no amendments, and (b) amended with pig manure. Each plot was divided into two 0.5 m(2) rectangular subplots. One subplot was designated as a rain splash treatment; the other sub-plot was covered with a 2 mm grid size wire screen that was located 12 cm above the soil surface. The purpose of the screen was to break the raindrops into fine droplets and to reduce fall height in order to drastically reduce their kinetic energy. Runoff was measured for each sub-plot. The results show that raindrop impact drastically enhances runoff generation on both bare soils and on manure amended soils. When the impact of raindrops was limited by screening, runoff was higher on amended soils than on bare soils.
   The temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall. Both experimental and modelling results showed that droplet energy induces a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil surface due to crusting, resulting in a reduction of hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff rate.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; DRAINAGE
AB The Boussinesq equation is usually used to describe one-dimensional unconfined groundwater movement. Solutions of this equation are important as they provide useful insights regarding the water table response to stream level variations and allow us to quantify the exchange flow between the stream and the aquifer. Due to the nonlinearity of the Boussinesq equation, the solutions are generally obtained using numerical methods. However, for certain classes of initial and boundary conditions there are both exact and approximate analytical solution techniques. This work focuses on the latter approach. A new mathematical technique for approximate solutions of the Boussinesq equation describing flow in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head is presented. The method applies to the problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer, and approximate solutions to both problems are derived. The solutions were obtained by introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a numerical fitting procedure. Results based on this technique were found to be easily calculated and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculation based on Runge-Kutta approach. A benchmark between the proposed solutions and five existing approximate analytical solutions shows that the present solutions are the most accurate approximate solutions among those tested. Applications of the solutions are presented in the context of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters.

AB The role of hydrological connectivity in driving the dynamics of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in streams is poorly characterised. Here, we demonstrate how a tracer-aided hydrological model can be used within a coupled modelling approach to explore the role of connectivity in governing stream faecal coliform (FC) dynamics. To do so, we tested a hypothesis that in northern upland catchments, the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between major landscape units (hillslopes and riparian zone) and the stream exert a dominant control on stream FC loads by facilitating generation of runoff-driven FC fluxes. This hypothesis was conceptualised within a simple FC model that was coupled to a tracer-aided hydrological model developed for a small (3.2 km(2)) data-rich catchment in NE Scotland. The model was dual-calibrated to daily discharge and stable isotope data for the period August 2008 to September 2009; stream FC loads were also simulated but not used as a calibration target. Behavioural models successfully captured the general dynamics of the discharge and isotope data (average Kling-Gupta efficiencies of 0.72 and 0.53, respectively), providing confidence in the realism of simulated hydrological processes. The models simulated a seasonally-varying role of connectivity in driving stream FC loads. In summer, connectivity of the catchment hillslope was crucial in providing a source of FC to the riparian zone for transfer to the stream; this countered the decline in fresh FC input to the riparian zone in summer which reflected the seasonal movement of red deer (the principal source of FC) onto higher ground. In winter when this seasonal movement caused FC to be predominantly stored in the riparian zone, simulated hillslope connectivity primarily provided water to the riparian zone that permitted increased runoff generation and associated mobilisation of FC. Comparison of observed and simulated stream FC loads revealed model performance to be variable (R(2)range: 0-0.34). The better performance of the model in summer was consistent with hydrological connectivity being a dominant control on stream FC loads at this time. However, failure of the model to capture low FC loads in winter indicated that additional processes not considered in the model may also govern stream FC dynamics during this period. Incorporating the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on FC mortality, or a dilution effect of hillslope connectivity in winter, could be potential next steps in refining the hypothesis conceptualised in the FC model presented here. The novel coupled modelling approach used in this study successfully allowed a hypothesised role of connectivity in driving stream FC dynamics to be tested, contextualised by the accuracy of discharge and isotope-tracer simulations as indicators of hydrological process realism. Therefore, coupling FIO and tracer-aided hydrological models has clear promise for furthering understanding of FIO dynamics, which is a vital precursor to the successful management of microbial water quality. Based on the experiences in this study, a "roadmap" for the future development and application of coupled approaches is also presented.

AB Soil moisture plays a fundamental role in the mass and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere, making its knowledge essential for several hydrological and climatic applications. The aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of soil moisture spatial-temporal variability at the catchment scale (up to 500 km(2)). The main implication is to provide guidelines to obtain soil moisture values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium-sized river basin scale, which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and rainfall-runoff modeling. To this end, 23 measurements campaigns were carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within the Upper Chiascio River Basin, a catchment with a drainage area of about 460 km(2) in the Umbria Region (central Italy). The data set allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its dynamics. On the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches, it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour. For the investigated area, the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods with respect to wet periods, mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year. Soil moisture values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than those recorded during dry periods. The maximum number of required samples, to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error of 3% vol/vol, was found equal to 12. The temporal stability analysis showed that during wet periods just one "optimal" measurement point can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment-mean behaviour, while during dry periods the number of "optimal" measurement points became equal to two. Therefore, at the adopted spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to significant errors. From the perspective of soil moisture dynamics, the decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of the time-invariant component (temporal mean of each site) was predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data, for almost the whole observation period. Results provided guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted measurements at a few selected points representative of the catchment-mean behaviour.

AB Stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in precipitation not only show a certain response to climate change at different time scales, but also have strong linkages to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons). Typhoon activity in the coastal region of Southeast China is quite intense, bringing huge amounts of moisture; thus, contributing to extreme rainfall in this region. The existing isotope data in Southeast China is available on a monthly or daily temporal resolution, which is inadequate to study 1-2-day-long typhoon rainfall events at a particular location. In this study, hourly rainfall delta H-2 and delta O-18 data are collected for eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in Fuzhou, Southeast China. The total correlation between delta H-2 and delta O-18 is obtained as delta H-2 = 7.41 delta O-18 + 0.81 (R-2 = 0.96, N = 220). All the eight typhoon events reveal a similar variability pattern in delta(18)Ovalues which can be divided into three stages. More positive delta O-18 values occur in the first and third stages, while the second stage is dominated by most negative delta O-18 values, exhibiting an inverted U-shaped pattern. The positive delta O-18 values during the first and third stages are governed by re-evaporation. The precipitation during the second stage has distinctly lower delta O-18 values than the weighted average delta O-18 of summer precipitation in Fuzhou. Some of these values are slightly lower than those of the water vapor over the Pacific Ocean's surface. No significant relationship is observed between precipitation delta O-18 and temperature as well as the amount of precipitation during the second stage. We hypothesize that the significant O-18-depletion is mainly caused by the 'rain shield effect', which refers to combination of large-scale convection, high condensation efficiency, and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative delta O-18 values during typhoon system. These findings suggest the use of stable isotope ratios as important tracers of typhoon water.

AB Precipitation is a fundamental forcing variable in land surface modeling, controlling several hydrological and biogeochemical processes (e.g., runoff, carbon cycling, evaporation, transpiration, groundwater recharge, and soil moisture). However, precipitation estimates from rain gauges, ground-based radars, satellite sensors, and numerical models are affected by significant uncertainties, which can be amplified when exposed to highly non-linear land model physics. This work tests the hypothesis that precipitation data from different sources can be optimally merged to minimize the hydrologic response error in surface soil moisture simulations and maximize their correlation with ground observations (multi-objective optimization problem). This hypothesis is tested by merging three precipitation products (one satellite product, a ground-based dataset, and model-base estimates) that force a land surface model trained to minimize soil moisture anomalies. A Monte Carlo-based algorithm is developed to generate weights to linearly combine these precipitation datasets. Optimal combinations of weights are identified by minimizing the errors and maximizing the correlation between the model simulated soil moisture and the satellite-based SMOS soil moisture product. The proposed methodology has been tested over Oklahoma where high-quality, high-resolution (independent) ground-based soil moisture observations are available for validation purposes. Results show that there exist optimal combinations of these precipitation datasets that provide smaller errors and larger correlation coefficients between modeled soil moisture estimates and ground-based data with respect to forcing the land surface model with single precipitation datasets. Specifically, combining three precipitation products from different sources provides the largest correlation coefficient and the lowest root mean square error at several locations across Oklahoma.

AB Single-mission altimetric water level observations of rivers are spatially and temporally limited, and thus they are often unable to quantify the full extent of extreme flood events. Moreover, only missions with a short-repeat orbit, such as Envisat, Jason-2, or SARAL, could provide meaningful time series of water level variations directly. However, long or non-repeat orbit missions such as CryoSat-2 have a very dense spatial resolution under the trade-off of a repeat time insufficient for time series extraction. Combining data from multiple altimeter missions into a multi-mission product allows for increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. In this study, we combined water level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from other altimeter missions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016 into one multi-mission water level time series using the approach of universal kriging. In contrast to former multi-mission altimetry methods, this approach allows for the incorporation of CryoSat-2 data as well as data from other long or non-repeat orbit missions, such as Envisat-EM or SARAL-DP. Additionally, for the first time, data from tributaries are incorporated. The multi-mission time series including CryoSat-2 data adequately reflects the general inter-annual flood behaviour and the extreme floodings in 2008 and 2011. It performs better than single-mission time series or multi-mission time series based only on short-repeat orbit data. The Probability of Detection of the floodings with the multi-mission altimetry was around 80% while Envisat and Jason-2 single-mission altimetry could only detect around 40% of the floodings correctly. However, small flash floods still remain undetectable.

AB The uncertainty assessment of the changes in drought characteristics due to climate change has caught the attention of the scientific community. This study used gauge-based gridded precipitation data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) to reconstruct historical droughts and downscale future precipitation projected by seven general circulation models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, namely, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Support vector machine (SVM) and quantile mapping were used for downscaling and GCM bias correction, respectively. The model performances were assessed based on statistical measures. The historical and future projected precipitation data were finally used to characterize the seasonal droughts using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for different crop growing periods. The drought severity-area-frequency (SAF) curves for the historical (1961-2010) and three future periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099) were developed. The uncertainty band of future drought SAF curves was estimated using Bayesian bootstrap (BB) at a 95% confidence level. As a result, SVM was successful in downscaling the precipitation of all selected CMIP5 GCMs. The seasonal ensemble of GCMs projected an increase in precipitation ranging from 8% to 41% under all scenarios. The historical SAF curves revealed that for equal drought severity, larger areas are affected by droughts having higher return periods. Future projections of droughts revealed the increase in affected area for lower severity and return period droughts and the decrease for higher severity and return period droughts. The uncertainty bands of drought SAF curves with higher return periods were found much wider compared to those with lower return periods which indicates more uncertainty in the projection of higher severity and return period droughts.

AB Evasion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from lakes is a significant component in the continental carbon balance, but most current CO2 evasion estimates ignore dailyCO(2) fluctuations. To test the hypothesis that partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 evasion vary throughout a day due to biological processes driven by solar radiation, we conducted in-situ pCO(2) and ambient water measurements over eleven 10-h periods in a subtropical, eutrophic shallow lake from November 2017 to May 2018. In-situ measurements were performed at 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 Central Standard Time of the United States (CST), and CO2 evasion rates were estimated based on the field pCO(2) records. Strong daily declining trends of pCO(2) and CO2 flux were found throughout the seasons except for one winter day with unusually low temperatures. At 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 CST of a day, average pCO(2) were 1131, 839, 345 and 205 mu atm, respectively, while average CO2 fluxes were 80, 67, -10, and -34 mmol m(2) h(-1). Significant differences were found in average pCO(2) between any two measured time points in a day, while significant reductions in CO2 flux were observed between 10:00 and 14:00 CST and between 14:00 and 17:00 CST. pCO(2) and CO2 flux dynamics were most likely driven by the air-water exchanges during nighttime hours and mainly driven by aquatic metabolism in the daytime. These findings suggest possible large uncertainties in the estimation of carbon emitted from trophic lakes, highlighting the need for further research on diurnal pCO(2) fluctuation from different aquatic ecosystems to improve CO2 evasion estimation.

AB A multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18 and H-3), hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity tools were used to revive a part of the drought prone areas of Vidarbha region, Maharashtra, India. In this study, groundwater recharge processes, monsoon characteristics, climate variables during evaporation in the region were evaluated using environmental isotope techniques. Additionally, electrical resistivity surveys were also conducted to understand the aquifer geometry and weak zones (fractures, lineament) for the sustainable groundwater development. Significant seasonal variation observed in stable isotopic composition, deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation helped to delineate the sources of vapour generating the rains during both the southwest and northeast monsoons. A negative correlation between stable isotopic content and amount of precipitation is observed. Two sources of groundwater recharge, namely, natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures (detention tanks) were deduced. Hydrochemical data also corroborates the above findings. Environmental isotope data show that the groundwater is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon, and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant. Tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern and its residence time is of the order of a few years. Modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment helped in estimating the climatic variables such as temperature and humidity during evaporation. Also, the recharge from the detention tanks was quantified based on isotope balance model. Aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zones were delineated in a part of the study area using electrical resistivity method. An integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is found to be effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas.

AB With concerns about future catastrophic disasters, elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)), global warming and vegetation changes have received much attention globally. In recent years, studies have suggested controlling climate change should be based on regional impacts. However, regional quantitative assessments of respective and combination influences of CO2, temperature and vegetation variations on water resources remain limited. To address this issue, a comprehensive framework is developed. This framework integrates a dynamic vegetation simulation approach, a biosphere hydrological model and a variance-based sensitivity analysis approach which enables identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations. A medium-sized river basin in northeast China is used to illustrate the application based on different CO2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions. Validation using MODIS products shows the proposed approach can simulate Leaf Area Index (LAI) changes well. Results show sum of the influences of LAI and temperature variations on transpiration are more than 1.6 times higher than physiological effects of eCO(2) in growing seasons, which implies more water could be transpired than conserved with eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes. Results also show runoff increases with eCO(2) and decreases with increasing temperatures, but LAI changes play a dominate role in runoff decrease in hot summer. Therefore, considering LAI changes is of utmost importance in projections of future water resources, and severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if LAI changes are neglected. This research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of eCO(2), global warming and LAI changes on regional water security and sustainability.

AB In response to the severe water crisis in Iran, the Iranian government has changed its approach to the management of the country's water resources in different sectors from supply-side to demand-side management-an approach that relies on reducing water demand. In this regard, due to the high consumption of water in the agricultural sector, switching from rice cultivation that requires large amounts of water, to less water-intensive crops were considered a priority for the country, and the government banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation policy. It is however very difficult for a government or any other power to enforce such a measure as it must be voluntarily accepted by end users (i.e., farmers) to be successful. Therefore, the success of this policy largely depends on what the public think of such measures. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to know how farmers think and behave in terms of these policies. The aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about farmers' intention toward changing the rice cropping system. To achieve our goal, we used a social-psychological theory known as the Theory of Interpersonal Behavior. A sample of 250 rice growers in southwest Iran was selected. Structural equation modeling showed that farmers' intention to change from rice cultivation to another crop is determined by personal norms, beliefs about their role and emotional considerations.

AB No attempts have been found on dealing with a set of non-competitive (or leader-follower-interactive) objectives when performing optimal groundwater remediation management. This study presents a multi-level nonlinear simulation-optimization (ML-NSO) model for groundwater remediation management when objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels. This model is formulated by integrating health-risk assessment (at the residential concern level), energy assessment (at the energy concern level) and contamination forecasting (at the environmental concern level) within a general framework. The capabilities and effectiveness of the developed model are illustrated through a real-world case located at Cantuar, Saskatchewan in Canada. Results facilitate (a) generating non-compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction, (b) displaying the distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks for human health, and estimating the corresponding energy consumption, (c) resolving of conflicts and interactions among residential, energy, and environmental requirements. Moreover, the performance of ML-NSO model is enhanced by comparing with the single-level and multi-objective (SL-NSO and MO-NSO) models. Results show that ML-NSO model would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost The ML-NSO model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies with considering the leader-follower relationship within system.

AB Optimization techniques have emerged as robust tools to aid the planning and design of urban drainage facilities in cost-effective ways. Such an effort was traditionally aided by heuristic methods (like genetic algorithm), which was generally time-consuming and also challenging in reaching convergence for large-scale problems with wide decision spaces. This study proposed a novel optimization method, denoted as two-level optimization (TO) scheme, for supporting rainwater storage pond design in an urban drainage system. Polynomial regression models were established as surrogate models to facilitate the solution of the optimization framework using traditional iteration algorithm. The TO scheme firstly sought the optimal layout of storage ponds on tributary sub-watersheds, and then proceeded to that of the mainstream one to yield the final solution. Through a case study, the TO scheme was compared with the traditional global optimization (GO) scheme where the physical simulation model was dynamically linked with genetic algorithm (GA) to seek the global optimal solution. The performance of two schemes under different constraint settings was analyzed. Effects of related issues such as start-point selection and mainstream design on tributary sub-watersheds were also discussed. The results showed that the proposed TO scheme is a prominent alternative to the traditional GO scheme to support urban water managers for a more science-based decision making towards storage pond implementation in large-scale practical problems.

AB In this study, a review of the overlay/index methods served for delineation of vulnerable zones in coastal aquifers affected by SWI is provided. Then, a more realistic presentation of the vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to SWI through modified GALDIT index method by incorporating the influential factors on SWI is established. The modifications on GALDIT method including incorporating the seaward hydraulic gradient (i) instead of the height of groundwater level above sea level (L) (so-called GAiDIT), and considering hydraulic gradient (i) as an additional parameter to the GALDIT (so-called GALDIT-i). Three GALDIT, GAiDIT, and GALDIT-i methods were evaluated with data from three coastal confined and phreatic/confined aquifers located in the south of the Caspian Sea, northern Iran. While no highly vulnerable zone was recognized by GALDIT method across three studied aquifers, averagely 43.4% and 50.5% of aquifers area were defined as highly vulnerable zones by GAiDIT and GALDIT-i, respectively. Furthermore, the final vulnerability maps obtained by GALDIT-i and then GAiDIT indicates higher correlation by three groundwater quality indices specific to SWI including f(sea) (r = 0.72 and 0.63) and GQI (r = 0.69 and 0.62) and also the distribution of TDS in groundwater (r = 0.71 and 0.61) compared with GALDIT (r = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.36, respectively). The values of vulnerability index obtained by GALDIT-i and GAiDIT are more strongly correlated with the length of SWI into the aquifer (L-x) based on Strack's analytical approach than GALDIT (r = 0.52, 0.36, and 0.32, respectively). The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient, height of groundwater level above sea level, aquifer type, and existing status of seawater intrusion has the greatest impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by GALDIT-i and GAiDIT methods. Results also indicated that serving the influential parameters in GALDIT methods regarding the hydrological and anthropogenic characteristics across the aquifer provide a more realistic characterization of the SWI. This modification leads to an accurate aquifer vulnerability mapping to SWI in aquifers characterized by transient anthropogenic drivers (e.g. pumping) which can be served as a promising tool for decision-making to properly assess and manage risk.

AB Laboratory evaporation experiments are used to determine soil hydraulic properties (SHP). In most cases, data are evaluated with the simplified evaporation method (SEM). Numerical simulations were used before to quantify the accuracy of the SEM and it was found that the method yields accurate estimates of SHP. However, previous tests neither accounted for heat flow, nor thermal fluxes of liquid water and water vapor, nor temperature effects on the transport properties. Since evaporation experiments are under most circumstances non-isothermal, past studies were therefore oversimplified and likely inaccurate. The objective of this article is to test the accuracy of the SEM using numerical simulations with a coupled model of water, vapor, and heat flow which is based on the Philip-de Vries theory and solves the surface energy balance. The model provides a state-of-theart description of the fluxes of water, vapor and energy during laboratory evaporation from bare soil. We present simulation results for different soil textures and resistances to vapor flow between soil and air, and analyze the accuracy of the SEM using the simulated data. The resulting average error for the water retention curve is smaller than 0.0025 m(3) M-3 and the relative error of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 15% for sandy loam and clay loam. For sand, the error in conductivity is higher but the structural shape of the conductivity curve is still identified relatively well. Compared to previous analyses of the evaporation method assuming isothermal flow, the average error of the SEM turned out to be only slightly higher.

AB Supraglacial debris is known to strongly influence the distribution of glacier surface melt. Since melt inputs drive the formation and evolution of glacial drainage systems, it should follow that the drainage systems of debris-covered glaciers will differ from those of debris-free glaciers. This would have implications for the proglacial runoff regime, subglacial erosion and glacier dynamics. This paper presents analysis of return curves from 33 successful dye injections into the extensively debris-covered Miage Glacier, Italian Alps. It demonstrates that the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris influences the structure and seasonal evolution of the glacial drainage system. Where the debris cover is continuous, melt is lower and the surface topography is chaotic, with many small supraglacial catchments. These factors result in an inefficient englacial/subglacial drainage network beneath continuous debris, which drains to the conduit system emanating from the upper ablation zone. Melt rates are high in areas of clean and dirty ice above the continuous debris. Runoff from these areas is concentrated by inter-moraine troughs into large supraglacial streams, which encourages the early-season development of an efficient englacial/subglacial conduit system downstream of this area. Drainage efficiency from the debris-covered area increases over the melt season but dye-trace transit velocity remains lower than from moulins on the upper glacier. Future runoff models should account for the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system.

AB Drywells are increasingly used to capture stormwater runoff for surface infiltration and aquifer recharge, but little research has examined the role of ubiquitous subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell performance. Numerical experiments were therefore conducted using the HYDRUS (2D/3D) software to systematically study the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywall infiltration. Subsurface heterogeneity was described deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses, or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance (sigma) and horizontal (X) and vertical (Z) correlation lengths. The infiltration rate increased when a high permeability layer/lens was located at the bottom of the drywell, and had larger vertical and especially horizontal dimensions. Furthermore, the average cumulative infiltration (1) for 100 stochastic realizations of a given subsurface heterogeneity increased with sigma and X, but decreased with Z. This indicates that the presence of many highly permeable, laterally extending lenses provides a larger surface area for enhanced infiltration than the presence of isolated, highly permeable lenses. The ability to inversely determine soil hydraulic properties from numerical drywall infiltration results was also investigated. The hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of a highly permeable lens could be accurately determined for certain idealized situations (e.g., simple layered profiles) using constant head tests. However, variability in soil hydraulic properties could not be accurately determined for systems that exhibited more realistic stochastic heterogeneity. In this case, the heterogeneous profile could be replaced with an equivalent homogeneous profile and values of an effective isotropic saturated conductivity (K-s) and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function (alpha) could be inversely determined. The average value of K-s for 100 stochastic realizations showed a similar dependency to I on sigma, X, and Z. Whereas, the average value of alpha had large confidence interval for soil heterogeneity parameters and played a secondary role in drywell infiltration. This research provides valuable insight on the selection of site, design, installation, and long-term performance of a drywell.

AB Floodplains may alternate between discharge zones for regional groundwater and areas of recharge from river water during high-flow events. Understanding the mechanisms and timescales of recharge on floodplains is important for their management and for the protection of fragile ecosystems. The floodplains of the River Murray host important ecosystems, particularly remnant eucalypt forests that are vulnerable to changes in inundation, rising regional water tables, and salt accumulation. This study addresses floodplain recharge and groundwater mixing on the Pike and Katarapko floodplains of South Australia. At Pike,H- 3 activities of groundwater in the low hydraulic conductivity Coonambidgal Formation that crops out on the floodplain are similar to 0.25 TU, H-3 activities of groundwater in the underlying higher hydraulic conductivity Monoman Formation decrease from similar to 1 TU near the contact with the Coonambidgal Formation to < 0.02 TU at > 15 m depth. Groundwater C-14 activities are between 40 and 95 pMC but are less well correlated with depth. The H-3 or C-14 activities do not vary systematically with distance from the surface water channels on the floodplains. These observations imply that groundwater recharge at Pike is dominantly through the floodplain rather than through the channel banks. In contrast to the regional groundwater where total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations are commonly > 35,000 mg/L, the TDS of groundwater on the floodplain is locally < 500 mg/L. A correlation between H-3 activities and TDS and the presence of groundwater with relatively low C-14 activities but above detection H-3 activities implies that recently recharged waters have mixed with regional groundwater in the floodplain sediments. The H-3 activities in these mixed waters implies that mixing occurs over a few years. By contrast, at Katarapko, the highest 3 H activities in the Monoman Formation groundwater (up to 2.35 TU) are closer to the Murray River, implying that recharge through the bank may occur. These contrasting patterns of recharge probably reflect local topographic controls. Understanding the recharge-discharge relationships are vital for managing proposed floodplain inundation programs aimed at improving ecosystem health.

AB The Fitero and Arnedillo geothermal systems are located in the NW part of the Iberian Range (Northern Spain). The geothermal reservoir is hosted in the Lower Jurassic carbonates, in contact with the evaporitic Keuper Fades. Thermal waters are of chloride-sodium type with discharge temperature of about 45 degrees C and near neutral pH. The Arnedillo waters are more saline with higher Na, Cl and sulphate contents, but lower Ca and Mg than the Fitero waters. All waters have attained mineral equilibrium at depth with calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, quartz, albite, K-feldspar and other aluminosilicates, except for the Fitero waters, which have not reached the equilibrium with the aluminosilicates. The calculated reservoir temperature is 81 +/- 11 degrees C in Fitero and 87 +/- 13 degrees C in Arnedillo. In order to identify the reasons for the differences found between the two systems some inverse and forward geochemical calculations were performed and the main water-rock interaction processes responsible for the chemical evolution of these waters have been evaluated.
   Halite dissolution has been found to be the triggering factor for the two most important geochemical processes in the system: a) albitisation process, due to the common ion effect (Na); and b) dedolomitisation process, associated with the salinity increase, which enhance the dissolution of anhydrite and, in turn, produces the precipitation of calcite (common ion effect, Ca) and the concomitant dissolution of dolomite.
   Halite dissolution may be an important driving force in the geochemical evolution of groundwater systems in contact with carbonates and evaporites, where equilibrium with K-feldspar, albite and anhydrite has already been attained. The evolution of the processes at pH, temperature and salinity ranges wider than those in the Fitero-Amedillo system has been theoretically examined with additional reaction-path simulations, in order to generalise the geochemical behaviour of these processes in other environments.

AB Riparian zones are essential to preserve water quality of rivers adjacent to large areas of irrigated agriculture. We used HYDRUS (2D/3D) to quantify the long-term (8 years) influence of crops (almonds, wine grapes and potatocarrot) irrigated with recycled water on water and solute exchange at the Gawler River interface in relation to vegetation buffer widths from 10 to 110 m. We found that under almond and annual horticulture the likely average annual water flow from the irrigated area to the river was nearly twice as much (2.1 and 1.8, respectively) that under wine grapes. The hydraulic exchange at river interface for different irrigated crops was found to be sensitive to the buffer widths. For wine grapes, almonds and annual horticulture, the average annual hydraulic balance reached an equilibrium at 20, 65 and 55 m buffer widths, respectively. Furthermore, for wine grapes, with a 20 m buffer width, the average annual load of salts became negligible. This study shows that buffer widths of 20, 60, and 40 m for irrigated wine grapes, almond, and annual horticulture, respectively, are needed to restrict the migration of salts to the river. Further refinements are possible by incorporating the influence of preferential flow paths, improved water stress response functions, and addressing the data limitations for calibration of the model for solute dynamics.

AB This paper presents novel flux and source term treatments within a Godunov-type finite volume framework for predicting the depth-averaged shallow water flow and sediment transport with enhanced the accuracy and stability. The suspended load ratio is introduced to differentiate between the advection of the suspended load and the advection of water. A modified Harten, Lax and van Leer Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC) is derived for the flux calculation based on the new wave pattern involving the suspended load ratio. The source term calculation is enhanced by means of a novel splitting-point implicit discretization. The slope effect is introduced by modifying the critical shear stress, with two treatments being discussed. The numerical scheme is tested in five examples that comprise both fixed and movable beds. The model predictions show good agreement with measurement, except for cases where local three-dimensional effects dominate.

AB In this research, a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model (HGT-MPM) is proposed for solving trans-boundary water conflicts in Guanting reservoir basin (GRB) between two cities (Le., Zhangjiakou and Beijing) in north China. A water allocation model, which considers both water quality and quantity, is developed for optimizing water use and pollutant discharge in the two cities, maximizing the net aggregate benefits from these activities and reducing the costs for water supply and pollution removal. The initial rights of water use and pollutant discharge are allocated to the cities of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, as two players based on the incorporation of a negotiation method for ill-defined water rights within the watershed. At this stage, equal treatment of every player's benefit claim can be addressed. The strategy spaces of the two players are delineated through solving the proposed HGT-MPM with mutual benefit claim constraints. The Rubinstein bargaining solution method is employed to identify the equilibrium of bargaining. To achieve maximal benefits for the two players, starting from allocating the results of the second step, the concepts of Core and Nash solutions of cooperative games are used to generate stable basin-wide cooperative solutions. Both players find it beneficial to cooperate with side payment from the downstream to upstream. At this stage, the principle of maximum economic benefits is mainly considered. The results indicate that unclear initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights can be fairly defined through bilateral negotiations between upstream and downstream. Without side payment, the initial water rights and pollutant discharge allocation will be the final outcome, which is sub-optimal, although it is better than the status quo in term of both total and individual benefits. Full cooperation with side payment leads to the greatest total net benefits and the greatest benefits to each individual city. The results not only provide a basis to allocate trans-jurisdictional water rights and pollutant discharge rights in an equal and efficient way but also provide certain inspirations for management policy improvement, such as establishing a water right trading system.

AB Cyclic injection and production by a single well is a technique used in applications such as natural gas storage, compressed air energy storage and periodic pumping tests. The induced flow and saturation distribution can sometimes be modeled assuming two immiscible and incompressible fluids. An analytical solution is derived for such one-dimensional cyclic flow using the method of characteristics. The solution usually exhibits a front or discontinuity, in which case the contour integral method is applied in the derivation. Saturation (S) is expressed as a function of time, distance from well, mobility ratio and production to injection time ratio t(prod)/t(inj). Derivation is carried out for both linear S(x) and radial S(r) flow. Dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and various cases are analyzed. A simple model for viscosity reduction of the reservoir fluid is presented, accounting for changes in mobility ratio, e.g., following cyclic injection for enhanced oil recovery. It is found that generally, for t(prod)/t(inj) >= 1 the solution converges to a periodic steady state, however, for t(prod)/t(inj) < 1 or when accounting for viscosity reduction, such a state is not reached and the injected phase penetrates deeper with each cycle.

AB Peatlands are a dominant land feature in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), comprising > 50% of the total land area, many of which are moderate-rich fens. The carbon stocks of moderate-rich fens in the WBP are susceptible to degradation through anthropogenic- and climate-related factors, yet, few studies have aimed to understand their hydrologic function. This study, located in a meltwater channel belt characterized by relatively thin outwash sand and gravel (similar to 6 m) underlying the peat, provides the first hydrological assessment of a moderate-rich fen in the AOSR. The lithology, hydrological function and groundwater geochemistry all point to the dominance of a local flow system supplying groundwater to the fen areas, evidenced by a thick (similar to 16 m) and shallow (similar to 7 m below ground surface) aquitard underlying the outwash, restricting hydrological connectivity between the fen and underlying regional aquifers. Vertical hydraulic gradients between the peat and underlying outwash aquifer, and horizontal hydraulic gradients between the fen and upland varied in response to both short-term and seasonal precipitation trends. Groundwater discharge to the fen was enhanced during wet periods characterized by high rainfall. Conversely, flow reversals (groundwater recharge; fen to underlying aquifer and upland), and subsequently, enhanced fen water table drawdown persisted during extended dry periods. This local groundwater flow-system influences recharge/discharge patterns at Poplar Fen, with hydraulic head in the underlying outwash aquifer highly susceptible to fluctuations in the presence and absence of precipitation-driven recharge from adjacent uplands. Moderate-rich fens similar to that studied here will likely become more susceptible to drying in the future due to a changing climate, leading to enhanced water table drawdown, peat oxidation and subsequent decomposition, vulnerability to wildfire, and seral succession to a more ombrogenous peatland system.

AB Understanding how catchment streamflow response varies in time and at different spatial scales is critical to assess runoff production and water availability in mountain areas. Very little work on comparing runoff generation processes in catchments of increasing size has been done in Dolomitic areas. In this research, we adopted a nested catchment (0.14-109km(2) ) approach to i) assess whether and how streamflow response at the seasonal and the rainfall-runoff event time scale varies with increasing spatial scale, and ii) identify the main factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow response in three mountain catchments in the Italian Dolomites. We used precipitation and streamflow data from June to September of 13 consecutive years (2005-2017) available for all three catchments, and computed runoff coefficients, stormflow volumes, streamflow peaks and lag times between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak for 203 rainfall-runoff events occurred during the study period. Results show that, overall, specific streamflow and runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale. However, this pattern was disrupted at the end of spring-beginning of summer due to the relevant snowmelt contribution to streamflow in the intermediate catchment characterized by the largest fraction of high-elevation areas, where deep snowpack accumulated during the winter. The probability distribution of runoff coefficients was very well represented by a Beta-distribution for all three catchments, suggesting that analogous factors controlled the variability of runoff coefficients. This was confirmed by multiple regression analysis that revealed that event rainfall amount, storm duration and 3-12 days antecedent precipitation (assumed as a proxy for antecedent wetness conditions) explained up to 0.81 of the variability of streamflow response, with a minor role of rainfall intensity. Further research is needed to assess whether detailed measurements of hydrological variables collected at the small catchment scale (< 1 km(2)) could be deemed as representative for the hydrological response of larger catchments.

AB Rigorous validation of the first-order detachment-transport coupling concept using different sediment sizes is nonexistent in the literature. We hypothesized that particle sizes in a sediment-laden flow can affect soil detachment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between detachment rates by rill flows and hydraulic parameters under low flow discharges, and to quantify the responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and median sizes. A concentrated flow flume test was conducted under three low flow discharges (0.00033, 0.00067 and 0.00100 m(2).s(-1)) and three sediment concentrations (50, 100 and 200 kg.m(-3)) with five median sizes (0.233, 0.204, 0.169, 0.115 and 0.078 mm). The results showed that the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model well (R-2 = 0.89). Stream power, compared with shear stress, is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rates under different sediment concentrations. The soil detachment rates by sediment-laden rill flows were negatively related to both sediment loads and sediment median sizes, validating the first-order sediment feedback relationships used in the WEPP model. The overall responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and sediment median sizes followed multivariate linear relationships, further demonstrating the negative feedbacks of sediment load and size on soil detachment by rill flow.

AB Snowmelt is the principal control on the timing and magnitude of water flow through mountainous watersheds. The effects of precipitation type and quantity on storage and hydrologic connectivity in mountainous systems were explored by combining the observed stable isotope delta O-18 in rain, snow, snowmelt, and streamflow with numerically simulated hydrologic boundary fluxes and inverse techniques applied to transient travel time distributions (TTD) using StorAge Selection (SAS) functions. Hydrologic simulations of the East River (ER, 85 km(2)), a snow-dominated Colorado River headwater basin, for water years 2006-2017 were used to test a diverse set of snow accumulation scenarios. During the snowmelt period, the ER released younger water during high storage periods across seasonal and annual timescales (an "inverse storage effect"). Additionally, more young water was released from storage during wet years than during dry years. However, wet years also appeared to increase hydrologic connectivity, which simultaneously flushed older water from the basin. During years with reduced snowpack, flow paths were inactivated and snowmelt remained in the subsurface to become older water that was potentially reactivated in subsequent wet years. Incremental warming in hydrologic model simulations was used to evaluate TTD sensitivity to precipitation changing from snow to rain. Despite the altered timing of boundary fluxes because of warming, years with basin average precipitation above 3.25 mm d (-1) (1200 mm y(-1)) were resilient to temperature increases up to 10 degrees C with respect to annual water balance partitioning and streamflow TTD. In contrast, years with less precipitation were sensitive to increased temperatures, showing marked increases in the fraction of inflow lost to evapotranspiration. Younger water was preferentially lost to evapotranspiration, which led to an increase in the mean age of streamflow in drier years.

AB Satellite products, like all datasets, are subject to errors and uncertainties. Due to inherent biases embedded in satellite precipitation estimates, we present an error-adjustment approach based on the statistical differences between satellite precipitation products and in-situ observations (observed errors) employing two widely-used error models, namely that additive and the multiplicative error models, in an attempt to assess their suitability for the error correction of satellite-based daily precipitation estimates over northeast Austria. An error-adjustment technique based on the concept of the copula is adopted and applied to correct the supplied precipitation fields. It was found that IMERG precipitation estimates improved after error adjustment when compared to original satellite precipitation estimate (OSPE). The additive error model resulted in a better improvement by fitting the entire range of data when compared with the multiplicative error model. Moreover, the additive error model extracted the error with more accuracy and produced a better estimation of their characteristics, while the method based on the multiplicative error was less robust. However, the overall spatial dependence of the observed errors is reasonably preserved as that of the generated errors by copula. In addition, the validation results implied that the simulated realizations en or-adjusted band, encompassed the observed data reasonably. Moreover, the copula-based simulations associated with the additive error model performed much better in comparison to the multiplicative error model. Overall, by using the t-copula model with an emphasis on the additive error model and imposing the simulated error fields on the OSPE, one may generate multiple realizations of precipitation fields.

AB Adequate and accurate hydrological data is necessary to manage water resources, which are critical in developing countries where such information is limited. In recent years, global reanalysis datasets have been developed to provide this information in climatic fields and, more recently, in hydrologic fields. Nevertheless, these latest efforts have been limited to temporal coverage (similar to 30 years) and mostly simplified hydraulic scheme routing in rivers, which can be inadequate for regional and long term scale objectives. In this article, a dataset (called hydrological reanalysis across the 20th century [HRXX] in the Amazon Basin) was developed as a case study spanning back to the year 1900 through the use of: 1) a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (MGB) forced by a long-term climatic reanalysis of rainfall (ERA-20CM) with bias removed; and 2) a data assimilation (DA) technique coupled with a localization method (LEnKF) to use several ground observations of daily discharge within a radius of influence. Several tests were assessed to find the best bias removal method, the optimal radius of influence for the localization method and the final HRXX dataset. A total of 114 hydrological ground observations of daily information were used for assimilation and validation purposes, and several statistics indexes were employed to assess their performance. Results indicate that both bias correction and the DA with localization method greatly improved the simulations. Ove restimations of the peaks in the open-loop (OL) (free run) simulation, mainly in the southern and northern regions of the Amazon Basin, were removed, and recession timing in the east-central region, as seen at the Obidos gauge station, were corrected. An average performance of similar to 0.6 and similar to 0.7 of the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta indexes was reached, even when only a few of the longest ground observations were used, which can be representative of the oldest periods (since similar to 1930). To assess extreme events, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used for maximum and minimum annual water level anomaly values, reaching 0.6 and 0.7, respectively, at the Manaus gauge station, which is remarkable considering that the analysis covers approximately 110 years. Considering the results of this case study and the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions in order to better estimate and create a hydrological reanalysis that adequately represents the hydrologic and hydraulic spatio-temporal fields.

AB Determining the bathymetric properties of a river, lake or reservoir is important for many reasons because it identifies location of sections with sedimentation or erosion which indicate the key processes and biophysical habitat status. This study used observational data of a 5 km section of the Danube River (transformed into a reservoir after 1972) to determine the best GIS interpolation method and the optimal number of sampling points to get an accurate description of the riverbed. Nine interpolation methods were used to generate bathymetric maps of the Danube course, between km 955 and km 950, in the area of Iron Gates reservoir, using a variable number of points (n = 1943; n = 4328; n = 17139), obtained by single beam echo sounder. Six methods of deterministic interpolation have been used: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) - criteria automatically determined (CAD) and manually determined (MD); Local Polynomial Interpolation (LPI) - criteria automatically determined (CAD) and manually determined (MD); Radial Basis Function (RBF) - fully regularized spline CRS; Radial Basis Function RBF - spline with tension SWT, and three geo-statistics methods: Ordinary Kriging - OK, Simple Kriging - SK, Universal Kriging - UK. Cross-validation and bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM s) analysis were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated data and maps. The two interpolation methods, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW-MD) and Simple Kriging (SK), provide satisfactory results, even in the case of a small number of points (n = 1943). If the number of measured points grows and a section grid (perpendicular/longitudinal) is developed, the DEM s bathymetric accuracy improves significantly, especially in the case of complex morphology, even if the positive and negative forms of the bed lead to sudden changes in the measured values. The obtained results revealed differences between the interpolation methods used, particularly in the case of a small number of points measured per perpendicular trajectories, but by the addition of points on longitudinal paths, a significant improvement of the bathymetric maps is obtained.

AB Understanding CO2 migration and distribution in fault systems is essential to evaluate long-term secure CO2 storage and prevent hazardous effects caused by CO2 leakage. To elucidate the role of the fault system on subsurface CO2 migration and leakage processes, a two-dimensional multi-phase transport model was constructed to represent Little Grand Wash (LGW) and Salt Wash (SW) faults, where naturally originating CO2 is being leaked to the surface. According to simulation results, buoyant CO2 leaked through various pathways including the faults themselves, fault offsets, and damaged caprock. Because of both fault systems and caprocks serving as barriers, multiple trapped CO2 plumes were developed in this region. Presence of trapped CO2 plumes in the subsurface is supported by multiple field-observations (e.g., elevated soil CO2 fluxes, travertines, and CO2-driven cold-water geysers/CO2 springs) adjacent to both LGW and SW faults. Sensitivity studies were conducted with different permeabilities for faults and caprock, various CO2 source locations, and differing fault parameters (e.g., fault throw and cutoff angle), which affected subsurface CO2 distribution including size, shape, and location of trapped CO2 plumes. Finally, such trapped CO2 plumes have played a key role in the development of CO2-driven cold-water geysers in these regions.

AB Vegetation growth in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a crucial process for quantifying ecohydrological modelling, as it influences evapotranspiration, interception, soil erosion and biomass production. The simplified version of Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) in SWAT was originally designed for temperate regions and naturally based on temperature to simulate growth cycles of vegetation. However, tropical or subtropical vegetation growth is mainly controlled by rainfall. Due to this limitation, current SWAT simulations in tropics and subtropics have been facing a series of problems on vegetation dormancy, water balance and sediment yield. Therefore, we proposed an approach to enhance the modelling of SWAT vegetation dynamics with remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), to finally increase the applicability of SWAT in tropical or subtropical areas. Spatially and temporally continuous LAI products (1 day, 500 m) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were integrated into SWAT to replace the LAI simulated by built-in EPIC module. Two advanced filter algorithms were employed to derive a downscaled LAI (30 m) to keep a consistent spatial scale with the size of Hydrological Response Units (HRU) and open data (i.e. SRTM, 30 m), and the source code of the plant growth module were correspondingly modified to incorporate the downscaled LAI into SWAT. To examine the performance of our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in a representative middle-scale (6384 km(2)) subtropical watershed of Meichuan basin, China, and detailed analysis was performed to investigate its ecohydrological effects, such as streamflow, sediment yield and LAI dynamics from 2001 to 2014. Model performances were compared among three scenarios: (1) original SWAT, (2) SWAT with a corrected plant dormancy function, and (3) modified SWAT after integration of MODIS LAI (our proposed method). Results showed that the modified SWAT took advantage of downscaled MODIS LAI and produced more reasonable seasonal curves of vegetation cover factor (C) of plants than the original model. Correspondingly, the modified SWAT substantially improved streamflow and sediment simulations. The findings demonstrated that SWAT model can be a useful tool for simulating ecohydrological process for subtropical ecosystems when integrated with our proposed method.

AB The quasi-exact implicit (QEI) analytical formulation of Haverkamp equation, which might be also known as Parlange model, and its one- and two-term approximate expansions are among the mostly used equations for in situ determination of soil sorptivity, S, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, from unsaturated one-dimensional (1D) cumulative infiltration into soils. However, from practical point of view, the approximate expansions are only valid from short to intermediate times and the QEI analytical formulation has a complex resolution, which makes its use complicated in inverting procedures. Therefore, alternative functions are needed to compute cumulative infiltration for longer times and improve inverting procedures for easier, more robust and accurate predictions of S and K-s. In this regard, current work presents and evaluates a new three-term approximation of the QEI analytical formulation. As a first step, we checked the accuracy of the proposed three-term approximate expansion with respect to the QEI formulation for three different soils (sand, loam and silt) in order to define its time domain validity. Next, the accuracy of the three-term approximate expansion to estimate S, K-s and the beta parameter was compared to those obtained with one- and two-term approximate expansions. Lastly, a large dataset of field experimental data was inverted using the proposed three approximate expansions and the QEI analytical formulation, and goodness of fits predicted and measured cumulative infiltration curves and accuracy of the parameters (S, K-s and the beta) estimates were compared. The results revealed that the three-term approximate has a larger validity time interval compared to one- and two-term approximate expansions, which allows its use for larger infiltration times durations resulting in more accurate estimates of K-s. Its capability of estimating S is also improved. The accurate prediction of beta parameter is not still guaranteed for none of the approximate expansions. Compared to the one- and two-term approximate expansions, the experimental infiltration data usage revealed that the three-term approximate expansion resulted in higher performance and better prediction of hydraulic parameters.

AB The Budyko framework, used for water balance studies, is an effective tool that estimates the actual evapotranspiration, balancing between energy and water availabilities. In this study, we investigate eight Budyko framework equations as well as the GR1A and GR2M models on the Nile tributary Blue-Nile catchment. On the annual time scale, all investigated models and equations show poor results. Moreover, the resulting errors on the monthly scale show a clear pattern of seasonality and autocorrelation. To overcome such deficiencies, we propose a time series SARIMA model, to fit the error term of the best performing Budyko equation. Building on the time series capabilities, we extend the Budyko framework to allow the incorporation of values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from previous months. The selected performance criteria are the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, as well as the coefficient of determination and bias. The novel hybrid SARIMAX-Budyko model exhibits high performance not only on the Blue Nile but also on other five major rivers worldwide. The proposed model outperforms the previously published Budyko equations, as well as the GRIM and GR2A as benchmark models, in almost all performance criteria and especially on the annual time scale.

AB Domestic sewage is a key source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries, especially in China, where a large amount of highly concentrated nutrients is directly discharged into the receiving waters. Therefore, in this study, a set of ecological ditch systems was designed to remove nutrients from rural domestic sewage in the hilly area of the central Sichuan Basin, China. The results show that the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies range from 14.87% to 84.24%, with an average of 47.97%, and the total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies range from 13.93% to 86.22% with an average of 49.79%. The highest daily TN and TP removal rates are 13.06 and 1.30 g M(-2)d(-1), respectively, and the average removal rates are 3.19 g m(-2)d(-1) for TN and 0.28 g m(-2)d(-1) for TP. Our results indicate that the ecological ditch system to treat rural domestic sewage with high nutrient concentrations can be used in the study area or areas with similar topography. Furthermore, we found that the nutrient removal efficiencies exhibit considerable seasonal variations and are sensitive to the hydraulic flow rates. The nutrient removal capacity of the ecological ditch system is therefore somewhat limited. Based on our findings, the use of winter-hardy wetland plants and increase of the size of the filter unit are recommended to make the ecological ditch system more efficient and maintain high nutrient removal rates year-round. Furthermore, we suggest that regular mowing of plants and the removal of accumulated sediment are necessary to manage the ecological ditch system.

TI Aridland spring response to mesoscale precipitation: Implications for
   groundwater-dependent ecosystem sustainability

AB Aridland springs maintain groundwater-dependent habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species. San Solomon Spring (Texas, USA) is part of a regional karst spring complex in the Chihuahuan Desert that supports several species of federal and state conservation interest. However, drought, climatic variability, and groundwater abstraction threaten discharge and water quality. In the surrounding Delaware Basin, expansion in unconventional oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing may increase demands on aquifers that also provide flows to the springs. A critical knowledge gap limiting habitat conservation and sustainable groundwater abstraction is that the flow system is not well understood. While the source of most spring discharge is from a Pleistocene-recharged regional flow system, evidence suggests that a modern local flow component provides fresh water influx. However, the exact sources, mechanisms, and timing of localized recharge are unknown. To address these questions, this study combined long-term in-situ spring water quality monitoring (specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) data with weather station-corrected 4 km gridded precipitation data to quantify the lag response at San Solomon Springs to mesoscale storm events and to delineate potential local recharge zones. Between April 2011 and March 2012, 26 event-flow responses were documented, with an average lag of 43 days between storm event and spring response. Response time varied depending on storm magnitude, spatial extent, and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Cross-correlation analysis of spatially distributed precipitation indicated zones of potential local recharge in the mountain block/mountain front zones and alluvial channels issuing from the Davis Mountains. Some local flow paths appear to cross known watershed boundaries, suggesting that groundwater abstraction in sensitive capture zones should be managed carefully to maintain spring flows and conserve habitats.

AB The relevance of hydrological processes varies in space and time resulting in typical temporal patterns for catchments. Contrasting catchments moreover differ in their catchment metrics. Hydrological models claim to be able to reproduce typical temporal patterns of dominant processes using site-specific model parameters. Thus, patterns of temporal dynamics in dominant modelled processes and their corresponding dominant parameters are a fingerprint of how a model represents the hydrological behaviour of a catchment and how these process patterns vary between contrasting catchments.
   In this study, we demonstrate how catchment metrics, modelled processes and parameter dominances can be jointly used to characterise catchments. We assess how catchment characteristics are represented in spatiotemporal process dynamics in models and how to understand the reasons for hydrological (dis)similarity among catchments along a landscape gradient. For this purpose, catchment metrics which characterise contrasting landscapes (lowland, mid-range mountain and alpine catchments) are related to dominant processes and parameters which were provided by a temporally resolved sensitivity analysis (TEDPAS) and simulations of a hydrological model.
   Our study shows that the applied model is able to represent the different processes and their seasonal variability according to the specific hydrological conditions of the study catchments. By analysing catchment metrics, modelled processes and model parameters jointly, we show that the largest differences are identified for the alpine catchment, whilst similarities are found among the other catchments. Following a landscape gradient, high flow phases are dominated by different flow components. In contrast, the model shows groundwater dominance in low flow phases in non-alpine catchments while in the alpine catchment low flows in winter are mainly controlled by snow processes. The joint analysis of catchment metrics, temporal dynamics of dominant processes and parameters can therefore be used to better disentangle similarities and differences among catchments from different landscapes.

AB Managing water resource systems usually involves conflicts. Water recognizes no borders, defining the global geopolitics of water conflicts, cooperation, negotiations, management, and resource development. Negotiations to develop mechanisms for two or more states to share an international watercourse involve complex networks of natural, social and political system (Islam and Susskind, 2013). The Kabul River Basin presents unique circumstances for developing joint agreements for its utilization, rendering moot unproductive discussions of the rights of upstream and downstream states based on principles of absolute territorial sovereignty or absolute territorial integrity (McCaffrey, 2007). This paper analyses the different stages of water conflict transformation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It first examines historical disputes between the upstream and downstream riparians, revolving around contending rights claims, resulting in zero-sum confrontations with one party's loss as another's gain, possibly ending in confrontation. The paper then formulates a decision support tool, a mechanism for transforming conflict into cooperation, and concludes by introducing practical methods for identifying basin needs and sharing benefits, enabling riparians to negotiate a win-win process.

AB Study objectives: To assess the relationship between real and simulated driving performance and the objective level of alertness as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) in patients suffering from narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.
   Methods: Twenty-seven patients (10 patients with narcolepsy, type 1 (n = 7) and type 2 (n = 3), and 17 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, mean age = 33.8 +/- 11.1 years, range = 18e65 y; four males) were recruited in a randomized, crossover, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, and compared to 27 matched healthy controls. Patients were randomly assigned to receive modafinil (400 mg) or placebo before the driving test (2 h of real and 2 h of simulated highway driving for each patient). Standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) of the vehicle in real and simulated driving and mean sleep latency in a 4 x 40 min MWT were assessed.
   Results: Untreated patients presented shorter sleep latencies on the MWT (20.8 (IQ range 16.1-32.9) vs. 34.9 min (IQ range 28.1-40.0)) and worse simulated driving performance (P < 0.001) than treated patients. Nevertheless, treated patients still exhibited shorter mean sleep latencies on the MWT than controls (34.9 (IQ range 28.1-40.0) vs. 40 min (IQ range 37.1-40.0), P < 0.05), but driving performance was identical in both groups. The SDLP of the vehicle in real driving conditions and the MWT score correlated with the SDLP in simulated driving (respectively, r = 0.34, P < 0.05 and r = -0.56, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In patients with narcolepsy/idiopathic hypersomnia, simulated driving and MWT explore different dimensions of fitness-to-drive and could be used complementarily to better evaluate sleep-related driving impairment. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Despite the fact that the ear is the site to monitor arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) closest to carotid chemoreceptors, sleep studies almost invariably use finger probes. This study aimed to assess the timing and morphological differences between SpO2 signals at the ear and finger during CheyneeStokes respiration (CSR) in heart failure (HF) patients.
   Methods: We studied 21 HF patients with CSR during a 40-min in-laboratory resting recording. SpO2 was recorded by: (1) two identical bedside pulse-oximeters with an ear (SpO2_Ear) and a finger probe (SpO2_Finger), and (2) a standard polysomnograph with a finger probe (SpO2_PSG). We estimated the delays between signals and, for each signal, computed the mean and minimum SpO2, the magnitude of cyclic desaturations and the overall time spent with SpO2<90% (T90%).
   Results: The SpO2_Finger signal was significantly delayed [bias: 12.7 s (95% limits of agreement: 2.2, 23.0 s)] and slightly but not significantly downward-shifted with respect to SpO2_Ear. SpO2_PSG was almost synchronous with SpO2_Finger; however, a further significant downward shift was observed relative to the latter. In particular, minimum SpO2_PSG was significantly lower [-2.1% (-4.8, 0.6%)], and desaturations and T90% were significantly higher than SpO2_Finger [1.2% (-1.3, 3.7%), and 13.9% (-12.3, 40.0%), respectively].
   Conclusion: During CSR in HF patients, the marked delay between SpO2_Ear and SpO2_Finger makes the interpretation of the timing relationship between peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and ventilatory events rather difficult. The observed discrepancies between SpO2_PSG and SpO2_Finger, which may be due to differences in the processing of raw SpO2 signals, call for a standardization of processing algorithms.

AB Objective: This prospective cohort study captured the patterns of sleep, sleep-wake activity rhythm, and first-morning urinary melatonin in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.
   Methods: Breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy wore wrist actigraph for 168 h and collected first-morning void urine samples before treatment, during the first, and at the last cycle of chemotherapy. We converted actigraphy data into sleep duration, sleep efficiency, nighttime total wake time, percent rhythm, F-statistic, amplitude, mesor, and acrophase. We then assessed urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) levels.
   Results: This cohort contained 180 participants. Compared with the baseline, sleep efficiency during the first and last cycle decreased by 10.16% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 5.85%, 14.47%] and 5.01% (95% CI: 0.50%, 9.53%), respectively. Similarly, percent rhythm decreased by 27.20% (95% CI: 19.95%, 34.45%) during the first cycle and 21.20% (95% CI: 13.52, 28.89) during the last cycle. Taking the baseline as the reference, aMT6s levels during the first and last cycle decreased by 11.27% (95% CI: 0.37%, 22.16%) and 14.74% (95% CI: 2.34, 27.11), respectively.
   Conclusion: The first administration of adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with sleep disturbance and sleep-wake activity rhythm disruption among breast cancer patients, while the disturbance and disruption during the last cycle are less severe; nevertheless, repeated administration of chemotherapy results in progressive impairment of nocturnal melatonin production.

AB Background/Objectives: Evidence of an association between sleep disorders and extracranial atherosclerosis is limited and has not been studied in remote rural settings, where living conditions and cardiovascular risk factors are different than in urban centers. We assessed the relationship between the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and sleep quality in stroke-free individuals aged >= 40 years living in rural Ecuador.
   Methods: Applying a population-based study design, participants underwent face-to-face interviews using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess sleep quality, and sonographic examinations for measurement of the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). The association between the cIMT and sleep quality (as the dependent variable) was assessed by means of generalized linear models, adjusted for relevant confounders.
   Results: The mean age of 561 participants was 60.4 +/- 12.6 years (58% women). The mean PSQI was 4.6 +/- 2.2 points. Of those, 79 (14%) individuals had an increased cIMT (>1 mm). A model adjusted for demographics showed a significant association between increased cIMT and the PSQI score (beta: 0.602; 95% C.I.: 0.027-1.177; p = 0.040). This relationship was reduced when cardiovascular risk factors were added to the model (beta: 0.514; 95% C.I.: -0.072 - 1.101; p = 0.086). When the model was adjusted for demographics and psychological distress, the association between increased cIMT and the PSQI score became significant (beta: 0.573; 95% C.I.: 0.013-1.133; p = 0.045). In addition, both symptoms of depression (p = 0.032) and anxiety (p < 0.001) remained independently significant.
   Conclusions: This study shows an association between increased cIMT and the PSQI score, which is, at least, partly mediated by manifestations of psychological distress. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Parent-reported sleep disorders in children with motor disabilities: a
   comparison with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children's new norms

   PATTERNS
AB Objective: Children with motor disabilities such as cerebral palsy or neuromuscular diseases present more sleep disorders than their typically developing (TD) peers. However, research on these populations has always been performed using historical normative datasets or controls such as siblings. Therefore, we assessed the sleep quality of children with motor disabilities in comparison with a large, contemporary, general population sample.
   Methods: Demographic, medical, and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaires were sent to parents of children aged 4e18 years and followed by our tertiary pediatric neurorehabilitation clinic, and to those of school-aged children in regional primary and secondary schools. TD participant data allowed us to set pathological sleep score thresholds (T score >= 70).
   Results: We collected 245 responses for children with motor disabilities and 2891 for those from the general population (37% and 26% response rates, respectively). Cerebral palsy was the most frequent diagnosis (N = 109, 44.5%). Children with motor disabilities had significantly more frequent pathological sleep reported in their total SDSC score (7% vs 1.9%, odds ratio (OR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 -7.27, p < 0.001) and in five subscores. Single-parent households and drug-resistant epilepsy showed significant positive associations with pathological sleep among children with motor disabilities. For TD peers, parental unemployment and parental nationality were positively associated with pathological sleep.
   Conclusion: This population-based study robustly estimated the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with motor disabilities. Sleep disorders were significantly more frequent in children with motor disabilities, but at a lower frequency than previously reported. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The impact of sleep-related disorders in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease on executive function performance has been scarcely studied. The aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of sleep-related disorders in chronic kidney disease pediatric patients, and to examine possible correlations with measures of executive function.
   Methods: We performed a case-control study including 51 children with chronic kidney disease stages 2 -5, aged 5-18 years, and 51 healthy controls. The parents of both patients and controls completed the Pediatric Seep Questionnaire (PSQ), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire.
   Results: Children with chronic kidney disease presented lower executive performance with higher scores in scales of executive function, and an increased risk of presenting a sleep-related disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 7.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-24.31, p < 0.005) compared to controls. In the patient group, age of chronic kidney disease onset correlated with Behavior Regulation Index T-score (r = 0.32, p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, differences between patients and controls for Metacognition Index T-scores did not persist after adjustment for sleep-related breathing disorder and insomnia scores, while differences in Behavior Regulation Index T-scores remained significant (54.15 vs 49.14, p < 0.02). Moreover, mediational analyses showed that sleep-related disorders mediated the effect of chronic kidney disease on metacognition, but not on behavioral regulation.
   Conclusion: Sleep-related disorders may in part explain the lower executive function performance during everyday life in chronic kidney disease pediatric patients. However, additional disease-related factors may influence executive function, especially in the domains of behavior regulation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: While anxiety rates are alarmingly high in short sleeping insomniacs, the relationship between insomnia and anxiety symptoms has not been extensively studied, especially in comparison to the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms. Using residency training as a naturalistic stress exposure, we prospectively assessed the role of sleep disturbance and duration on anxiety-risk in response to stress.
   Methods: Web-based survey data from 1336 first-year training physicians (interns) prior to and then quarterly across medical internship. Using mixed effects modeling, we examined how pre-internship sleep disturbance and internship sleep duration predicted symptoms of anxiety, using an established tool for quantifying symptom severity in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
   Results: Pre-internship poor sleepers are at more than twice the odds of having short sleep (<= 6 h) during internship as good sleepers (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.61, 3.57). Poor sleepers were also at twice the odds for screening positive for probable GAD diagnosis (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.26, 3.45). Notably, sleep onset insomnia strongly predicted anxiety development under stress (OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 1.49, 8.45). During internship, short sleep associated with concurrent anxiety symptoms (b = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.38, -0.14) and predicted future anxiety symptoms even more strongly (b = -0.39, 95% CI = -0.76, -0.03).
   Conclusions: Poor sleepers, particularly those with sleep onset insomnia symptoms, are vulnerable to short sleep and GAD anxiety and worry during chronic stress. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: Recent evidence indicates that adolescents' motivation to change sleep-wake patterns is low, despite significant impact of adolescent sleep problems on many areas of daytime functioning. The aim of the present study is to evaluate components of adolescents' motivation, and subsequent changes in behaviour.
   Methods: Fifty-six adolescents, aged 13-23 (M = 15.8 +/- 2.3 y; 38% m) diagnosed with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) underwent three therapy sessions involving bright light therapy to phase advance sleep patterns. Adolescents were instructed to advance wake-up times by 30-min daily. Motivation ratings of desire, ability, reason, need and commitment to change sleep patterns were taken at baseline. Sleep diaries were taken at the end of treatment session 1, with sequentially earlier wake-up times in 30-min intervals indicating compliance.
   Results: At the outset of therapy, adolescents indicated strong desire, reasons and need, yet moderate ability and commitment to advance their sleep-wake patterns. Following therapy, sleep-onset times were significantly advanced, total sleep time increased and sleep latency decreased (all p < 0.05). Therapy lasted 6-27 days (M = 13.9 +/- 4.5) and clients complied for approximately half the time (between 3 and 15 days; M = 8.8 +/- 2.7). Commitment was associated with ability (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) but not desire, reason or need (all p > 0.05). Adolescents' desire to change (r = 0.30, p = 0.03) and commitment (r = 0.30, p = 0.03) were positively correlated with behaviour change, but their need, ability and reasons were not. A mediation analysis showed that ability and desire were important in predicting behaviour change, by total effects through commitment (ie, indirectly and directly).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the total effects of ability (ie, confidence) and desire to change are the best predictors of behavioural changes, thus clinicians should focus on these components of the readiness to change model when undertaking treatments with sleep-disordered adolescents.

AB Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) but its effectiveness requires high adherence. We aimed to assess the impacts of the spouse's/partner's involvement and the quality of the couple's relationship on CPAP adherence.
   Methods: In a multicenter prospective study conducted in France, patients reported their subjective views regarding their partner's engagement in their CPAP treatment and the quality of their marital relationship using the Quality of Marriage Index. A hierarchical linear model was built to assess the predictors of CPAP adherence at day 120. Structural equation modeling was performed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the spouse's/partner's engagement and the quality of the couple's relationship on CPAP adherence.
   Results: The 290 OSA patients were predominantly male (77%), with a median age of 53 years IQR: [46; 62], median BMI: 32 kg/m(2) [28.6; 35.9] and median apnea thorn hypopnea index: 43/per hour [33; 58]. Independent factors for CPAP adherence at day 120 were the partner's encouragement of CPAP usage and a stable relationship exceeding 30 years, although emotional support or collaboration were not associated with CPAP adherence. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that spouse's/partner's engagement is directly related to CPAP adherence and improvement of symptoms, and that CPAP adherence is a mediator of disease-specific health-related quality of life. Marital quality was a significant moderator of these interactions meaning that a spouse's/partner's engagement improved adherence only when the quality of marriage index was high.
   Conclusion: Future research and integrated OSA management should systematically include and document the role of the spouse/partner in CPAP adherence. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Introduction: Sleep dysfunction is frequent in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), but polysomnographic (PSG) data is scarce. Our objectives were to: (1) compare PSG data between DLB patients and age normative values (NV), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) patients; (2) evaluate the relation between of OSA, Fluctuations and Hypersomnolence and PSG data.
   Methods: We selected all consecutive patients with DLB, PD and iRBD that underwent video-PSG during a two year period. Clinical data was collected by file review. Video-PSG data included sleep structure, Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), REM sleep atonia indexes and video file inspection of motor events (ME) during REM sleep.
   Results: Subjects: In this study, 19 DLB, 51 PD and 20 iRBD patients participated. Of those, nine DLB (DLB-RBD) and 23 PD (PD-RBD) patients had RBD. Compared to NV, DLB patients had significantly lower sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and REM sleep duration and higher sleep latency, wake after sleep onset and N2 duration. There were no significant relations between PSG data and OSA, hypersomnolence or fluctuations. Sleep latency and AHI were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in DLB compared to PD patients. ME frequency was higher in iRBD.
   Conclusion: DLB patients present significant sleep fragmentation and shortened total and REM sleep time. These changes were not related with OSA, fluctuations or hypersomnolence, suggesting a different pathophysiology. PSG data was similar in the three RBD groups, in accordance with a common neuropathological origin, except for an increase in RBD severity in patients with iRBD. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Sleep and sleep disorders in Franz Kafka's narrative works
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Franz Kafka; Sleepiness; Parasomnia; Circadian rhythm sleep-wake
   disorder
AB Objective: As Franz Kafka, one of the most important writers of the 20th century, suffered from severe chronic insomnia disorder and inadequate sleep hygiene that impaired his quality of life, we speculated that sleep disorders would be found in his narrative works.
   Methods: We read Kafka's complete literary works looking for references to sleep and sleep disorders, excluding insomnia.
   Results: In Kafka's works, sleeping well and for a long time was used as an allegory of having a pleasant life. We found that some of his characters were disturbed by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep symptoms in the context of heart failure and abnormal sleep behaviors (eg, sleep-talking, sleep-crying, sleep-laughing and dream-enacting motor manifestations). Kafka also recalled a dream where bruxism occurred.
   Conclusion: Kafka's narrative works contain characters suffering from a wide variety of sleep disorders which in some cases represent autobiographical elements but not in others indicating that he was an astute observer of people, sleep and its disorders. The inclusion of characters suffering from sleep disorders was used by Kafka as a literary resource to enrich his texts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Reduced response to gabapentin enacarbil in restless legs syndrome
   following long-term dopaminergic treatment

ID EKBOM DISEASE; AUGMENTATION; GUIDELINES; CONSENSUS
AB Objectives: To determine whether long-term treatment with dopaminergic agents (DAs) might dampen the response to a non-dopaminergic agent, such as gabapentin enacarbil.
   Methods: We performed a two-week randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled study in a single, referral center in dopamine treatment-naive patients and non-augmented patients continuously treated with dopaminergics for the last five consecutive years. Following washout from any previous CNS-active drugs, patients were randomized into one of two groups for two consecutive two-week treatment periods with gabapentin enacarbil (GBPen) and placebo. Treatment was administered at 7 PM at a fixed dose of 600 mg/day. RLS severity was measured weekly using the International RLS Scale (IRLS) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI). An M-SIT was also performed between 6 pm and midnight at the end of each treatment condition.
   Results: There were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, duration of disease, ferritin levels, RLS severity at baseline, or existing concomitant conditions. Both groups improved more during treatment with GBPen than during placebo on the IRLS scale, CGI and mSIT. However, improvements were greater in the DA-naive group than in long-term treatment with DAs group on the IRLS (p < 0.05), CGI (p < 0.01), and mSIT (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Previous long-term treatment with DAs reduces future response to GBPen in RLS patients. Potential pathiophysiological explanations are discussed. Our finding has strong implications for the initial choice of treatment in RLS and supports the notion that initial treatment should not be started with DAs. Classification of evidence: The study provides class II evidence supporting reduced effects of gabapentin enacarbil in RLS patients previously exposed to long-term treatment with dopamine agonists.

TI Impact of acute sleep restriction on cerebral glucose metabolism during

   HOMEOSTASIS; TOPOGRAPHY
AB Background: Restricting time in bed improves insomnia symptoms, but the neural mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Total and partial acute sleep restriction may be useful paradigms for elucidating these effects. We examined the impact of acute sleep restriction on cerebral glucose metabolism during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in individuals with primary insomnia (n = 17) and good sleep (n = 19).
   Methods: Participants underwent [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans during baseline and recovery NREM sleep following one night of partial or total sleep restriction. We compared group differences in baseline-recovery changes, as well as main effects of group and condition (baseline vs. recovery NREM sleep), for relative regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMR(glc)), whole-brain glucose metabolism, and sleep quality.
   Results: Relative rCMR(glc) was significantly lower during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline in the left frontoparietal cortex, medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, with no significant group differences. Good sleepers, but not insomnia patients, had lower whole-brain glucose metabolism during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline. Acute sleep restriction improved sleep quality in individual with insomnia. Subgroup analyses including only participants who underwent partial sleep restriction yielded the same pattern of findings.
   Conclusion: Individuals with insomnia and good sleepers showed similar relative rCMR(glc) responses to acute sleep restriction. Brain regions showing the greatest baseline-recovery changes in both groups included regions previously shown to have smaller sleep-wake differences in patients with primary insomnia. Acute sleep restriction, and by extension sleep restriction therapy, may impact regional metabolic alterations that characterize insomnia. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep disruption is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperglycemia. We recently reported the effectiveness of a continuous care intervention (CCI) emphasizing nutritional ketosis for improving HbA1c, body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in T2D patients. The present study assessed the effect of this CCI approach on sleep quality using a subjective patient-reported sleep questionnaire.
   Methods: A non-randomized, controlled longitudinal study; 262 T2D and 116 prediabetes patients enrolled in the CCI and 87 separately recruited T2D patients continued usual care (UC) treatment. Patients completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. A PSQI score of >5 (scale 0 to 21) was used to identify poor sleepers.
   Results: Global sleep quality improved in the CCI T2D (p < 0.001) and prediabetes (p < 0.001) patients after one year of intervention. Subjective sleep quality (component 1), sleep disturbance (component 5) and daytime dysfunction (component 7), also showed improvements in the CCI T2D (p < 0.01 for sleep quality and sleep disturbance; and p < 0.001 for daytime dysfunction) and prediabetes patients (p < 0.001 for all three components); compared to the UC T2D group after one year. The proportion of patients with poor sleep quality was significantly reduced after one year of CCI (T2D; from 68.3% at baseline to 56.5% at one year, p = 0.001 and prediabetes; from 77.9% at baseline to 48.7% at one year, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates improved sleep quality as assessed by PSQI in patients with T2D and prediabetes undergoing CCI including nutritional ketosis but not in T2D patients receiving UC. The dietary intervention benefited both sleep quality and the severity of T2D symptoms suggesting that nutritional ketosis improves overall health via multiple mechanisms. (c) 2019 The Authors.

   FALLS
AB Objectives: The present study explored associations between sleep and children's dual-task performance using cognitive-motor dual tasks (eg, walking and talking). Previous research with older adults indicated correlations between higher gait variability and unfavorable sleep continuity variables. Based on this research, as a first objective, we investigated similar correlations in a sample of children. Second, we explored correlations between dual-task performance and dimensions of sleep architecture. Third, we tested moderating effects of prematurity on these associations.
   Methods: In this study, 7- to 12-year-old children were tested in dual-task situations; of those, 39 were formerly preterm, and 59 were full-term born children. They were asked to walk and simultaneously perform different cognitive tasks. Gait was measured using an electronic walkway system. Sleep was measured using inehome sleep-electroencephalography.
   Results: After accounting for age and cognition, regression analyses revealed correlations between a higher number of awakenings after sleep onset and lower dual-task performance; concerning sleep architecture, analyses revealed correlations between a higheramount of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and lower gait variability. Furthermore, associations between a higher amount of slow wave sleep (SWS) and children's higher cognitive performance were found. Moderation analyses indicated no effects of prematurity.
   Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that a more disrupted sleep was related to children's poorer dual-task performance. Our findings support claims that REM sleep seems more related to performance in procedural tasks whereas SWS seems more related to performance in declarative tasks, suggesting that different sleep stages may support the processing of different performance types.

AB Background: Residual snoring in children with obstructive sleep disordered breathing (SDB) may continue post-adenotonsillectomy. This study aims to identify baseline dentofacial differences in children with SDB using routine orthodontic records that might aid effective early intervention for the upper airway to prevent continued obstruction.
   Methods: Children (6-16 years) with clinically diagnosed SDB from a paediatric Otolaryngology Clinic who required adenotonsillectomy were participants (n = 10). The control group (n = 9) comprised healthy non-snoring children from the community. Baseline overnight polysomnography (PSG), standardised frontal and right profile photographs and alginate impressions were taken of all children. Facial width, length, depth, convexity and mandibular position were measured from the photographs. The occlusion, arch width, arch depth, maxillary arch form, palatal height and volume were recorded from digitised dental models. Inter-group differences were compared.
   Results: SDB patients had a significantly increased lower face height, maxillo-mandibular angle (1.73 degrees; 95% CI 0.45-3.0) and a narrower maxillary arch in the upper posterior region. There was a trend towards a decreased palatal volume, increased posterior crossbite and Class II molar relationship.
   Conclusion: Dentofacial phenotypic differences between children with SDB and controls can be detected using facial photographs and dental models. Increased awareness of these features may help to identify children who to continue to snore post adenotonsillectomy. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to enhance our understanding of clinical trends in sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) propensity on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Demographic variables of interest included early childhoodadvanced age, gender, race, and REM-suppressant use.
   Methods: Nocturnal sleep studies and 5-nap MSLTs were retrieved from a large repository of deidentified studies from various US sleep clinics between 2007 and 2015. Studies were signal processed, human-edited, and underwent rigorous quality assurance for inclusion.
   Results: The final sample consisted of N = 2498 MSLTs (24.2% Black; 34.2% Men; Age 4-89). In adults (age >= 21), sleep propensity modestly decreased across nap (90% at nap 1 to 80% at nap 5; p < 0.001). Children >= 12 years were least likely to fall asleep on any nap (similar to 55% at nap 5). REM propensity troughed at nap 4 (13%) and varied with age. Advanced age (>= 60 years; OR: 0.28, p < 0.001), REM-suppressant use (OR: 0.52, p < 0.001), and female sex (men OR: 1.48, p = 0.012) was associated with a decreased proportion of >= 2 REMs in adjusted logistic models. Children often demonstrated only 1 REM and generally had long sleep latencies, yielding a low proportion of MSLTs consistent with narcolepsy (11.0% vs. 19.2% and 16.8% in those between 13-20 and 21-59, respectively; p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: MSLT outcomes vary greatly across age, gender, and use of psychotropic medication. Demographic variance should be considered when interpreting MSLT results. Robust age effect question the appropriateness of the MSLT as currently designed and implemented for children and older adults. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. \
   Materials and methods: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 +/- 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up.
   Results: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects.
   Conclusions: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI.

AB The combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants are often required to provide the essential fast grid balance service between the load demand and power supply with the increase of the intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources. It is extremely challenging to ensure CCGT power plants operating flexibly and also maintaining its efficiency at the same time. This paper presents the feasibility study of a CCGT power plant combined with the cascaded latent heat storage (CLHS) for plant flexible operation. A 420 MW CCGT power plant and a CLHS dynamic models are developed in Aspen Plus based on a novel modelling approach. The plant start-up processes are studied, and large amount of thermal energy can be accumulated by CLHS during the start-up. For load-following operation, extensive dynamic simulation study is conducted and the simulation results show that the extracted exhaust gas can be used for thermal energy storage charging, and the stored heat can be discharged to produce high temperature and high pressure steam fed to the steam turbine. Besides, the stored heat can also be used to maintain the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) under warm condition to reduce plant restart -up time. The simulation results demonstrate that the integration of CLHS with CCGT power plant is feasible during the start-up, load-following and standstill operations.

AB A Wankel engine with hydrogen direct-injection enrichment is recognized as an attractive method to enhance combustion efficiency. In this paper, on the basis of the chemical kinetic mechanisms, a three-dimensional simulation model was established and validated by the measured results. The ignition and combustion processes in a gasoline Wankel engine with hydrogen direct-injection enrichment were implemented for numerical simulation. The influence of twin-spark timing was firstly analyzed by synchronous ignition. Further investigation was then conducted to simulate how to effect the combustion by asynchronous ignition based on the favorable synchronous ignition timing. Results showed that, the average flow velocities were 18.8, 20.7, 23.6, and 25.4 m/s for the spark timings (ST) of 45, 35, 25, and 15 degrees CA BTDC respectively. With retarded ST, the rich equivalence ratio approached to twin-spark plug continually. For synchronous ignition, at a larger advance of ST, the duration between the timing of the vortex dissipation and ST was longer, and the ignition delay was more prolonged. As the ST advanced, the combustion rate was enhanced with the increment in chamber temperature, the reactants (C8H18, C7H16, and H-2) consumption and intermediates (H2O2, OH, and CH2O) generation were accelerated, the maximum H2O2 and CH2O decreased whereas the maximum OH increased, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) increased sequentially. For asynchronous ignition, the accelerated flame front was in accordance with the rotating direction of the rotor while the opposite direction was inhibited during the combustion process. An earlier ignition of leading-spark plug (L-plug) or trailing-spark plug (T-plug) provided the higher flame speed and faster H-2 consumption, which contributed to the higher in-cylinder pressure, combustion temperature, and NO and CO production. The preferable ignition and combustion characteristics was realized when the L-plug angle was 25 degrees CA BTDC, and the T-plug angle was 35 degrees CA BTDC. Compared with the favorable synchronous ignition timing, the flame propagation and H-2 consumption were expedited, the peak pressure increased by 2.8%, the corresponding crank position advanced by 3 degrees CA and there was no increase in NOx and CO generation. Therefore, it was recommended in engineering applications that the ST of T-plug advanced appropriately while the ST of L-plug remained constant.

AB Saving energy is important and necessary for hydraulic excavators. This paper proposed a novel energy regeneration boom system. A variable displacement hydraulic motor and flow control valve were used to regulate the torque and speed of the generator, and to regulate flow through the hydraulic motor. A control strategy was proposed to calculate the optimal displacement of the hydraulic motor. The hydro-mechanical efficiency map and volumetric efficiency map were used to estimate the speed and torque of the generator instead of using speed and torque sensor. The resulting energy regeneration efficiency ranged from 33.8% to 57.4%, which cannot be realized in conventional boom system. Compared with conventional energy regeneration boom system, the improvement of energy regeneration efficiency with the proposed system was 3.2% to 4.1% for low and moderate velocities. A control strategy has been proposed to decrease the setup power of generator and ensure system safety in large load and high velocity mode.

AB The aim of the proposed work is to investigate the technical and economic suitability of a gas turbine combined heat and power system in commercial buildings. These systems are widely recognised as a promising technology to provide significant fuel savings and carbon emissions reduction where they have been widely used in industrial settings due to the relatively constant electrical and thermal loads required for industrial processes. However, their deployment has been relatively stagnant over the last few decades due to challenges such as poor planning and policy measures, energy market changes and regulatory barriers. In this context, a preliminary system design and optimisation procedure has been developed based on a sensitivity analysis of different scenarios of building loads, market and weather conditions. The optimisation is performed considering several technical and environmental parameters (e.g., energy and exergy efficiencies and primary energy saving), as well as economic indexes (e.g., net present value, pay-back period, profitability, etc.). This allows the suitability assessment of the investment for different market price scenarios under different heating degree days demand scenarios. The analysis is carried out using an Italian case study as it exhibits a wide range of heating degree days variability, while subject to a single pricing market. Results show that strong correlations occur between the technical and economic performance indices and the weather conditions for all considered configurations. The methodology and conclusions, if coupled with the possibility of applying clustering techniques to determine common patterns of energy consumptions in building blocks, represent a powerful toolset to carry out preliminary techno-economic assessment of a combined heat and power system.

AB The turbine-less jet engine is promising due to the compressor driven by a motor and the high combustor exit temperature. It is a key problem that how to provide electric power for the motor. In this paper, a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) jet hybrid engine with anode and cathode recirculation is proposed and investigated where the SOFC power system is instead of the turbine to provide power for the compressor. For the system, compressed air entering into SOFC cathode channel is preheated by cathode recirculation exhaust. The gases reform in the reformer, which are air, fuel and steam from the anode recirculation exhaust. Reformed gases are provided for the SOFC anode channel. SOFC produces electric power to drive the compressor by a motor. Then, SOFC exhaust enters the combustor. The combustor exhaust expands and produces propulsion power in the nozzle. In order to evaluate and improve the performance of the SOFC jet hybrid engine, the thermodynamic analysis model is built. The energy and exergy analysis are accomplished. The effect of pressure ratio and flight altitude on the performance of the hybrid engine are studied. In addition, sensitivity analysis is accomplished. The preliminary results are as follows: (1) The thermal efficiency, the specific thrust and the specific impulse of the engine could reach to 57.60%, 790.00 N/(kg.s(-1)) and 4132 s under design conditions. (2) The sum of the relative exergy destruction ratio of the SOFC, the combustor, the nozzle and the exhaust is over 85%. (3) The total pressure recovery coefficient of the SOFC has a strong influence on the performance of the SOFC jet hybrid engine.

AB Metallic bipolar plates are considered to be cost-effective and feasible alternative to graphite bipolar plates for high power density of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells. However, the lifetime of metallic bipolar plates is determined by surface coating and the durability evaluation is extremely costly and time-consuming. It is urgent to establish a method for the lifetime evaluation and quick development of coated metallic bipolar plates. In this study, a lifetime prediction model for coated metallic bipolar plates is proposed and verified. Firstly, the model is established based on the electrochemical reaction kinetics of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells. Secondly, the operating conditions for automotive application are equivalent to the ex-situ accelerated tests for the coated metallic bipolar plates and the model is formulated based on the ex-situ accelerated tests. Finally, 2500 h in-situ test of stacks assembled with carbon-coated metallic bipolar plates is carried out to verify the accuracy of the model and the relative prediction error is 8.68%. The universality of the model has been evaluated by applying it to gold-coated metallic bipolar plates, which were tested in-situ in stacks up to 3000 h. This study is beneficial to the quick evaluation of lifetime for coated metallic bipolar plates and provides a theoretical guidance for the rapid development of coatings.

AB A solution to increase the use of natural gas in U.S. is to convert existing diesel engines to natural-gas spark ignition operation through the addition of a gas injector in the intake manifold and of a spark plug in place of the diesel injector. This study presents experimental and numerical simulation results of flame propagation inside a such converted engine. Compared to the conventional theory of flame propagation inside a spark ignition engine, the results showed that the combination of strong radial inward movement and tumble resulted in a strong turbulence inside the bowl compared to the low turbulence intensity inside the squish region. After ignition, the characteristic turbulence distribution partitioned the combustion into two separated events: a fast, thick flame inside the bowl but a slow, thinner, and delayed flame inside the squish region, a feature unique to the lean-burn natural-gas spark-ignition combustion inside a bowl-in-piston geometry. Specifically, the high turbulence inside the bowl increased the local flame speed. By contrast, the squish experienced a much lower turbulence, which, combined with the higher surface/volume ratio, reduced the turbulent flame speed. In addition, the overlap between the fast- and the slow-burn events, which determined the phasing and the amount of fuel inside the squish, was controlled by the combustion phasing. For example, advancing the burning inside the bowl increased the fraction of fuel burning in the late combustion stage, which also increased the phasing difference between the fast- and the slow-burn events and produced a secondary peak in the apparent heat release rate. As the less-favorable combustion conditions inside the squish region would increase carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons emissions, this study suggests that combustion strategies in diesel engines converted to lean NG SI operation should minimize the amount of fuel burning in the squish region.

AB Natural gas diesel dual-fuel engines can significantly reduce soot emissions and mitigate the oil crisis. However, some drawbacks exist including low thermal efficiency, as well as high methane and carbon monoxide emissions. Multiple injection plays an important role in improving the performance and reducing emissions in dual-fuel engines. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of multiple injection effects on the combustion and emission characteristics of a natural gas diesel dual-fuel engine at low load condition. The results showed that, when the first diesel injection timing is advanced, the indicated thermal efficiency and nitrogen oxide emissions increased first and then decreased, while the maximum pressure rise rate, carbon monoxide and methane emissions reduced initially and then increased. When the first diesel injection ratio increased, combustion rate of natural gas air mixture increased, methane and carbon monoxide emission decreased, and nitrogen oxide emission increased. When the first diesel injection timing was relatively rearward, the combustion process showed a distinct four-stage heat release characteristic. The proportion of premixed combustion of the first injected diesel and the duration of flame propagation of natural gas had considerable influence on methane emission. When the first diesel injection timing was relatively forward, the first injected diesel played a premixed role, and the start of combustion was controlled by the second injected diesel. A relatively high indicated thermal efficiency can be obtained under this injection strategy. The methane was mainly distributed in the cylinder wall and crevice area at exhaust valve opening due to the limitation of flame propagation under the multiple injection strategy.

AB Solar hydrogen generation from water electrolysis driven by photovoltaic (PV) cell is a promising means of solar energy storage and hydrogen harvesting, which could transform the surplus PV power into a durable energy carrier with high-energy density and without pollution. However, the efficiency of the PV cell is easily decayed in high temperature, which limits the utilization of PV cell. On the other hand, the water electrolysis requires more electricity at low temperature, which influences the energy efficiency, and it needs to be improved from a thermodynamic perspective. This study proposes an efficient, flexible and no-carbon heat and hydrogen co-generation system with a complementary combination of PV cells and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. This novel system utilizes water flow to decrease the PV temperature and decline the Gibbs free energy in the water electrolysis simultaneously, and the overall solar energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency can reach as high as 62.67%, 20.29%, and 17.29%, respectively. The environmental performances of the system under different operating conditions are also analyzed, and the annual hydrogen generation rate and carbon dioxide reduction rate are as high as 47.52 kg/m(2) and 15.91 t/m(2), respectively. This novel system provides a convenient and efficient approach for solar energy storage and utilization, which is expected to fundamentally guide the future research and application of solar hydrogen generation.

AB Solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) is one of the most important technologies for solar energy conversion. However, the inefficiency due to coupling constraints such like low working temperature and dimensionless figure of merit of the thermoelectric materials, also known as material's ZT value, has been hampering the development of STEGs for a time. Here we demonstrate a high performance STEG system combined with solar concentrators and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) absorber, which can greatly improve the solar-thermal conversion process. The proposed STEG system enables a peak efficiency of 4.3% with solar concentration of 78, and a maximum power of 11.2 W at 106 x suns. The enhanced efficiency is ensured by the optimized system thermodynamics due to the combination of solar concentration devices and CNT based solar absorber. Our design provides a universal prototype of solar thermal energy recovery system for distributed energy harvesting and deep-space explorations.

AB In this paper, a novel simple CO2 Rankine cycle to recover LNG cold energy is proposed. The system is driven by ambient air, which is regarded as one of the most convenient and economic heat source. For the reason that the ambient temperature changes with days and seasons, it is necessary to take into account the system behavior with the variations of ambient temperature and mass flow rate. In this study, a detailed off-design performance analysis based on the preliminary design of the system is carried out. A sliding pressure control method is applied to keep the system stably and safely operate at off-design conditions. And the system behavior at design condition are compared with that under off-design conditions using a statistical tool. It is noted that the design value of temperature and mass flow rate of ambient air is 313.15 K and 26.86 kg.s(-1). The results indicate that the design cycle thermal efficiency, cold energy recovered from LNG and net power output is 6.75%, 1500.7 kW and 108.7 kW, respectively. With the decrease of ambient air temperature and mass flow rate, almost all the performance indicators decrease. But pump power consumption and efficiency changes slightly. Compared with the design values, cycle thermal efficiency and net power output decreases up to 47% and 60% when the ambient temperature decreases to 293.15 K, and 64% and 75% when the mass flow rate of ambient air decreases to 16 kg.s(-1), respectively. Moreover, the smaller mass flow rate of ambient air has greater impact on the system performance than the bigger one.

AB Energy and water have become major constraints for China's sustainable development. Effective measures focused on resource conservation are important to this country. In this study, a comprehensive assessment is conducted of the energy and water use of different sectors using exhaustive data collection and an environmentally extended input-output model. Given the interdependent relationship between energy and water, this paper also identifies the key sectors with most closed energy-water nexus. The results show the following; (1) the key sectors for high direct energy consumption and water use include Mining and Washing of Coal, Manufacture of Chemicals, Manufacture of Nonmetallic Mineral Products, Manufacture and Processing of Metals, and Electricity. (2) The key sectors for high indirect energy consumption and water use include the Manufacture of Chemicals, Manufacture of Electrical Machinery, and Construction. (3) The Manufacture of Chemicals sector should be focused on due to its direct and indirect influences. A focus on the key sectors may provide a greater opportunity for simultaneously achieving energy savings and water conservation, whereas different priorities should be applied; production-based or technology-related measures are effective for influencing direct energy consumption and water use, whereas consumption-based or end-use measures are better suited for influencing indirect energy consumption and water use.

AB The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of an optimized artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization for estimating the energetic performance of a building integrated photovoltaic/thermal system. A performance evaluation criterion is defined in this study to assess the overall performance of the considered system. Then, the mentioned methods are used to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the system. The performance evaluation criterion was taken as the essential output of the system, while the input parameters were the channel length, channel depth, channel width, and the air mass flow rate. The results revealed that the coefficient of determination for the training phase of the artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network methods is respectively 0.9982 and 0.9997, while it is 0.9980 and 0.9997 for the testing phase. Moreover, the root mean square error for the training phase of the artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network techniques was respectively 0.0462 and 0.0175, while it was 0.0493 and 0.0178 for the testing phase. Therefore, it was concluded that the particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network model could slightly perform a better performance compared to the conventional artificial neural network.

AB In the present work, an Elman neural network (ENN) is suggested for parameter identification of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is optimized by a novel optimization method. Proposed optimization algorithm of this paper is a hybrid algorithm that combined the teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm namely the TLBO-DE method. This paper combined these two effective methods to efficiently estimate the PEM fuel cell model parameters, and it's validated by various validation functions. Performance of this proposed optimization method is confirmed by the obtained results from some well-known benchmarks. Moreover, a TLBO-DE based Elman neural network is implemented for solving the nonlinear parameter identification issue for the PEM fuel cell. According to the obtained results, this proposed network can forecast the stack voltage in various operational situations with high authenticity.

AB An experimental investigation of methane reforming with flue gases obtained by combustion of methane with an excess air factor of 1 is carried out over a nickel-based catalyst. A set of experiments was conducted to understand the effects of operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, residence time and inlet gas composition on the conversion of the reactants. In addition, two shapes of catalysts such as a solid cylinder and ring were used in experiments. It is found that at the residence time above 4 kg(cat) s/mol the methane conversion has a value close to equilibrium. A change in pressure from 1 to 5 bar has a negligible effect on methane conversion, not more than 1-2% for various operating parameters. It has been experimentally determined that the use of an extended surface catalyst gives a higher methane conversion at a fixed catalyst weight. Therefore, for a fixed residence time, the methane conversion over a Raschig rings is 1-2% higher than over a solid cylinder. The steam addition to the inlet reaction gas mixture increases the methane conversion significantly; especially at the temperature range from 500 to 800 degrees C.

AB Frost build-up on the evaporator of air source heat pump severely deteriorates the heat transfer and subsequently reduces the performance of the system. Combining liquid desiccant dehumidification with heat pump system is an efficient strategy to achieve frost-free operation by dehumidifying the inlet air during winter in humid areas. In this paper, detailed energy, exergy and exergoeconomic analyses are performed for a frost-free air-conditioning system with integrated liquid desiccant dehumidification and compressor-assisted regeneration, in which the diluted liquid desiccant can be efficiently regenerated under low temperature condition. Parametric studies are conducted to appraise the influence of the important operation parameters on the performance of the proposed system. Then the hybrid system is optimized and compared from the exergoeconomic perspective. It is found that, the first and second largest exergy destructions take place in the regenerator and dehumidifier, which can be improved by increasing the investment costs. When the proposed system is optimized based on the exergoeconomics, the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency increase by 13.02% and 12.73%, respectively. The total product unit costs can decrease by 12.64% compared to that under the basic operation condition.

AB Lignite rich in oxygen-containing species (OCSs) was employed as perfect ion-exchange material for high activity catalyst preparation. HCl treatment Shengli lignite (HSL) selectively removed the organic salt and improved capability of ion exchange. In this paper, highly desirable and layered carbon supported Ni catalyst was prepared by modified lignite. Thanks to the excellent role of Ni (1 1 1) plane and porous layered graphene-like delocalized electronic structure, specific structure of lignite provides an exchange platform in facilitating the Ni electron transfer during the catalytic reaction process. Ni loaded on HSL (Ni/HSL) showed the great catalytic activity and stability for reforming of toluene and biomass tar. Ni/HSL prepared at 650 degrees C shows the great activity and stability for toluene steam reforming (TSR) and biomass tar reforming (BTR). A series of instruments (XRD, SEM, TEM, H-2-TPR, XPS, CO pulse adsorption, etc.) were employed for characterization. Based on these significant characterizations of catalyst, calculation of turnover frequency (TOF), and results of conversion of toluene and corncob tar. The results revealed the layered delocalized electronic structure of Ni/HSL, which has lower activation energy than other reported catalysts. Uniform dispersed catalyst was synthesized successfully for reforming of toluene and biomass tar.

AB With regard to the significant role of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems in performance enhancement of power plants, two novel micro-CCHP systems are presented which are based on organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and Kalina cycle (KC) as topping cycles. Additionally, ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) and vapor compression heat pump cycle (VCHPC) are utilized as the bottoming cycle of the power systems. To demonstrate feasibility of the recommended micro-CCHP systems, an exhaustive thermodynamic modeling and exergoeconomic analysis are employed as the most effective tools for performance evaluation of the systems. Also, to get better performance of the systems, single- and multi-criteria optimizations are carried out, using genetic algorithm. It is figured out that the KC-based micro-CCHP system has higher optimum thermal efficiency and total sum unit cost of the product (SUCP) than the ORC-based micro-CCHP system, while it had lower exergy efficiency. Regarding that, the optimum thermal efficiency for the ORC- and KC-based micro-CCHP systems are computed by 76.54% and 77.32%, respectively, whilst the optimum exergy efficiency for the ORC- and KC-based micro-CCHP systems are calculated by 48.37% and 31.2%, respectively. In addition, generator had the major exergy destruction rate among all components for both systems. Furthermore, the results of parametric study proved that higher thermal (energy) efficiency can be computed with increasing the heat source temperature, heater temperature, evaporation temperature, and terminal temperature difference of the recovery heat exchangers.

AB This work synthesizes a reduced-order sliding mode observer-based sliding mode controller for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system. This multivariable closed-loop system is dealt with two inputs (hydrogen fuel flow and cooling air flow rate) and two outputs (output voltage and stack temperature). For this, at first, we develop a nonlinear transient proton exchange membrane fuel cell model. This model is verified with the available experimental data. To maintain the fuel cell operating temperature, it is coupled with an airflow cooling fan. Then a nonlinear model-based control scheme is formulated that consists of sliding mode controller and reduced-order sliding mode observer. A special care is taken in control model against chattering response. Evaluating the sliding mode observer performance, it is integrated with sliding mode controller and the resulting hybrid control structure is compared with a traditional proportional integral controller. The nonlinear sliding mode observer-based controller shows its superiority over the proportional integral controller in rejecting the disturbance as well as tracking the set point.

AB A vertical earth-to-air heat exchanger system (VEAHE) system was proposed in this study. Compared to conventional EAHE systems, it has smaller land use and higher geothermal energy utilization efficiency. To validate its thermal and economic feasibility, an experimental setup was established to examine the variation of its outlet air temperature, air temperature along the tube and soil temperature. Also, the energy metrics of the proposed system were calculated for its economic assessment. Results showed that the outlet air temperature of this system ranged from 22.4 degrees C to 24.4 degrees C in summer and from 16.0 degrees C to 18.0 degrees C in winter. A detailed air temperature profile along the whole tube revealed that, the air temperature difference under 5 m in deep soil was more than twice as many as that from the inlet to 5 m. For the soil temperature at different depths, its recovery rate approximately equaled to the corresponding changing rate at the same depth during operation. For the proposed system, its energy payback time was calculated as 8.2 years, and its CO2 emission mitigation potential and total carbon credits were calculated as 7170.42 kg and $203.43 respectively, given an economic lifespan of 20 years. In addition, its monetary payback period was calculated as 17.5 years. The above results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system in exploiting deep ground soil as a natural heat sink/source in summer/winter. Meanwhile, the energy metrics analysis indicates that the proposed system is economically viable.

AB Thermodynamic and ecological performance evaluation of the reversed Brayton cycle operated heat pump is analyzed in this work. Performance assessment of the heat pump is carried out through many-objective as well as multi-objective optimization. Maximization of coefficient of performance, ecological coefficient of performance, exergy efficiency and ecological function of the heat pump are considered simultaneously during many-objective optimization. Four operating variable of the heat pump which include temperature ratio, compressor pressure ratio, hot side and cold side heat exchanger effectiveness are investigated in the optimization study. The conflicting level between thermo-ecological behaviour of heat pump is explored through comparison between multi-objective (i.e. two-objective) and many-objective (i.e. four-objective) optimization results. Both, multi-objective and many-objective optimization problem of heat pump are solved using the heat transfer search algorithm and results are presented in the form of Pareto-optimal points. Further, the effect of the design variables and its sensitivity to thermo-ecological behaviour of the heat pump are also presented. Comparative results reveal that, 16.16-37.93% variation in the thermo-ecological behaviour of the heat pump is observed during many-objective optimization as compared to multi-objective optimization. Different decision making approaches are used to select a final optimal solution from Pareto optimal set of many-objective optimization. Finally, the optimization results are compared with the experimental results of the heat pump system. The comparative results revels that 10.95% deviation in co-efficient of performance and 12.3% deviation in exergy efficiency are observed between optimization and experimental results.

AB Modeling energy technology adoption involves heterogeneity and dynamic interactions of individuals based on the physical, technical, and economic environments in the decision making process. In this context, this study aims to develop a hybrid model integrating an agent-based modeling (ABM) with the geographic information system and logistic regression for simulating rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption in the study area. Towards this end, this study regarded "building" as an "agent" to simulate the market diffusion of rooftop solar PV systems in the Nonhyeon neighborhood, located in the Gangnam district, Seoul, South Korea, based on various factors affecting the adoption (i.e., physical, demographic & socioeconomic, technical, economic, and social factors). This study considered three behavioral rules of rooftop solar PV adoption, which were determined using panel logistic regression according to different motivators for rooftop solar PV adoption. Based on these different behavioral rules, three hybrid ABM models were developed to simulate the market diffusion of rooftop solar PV systems. It was shown that models including the various potential motivators for the adoption proposed in this study better represented the reality of aggregate decision-making processes, while the model including only the motivators proposed in the previous ABM studies failed to perform well, rarely adopting the rooftop solar PV system during the runs. The ABM proposed in this study allows the estimation of the aggregate amount and patterns of future market diffusion for rooftop solar PV systems, which can be widely used by governments and electric utilities for evaluating policies and business models.

AB The knowledge of global solar radiation is of vital importance for the design and use of solar energy systems. This study evaluated the potential of two new powerful machine learning models, i.e., kernel-based nonlinear extension of Arps decline model and gradient boosting with categorical features support, for accurately estimating daily global solar radiation in humid regions. These two models were also compared with the multilayer perceptron, M5 model tree, random forest and multivariate adaptive regression spline models, using five input combinations of daily meteorological data during 2001-2015 from four weather stations in the (sub)tropical humid regions of South China. The results showed that, when lack of complete meteorological data, machine learning models using the ratio of actual and theoretical sunshine duration, maximum and minimum temperatures obtained satisfactory daily global solar radiation estimates. Generally, the kernel-based nonlinear extension of Arps decline model offered the best prediction accuracy among the studied models, followed by the gradient boosting with categorical features support. The multilayer perceptron model exhibited the smallest average percentage increase in the root mean square error during testing over the training values, followed by the kernel-based nonlinear extension of Arps decline model. Both the kernel-based nonlinear extension of Arps decline model and gradient boosting with categorical features support were successfully applied to develop general models for daily global solar radiation prediction (differences in root mean square error < 5% compared with local models). The gradient boosting with categorical features support and multilayer perceptron exhibited much smaller computational time for both local and general models. Comprehensively considering the accuracy, stability and computational time, both the kernel-based nonlinear extension of Arps decline model and gradient boosting with categorical features support are recommended for predicting daily global solar radiation in the humid regions of China.

AB For gasoline preparation, it is necessary to control the fuel's octane number, which often affects production costs. Ethanol is widely used as gasoline alternative fuel with high octane number. In this paper, based on a modified dual fuel spark ignition engine, studies of port injection of ethanol and direct injection of gasoline surrogates (toluene reference fuel) were conducted. The results revealed that when direct injection of toluene reference fuel with research octane number of 90, with the increase of ethanol injection ratio, the flame development duration and rapid combustion duration were prolonged (about 2 degrees CA and 3 degrees CA, respectively). Meanwhile, nitrogen oxide emissions, total hydrocarbon emissions, ethane, isopentane, cyclohexane, olefins and aromatics gradually decreased. For direct injection of fuels with different research octane number and port injection ratio of ethanol fixed at 21%, even when the research octane number of gasoline surrogates was as low as 75, the combustion history and engine efficiency were close to those of fuel with research octane number of 95. In particular, the indicated thermal efficiency of dual fuel spark ignition mode with direct injection of fuel with research octane number of 75 combined with 35% ethanol ratio was similar to that of direct injected spark ignition mode fueled with research octane number of 95 under respective knock limited spark timings.

AB Invention of evacuated tube heat pipe solar collectors (HPSCs) was a huge step forward towards resolving the challenges of conventional solar systems due to their unique features and advantages. This has led to their utilization in a wide range of solar applications surpassing other conventional collectors. However, relatively low thermal efficiency of heat pipe solar (HPS) systems is still the major challenge of solar industry evidenced by numerous studies conducted mainly during the last decade to improve their efficiency. To date, several review papers have been published summarizing studies relevant to utilization of HPSCs in various thermal applications. However, to the authors' knowledge, a comprehensive review which surveys and provides an overview of the studies undertaken to improve the thermal performance of HPS systems (mainly during the last decade) by implementing different strategies has not been published to date. This review paper summarizes all the proposed strategies to improve the thermal efficiency of different industrial, domestic, and innovative HPS systems. First, the concept, structure, and operational principles of HPSCs are introduced concisely. Then, novel structures and designs of HPSCs aiming to increase the thermal efficiency of the collector as the most important component of the solar system is reviewed. This is followed by a comprehensive review of various methods to store solar energy more efficiently, increase solar system's operation time, increase overall efficiency by turning the solar system into a multi-purpose system, enhance heat transmission in the solar system, and implement new solar loop and heat pipe working fluids with better heat transfer characteristics. Finally, research gaps in this field are identified and some future research trends and directions are recommended.

AB As conventional energy resources are limited and polluting, new energy resources, being renewable and environmentally friendly, have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, no study on new energy investment, which acts a significant role in promoting the development and use of new energy resources, has been conducted. To cover this gap, an applicable decision support model is established by integrating Z-numbers, regret theory and elimination and choice translating reality III (ELECTRE III) to address new energy investment risk evaluation problems. In this way, Z-numbers are used to describe the decision-making information involved in the problems, a suggested method is combined with regret theory to determine the utility, rejoice and regret values of Z-information, and ELECTRE III is introduced to handle multiple criteria evaluation comprehensively. To elucidate and validate the application of the established model, a case study for new energy investment in Qingshuitang Industrial Zone is conducted and in-depth results analysis and discussion are implemented. The study shows that solar energy is the best investment project and environment is the most important investment factor. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the established model can effectively support new energy investment decision-making and it performs better than other existing methods.

AB Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been widely used in performance and energy efficiency evaluation. However, in the traditional DEA, the effective of each decision making unit (DMU) is evaluated through its own optimized perspective and regardless of other DMUs influence, which may result in too many effective DMUs. And the DEA cross-model (DEACM) can distinguish the effective DMUs better by constructing a cross-efficiency matrix, but the optimal weight of the DMU may not be unique, so the cross efficiency of the DEACM may be different. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel DEACM based on the affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm (AP-DEACM). Through the AP clustering algorithm, the high impact data affecting the performance capacity and energy saving are obtained. Then the better effective DMU is identified through the high discrimination of the AP DEACM. Finally, the proposed AP-DEACM is used for performance evaluation and energy optimization modeling of the Pure Terephthalic Acid (PTA) production process and the ethylene industrial process in complex petrochemical industries. The experimental results show that the energy saving potential of PTA production plants and ethylene production plants are 2.78% and 1.26%, respectively, and the average value of carbon emission savings potential is 3.62% in ethylene production plants.

AB Thermoelectricity is regarded as one of the promising waste heat recovery candidates. A fundamental but effective method for the best use of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) is to maximize the heat flow crossing thermoelectric materials. The main focus of the present study was to develop a thermal interface material (TIM) with high thermal conductivity and temperature resistance as the key to minimizing the overall thermal resistance of the heat flow path of a TEG module operating under high-temperature conditions. In combination with a polyimide matrix and a multi-dimensional filler compound, a new TIM having stable heat conduction behavior at high temperatures was produced. The developed TIM was stable without losing mass up to similar to 500 degrees C, and its thermal conductivity reached 81.4 W/m.K. It was applied to the interface between a TEG and a heat source whose temperature ranged from 100 to 300 degrees C and, the effect of the thermal conductivity and interface thermal resistance of the TIM on thermoelectric power generation performance during onsite curing of the TIM was investigated. Reduction of the interface thermal resistance by the new TIM improved the power generation by, at most, 132.3 and 38.6% compared to cases without a TIM and with a conventional graphite foil TIM, respectively. In terms of energy conversion efficiency, the TEG with the new TIM showed maximum improvements of 73.2 and 20.9% over the cases without a TIM and with a graphite TIM for the same temperature difference across the TEG, respectively. In addition, thermal cyclic testing confirmed the long-lasting heat-conducting feature of the developed TIM. The present work clearly shows the potentially significant influence that TIMs have on the waste heat recovery performance of TEGs.

AB Energy, exergy, economic, advanced exergy, and extended exergy analyses are reported of a Bergey Excel-S wind turbine with nominal power of 10 kW in two cities: Tehran (medium wind potential) and Manjil (high wind potential). The results show that the energy efficiency of the wind turbine is higher in Manjil (3.33%) than Tehran (1.08%). The exergy efficiency in these areas is lower. This means that the exergy efficiency in Manjil is 10.8% but in Tehran is 6.43%. The cost of electricity generated by the wind turbine in Tehran is 0.23US$/kWh. This cost is reduced to 0.73 Us$/kWh in Manjil. The advanced exergy analysis demonstrates that the avoidable exergy destruction percentage of the wind turbine increases with wind speed. The extended exergy analysis shows that, in windy areas, the highest exergy percentage is exhibited by the system's input and output exergy flows and power production (88.7%), while, in areas with medium wind speed potential, the exergy is equal to is the equivalent extended exergy content of the influx of capital cost (58.9%).

AB In this paper, the dynamic failure of the two-phase ejector in a modified auto-cascade freezer system was experimentally investigated in the pull-down process. The effects of the critical ejector geometries including the nozzle throat diameter, mixing section diameter and nozzle exit position on the ejector performance were discussed in detail. The entrainment ratio and pressure lift ratio were used to evaluate the ejector performance. The malfunction behaviors of the pressure rise and fluid entrainment at different ejector geometries were analyzed. The results showed that two typical malfunction modes, i.e., pressure lifting failure and refrigerant entrainment failure, occurred in the pull-down process when ejector geometry were improperly adopted. The operation reliability of the ejector was sensitive to the nozzle throat diameter. Low mass entrainment ability and poor mixing effect for the mixing fluids were the main reasons of pumping failure for the ejector at undersize and overlarge mixing section diameters, respectively. Pressure lifting failure was prone to occur at smaller NXP, and the pulsation of the pressure lift ratio became obvious at large NXP when the secondary fluid was at two-phase state. The variation of temperature at the secondary fluid inlet was an important symbol of detecting the reverse flow of the primary from the secondary fluid inlet. The ejector with throat diameter of 0.8 mm, mixing section diameter of 3 mm and NXP of 6 mm was proposed in consideration of the ejector operation reliability in the pull down process, and the time-average value of the pressure lift ratio could reach 2.197 at the entrainment ratio of 0.663.

AB The use of pump working as turbine (PAT) was identified by many researchers as a way to improve the energy efficiency in the water systems. However, the majority of the researches consider the hydraulic machine connected to the electrical grid, which may not fit best when these recovery systems are located in rural or remote areas. To improve the efficiency in these recovery systems for rural areas, this research contributes for a further study and optimization of the off-grid PAT systems with induction generators. The current manuscript proposes a methodology to obtain the best efficiency of the PAT-SEIG (Self-Excited Induction Generator) system when operating under different speeds and loads. For these systems, the selection of capacitors for the SEIG is critical to maximizing the energy efficiency. A methodology is proposed to estimate and select the correct SEIG model parameters and, thus, compute the best capacitor values to improve the PAT-SEIG energy efficiency. Special attention is given to the impact the SEIG parameters have in the efficiency of the recovery system. The accuracy of the analytical model improved, reducing the error between analytical and experimental results from 50.8% (for a model with constant parameters) to 13.2% (with parameters changing according to the operating point of the system). These results showed an increase of the overall PAT system efficiency from 26% to 40% for the analyzed case study.

AB The present investigation is developed in the refrigeration industry, whose activity is the production and commercialization of the ice used mainly in the fishing industry. The development consists in evaluating and comparing the steam compression refrigeration system with intercooler and the steam compression refrigeration system with compressor scale system. These evaluations are intended to determine the COP in both systems through an energetic and exergetic analysis, as well as to reduce the freezing time of the ice without affecting its quality. Finally, a thermoeconomic evaluation of these systems will be carried out to allow the company to analyze the convenience in study, by reducing their production costs using their productive processes efficiently, providing quality products, and being competitive in the market. It is evident that when carrying out the evaluation of the refrigeration system with compressor scale system, it will be possible to increase the exergetic efficiency, reduce the irreversibilities and the destroyed exergy; Above all, the COP will be increased by 8.28%, which allows a reduction in ice freezing time by 22.25% or 3 h and 39 min. In addition to obtaining savings in electricity consumption equivalent to $8563.00 dollars in the next 12 months.

AB Abrupt climate change such as the loss of Arctic sea-ice area urgently needs negative emissions technologies. The potential application of direct air capture of carbon dioxide from indoor air and outdoor air in closed buildings or crowded places has been discussed in this paper. From the aspects of carbon reduction and indoor comfort, the ventilation system integrating a capture device is of great value in practical use. For ultra-dilute carbon dioxide sources, many traditional separation processes have no cost advantages, but adsorption technologies such as temperature vacuum swing adsorption is one of suitable methods. Thermodynamic exploration has been investigated regarding minimum separation work and second-law efficiency at various concentrations in the air. The influence of concentration, adsorption temperature, desorption temperature and desorption pressure on the energy efficiency has also been evaluated. Results show that the minimum separation work for the level of 400 ppm is approximately 20 kJ/mol. The optimal second-law efficiencies are 44.57%, 37.55% and 31.60%, respectively for 3000 ppm, 2000 ppm and 1000 ppm. It means that a high energy-efficiency capture device in buildings merits attention in the exploration of the possibility of approaching negative carbon buildings.

AB A hybrid cooling system aimed at enhancing energy, exergy and economic efficiency of data center is proposed. The proposed system combines a high cooling efficiency spray cooling system, a waste heat reusing absorption chiller and a peak load shifting chilled water storage. This combination is implemented by replacing the condenser of spray cooling system with the generator of absorption chiller, and storing cooling capacity of absorption chiller during off-peak time to supplement the cooling load during on-peak time. A thermodynamic model is developed based on energy and exergy balance. Parametric sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of spray cooling inlet temperature, chilled water temperature, cooling water temperature and ambient temperature on the energy saving efficiency, exergy efficiency and operation cost. Comparison study and economic analysis are conducted based on Dawning 5000A supercomputer in Shanghai, China. Sensitivity analysis results show that the effect of spray cooling inlet temperature is the largest, while the effects of chilled water temperature and cooling water temperature are the smallest. At appropriate condition, the absorption chiller and chilled water storage could totally eliminated the cooling load of air conditioner during on-peak time. The energy saving efficiency, exergy efficiency and operation cost saving could be up to 51%, 17%, and 71% with the cost payback period as low as 286 days.

AB This paper proposes the eddy-current braking & heating system, which is a novel efficient braking energy recovery system for electric bus. The system is designed to solve two problems: one is the low recovery efficiency of regenerative braking energy, another is the driving range dramatic decline of electric bus when heating the bus cabin in winter. The system converts braking energy into heating energy directly by the principle of eddy current braking and heating. It greatly improves the recovery efficiency of braking energy. The layout scheme of system is designed by considering the vehicle drive structure. The mathematical models of friction braking, regenerative braking, eddy-current braking & heating are established respectively. A blend braking control strategy considering braking strength, State of Charge, and supply air temperature is proposed. The energy saving evaluation parameters of the system are presented. A simulation platform is built in the MAMAS/Simulink environment. The simulation and vehicle tests show that the calculated temperature and driving range agree well with the measured results and the models are validated. Compared with Positive Temperature Coefficient heating, the recovery efficiency of braking energy of the system increases from 23.8% to 65.3%, and the improvement rate of driving range reaches 81.4%. The system can satisfy the braking requirement of electric vehicle by blend braking control strategy. The system can effectively increase energy recovery of the regenerative braking. It can solve the reduced driving range problem of electric buses while heating in winter.

AB The use of biodiesel produces less pollution than petroleum diesel, and any application that utilizes diesel fuel can use biodiesel. However, the intention is not to fully substitute petroleum diesel but to help extend the usefulness of petroleum, supporting the longevity and cleanliness of diesel engines, and possibly create a balanced energy policy. This study employed exergy, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses to verify the effect of engine load and biodiesel concentration in a stationary, direct injection diesel engine. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was applied within Simapro software to quantify the environmental impacts associated with the consumption of diesel and biodiesel, utilizing the Eco-indicator 99 environmental impact assessment method. Analyses included the calculation of exergy efficiency, specific cost, specific environmental impacts, and exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental impact factors. It was verified that full load operation presented the best results in all analyses. Exergy analysis revealed that low biodiesel concentration presented slightly higher efficiency. Although the specific cost of biodiesel was double the specific cost of diesel (1.55 US$/kg versus 0.76 US$/kg), biodiesel presented lower environmental impacts (55.8 mPt/kg versus 240 mPt/kg for diesel). It was verified that exergy efficiency increased along with capacity load, but increases in the concentration of biodiesel yielded lower exergy efficiencies. The exergoeconomic factor decreased as exergy destruction and exergy losses increased, and specific environmental impacts decreased with increases in power or in biodiesel concentration. A case is made for the outstanding benefits around understanding how environmental impacts are formed to pinpoint where changes should be implemented (herein, focus is on fuel and pollutant formation).

AB Several plant concepts for synthetic compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production using different water electrolysis and methanation technologies are compared in terms of power-to-methane efficiency, cooling water requirements, net water requirements, and carbon valorization. In these concepts, both oxygen and hydrogen produced in the electrolysis unit are valorized. Pure oxygen is used in the gasification unit, which allows a compact autothermal unit design and an efficient syngas production. Electrolytic hydrogen is fed to the catalytic methanation unit, thus improving the carbon utilization compared to state of the art plants with water-gas shift units. Pinch analyses were performed using an in-house MATLAB (R) algorithm to evaluate the thermal requirements of each plant concept and determine the maximal theoretical plant efficiencies. Plant efficiencies were then evaluated more accurately in static regime using full integrated Simulink (R) plant models. Calculated efficiency values are very close to the maximal theoretical ones, which validates the relevance of the implemented thermal integrations from an energy standpoint. Investigated plant concepts with solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) units present a significantly higher overall efficiency (in the range of 78.5-81.8% higher heating value (HHV) according to the end-products) compared to the reference case with liquid water electrolysis units (64.9% HHV for synthetic natural gas (SNG) or 64.4% HHV for CNG), thus highlighting the potential of the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology for power-to-gas/liquids applications. The plant efficiency values are then verified, discussed, and compared with previous literature values. The techno-economic feasibility of several options for residual heat valorization is then discussed, e.g. power production or coupling with a district heating network.

AB The synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials, ideally produced via facile, inexpensive approaches, using sustainable resources as precursors, with modulated structures, morphologies and functionalities is still challenging for energy applications. This work developed a mild one-step hydrothermal synthesis route for the fabrication of highly dispersed metallic nickel nanoparticles on hydrothermal carbons derived from waste biomass. The roles of precursor nickel ion concentration and calcination temperature in modulating the morphology, location and crystalline size of the nickel nanoparticles as well as the metal-support interactions have been delineated. The average grain size of the metallic nickel nanocrystals on the resultant Ni-0.5@HCOp nanocatalysts could be tuned to 8-13 nm by varying the preparation conditions. The catalytic abilities of the Ni-based nanocatalysts towards hydrogen-rich syngas production and tar reduction were then tested in a two-stage reactor system using sewage sludge as biomass feedstock. The catalytic tests showed that the Ni-0.5@HCOp catalyst calcined at 700 degrees C was shown to have stronger metal-support interactions compared to other Ni-based nanocomposites, which provided better suppression of coke deposition and resistance of nickel agglomeration during the catalytic gasification process. This highly active catalyst promoted formation of hydrogen-rich syngas, with up to 109.2 g H-2/kg sludge, and tar yields as low as 2.12 mg g(-1).

AB In order to obtain a deep insight into the upgrade of oil sand bitumen (OSB), the composition, distribution and chemical structure of products obtained from the fast thermal cracking of the OSB were investigated via Py-GC/TOF-MS and a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor. A detail composition information of fast thermal-cracking products of the OSB was determined by Py-GC/TOF-MS, which mainly contained alkenes (1-alkenes, iso-alkenes and cycloalkenes), alkanes (n-alkanes, iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes), diolefins, aromatics and sulfur-containing compounds. The distribution of fast thermal-cracking products varied under different temperature. Alkenes were the uppermost style in volatile products at the temperature ranging from 500 degrees C to 700 degrees C, whereas with the temperature further rising to 800 degrees C, aromatics products became predominant and were mainly generated from the deep cleavage of alkyl substituent groups and the secondary reactions to form aromatics. Moreover, the relative content and carbon number distribution of volatile products along with various temperature were summarized. The thermal cracking experiments of the OSB over silica sand in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor showed that the gas products had a remarkable increase in yield as the temperature increase, which was connected with the increase in methane and ethylene of dry gas as well as propylene and butenes of LPG. The coke yield also exhibited an increase tendency with the enhancement of temperature, while this variation was slighter in comparison to that of gases. Conversely, the yield of liquid products gradually decreased with the temperature, which was closely related to the significant decrease of VGO and heavy oil fractions due to the coke formation of polyaromatics and the intensive rupture of alkyl side chains. Nevertheless, the light oil fraction (diesel and gasoline) displayed the different variation along with the temperature, which increased firstly and then decreased as a result of the decomposition of heavy fractions and secondary cracking of light oil itself. Compared to the native OSB, there was a slight difference in functional group distribution for liquid products which was concerned with the formation of olefins, whereas the average structural parameters of the liquid products changed dramatically after the fast thermal cracking of the OSB. Furthermore, the effects of the reaction temperature on the chemical structures were significant due to the decomposition, condensation and secondary reactions proceeded during the fast thermal cracking process.

AB As the gaseous fuels interchangeability, which requires that the two gaseous fuels must be nearly identical in terms of their combustion characteristics and result in a similar engine performance, is important for internal combustion engines operation in cases of the fuel composition variation or the main fuel supply failure. In such cases, simulation tools of sufficient accuracy can be effectively employed in fuel interchangeability studies as well as for predicting the engine performance and emissions. In this study, a zero-dimensional diesel engine model is extended for simulating multi-fuel engines by considering the thermodynamic properties of the employed fuels. The model is verified against experimental data and subsequently employed to investigate the performance and knocking resistance of an SI engine operating with interchanged gaseous fuels mixtures. The derived results demonstrate that the Wobbe Index estimation is not sufficient for the characterisation of the engine performance and therefore simulation must be used for the accurate engine performance prediction with fuels interchangeability. The addition of either carbon dioxide or nitrogen results in reducing the knocking probability and retarding the knocking onset crank angle. It is inferred that the carbon dioxide addition is more effective than the nitrogen addition and concluded that the proposed model for multi-fuel engines provides results of sufficient accuracy to investigate the fuel interchangeability influence on the engine performance and knocking resistance.

AB This work presents a comprehensive study of the performance of six large photovoltaic (PV) power plants with different mounting topologies over several years of operation. This is a marked contrast to most available performance studies which focus on the study of a single installation of low rated power and one mounting type. The performance results are obtained following the guidelines of Standard IEC 61724 and largely coincide with those expected considering the plants' location in the South-Central Region of Spain, with a total system efficiency ranging between 10% and 12%. Moreover, some performance trends are identified and associated with mounting system, size and location. Finally, it is concluded that the added complexity of dual-axis tracking systems in the operation and maintenance was underestimated in the design phase of the PV power plants. Wind speed has emerged as a key parameter, not only due to the cooling effect on the PV panels but also as a result of its impact on the availability of energy generation.

AB Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is one of the attractive methods for the utilisation of greenhouse gases (e.g., CH4, CO2) to produce valuable fuels. In the quest for an efficient development in DRM, several technologies have been practised, while dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma technology garners special attention in the utilisation of CO2 and CH4 through DRM process due to easy upscaling opportunities and mild operating conditions. However, the low energy efficiency (EE) of DBD plasma is a distinct challenge and it offers an in-depth insight into its basic operational understandings. This review presents the overall status and current developments in DBD plasma for DRM. In the mainstream, challenges in DBD plasma technology, catalyst-plasma interactions and developments in plasma catalysts to improve the yield and selectivity of DRM have been discussed. The current status and developments in DBD reactor configuration based on reactor geometry, such as the electrode morphology, discharge gap (D-gap), discharge volume (V-D) and material packing to maximise the productivity of DRM are specifically investigated. The effects of the operating parameters, such as gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), specific input energy (SIE) and feed ratio are critical for product distribution. The current status of reaction kinetics and prospects in fluid modelling of catalytic DBD plasma DRM reactor is reviewed to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. Finally, further advancements in the catalytic DBD plasma DRM has become a requisite to make it commercially viable for the successful production of valuable fuels.

AB The objective of this paper is to carry out a dynamic exergetic assessment of a large complex building. Results in this paper show that although the building and its Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems with an energetic efficiency of 122.6% meet energy performance regulations, their overall exergetic efficiency is extremely low (3.68%). This emphasizes the importance of exergy analysis in buildings to improve the quality match between energy supply and demand, and consequently, to increase the sustainability of the building energy system. From the exergy point of view, the main sources of thermodynamic inefficiencies in the considered building are energy conversion systems, energy distribution layer, and energy released to the environment with 54, 21 and 16% of the total exergy destruction, respectively. However, among these sources of inefficiency, only the last one can be detected through an energy analysis. The exergetic efficiency of the system decreases when the exergy demand decreases, but the same energy sources are used to fulfill the demand. This reveals a potential to improve the efficiency of the building's energy system through the implementation of an exergy-based control strategy. The high-temperature heating network provides around 26% of the low-temperature heating demand. From the exergy point of view, however, this share is approximately 46%. This indicates that the quality of the supplied energy from the high-temperature heating network is much higher than required and the heat transfer from the high-temperature to the low-temperature heating network decreases the exergetic efficiency of the building.

In this context, it is important to investigate how emission abatement technologies capable of meeting the updated regulation on nitrogen oxides emissions affect the performance of waste heat recovery units to be installed on board new vessels. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential fuel savings of installing an organic Rankine cycle unit on board a hypothetical liquefied natural gas-fuelled feeder ship operating inside emission control areas. The vessel complies with the updated legislation on sulphur oxides emissions by using a dual fuel engine. Compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission regulation is reached by employing either a high or low-pressure selective catalytic reactor, or an exhaust gas recirculation unit. A multi-objective optimization was carried out where the objective functions were the organic Rankine cycle unit annual electricity production, the volume of the heat exchangers, and the net present value of the investment. The results indicate that the prospects for attaining a cost-effective installation of an organic Rankine unit are larger if the vessel is equipped with a low-pressure selective catalytic reactor or an exhaust gas recirculation unit. Moreover, the results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of the organic Rankine cycle units is highly affected by fuel price and the waste heat recovery boiler design constraints.

AB Determination of wind speed probability distribution is of considerable importance to the accurate wind energy assessment. This paper proposes an optimal score-radar map for determining the suitable region wind speed probability distribution from various candidate parametric distributions. Five typical fitting performance indices are calculated and transformed into standard scores. Optimal weight coefficients are obtained to consolidate the five standard scores into an integrated score, which minimizes the differences between multiple fitting performance indices. The optimal score-radar map consists of integrated scores visually presents the suitability of candidate parametric distribution to numerous wind farms, which enables easy, quick, and explicit determination of suitable candidate. The applicability, efficiency, and verification of the proposed map are demonstrated using ten years of collected wind speed data form sixty-six wind farms at North Dakota. The results show that the mixture Generalized Extreme Value-Weibull distribution has the minimum area of optimal score-radar map and presents satisfactory suitability to North Dakota. Also, such distribution accurately characterizes the mean value, standard deviation, and skewness of collected wind speed data. The wind energy of North Dakota is investigated using such distribution. An ideal wind farm and preferable wind turbine are found.

AB Geothermal energy recovery from abandoned flooded mines provides a viable high-tech solution to reuse the abandoned mines for meeting humanity's energy needs worldwide in an environmental, economic, and reliable way. This unique energy application with mine water in the U.S., however, has not been reported. This study reports on a real geothermal energy application in the U.S. for the use of water in flooded mines for house heating. First, the site exploration of a typical flooded copper mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is presented to discuss three essential components of the proposed large-scale energy application, i.e., bedrock geology, mining background, and energy reserve analyses. Then, the key technical details and data monitoring of a demonstration project for the use of mine water for heating a 15,000 ft(2) (1394 m(2)) building are introduced. For the energy reserve, energy reserve analyses were conducted considering the renewability of the thermal energy in the natural system, which was usually neglected in the literature. The analyses revealed that the annual extractable energy from the explored flooded mine with the energy replenishment is comparable to the annual energy generated by a small-scale power station, which can support over 82,000 households. The results from the demonstration project indicated that house heating with geothermal energy via the mine water is the most efficient and the second most economical heating option in very unfavorable conditions with a high electricity price and a low annual average air temperature. The intention of this study is to share the background and practical knowledge that has been learned from this ongoing project to guide future real installations in other mining areas with deep flooded mines in the U.S. and around the world.

AB Energy integration is a matter of substantial importance in process engineering. Much attention was given in the last decades, in special, to heat recovery. However, recently, simultaneous work and heat recovery has arisen as an important area of study in process engineering. It has been demonstrated that work and heat exchange networks (WHEN) may improve the energetic efficiency of processes such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) production. Optimization-based frameworks for WHEN synthesis developed so far are based on deterministic approaches and commercial solver implementations. This work aimed to present a novel alternative framework based on a matrix-based implementation fit for the use of a meta-heuristic solution approach. The superstructure employed is inspired on previous literature and extended for a broader analysis. The method was applied to three examples, being two based on real processes. In benchmark tests, the approach was able to outperform all other solutions reported with respect to total annual cost, the objective function adopted in these studies.

AB A mineral-coupled support, flake graphite-carbon nanofiber-modified bentonite, was used to stabilize stearic acid for constructing form-stable phase change material composites. In order to achieve a synergistic improvement of thermal conductivity and loading space, the supporting material was prepared by growing carbon nanofiber on flake graphite surface through chemical vapor deposition technique and then chemically bonding with modified bentonite. The effect of coupling behavior on interfacial thermal resistance was investigated and results show that the thermal conductivity of the coupled supporting material (4.595 W m(-1) K-1) is higher than that of non-coupled support (4.291 W m(-1) K-1), proving chemical bonding can decrease interface thermal resistance at a certain extent. The performances of composites were further explored, which indicates the obtained composite base on coupled support possesses good chemical compatibility, and great thermal stability under 180 degrees C. It also shows that this composite with 41.90% loading capability has latent heat value of 79.13 J g(-1) for melting and 79.13 J g(-1) for freezing, respectively. After 50 heating-cooling cycles, the variation of melting latent heat was within 0.05%, exhibiting a great thermal reliability. Besides, thermal conductivity of this composite is 10.50 times higher than that of pure phase change material, resulting in more rapid heat transfer efficiency, and excellent transient temperature response recorded by thermal infrared images. In all, the composite is a potential candidate for thermal storage applications due to larger latent heat capability and considerable thermal conductivity.

AB This paper develops a one-dimensional simulation model of a thermoelectric module aiming at its characteristic exploration and output performance prediction. Almost all related effects are considered including Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson effects, the spatial- and temperature-dependent thermoelectric material properties, as well as the other irreversible factors. In order to ensure its high accuracy and computational efficiency, the differential equations built for components of non-linear physical properties, and analytical equations for the others of constant properties are jointly solved by numerical methods and implemented in MATLAB integrated development environment. A small deviation of 1.44% exists between its calculated output power and that by a previously reported three-dimensional model under a specific wide load range (0-250 Omega), validating its accuracy of this model. Besides, it indicates that both the proportions of heat leakage through the occupied air zone and its maximum output power to the input total heat flow have the same order of magnitude. A rising proportion for the former has to be paid attention in case of a higher temperature difference applied. The assumption of regarding its electrical contact resistance as an identical external resistance connected with the load in series is computationally proved to generate a negligible discrepancy in terms of TEM characteristics and its output performance. Furthermore, with respect to the impacts of TEM geometry, the pre-set fixed substrate area weakens the equivalence of regarding a thermoelectric module with larger cross-section area of thermoelectric legs as multiple identical modules with smaller leg areas connected in parallel. It accounts for the better linearity of rising output power by a long leg than that by a short leg as the leg area increases. A long thermoelectric leg means an increased induced electrical potential and inner resistance as well, thus leading to a single peak of the output power as the leg length increases. Finally, a thermoelectric geometric optimization approach abased on the Hill-climbing algorithm is introduced and first applied for the maximum output. Its accuracy and efficiency are validated and analyzed detailedly by supplying different variables as initial search point. All the methods and conclusions in this paper can assist thermoelectric generators' performance estimation and guide the geometric optimizations regarding their large-scale applications in the future.

AB The power supply of a remote island is mainly from the diesel generator due to nature and environmental constraints for developing renewable electrical power generation. Recovering waste heat from diesel generators can reduce cost and satisfy the concurrent need for electricity, district heating or cooling on a remote island. This study investigates the optimization design of a district cooling system (DCS) on a remote island by the dynamic programming method. In a case study on Green Island, the waste heat from the diesel power plant can be recovered to drive an absorption chiller that satisfies the peak cooling load of 756 kW. The objective function of the optimization design includes the capital cost and the running cost during the period of the life cycle. The dynamic programming method is adopted to minimize the objective function, and the constraint involves the conservation of energy between the chiller and the chilled water storage tank. The results showed that a 510 kW absorption chiller and a storage tank capacity of 1978 kW-h achieved the optimization of the DCS. The averaged energy conservation rate was about 75.7%. Moreover, the electricity consumption and CO2 emission were reduced by 955.8 MWh and 675 tons per year, respectively. Based on the difference in the electricity prices of electric utility companies, the investment in the DCS is expected to have a four-year payback period. These optimization results are based on an evaluation of energetic, economic and environmental effects, which are also suitable for any kind of regions without direct access to interconnected electrical networks.

AB Sustainable energy production through conversion of biomass has recently found growing interest. Among thermochemical conversion techniques, gasification is of interest to replace direct combustion emitting air pollutants that threaten our environment. However, gasification process is still far from being efficient since most of the research studies have only focused on experimental implementation of the methods while numerical modeling has been limited to pilot scales, ignoring the performance optimization required for scaling up the gasification process. Gasification is a highly complex process, which involves the coupling of thermochemical equilibrium, kinetics, heat and mass transfer, and computational fluid dynamics. This complexity has currently prevented the proposed theoretical/computational models in the literature from achieving the required accuracy for optimizing the gasification process. Herein, we offer a comprehensive guideline to improve the numerical models which can be implemented in future sustainable biorefineries to improve their efficiency. The present study pursues two principal objectives: (1) Introducing the fundamental knowledge required for theoretical/computational modeling and (2) Reviewing alternative numerical models for gasification process. First, a brief overview of the knowledge needed to make a systematic model is gathered. The theory of gasification, the various types of gasifiers and their differences are reviewed. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of the type of biomass feedstock with concentration on advanced biofuels and focus on wood pellets for the modeling section. Second, CFD is introduced and chemical equilibrium, kinetics, and heat and mass transfer models are discussed in depth and the variation of different parameters with respect to the change of temperature within a gasifier is elaborated. The results of this study make a clear pathway for modeling of gasification process by anticipating the expected outputs from the model by using the existing experimental data. Finally, comprehensive application of these models is demonstrated and substantial parameters affecting the gasification process are introduced. This paper provides a framework for numerical modeling of the gasification process of biomass to optimize the efficiency of the conversion process.

AB A catalyst is designed for use in radio frequency (RF) induction-based biofuel upconversion. Stainless steel spheres are functionalized with Pt-nanoparticles through the use of a silane linker. These spheres are characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM/EDX and XPS followed by generation of heating profiles in an RF induction heater. The high electric conductivity of the steel balls results in rapid heating which creates a positive temperature gradient across the surface with temperatures of the steel balls reaching 300 degrees C in under 20 s. Using a minimum of 3% power (150 W), temperatures over 525 degrees C are achieved within 150 s in a single steel ball experiment. A steel bed experiment is performed to simulate an induction-based catalytic upconversion of biomass pyrolysis vapors which indicates that temperatures over 195 degrees C are achieved in as little as 300 s using 5% power (250 W). Melting and degradation of the Pt nanoparticles is evident with repeated heating at temperatures of 525 degrees C and above, fortunately, typical catalysts designed for upconversion of pyrolysis oils are operating well below these temperatures. This form of heating has a potential to mitigate the effects of coke deposition on catalyst surface, which is a pressing issue during up-conversion of pyrolysis oil and various petrochemical processes.

AB Given that castor and Eruca sativa plants are non-edible, low-impact energy crops, different scenarios for commercial-scale biorefineries based on these plants were developed. The processes were simulated by Aspen Plus (TM) software, and the estimation of equipment cost and economic analyses were performed by Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (PEA) software. In each scenario, biodiesel was produced by transesterification of oil extracted from castor (scenarios 1 and 3) and Eruca sativa (scenarios 2 and 4) grains, and the lignocellulosic residuals were used for biogas or heat (scenarios 3 and 4) production. Based on the simulation results, 7400-7470 m(3) per year biodiesel can be produced in these processes. The production price of biodiesel was obtained as 0.28, 0.04, 0.31, and 0.02 $/L for scenarios 1 to 4, respectively. Furthermore, the total capital investment was $87, 33, 89, and 34 for scenarios 1 to 4, respectively. The energy efficiencies of these processes were 63%, 71%, 63%, and 81%, respectively. Direct heat production from residues resulted in profitable processes, while biogas production was profitable only at a capacity higher than 240,000 tonnes per year. High investment requirements and interest rate were the most important factors affecting the profitability of biogas production scenarios. The results of this study could lead the research in the area toward commercialization of profitable biorefineries.

AB Microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) slurry has proven to have potential in elevating the overall performance of a photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) module as a working fluid. In order to make full use of the superiority of MPCM slurry and further improve energy and exergy efficiencies of the PV/T module, the effects of MPCM concentration and melting temperature under a wide inlet fluid velocity range were explored based on a three-dimensional numerical model of coupled heat transfer in this study. The results show that both the energy and exergy efficiencies increased with the concentration. A lower melting temperature resulted in higher energy efficiency, whereas a higher melting temperature is helpful for exergy efficiency improvement. The slurry with an excessively low melting temperature (e.g. 27 degrees C) even led to lower exergy efficiency than pure water. The melting temperature needs to be precisely tailored to make a compromise between energy and exergy efficiencies. In comparison with pure water, the improvement in energy efficiency provided by the slurry was further enhanced at a lower inlet velocity, while the improvement in exergy efficiency was optimized by adjusting the inlet velocity to a certain value. The maximum improvement in energy efficiency provided by the slurry was 8.3%, whilst that in exergy efficiency was 3.23% in this work. From the above, the superiority of MPCM slurry can be further promoted by selecting suitable material properties and operating parameters.

AB The compressed air energy storage system has the potential to enable large-scale implementation of renewable energies. However, the exergy destruction in the throttle valve and cavern is an important factor that affects the overall performance of the system. The conventional diabatic compressed air energy storage system consisted of compressors, heat exchangers, cavern, combustion chambers and turbines was studied and parameters of the Huntorf plant were adopted for calculation. Mathematical models of the components in the compressed air energy storage system were developed based on the equation of state for the real gas and the thermodynamic laws. The models are derived on the basis of assumptions that the inlet and outlet air flow rates of the cavern are negligible and that the system is operated in steady state. The test data of the Huntorf plant during the initial test was used to validate the models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the domain parameters that affect the exergy destruction in the cavern and throttle valve. The results indicated that 18.85% of the stored exergy was lost in the cavern and throttle valve during a complete cycle. The exergy destruction in the cavern was higher than that in the throttle valve, and the exergy destruction coefficients in the cavern and throttle varied with opposite tendencies when the parameters were changed. The heat transfer coefficient, injected air temperature, and initial temperature of the cavern were found to highly affect the total exergy destruction coefficient. Higher injected air temperature and lower cavern initial temperature reduces the total exergy destruction in the cavern and throttle valve.

AB The efficiency of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) can be improved by placing a shield or deflector upstream of the turbine to reduce the negative torque on the blade. However, previous studies mainly focused on fixed shields or deflectors, and the performance of the VAWT was significantly affected by the wind direction. Considering this, this paper proposed a novel passive-pitch shield (PPS) which consists of two simple plates and could passively adjust its pitch angle according to the wind direction, so that the VAWT could operate with high efficiency under any wind directions. Two-dimensional transient CFD simulations were carried out to quantitatively analyze the influence of the PPS on the performance of the VAWT. The influence of PPS on the VAWT was explained in depth from the perspective of flow structures. Simulations were also performed to verify the passive pitch capability of the PPS and good results were obtained. To further improve the performance of the VAWT, several types of PPSs were compared. It was found that the power coefficient of the VAWT was increased by 46.32%.

AB Cycle to cycle variation of a spark ignition engine is analyzed utilising wavelet analysis technique based on the spectral-temporal approach to stabilizing high cyclic variations. The selected examples of previously published cyclic IMEP measurements from a DISI engine a different percentage of fusel oil blended with gasoline (FAWE10, FAWE20, FBWE10 and FBWE20) under 4500 rpm engine speed and 60% WOT are studied. The results reveal that the increase in spectral power is observed with increasing fusel oil up to 20% with both blends (FBVVE20 and FAWE20). The indicates a pronounced influence of fusel oil ratio on the engine CCV of IMEP. However, the maximum peak in GWS observed for FBVVE20 fuel blend with more uniform overall spectral power for FAWE20 fuel blend which indicates a noticeable enhancement in cyclic variations behaviour after water extraction. As an outcome, the fusel oil water content has acted negatively to restrict the combustion as the fusel oil increased as well as the cyclic variations affected despite the high oxygen content and octane number of fusel oil.

AB Gasoline spark-ignited internal combustion engines for passenger cars are still a major part of the worldwide market share. With legislation pushing towards a lower carbon footprint, many technological alternatives are under scrutiny. Among them, one of the most promising is a variable compression ratio (VCR). This paper aims to experimentally prove the potential of this technology when applied to a state-of-the-art 3-cylinder, direct injection, turbocharged engine fuelled with regular RON 95 gasoline. A 2-stage variable compression ratio (VCR) system was applied to a series engine: The VCR prototype engine features compression ratio stages of 9.56:1 and 12.11:1. The engine has undergone only minor modifications, remaining substantially original. Dynamometer tests with in-cylinder pressure analysis were performed. The engine was tested over an operational map up to 4000 rpm and up to 26 bar BMEP, with stoichiometric operation and original ECU calibration. A fuel consumption reduction of up to 4% was found at part-load, where combustion phasing tended to be optimum. Penalties in fuel consumption at high loads were present due to knock-limited spark-timing. Results show that an even higher compression ratio variation range would further reduce of fuel consumption in both low and high load.

Specifically, two solar PV floor tile prototypes are fabricated, and its electrical and thermal performance are tested in the lab and under real conditions. The mathematical model of the developed solar PV floor is also developed, and the simulated result is compared with outdoor tests. Results show that the developed PV floor can achieve satisfactory performance in solar energy conversion, anti-slip performance, heat-resistance and compressive strength, demonstrating that such PV floor tiles can be used as a replacement of the pavements. The developed PV floor can generate power and reduce the material utilization, providing an innovative and green solution to integrate sustainable energy technologies into the park and to achieve the target of zero greenhouse gas emission.

AB This paper presents the concentration disposal index (CDI) concept extension for increasing the Water-EnergyEnvironmental nexus and reducing the environmental impacts of RO system brine. This non-dimensional index introduces the difference between the density of brine flow and raw water tank in recovery. This concept is utilized in main engine system of the ship. Different configurations of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and working fluids are studied at the outlet of high temperature thermal source (280 degrees C), based on Energy analysis (1E), Exergy (2E), Economic (3E) and environmental impacts (4E) in order to produce desalinated water (4E + D). The output power from ORC is used as the driver of RO high pressure pump. Based on the waste heat in system, the sources are used for preheating of RO system pump inlet water. These sources are: Lubricating oil, air cooler and jacket cooler and ORC condenser. The key parameters in optimization are: (1) the ORC configuration choice, (2) the working fluid of Rankine cycle based on thermal source, (3) the RO system optimum design, (4) the membrane selection among the DOW company membranes, (5) the pinch and approach temperatures of the Waste Heat Recovery (WHR), (6) the reduction of environmental impacts of RO brines, (7) the selection of Energy Recovery Device (ERD). Determination of these parameters is done according to system optimization by genetic algorithm (GA). In order to consider the CDI function impact, once the system is considered with two objectives based on exergy efficiency of the entire cycle and the unit product cost (UPC) and then is considered by three objectives; the two mentioned ones and the CDI function. The results of these two optimizations indicate that, utilizing CDI reduces the ultimate concentration of the brine and increases the buoyancy force for faster mixture. In three-objective optimization, the ORC configuration is chosen with the recuperator, the R245ca working fluid, the two-stage RO system and the SW3OXLE-400i membrane for both of stages.

AB Phase change materials are smart, feasible latent heat storage materials and have been incorporated into building materials to reduce energy demand and improve the thermal comfort of buildings. This study proposes a method for improving energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings (during both summers and winters) by developing a novel hybrid phase change material wallboard and a method to select the temperature of phase change material for different seasons (29 degrees C for summer, 18 degrees C for midseason, and 12 degrees C for winter). This type of hybrid phase change materials wallboard consists of three types of phase change materials with different phase-change temperatures that can be utilized efficiently in different seasons. The thermal performances of the hybrid phase change material wallboards (two combination modes: Model and Mode2) were evaluated by a guarded hot plate method. The effective thermal conductivity (lambda) and apparent specific heat (C-p) of these wallboards were investigated. The interior temperature variations of the two types of phase change materials wallboards were compared during heating and cooling, and it could be concluded that the Mode2 hybrid phase change materials wallboard (where phase change material was incorporated into different gypsum wallboard layers) was more suitable for real applications. The goal of this study is to investigate an appropriate method to fabricate a new hybrid phase change materials wallboard for building energy savings over different seasons.

AB Reverse electrodialysis heat engine (REDHE) is an effective technology to harvest salinity gradient energy (SGE) driven by low grade heat. In order to improve the energy conversion efficiency of it, one practical way is to enhance the capturing SGE ability of the reverse electrodialysis (RED) unit. To achieve that, the promising multistage RED (MSRED) method is proposed. In this paper, two strategies for MSRED, i.e., individually control (Strategy I) and serial control (Strategy II) respectively, were theoretically compared and analyzed. The results showed that Strategy II is more suitable in practice, although its performance is slightly inferior compared with Strategy I. After that, the influence of feed solution velocity, thickness of high concentration solution compartments, concentrations of feed solutions and flow arrangement on the relevant key performance indicators of MSRED in the two strategies were investigated. And results demonstrated that thickening compartments of high concentration solution, increasing the concentration of high concentration feed solution and adopting counter-flow arrangement are all more effective for elevating the performance of MSRED than increasing feed solution velocity. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of low concentration feed solution overly has a significant negative impact on the performance of MSRED.

AB The flue gas heat can be recovered by organic Rankine cycle (ORC) or two-stage series organic Rankine cycle (TSORC), but their comprehensive performance should be compared in detail. In this paper, ORC and TSORC are compared from thermodynamic and economic points of view. The technical indicators include the net output power, efficiency, thermal conductance, volumetric flow ratio, and the economic indicators the electricity production cost (EPC), payback period (PBP) and rate of return on investment (ROROI). The results show that the TSORC can recover more heat in the low-pressure stage from the heat source so as to decrease the irreversible loss between the heat source and the working fluid in contrast with ORC, thereby enhancing the net output power and exergetic efficiency but decreasing the thermal efficiency. However, from the economic point of view, the TSORC declines the EPC, PBP and ROROI due to that the increased investment is higher than the earnings as a result of the installation of the second-stage evaporation. A higher flue gas temperature from 200 degrees C to 300 degrees C tends to enhance the tech-economic performance of the TSORC. As the manufacturing cost goes down over time, the TSORC will further improve its economic performance in the future.

AB Organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) are used to generate power from low temperature heat sources. In this study, 28 hydro carbon (HC), hydro fluorocarbon (HFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFO) working fluids are used for three different heat source temperatures (90, 120 and 150 degrees C). A 1-D radial-inflow turbine (RIT) design with loss calculations is incorporated into the model to add dynamic turbine stage efficiency. The turbine model is run together with the ORC, and real gas properties are used for the entire system. A genetic algorithm multi-objective optimization is used to design an ORC with minimum thermal conductance per net power output and maximum performance factor (PF). The decision variables are specific speed, condensation pressure, pressure ratio at the turbine stage, degree of superheating and pinch point temperature difference (PPTD) in the evaporator. Pareto frontiers are obtained at the end of the study, and a decision-making method (TOPSIS) is used to select an optimum solution for each working fluid. R1234yf, R1234ze(e) and isobutane are found to be the optimum working fluids at 90, 120 and 150 degrees C heat source temperatures respectively. For each solution, turbine geometry, fluid velocities and impeller rotational speed are calculated.

AB This paper focuses on the thermodynamic and economic investigation of a humidification dehumidification desalination system (HDDS), using waste exhaust gas to heat the humid air. In accordance with the principles of the mass and energy conservation, thermodynamic analysis of the HDDS is first completed, and the heat and mass transfer (HMT) areas for the waste heat recovery exchanger, packing-bed humidifier and plate type dehumidifier, are obtained. Finally, the economic performance of the HDDS is also calculated. The research results state clearly that the top values of the water production and GOR arrive at 289.32 kg h(-1) and 3.06 at the dehumidification balance conditions, while the maximum total investment of the air-heated HDDS is calculated as 112.55 x 10(3) The influence laws from the variation of the dehumidification effectiveness, minimum enthalpy difference during humidification, top temperature and temperature of the waste heat source are different and complicated, especially on the unit cost of water production, which is determined with the thermodynamic and economic performance considered simultaneously. It can be concluded that the elevation of the thermodynamic performance, mainly referring to the aspect of water production, will raise the corresponding cost of the air heated HDDS, which is mainly composed of the investment of the dehumidifier area.

AB Oxyfluorosilicate glasses-doped with different concentrations of Tm3+ and Tm3+/Yb3+ ions have been synthesized and characterized their absorption, photoluminescence, luminescence decay and upconversion properties. The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters have been obtained from the absorption spectrum of Tm3+ single doped glass and are in turn used to calculate radiative properties such as transition probabilities, branching ratios and lifetimes for the fluorescent levels of Tm3+ ions. Visible and near-infrared emission spectra of Tm3+ and Tm3+/Yb3+-doped glasses have been measured under 473 nm laser excitation. The quenching of emission intensities at higher concentrations of Tm3+ ions has been found to be due to cross-relaxation mechanisms. The Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped glasses show upconverted emissions under 975 nm laser excitation. The mechanism of upconversion has been explained based on the pump power dependence of upconversion luminescence. The results reveal that the co-doped glasses are promising for optical fiber amplifiers operating at the relatively low-loss wavelength regions.

AB Amorphous alloys with pre-fabricated defective structure have been proved to have splendid ductility, making it a prospective second phase for metallic glass (MG) matrix composites. Here, the plastic deformation behavior of amorphous-amorphous (A/A) dual-phase nano-multilayers is successfully simulated by performing molecular dynamics method. The results reveal that the soft phase with structural defects in A/A nano-multilayers plays a key role in improving plasticity of MG. Specifically, when the density of structural defects is small, most of plastic deformation dominated by a single shear band is mainly confined to the flabby soft phase. A suitable density makes the clusters with large atomic shear strain more likely to be activated at the A/A interfaces, thereby linking the shear deformation between the two amorphous phases and promoting a relatively uniform global plasticity. Nevertheless, the free volume gradient caused by excessive density difference between two amorphous phases will create the rapid release of large stress at the A/A interfaces. The results indicate that the introduction of A/A interfaces and soft MG phase is an effective approach for significantly improving the plasticity without damage and expense the strength of MG.

AB Tellurite glasses with compositions (70-x)TeO2-20ZnO-5Na(2)O-4.8Bi(2)O(3)-0.2Er(2)O(3)-xTm(2)O(3) (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mol%) in fixed Er3+ and variable Tm3+ doped concentrations were synthesized by using conventional melt-quenching technique, and the concentration dependent structural nature, thermal stability and near-infrared band luminescent property were investigated. Under the excitation of 808 nm laser diode (LD), the Er3+/Tm3+ codoped tellurite glasses produced a broad near-infrared band fluorescence emission ranging from 1350 to 1650 nm, which completely covers the telecommunication window of WDM transmission system. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of this broadband emission contributed by the Er3+:I-4(13/3) -> I-4(15/2) and Tm3+:H-3(4) -> F-3(4) radiative transitions increased with the decrease of Er3+/Tm3+ doped concentration ratio, and reached to a value of about 148 nm in the 0.2 mol% Er2O3 and 0.8 mol% Tm2O3 codoped tellurite glass sample. The quantitative analyses of energy transfers between the Er3+/Tm3+ ions as well as the fluorescence decaying behavior of Er3+ were carried out to elucidate the observed broadband luminescent phenomena. Judd-Ofelt analysis was presented and some important spectroscopic parameters such as the spontaneous radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio and radiative lifetime were estimated to reveal the potential luminescent properties. Meanwhile, the amorphous structural nature of the synthesized tellurite glasses with different doped concentrations was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, the presence of functional vibrations assigned to the tellurite network was clarified by the Raman spectra and the good thermal stability of glass host was revealed by the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses. Also, the optical band gap energy corresponding to the direct and indirect allowed transitions was derived. The obtained results indicate that Er3+/Tm3+ codoped tellurite glass might be a promising candidate material for the development of near-infrared broadband fiber amplifiers.

AB In an attempt to develop a novel gamma radiation shielding glasses, we prepared borate glasses contains a high concentration of heavy metals like Bi2O3 and MoO3 with the composition of 20MoO(3)-(80-x)B2O3-xBi(2)O(3), were x varied from 30 to 45 mol% using tradition melt-quenching-annealing method. A structural investigation such as XRD and FTIR were characterized to confirm the amorphous structure of the prepared glasses and prove the availability of all chemicals included in these compositions after the melting process. Furthermore, optical studies on these glasses were investigated to prove the transparency of the fabricated glasses. Attenuation characteristics (mass attenuation coefficients, radiation protection efficiency, and half value layer) of the prepared glasses with respect to gamma photons (in the range of 0.356-1.33 MeV) were investigated. The mass attenuation coefficients and radiation protection efficiency results increased with increasing the Bi2O3 content and this improves the attenuation ability for the prepared samples. The radiation protection efficiency also revealed that the glasses have the maximum capability in attenuation gamma photons at 0.356 MeV. The mean free path with the prepared glasses was compared with some concretes which is reported in the literature and with some commercial glasses to assess their potential for use in gamma radiation shielding products.

AB The glass structure, thermal and electrical properties and water durability of the P-Sn-W-B glasses, prepared by traditional melt-quenching technique, were examined. The glasses exhibited relatively low transition temperatures (90-150 degrees C), ultra low sealing temperature (250-300 degrees C), high electrical resistivity (rho(v) = 10(11-13) Omega.cm), high coefficient of thermal expansion(CTE = 182 similar to 230(star)10(-7)/K), and excellent water durability, could be used as low melting sealing material. With the increasing NH4H2PO4/P2O5 ratio, the O/P ratio increased, from the EDX analysis. The glass structure changed with the composition, the infrared spectra showed that the P=O double bonds, O-H bending vibration decreased whereas new bonds like P-O-W formed, enhancing the glass structure, also, the water durability of glass was improved.

AB Dy2O3 is potential and attractive as scintillator, mid infrared laser and Faraday rotation materials in high energy physics, general radiation and magneto optical sensing systems. In this study, Dy3+ doped diamagnetic glasses with compositions of 10GeO(2) - 30PbO - 50Bi(2)O(3) - (10-x)B2O3 -xDy(2)O(3) (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 M %) were fabricated by a melt quenching technique. The modification of Dy3+ on glass forming, structure, UV-Vis, FT-IR, Raman and photoluminescence spectra and properties were investigated through XRD, Raman spectra, DSC, Vicker's hardness and Verdet constant measurements etc. Melt with Dy2O3 content beyond 5% prefer to crystallize, not to form glassy matrix. The UV visible absorption spectra showed three intense bands at 483 nm, 575 nm and 661 nm due to F-4(9/2) -> 6H(15/2) (blue), 4F(9/2) -> 6H(13/2) (yellow) and 4F(9/2) -> 6H(11/2) (red) transitions, respectively. Judd-Ofelt paramaters have been calculated to verify network connectivity of Dy2O3 doped glasses. FT-IR and Raman spectrum depicted the presence of PbO4, BiO3, GeO6, BO3 frame groups and Dy-O bonds from cubit Dy2O3. Glass doped with 1%Dy2O3 exhibited promising thermal stability (97 degrees C), microhardness (480 HV) and magneto-optical activity (0.1864 min/G.cm@532 nm) due to the high optical dispersion, high ion polarizability of Dy3+ ions

AB Present investigation explores the structural changes that occur in glass network as a function of compositional variation through Raman spectra of As-Sb-S-I chalcogenide glasses and correlated with their bulk mechanical properties. In this study, a series of six glasses are prepared by melt quenching technique. The glass without iodine (G1) is assigned as base glass. The rest of the glass compositions are designed with iodine content either at 10 or 20 mol% and simultaneously varying the As/Sb mol% ratio. The effects of iodine variation in the glass matrix are clearly evident from their Raman spectra as well as bulk mechanical properties which are further validated by theoretical estimated average coordination number <r>. Raman spectra analysis indicates that the peak around 150 cm(-1) corresponding to Sb-S bonds increases in amplitude and appearance of peak around 233 cm(-1) of As-S bonds in antimony and arsenic rich glasses, respectively. In addition, an intense peak around 490-495 cm(-1) and weak peak around 233 cm(-1) which are attributed to stretching vibrations S-S and As-S bonds respectively in As2S3 units can be seen only in arsenic rich glasses. The elastic modulus values denote the dependence on antimony content while Vickers hardness values are decreasing with an increase in iodine content. The Raman spectra of raw materials used in glass preparation are also analysed to compare the bonds present in crystalline raw materials to that of amorphous structure in the prepared glasses.

AB Background: Bronchiectasis is a complex respiratory disease characterised by permanent dilatation of bronchi. Vitamin D plays a role in infective disease by modulating the inflammation. Patients affected by bronchiectasis are frequently Vitamin D deficient and it correlates with lung function decline. We want to understand if there is a correlation between Vitamin D and clinical and radiological severity of bronchiectasis.
   Methods: We included 57 patients (17 males/40 female with mean age 60 +/- 12 years) between October 2017 and March 2018. We excluded patients with cystic fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis and reporting Vitamin D supplementation. Bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) and Bhalla score were calculated, blood inflammatory markers and Vit. D were measured and lung function tests were performed.
   Results: Vitamin D is deficient in 64% of patients, sufficient in 36% and normal in 7%. Mean BSI is 7.5 +/- 5 and mean Bhalla score is 16 +/- 4. Vitamin D levels correlate with Bhalla score (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001) and BSI (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.0001). The correlation appears to be stronger than other markers of inflammation such as ESR and CRP [R-2 = 0.33, p = 0.001 and R-2 = 0.39, p = 0.001 respectively].
   Conclusions: We consider Vitamin D as a good predictor of clinical and radiological severity of bronchiectasis.

AB Background: Functional status, an important predictor of health outcomes in older patients, has not been studied in an IPF population. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of frailty and geriatric conditions in older patients with IPF.
   Methods: IPF patients age >= 65 years were identified prospectively at the University of Michigan. Frailty was assessed using the Fried frailty phenotype. Questionnaires addressing functional status, geriatric conditions and symptoms were administered. Quantitative measurement of pectoralis muscle area was performed. Patient variables were compared among different frailty groups.
   Results: Of the 50 participants, 48% were found to be frail and 40% had >= 2 geriatric conditions. Frailty was associated with increased age, lower lung function, shorter 6-min walk distance, higher symptom scores and a greater number of comorbidities, geriatric conditions and functional limitations (p < 0.05). Pectoralis muscle area was nearly significant (p = 0.08). Self-reported fatigue score (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.23-3.70, p = 0.0068) and diffusion capacity (OR = 0.54 CI 95% 0.35-0.85, p = 0.0071) were independent predictors of frailty.
   Conclusions: Frailty and geriatric conditions are common in older patients with IPF. The presence of frailty was associated with objective (diffusion capacity) and subjective (self-reported fatigue score) data. Longitudinal evaluation is necessary to determine impact of frailty on disease-related outcomes in IPF.

AB Rationale: Various determinants of osteoporosis have been previously identified. However, only a few longitudinal studies have examined related factors. We aimed to investigate factors predicting and modifying rapid decline of bone mineral density in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Methods: We analyzed patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease whose bone mineral density were measured at least three times over three years (n = 111). We divided annual per cent changes of bone mineral density in different body parts into tertiles. Rapid decliners (n = 33) were defined as those with the largest decline in at least two parts; all other participants were defined as non-rapid decliners (n = 78).
   Results: At enrollment, bone mineral density did not differ between the two groups. However, rapid decliners had a significantly greater rate of new vertebral fractures over 3 years compared with non-rapid decliners. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, moderate to severe emphysema, no daily exercise habits, and anemia increased the likelihood of rapid decliners. Furthermore, patients who newly started and continued bisphosphonate exhibited higher annual per cent changes of bone mineral density than did those without bisphosphonate use.
   Conclusions: A rapid decline in bone mineral density correlates to a higher likelihood of vertebral fracture. We clarified the predictors of bone mineral density decline and demonstrated that bisphosphonate use might modify bone mineral density in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

DT Article
DE Cystic fibrosis; Pediatric chest diseases; Pulmonary rehabilitation;
   Inspiratory muscle training; Postural stability
ID EXERCISE TOLERANCE; LUNG-FUNCTION; BALANCE; ADULTS; STRENGTH; GUIDELINES
AB Background: Previous research has found conflictive results regarding the benefits of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Also, involvement of postural stability is a rising concern in chronic lung diseases but its role in CF patients is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate the effects of IMT in CF patients as well as analysing the factors which may be related to postural stability.
   Methods: Thirty-six children aged between 8 and 18 years with CF were randomly allocated to either "comprehensive chest PT" group (PT) or "IMT alongside comprehensive chest PT" group (PT + IMT). Both groups trained for 8 weeks. Dynamic and static postural stability tests on Biodex Balance system (R), spirometry, respiratory muscle strength and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of training. Determinants of postural stability was also analysed on baseline values.
   Results: Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) was found to be an independent predictor for overall limits of stability (LOS) score explaining %26 of variance (R = 0.514, p = 0.003). Overall LOS score, FVC, FEV1, peak expiratory flow, MEP and 6MWD significantly improved in both groups, with no significant differences between groups. Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) also improved in both groups but the magnitude of improvement in MIP was greater in PT + IMT group (38 cmH(2)O vs 13 cmH(2)O; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Combining IMT with chest PT failed to provide further improvements, except for MIP, suggesting that a comprehensive chest PT program may be individually effective in improving overall LOS score, spirometry, respiratory muscle strength and 6MWD.

TI 18-year evolution of asthma and allergic diseases in French urban
   schoolchildren in relation to indoor air pollutant levels
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Asthma; Allergy; Prevalence; Epidemiology; Air pollution; Children
ID SENSITIZATION; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE; BIRTH; MOLD
AB Background: An initial epidemiological study carried out 18 years ago in Marseilles indicated that the air quality in schools was poor and that there was an association between the level of fine particulates and the occurrence of asthma in children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the change in the prevalence of childhood asthma and allergic diseases and their link with the levels of air pollutants and other factors of potential risk.
   Methods: In 2016, using a questionnaire identical to the one used for the 1st survey in 1998-1999, we collected information regarding the symptoms, the diagnosis, and the potential confounding factors. We measured the main indoor and outdoor pollutants at the schools.
   Results: Overall, the prevalence of asthma and of allergic diseases exhibited an increasing trend in the time interval between the two studies, significant only for dry cough and pollen allergy. The level of air pollutants decreased significantly indoors. In spite of this, we found a correlation and a dose-effect relationship between the level of PM2.5 and the prevalence of asthma. A family history of asthma and allergies, the insalubrity of the place of residence, and a non-Mediterranean diet were also associated with the risk of these diseases.
   Conclusion: In the time interval between the two studies, which were 18 years apart, despite a reduction in the level of air pollutants in classrooms, asthma was still related to PM2.5. Other potentially causative or contributing environmental factors were also related to asthma and allergies.

AB Background: Mycobacterium kansasii is a major pathogen associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease. For treatment of M. kansasii pulmonary disease, daily therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol is traditionally recommended. Although a regimen containing a macrolide, instead of isoniazid, has been recently recommended, supporting data are limited. We compared the treatment outcomes of a macrolide-containing regimen (macrolide group) and an isoniazid-containing regimen (isoniazid group) on patients with M. kansasii pulmonary disease.
   Methods: A total of 49 patients were identified between January 2002 and December 2016. Treatment outcomes for the isoniazid group (n = 24) and the macrolide group (n = 25) were compared.
   Results: Baseline characteristics of the isoniazid and macrolide groups were similar. Favorable outcomes did not differ between the isoniazid group (79%, n = 19) and macrolide group (88%, n = 22, P = 0.463). Total treatment duration (median 17.9 months vs. 15.4 months; P = 0.712) and time to culture conversion (median 2.0 months vs. 1.2 months; P = 0.838) were also similar between the isoniazid and macrolide groups. Five patients who completed three-times-weekly intermittent treatment containing a macrolide for non-cavitary M. kansasii pulmonary disease achieved negative sputum culture conversion within 12 months of treatment. Only one patient experienced recurrence of M. kansasii pulmonary disease in the isoniazid group.
   Conclusions: A macrolide-containing regimen appears to be as effective as an isoniazid-containing regimen for treatment of M. kansasii pulmonary disease. Additionally, intermittent therapy containing a macrolide could be an alternative treatment option for non-cavitary M. kansasii pulmonary disease.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; TIME-COURSE; VARIABILITY; ASTHMA;
   MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; DECLINE
AB Background: Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) is an important event during the course of the disease. It causes a more rapid decline in lung function, which is associated with hospitalization and the risk of death. Therefore, it is essential to discover approaches to early detection and prevention of ECOPD. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) can be safely used instead of spirometry which can assess the severity of COPD as a standard tool. We hypothesized that monitoring PEF could possibly be used to predict the ECOPD.
   Method: To verify this hypothesis, daily morning PEF was monitored for 6 months in 53 patients with moderate to severe COPD (mean FEV1 31.53% predicted) who were enrolled in Ningbo, China.
   Result: A total of 69 exacerbations of COPD (63 of gradual onset, six of sudden onset) were recorded in this study. Thirty cases (43.5%) of gradual onset exacerbations needed to be hospitalized, and the mean PEF significantly decreased (vs baseline) during the 5 days that preceded those exacerbations (from 161.9 +/- 39.4 L/min to 137.9 +/- 36.1 L/min, P < 0.05, statistical power = 0.92). However, this was not the case with non-hospitalized exacerbations (from 175.4 +/- 42.5 L/min to 161.5 +/- 39.3 L/min, P = 0.172, statistical power = 0.63). The ROC analysis demonstrated that 24 h before hospitalized exacerbation, the optimal cutoff value of Delta PEF for its prediction was 28 L/min (17% from baseline), with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.7% and 72.7%, respectively (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84, P < 0.05, statistical power = 0.78). While 48 h before hospitalized exacerbation, the optimal cutoff value of Delta PEF for its prediction was 14 L/min (9% from baseline), with a sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 66.7%, respectively (AUC = 0.863, P < 0.05, statistical power = 0.87).
   Conclusions: As a rapid, inexpensive method, PEF could be used for the prediction and early detection of hospitalized exacerbation of COPD. This may provide opportunity for early intervention of ECOPD.

   Methods: Prospective cohort of 20 adults (12 male) with SEA commencing monthly mepolizumab. Measurements at baseline, Week 4 and Week 26 included the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5), spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and multiple breath nitrogen washout to measure global (Lung Clearance Index, [LCI]) and regional ventilation inhomogeneity in acinar (Sacin) and conducting (Scond) airways. Other asthma therapy remained unchanged between baseline and Week 4. Treatment related changes were assessed using RM-ANOVA and paired t-tests. Relationships between changes in lung function and symptoms were assessed by Pearson's correlation.
   Results: At Week 4, ACQ-5, spirometry, LCI and Sacin improved significantly (p < 0.04) and all were sustained at Week 26. The change in ACQ-5 correlated with the change in Sacin (r = 0.48, p = 0.03) and FRC (r = 0.46, p = 0.04), but not spirometry.
   Conclusion: Improved symptom control improved rapidly after commencing mepolizumab in patients with SEA. The early improvement in small airway function was associated with asthma control and may be a significant contributor to the therapeutic response.

AB Background: The exercise challenge is the gold standard for diagnosing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Airway obstructions appear up to 30 min after the challenge, with a maximum decrease in spirometry and a maximum increase in airway resistance. There is evidence that changes in body plethysmography parameters are more sensitive to the exercise challenge and precede those in spirometry.
   Purpose: To compare changes in body plethysmography and spirometry parameters after exercise challenges and to verify the cut-off values of sReff in EIB.
   Procedures: In 82 subjects with suspected EIB, a total of 473 lung function tests were measured at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after exercise challenges at different stages of bronchial obstruction.
   Findings: The maximum changes in the body plethysmography parameter sReff significantly preceded the maximum changes in the spirometry parameter FEV1 (sReff: 12.2 min +/- 8.8, FEV1: 15.2 min +/- 9.3, p < 0.005). The parameters of sReff and FEV1 had a strong negative correlation (r = -0.63, p < 0.0001) with a nonlinear, polynomial relationship. Furthermore, sReff and Reff had a strong linear correlation (r = 0.86, p < 0.001), and Reff and Rtot had a perfect linear correlation (r = 0.99, p < 0.001). Based on baseline values and on quantile regression, an increase of 0.25 kPa s in sReff was defined as significant. Using this cut-off value, FEV1 and sReff almost equally detected EIB.
   Conclusion: The changes in sReff were more sensitive and better indicated lung impairment than did the changes in FEV1, which underestimated the degree of hyperinflation.
