AB One of the primary functions of green roofs in urban areas is to moderate rainwater runoff, and one of the major impediments to the survival of plants on an extensive green roof (EGR) is a lack of available water during dry periods. Runoff moderation and water storage are both influenced by the composition of the growing media. Here we present a framework for evaluating the hydrologic performance of EGR growing media and also provide hydrologic attribute data for several commonly used EGR media constituents. In this three-phase study, we: 1) measured hydrologic attributes of individual EGR media constituents, 2) predicted attributes of media mixtures using individual constituent data, and 3) tested the seven top-ranking mixtures to evaluate hydrologic performance. Hydrologic attributes included wet weight and water held at maximum retentive capacity, long-term water retention, and hydraulic conductivity. Because perlite was light in weight yet held the greatest amount of water both at its maximum retentive capacity and in the long term, media mixtures dominated by perlite were predicted to have the best overall hydrologic performance. Mixtures dominated by pumice were also predicted to perform relatively well but were heavier. Despite the slightly greater weight and slightly lower performance, pumice may be a preferred alternative to perlite because perlite is a processed constituent with greater estimated embodied energy. Results indicate that performance of mixtures can be adequately predicted using performance of individual constituents for wet weight, water held, and long-term water retention. Hydraulic conductivity was less predictable because the pore volume in mixtures can be unrelated to the pore volume of the individual constituents. The framework presented here can be used to evaluate the performance of other EGR media, and the media attribute data can be used in formulating EGR media mixtures for specific applications. In addition, the attribute data can serve as a benchmark for evaluating other EGR media. Our results underscore the need for standardization of methods for more effective comparisons of EGR substrates, and also reinforce the need to evaluate EGR components using real-world scenarios.

AB In recent decades, numerous farmland birds have experienced considerable population declines. The loss of nutrient-poor habitats with short vegetation due to land-use intensification, abandonment or nitrogen deposition helps account for this decrease. Soil-disturbing ecosystem engineers can naturally create short and sparsely vegetated swards with beneficial effects for biodiversity.
   The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as an ecosystem engineer on breeding populations of the severely declining northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) on the East Frisian Islands (Lower Saxony, northern Germany). Rabbits were found to have had a considerable influence on the structure of the dune grassland, the main breeding habitat of the wheatear: high rabbit abundance resulted in greater burrow density and more bare ground. Wheatears were also more abundant on islands with larger rabbit populations. At the plot level, wheatear abundance increased with burrow density and the cover of potential foraging habitats (short vegetation). In addition, the likelihood of nest-building increased with burrow density and decreased with vegetation height.
   We thoroughly investigated the dependence of the northern wheatear on large populations of the ecosystem engineer European rabbit. Through their digging and grazing activities, rabbits create two key resources for breeding wheatears: (i) sufficient burrows as potential nesting sites and (ii) the availability of short vegetation as foraging habitats.

AB Suaeda glauca and Suaeda salsa are annual chenopod herbs that grow well in saline-alkali lands, and they share a number of morphological and physiological traits. We found that the natural distributions of these two halophytes were regionally heterogeneous in the saltmarsh of the Bohai coast, China. In the present study, habitat surveys and laboratory tests were conducted to examine the adaptability of S. glauca and S. salsa in variable environments. The habitat survey showed that S. glauca preferred to establish in soil with a lower moisture, lower EC, and higher pH as compared to S. salsa, suggesting that the adaptability of S. glauca and S. salsa to drought, salt, and alkali conditions varies. In the laboratory, these abiotic stresses were simulated at varying degrees by hydroponic culture. Plant biomass, water content, cations and anions distribution were measured after 10 days treatments. The results showed that (1) the inhibitory effect of the drought treatment on S. salsa shoot fresh weight and water content was less than that on S. glauca. Low and moderate drought treatments inhibited the root growth of S. glauca but promoted S. salsa root growth with Mg2+ and SO42- accumulation. (2) S. glauca and S. salsa were both highly resistant to salinity, and their adaptive strategies were similar. The optimum NaCl concentration for S. salsa was 200 mM, higher than that of 100 mM for S. glauca, and a greater K+ deficiency was observed in S. glauca roots under high salinity treatment. (3) Although high alkali stress was destructive to S. glauca and S. salsa, low alkali treatment promoted the plants root growth, and this promotion in S. glauca was greater than that in S. salsa. Furthermore, low and moderate alkali treatments significantly increased Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents in S. glauca root but had little effect in S. salsa. These results indicated that S. salsa was more tolerant to drought and salt stresses than S. glauca but less tolerant to alkalinity. The resistance variation between the two species was mainly due to their root adaptability and the potential cations regulation. Moreover, our study suggests that S. salsa is an optimal species for the artificial revegetation in high saline land, while S. glauca is more adaptable to alkali land.

AB In order to explore the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches on its surrounding thermal environment, the remote sensing image data of Taiyuan City was used as the basic data source, and the temperature field under the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches was simulated by CFD technique. The dimensionless parameter of relative temperature change rate was introduced as the index of thermal environment effect. From the existing shape index reflecting the patch characteristics, the indicators of the green patch affecting the surrounding thermal environment were screened out, and the corresponding quantitative relationship between them was established. Based on the statistical analysis of patch shape index and thermal environment effect index, it is pointed out that the deviation degree for equivalent perimeter of patch is positively correlated with the relative change rate of temperature reflecting thermal environment effect. Meanwhile, the smaller area of green space can be used to improve local microclimate. The introduction of CFD technology into the study of urban thermal environment provides a basis for exploring the key parameters to improve the ecological environment benefits of urban green space and determining the shape control index of patch in green space planning and design. On the other hand, the simulation function of CFD technology is used to optimize green space design, which has better significance to guide production practice.

AB Constructed wetlands are increasingly used within urban areas to reduce pollutant runoff, including nitrogen. These environments are exposed to frequent wetting and drying events, and also increasing temperatures due to the heat island effect and seasonal variation. In this study, we have investigated the role of drying and rewetting of sediments and temperature on the partitioning of two nitrate reduction pathways: denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in four constructed urban stormwater wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. Our results suggest that both DNF and DNRA decreased due to drying of sediments, but DNRA decreased to a greater extent. Rates of DNRA from the drying-rewetting treatment decreased 5-90% compared to the control. Moreover, a concomitant increase in NH(4)(+ )fluxes and a slight change in sediment oxygen demand (SOD) suggest that oxic conditions arising from sediment drying was responsible for the decreased rates of DNF and DNRA. Rates of both DNF and DNRA increased with increasing temperature in slurries. The DNF:DNRA ratio suggests that the relative increase in DNRA was more than DNF with increasing temperature. The mean activation energy of DNF ranged from 41 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) and the corresponding temperature coefficient (Q(10)) values ranged from 1.3 to 2.4. In comparison, the mean activation energy of DNRA was higher and ranged from 50 +/- 8 to 107 +/- 14 kJ mol(-1) with the corresponding Q(10) values ranging from 1.2 to 3.4. Overall, our results suggest that drying and re-wetting of sediments decreases nitrate reduction and increases nitrogen retention, whereas increased temperature enhances the recycling of bioavailable nitrogen in wet sediments in constructed urban stormwater wetlands.

AB Macroinvertebrates are sensitive to changes in the river environment and ecological status. Ecological variables over multi-spatial scales and macroinvertebrate community data were collected in June (normal flow season) and September (high flow season) of 2017 in the Weihe River Basin (WRB). A total of 14,377 individuals were identified, which were classified into 7 classes, 18 orders and 59 families. Macroinvertebrate community composition, density, biomass, the values of Pielou evenness index (E), Simpson diversity index (lambda) were significantly different between normal flow season and high flow season. The dominant species (Tubificidae, Chironomidae and Baetidae) were the same in both seasons. The highest richness, abundance, density and biomass occurred at a stream bed depth of 0-10 cm. The results of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that ecological factors explained the major variation in macroinvertebrate community composition. Specifically, the increased nitrogen concentrations favored tolerant species, whereas high velocity and dissolved oxygen (DO) benefitted community taxa richness and biodiversity. The reduction of taxa richness, abundance, density and biomass in high flow season was related to the summer flood. Increased nutrient concentrations and macroinvertebrate habitat damage contributed to more tolerant, yet less diverse stream macroinvertebrate assemblages.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotic (FQ) residues in aquaculture ponds are being highlighted around the world because of its high potential threat to environment and human health. This study aimed to apply submerged macrophytes to restore the sediment contaminated by enrofloxacin (ENR) in aquaculture ponds. The results showed that the relative growth rate of Vallisneria spiralis L. was not inhibited when the ENR concentrations in the sediment varied at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg DW. Low ENR concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg DW) promoted the elongation growth, N and P accumulation of V. spiralis, but high concentration (5.0 mg/kg DW) inhibited the root elongation and N and P accumulation of leaves. Meanwhile, the ENR removal efficiencies were 74.7%, 32.3% and 60.0% at the above mentioned three concentrations, respectively. 45.6% and 70.4% of the CIP were eliminated from the sediment with ENR concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg DW. Under the influence of V. spiralis and FQs, the microbial diversity of the sediment samples was greatly influenced by ENR, but affected little by its concentration. ENR and ciprofloxacin (CIP) caused a clear increase in the abundance of Acidobacteria, Planctomycetia and Verrucomicrobia, while suppressing the abundance of Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. As a result, submerged macrophytes showed great potential in restoring the aquaculture ponds with FQ residues.

AB We report suppression of multiphoton ionization (MPI) of aniline doped large superfluid helium droplets containing over 5 x 10(6) atoms. In contrast, surface-bound sodium atoms and dimers are readily desorbed and ionized. Adequacy of the experimental conditions is also confirmed from ejection of embedded aniline cations from smaller droplets containing multiple cations, and MPI of gaseous aniline. The photoelectrons have a mean-free-path of less than 1 nm and a thermalization distance of 10 nm. In a droplet with a diameter of over 70 nm, effective charge recombination within the droplet is expected.

AB This paper is the next step to resolve long-standing puzzles related to metal particle combustion. Based on the recently developed model on the metal particle burn time, we are able to explain the burn time dependence on the oxygen concentration. This dependence is weaker than the inverse proportion described by a classical law. We show that the effect appears due to a significant contribution of the atomic oxygen to the effective enthalpy of reaction, which is crucial for the combustion model we had suggested.

AB We propose an easy to implement protocol for the development of force fields that can be employed in a binary system. Intermolecular parameters are computed through a simple and efficient FF parameterization protocol. As a prototype we used a solution of oxygen in dimethylsulfoxide to validate our FF by evaluating the RDFs, the diffusion coefficients and the solvation free energy. Our results let us conclude that our FF is able to correctly describe the DMSO - O-2 system, in agreement with experimental findings. In addition, our protocol is a highly useful tool that allows FF development with application to binary systems.

AB Methods to calculate rates of chemical reactions ab initio, in reduced dimensions, using Semiclassical Transition State Theory have recently been formulated. Here we further develop its application to unimolecular reactions where the choice of active degrees of freedom is not clear a priori. We describe in more detail a procedure to determine which degrees of freedom must be accounted for explicitly in the reduced dimensionality framework, and illustrate its success on a hydrogen transfer reaction of a cyclocarbene species.

AB Water adsorption effect on a solid surface can change water fluidity and viscosity to leave an impact on engineering processes. However, the water adsorption effect caused by Coulomb interaction (Coulomb adsorption) has seldom been tested. Therefore, this paper designed a narrow slot seepage experiment to study the water adsorption effect on water fluidity under different external electric field along with different ion concentration and hydraulic gradient. The experiment results showed that the dynamic viscosity of water in the slot would be enhanced by the growing electric field strength; the growth of hydraulic gradient was not conducive to Coulomb adsorption; and there was a threshold hydraulic gradient i(T) (around 26.67 in this paper) that when i > i(T). the growth of ion concentration would be conducive to Coulomb adsorption, while it would be adverse to Coulomb adsorption when i < i(T).

AB Perchlorate IR lineshapes in ionic solutions, polymeric membrane, and perchlorate coordinated onto manganese (III) porphyrin were investigated using various model systems. The lineshape of perchlorate ligand is very sensitive to the nanoscopic aqueous environment. The observed asymmetric mode of ligated perchlorate has a smaller bandwidth and faster dynamics than that of 1M perchlorate aqueous solution. When we used chemical exchange models of coherence, the IR lineshapes of 6M-concentrated anionic solutions have better fit. The IR lineshape of 6M-concentrated anionic solution in the polymer matrix was best fitted by assuming the chemical exchange of coherence with spectral diffusion.

AB Laser treatment of MEH-PPV films increased photoluminescence (PL) by up to 400% in nitrogen. Maximum enhancement was observed with irradiances between 20 and 70 mu W/mu m(2), and a total fluence of similar to 700 mu J/mu m(2). (Below similar to 1 mu W/mu m(2) only photobleaching was observed). PL continued to increase for 16 h after treatment ended suggesting that the morphology continued to evolve in the absence of light. After 1 day, emission remained unchanged suggesting the new morphology is stable at room temperature. We believe this increased PL efficiency in primarily the result of reduced efficiency of trap-assisted recombination due to decreased interchain energy transfer.

AB CdSe quantum dots (QDs) grows slowly in mesoporous TiO2 film deriving from a large lattice mismatch (11%) and poor interaction between the two, which resulting the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). An external voltage is applied in the successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) process, which drives the Cd2+ and SeSO32- ions quickly diffused into the mesoporous TiO2 film and reacted to form CdSe QDs at room temperature. The CdSe QDSSCs yields a PCE of 3.27%. This work provides an efficient strategy to assemble QDs for enhancing the performance of QDSSCs.

AB Specific interaction of the chloride and perchlorate ions with F127 hydrogel is studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and picoseconds dynamics. An anionic dye C343 probes the hydrophilic corona while the hydrophobic dye C153 reports on the core. In the absence of salts, C343 experiences a translational viscosity of similar to 16 cP, which increases to similar to 29 cP in 1 M LiCl and similar to 39 cP in 1 M LiClO4. Anisotropy decays remain unaffected by salts. The perchlorate ion makes solvation dynamics at corona faster while the chloride ion has no effect. At core, the ions do not affect translational viscosity or solvation dynamics.

AB Intrinsic wettability of CVD-grown graphene on Cu/alpha-Al2O3(0 0 01) to ionic liquid [emim][NTf2] was investigated by in situ contact angle measurement in a high vacuum. The contact angles increased with the coverage of graphene from a complete wetting regime on the clean Cu surface to a partial wetting regime on the surface fully covered with graphene. The measured contact angles were well explained by the Cassie equation. Since the contact angle of graphene was close to that of bulk HOPG, it is indicated that the first layer graphene is just enough to govern its wettability.

The novel biosensor was based on molecular imprinted Mn-doped ZnS quantum dots. Two fragments which mimicked the partial structure of CYN were carefully selected to synthesize the molecularly imprinted 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped Mn-ZnS quantum dots (MPA-MnZnS-QDs-MIPs). As the two fragment imprinted sites could enhance the rebinding of CYN into them and modulated Mn-ZnS QDs' selective aggregation in MPA-MnZnS-QDs-MIPs. Hence, the enhanced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) response was observed as the MPA-MnZnS-QDs-MIPs interacted with CYN in the water sample. A good linear relationship with the concentration of CYN in the range of 30-320 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 24 mu g L-1 was demonstrated by the enhanced phosphorescence intensity ratio Delta P/P-0. And our detection method exhibited higher selectivity for CYN than the two partial fragments. Also, there was no interference on the detection system when the competitors were present in the algae culture samples. The method presented required minimal expertise and enabled fast and inexpensive monitoring of the water toxins.

ID NS5 METHYLTRANSFERASE; INTERACTION ENTROPY; PROTEIN
AB We investigated residue-specific binding free energies using computational alanine scanning with interaction entropy method to identify hot-spots and unravel molecular basis in 3 ligand bindings to Zika SAM binding site. This approach allows one to obtain quantitatively residue-specific contributions to protein-ligand binding free energy. Our computational analysis identified four major residues, W87, 1147, H110, and K105 that contribute most to the ZIKV bindings to both SAH and SFG ligands. There are two additional residues, R160 and R163, that also contribute significantly to the binding. Finally, the computed total binding free energies are in good agreement with experimentally measured data.

AB A novel mixed micelles was developed to improve the solubility of Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). Sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and D-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) were utilized as micelles material, mainly based on the design that ZnPc was located inside the hydrophobic core of mixed micelles, which was formed by supramolecular self-assembly of SDC and TPGS. A series of ZnPc loaded mixed micelles containing different quality of SDC were prepared and characterized by means of their physicochemical properties, photodynamic activity, photostability, drug release and cell viability. These mixed micelles appeared spherical, short rod and long rod shape, respectively, with corresponding particle sizes of about 106 nm, 344 nm and 80 nm, respectively. Drug loading efficiencies were higher than 90%. The capacity of ZnPc loaded mixed micelles to produce singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) by irradiation with 650 nm red laser was monitored using 1,3-diphenylisobenzo-furan as a probe. The singlet oxygen quantum yields (Phi(Delta)) for ZnPc loaded mixed micelles were high to that of the standard (ZnPc in DMF), and three of mixed micelles displayed excellent ability to generate O-1(2) (the value of Phi(Delta) A were greater than 0.70). These mixed micelles were photostable in the timescale typically used in photo-dynamic therapy (PDT), and only a small photobleaching event was observed after 20 min of light irradiation. The in vitro drug release studies of ZnPc loaded mixed micelles demonstrated a sustained release profile. Phototoxicity experiments in A549 cells showed that mixed micelles had higher toxicity than that of free ZnPc with the same concentration. Thus, the mixed micelles developed in this work are a promising strategy to be employed in delivery of ZnPc in PDT.

AB The spectral behavior of the spin probe TEMPO in the bulk cyclohexane (CHX) and its confined states in a series of silica gels (SG) using ESR is reported. The spectral parameter A(zz), and the characteristic ESR temperature T-50G. of slow to fast regime transition of TEMPO change dramatically in the virgin SG-SIL's compared to the bulk CHX sligtly depending on the pore size. These observations result from the interrelation between the mutual interaction of the TEMPO with the SG's and the altered phase behavior of the CHX from DSC. This is supported by the modified (silanized) SG matrices.

AB We calculate vibrational and Raman spectra for B-doped, P-doped, and B-P codoped Si nanocrystals using real-space pseudopotentials constructed within density functional theory. An experimental extrinsic peak in the Raman spectra near 650 cm(-1) is observed in codoped nanocrystals. We analyze the origin of this peak and find that it can be best explained by the presence of B-P bonds, which are located near the surface of the nanocrystal. We propose that the spectral details of this peak are related to quantum confinement and the breaking of local symmetry associated with the phonon modes involving dopant bonds.

AB In order to study effects of different solvents on Ti anodization process, we compared the morphology changes of TiO2 nanotubes in three fluoride-containing electrolytes composed of ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol, diethylene glycol (DEG), respectively. Results show that close-packed nanotubes are obtained in EG electrolyte, spaced nanotubes are obtained in DEG electrolyte. In this paper, the formation mechanism of spaced nanotubes is discussed. The difference in three solvent effects is that the weak ability of DEG to bind protons leads to strong solution etching effect, which is the key to form spaced nanotubes.

AB The La0.885Pb0.005Ca0.11FeO2.95 sample has been prepared using the sol-gel method based on the use of citric acid. In this research paper, structural, morphological and NH3 gas-sensing properties have been reported. The structural study has proven that our sample crystallized in the orthorhombic structure with Prima space group. The electrical and gas sensing measurements have shown that the La0.885Pb0.005Ca0.11FeO2.95 sample presents p-type semiconductor behavior and can be able to detect the ammonia gas with different concentrations from 10 to 100 ppm with quick response times. We have noted that we had obtained the highest sensitivity at 270 degrees C considered as the operating temperature of our sensor.

AB The key difficulty to develop efficient high-order methods for integrating stochastic differential equations lies in the calculations of the multiple stochastic integrals. This letter suggests a scheme to compute the stochastic integrals for the colored noises based on the white noise representation. The multiple stochastic integrals involving one and two stationary noises can be conveniently generated together with noises using the discrete Fourier transformation. Based on the calculated stochastic integrals, we obtain simple fourth-order and third-order strong methods for equations with a single and multiple noises, respectively. Numerical tests verify the accuracy of the suggested methods.

AB Understanding the crystal nucleation mechanism and kinetics is essential for predicting and controlling numerous natural and industrial processes. However, it is extremely difficult to experimentally determine certain key parameters, such as the critical nucleus size, the interfacial free energy, and the diffusion coefficient in multicomponent liquids. In this work, we used MD data on nucleation rates and diffusion coefficient to analyze the nucleation kinetics in a Ni50Ti50 alloy in the framework of the Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT). Our analysis validates the CNT as a good descriptor of the crystal nucleation rates in this supercooled alloy, corroborating recent results of MD simulation of supercooled Lennard-Jones and BaS liquids.

ID CAPACITY ELECTRODE MATERIAL; PREDICTION; BOROPHENE; SODIUM; LAYER; LI
AB Using first-principles methods, we have investigated the adsorption and diffusion of Na and K over Janus MoSSe for Na/K-ion batteries (NIBs/KIBs) anodes. The optimized adsorption energies were found to be 1.66 eV for Na and 2.18 eV for K which are sufficiently large to ensure stability and safety during operation. In addition, Janus MoSSe yields a high storage capacity of 510 mAh/g and 203 mAh/g, respectively. Additionally, Janus MoSSe has low diffusion barriers 0.075 and 0.058 eV for Na and K, respectively. Given these advantages, we conclude that the Janus MoSSe can be considered as an excellent candidate for anodes in NIBs/KIBs.

AB In recent years, using graphene to modify BiVO4 has become a research hotspot. However, there are few reports on the effects of the graphene size and the loading content on the photocatalytic activity of the graphene-modified BiVO4. In this work, a series of BiVO4 photocatalysts modified by oxide graphene (GO) of different sizes and loadings were prepared, characterized and their activities were investigated. The results showed that when the size of GO was 5-7 mu m and the loading was 0.5 wt%, the phenol degradation rate over the GO-modified BiVO 4 was the best and reached 65.2% after 5 h visible light irradiation.

AB In this work, a multi-site adsorption inhibitor (DBI) was synthesized and characterized. The corrosion inhibition performance of symmetric benzyl lauric acid imidazoline quaternary ammonium salt under 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) condition was studied by weight loss test, potentiodynamic polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SEM and XRD techniques. The experiment results have shown that the inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in an inhibitor concentration. Potentiodynamic polarization showed that this inhibitor is an anodic-type inhibitor. It is proved that the corrosion inhibitor has high surface properties and good adsorption performance on the surface of P110 steel through the contact angle and surface tension test. Furthermore, the adsorption of the corrosion inhibitor conforms to the Langmuir's adsorption isotherm on the surface of P110 steel.

AB In the multi-center molecular integrals, Gaunt coefficients have an important role for numerical calculations. If we want to find correct results from molecular interactions, then we have to calculate accurately their molecular integrals which contain Gaunt coefficients. These coefficients and atomic spherical harmonics have a remarkable relationship. Namely, analytical productions of spherical harmonics generate these coefficients. In this paper, we present some best-known definitions for Gaunt coefficients, and later for them, we find new representations with binomial coefficients. Finally, we will give other mathematical details and numerical results for these coefficients to emphasize their quantum mechanical importance.

AB Rate constants for the removal of O-2(b(1)Sigma(+)(g)) by collisions with I-2 and NO have been determined over the temperature range from 300 to 750 K. Time dependent laser induced fluorescence (LIF) from the b(1)Sigma(+)(g) -> X-3 Sigma(-)(g) transition has been recorded in the temperature range of 297-750 K. The measured temperature-dependent rate constants for quenching of O-2(b) by NO can be represented by the expression 5.1 x 10(26) x (T-4) x exp(1338/T). The rate constant for quenching of O-2(b) by I-2 was found to be insensitive to temperature and approximately equal to (6.3 +/- 1) x 10(-11) cm(3)/s over the range of 297-750 K.

AB Arsine gas holds an important place in industrial toxicology. The aim of this work is to identify and characterize the hydrogen bonding in the complexes formed by arsine and H-X (X = F, Cl, Br, HO, NC, CN, CH3, C2H) molecules. It is hopeful that these analyses and calculations could be helpful to understand the essence of chemical bonding in the complexes formed by arsine and other molecules. Various methods including electrostatic potential, natural bond orbital, atoms in molecules theory, electron density difference plots and reduced electron density gradient were used to characterize the interactions in all these complexes.

AB Introduction: There is some evidence to suggest that a systemic and central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response occurs following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) which may be related to the pathophysiology of early brain injury and delayed ischaemic neurological deficit (DIND). The aim of this study was to measure inflammatory mediator levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the days following aSAH and to determine their association with aSAH, DIND and clinical outcome.
   Material and methods: Plasma and CSF samples were obtained prospectively from patients with aSAH on days 1-3, 5, 7 and 9 and profiled for interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Plasma and CSF samples from non-aSAH patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia were used as controls.
   Results: The CSF levels of all cytokines investigated except for IL-1 alpha were significantly higher in aSAH compared to controls in the first seven days of ictus. CSF levels of IL-1 alpha (p = 0.014), IL-18 (p = 0.016), IL-6 (p = 0.0006) and IL-8 (p = 0.006) showed significant increases in the days following aSAH. Conversely IL-17 demonstrated a decrease. In particular, IL-4 was higher in the CSF of patients who had DIND at all time-points (p = 0.032). Plasma IL-6 and IL-8 levels were higher, and IL-1 alpha levels lower, than controls at most time-points. All mediators demonstrated persistent elevation in the CSF compared to plasma apart from IL-1 alpha and IL-18 which followed the opposite trend. Day 3 plasma IL-6 levels predicted poor outcome at six months (Exp(B) 1.12 1.03-1.22, P = 0.012), although this association was lost in the second analysis incorporating Fisher grade, WFNS grade and age.
   Conclusion: The post aSAH inflammatory response peaks on days 5-7 post ictus and remains largely compartmentalised within the CNS. IL-4 may have a particular association with DIND although its precise role in the pathophysiology of the disorder remains unclear. IL-6 predicted poor outcome but not independently of clinical grade, suggesting that it may be a surrogate marker of early brain injury.

AB The immune profile associated with distinct clinical forms of tuberculosis (TB) has been extensively described for adult populations. Nevertheless, studies describing immune determinants of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB (PTB or EPTB, respectively) in children are scarce. Here, we retrospectively assessed plasma levels of several mediators of inflammation in age and sex-matched children from South India presenting with PTB (n = 14) or EPTB (n = 22) as well as uninfected healthy controls (n = 19) to identify biomarkers that could accurately distinguish different TB clinical forms. Furthermore, we performed exploratory analyses testing the influence of sex on the systemic inflammatory profile. The analyses identified a biosignature of 10 biomarkers capable of distinguishing the three clinical groups simultaneously. Machine-learning decision trees indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were the markers that, when combined, displayed the highest accuracy in identifying the clinical groups. Additional exploratory analyses suggested that the disease signatures were highly influenced by sex. Therefore, sex differentially impacted status of systemic inflammation, immune activation and tissue remodeling in children with distinct clinical forms of TB. Regardless of such nuances related to biological sex, MMP-7, CRP and LBP were strong discriminators of active TB and thus could be considered as biomarkers useful in discrimination different TB clinical forms. These observations have implications on our understanding of the immunopathology of both clinical forms of TB in pediatric patients. If validated by other studies in the future, the combination of identified biomarkers may help development of point-of-care diagnostic or prognostic tools.

AB Background and objective: TNF-alpha 308 G/A variant is recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although many studies have investigated the association of TNF-alpha 308 and COPD risk, a deep understanding of this association is lacking due to small subjects sizes and insufficiently study designs among different investigations. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed based on published reports on the association of TNF-alpha and COPD.
   Method: The published studies concerned the association between TNF-alpha and COPD were identified using a systematic research in Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed up to April 2018. A total of 46 different papers studying the rs1800629 variant in TNF-alpha gene were included. Then, human studies were selected to further analysis regardless of papers language.
   Results: Based on the results, the major outcome of this meta-analysis can be represented as follows: individuals with GG and GA genotypes possess less risk of developing COPD (OR = 0.58, 95%Cl: (0.44-0.79), P < 0.00) compared to AA genotype carriers. In contrast, the AA genotype carriers of the TNF-alpha rs1800629 has a significantly higher risk of developing COPD (OR = 1.83, 95%CI: (1.34-2.51), P < 0.00) compared to GG carrier. Despite the previous meta-analysis results which reported significantly decreasing of heterogeneity with ethnicity, we found that the source of controls has a significant contribution to observed heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: Thanks to the global burden of COPD studies, proving TNF-alpha 308 gene variant as an independent factor in its pathogenesis opens new insights to diagnosis and management of COPD.

AB Background: Irisin is a myokine/adipokine that under stimulus of physical exercise is able to improve thermogenic capacity in adipose tissue. Likewise, taurine supplementation has demonstrated similar effects on energy metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesized that taurine supplementation combined with physical training may induce an increase in irisin concentrations, optimizing energy metabolism in obese individuals. Objective: To evaluate if taurine supplementation associated with a high intensity physical training program increases irisin levels in obese women. Methods: double-blind study with 22 obese women (BMI 32.4 2.0 kg/m(2), 36.6 +/- 6.4 years and sedentary) who were randomly divided into two groups, control group (GC, n = 14), exercised and supplemented with placebo (3 g of starch), and taurine group (GTAU, n = 8), exercised and supplemented with taurine (3 g). The subjects performed high intensity physical training, Deep Water Running (DWR), for 8 weeks, 3 times/week, for 50 min per training session, at 70-85% maximum heart rate. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was evaluated by indirect calorimetry, body composition by deuterium oxide, plasma taurine by HPLC, plasma irisin by Multiplex Kit, and food consumption by food records. The results were analyzed by an ANOVA two way repeated measures mixed model, with the Sidak post hoc (p < 0.05). Results: No changes were observed in body composition. DWR increased RMR independent of supplementation (p < 0.001) and irisin levels (pg/mL) showed a significant difference only in the GTAU in 1 h after exercise (p < 0.001). Conclusion: DWR associated with taurine supplementation resulted in increased plasma irisin concentrations after physical training in obese adult women.

AB Objectives: Conventionally regarded as a harmless skin commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounts for the majority of neonatal late-onset sepsis and is shown to be associated with neonatal inflammatory morbidities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This study addressed the pro-inflammatory capacity of different S. epidermidis strains on human alveolar epithelial cells.
   Methods: A549 cell monolayers were stimulated by live bacteria of S. epidermidis RP62A strain (biofilm-positive) and ATCC 12228 strain (biofilm-negative) at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10 for 24 h. LPS (100 ng/ml) and Pam3CSK4 (1 mu g/ml) were used for comparisons. Cell viability was measured by MTT method. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 were assessed using RT-PCR, immunoassays and immunofluorescence.
   Results: Both S. epidermidis strains induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1 beta, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, but not IL-10. The stimulatory effect of RP62A exceeded that of LPS (p < 0.05). RP62A strain showed a trend towards higher induction of pro-inflammatory mediators than ATCC 12228 strain. The co-stimulation with RP62A strain decreased cell viability compared to control and TLR agonists (p < 0.05). RP62A but not ATCC 12228 stimulated mRNA and protein expression of TLR2.
   Conclusions: S. epidermidis drives pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells in vitro. The pro-inflammatory capacity of S. epidermidis may differ between strains. Biofilm-positive S. epidermidis strain seems to induce more potent pulmonary pro-inflammation than biofilm-negative S. epidermidis strain.

AB In the majority of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) patients, a point mutation, V617F has been found in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene, and this JAK2 mutant provoked aberrant signaling pathway. In the current study, we found that suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins 3 (SOCS3) possessed the tumor suppressive activity against the JAK2 V617F mutant-provoked cellular transformation. The knockdown of SOCS3 increased the expression level of the JAK2 V617F mutant, which enhanced the activation of signaling mediators, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and 5 (STAT3, STAT5) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and also increased of the proliferation rate and tumorigenesis activity of Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutant and erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). In contrast, the enforced expression of SOCS3 significantly inhibited the JAK2 V617F mutant-induced activation of downstream signaling molecules, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis by down-regulating the expression level of the JAK2 V617F mutant. SOCS3 interacted with the JAK2V617F mutant through its SH2 domain and was phosphorylated at Tyr-204 and Tyr-221 in its SOCS box by the JAK2V617F mutant. SOCS3 mutants carrying a mutation in the SH2 domain (R71E) and a substitution at Tyr-221 (Y221F) failed to exert inhibitory effects on JAK2V617F mutant-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results imply that SOCS3 plays a negative role in the JAK2 V617F mutant-induced oncogenic signaling pathway through its SH2 domain and the phosphorylation of Tyr-221 in its SOCS box.

AB Obesity is a common metabolic disorder with increasing trend all around the world. Owing to the role of pro inflammatory cytokines on obesity, we aimed to investigate the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) polymorphisms on risk of obesity.
   Electronic literatures were searched in Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. The references of relevant reviews and included studies were also manually checked. All types of observational studies from 1 January 1992 to 28 February 2018 were included. Odds ratio (OR) was,estimated by fixed and random effect model. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on age statues.
   Pooling analysis of eligible studies have been considered for rs2069845 and rs1800796, and no significant results were observed. Minor allele of IL-6 rs1800797polymorphism decreased the risk of obesity/overweight in allelic 0.74 (0.59-0.92), dominant 0.65 (0.49-0.85), and over-dominant 0.66 (0.51-0.87) models. Fourteen eligible studies were included for rs1800795. According to BMI, C allele showed increased risk of obesity in genetic models containing homozygote model 1.47 (1.02-2.12) for body mass index (BMI) >= 25 vs. BMI < 25, recessive model 1.32 (1.07-1.63) for BMI >= 30 vs. BMI < 25, and homozygote model 1.35 (1.10-1.66) for BMI >= 30 vs. BMI < 30. In overall definition of obesity more significant results were observed, including homozygote model in obese vs. normal 1.71 (1.14-2.56). Similarly, subgroups analysis revealed additional significant results.
   Minor alleles of rs1800795 raised and rs1800797 reduced the risk of obesity, while rs1800796 and rs2069845 may not be associated. However, more observational studies are recommended to confirm these results.

AB Musculoskeletal disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide; two of the most prevalent of which are osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Each affect millions in the aging population across the world and the associated morbidity and mortality contributes to billions of dollars in annual healthcare cost. Thus, it is important to better understand the underlying pathologic mechanisms of the disease process. Regulatory chemokine, CXCL12, and its receptor, CXCR4, are recognized to be essential in the recruitment, localization, maintenance, development and differentiation of progenitor stem cells of the musculoskeletal system. CXCL12 signaling results in the development and functional ability of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, satellite cells and myoblasts critical to maintaining musculoskeletal homeostasis. Interestingly, one suggested pathologic mechanism of osteoporosis and sarcopenia is a decline in the regenerative capacity of musculoskeletal progenitor stem cells. Thus, because CXCL12 is critical to progenitor function, a disruption in the CXCL12 signaling axis might play a distinct role in these pathological processes. Therefore, in this article, we perform a review of CXCL12, its physiologic and pathologic function in bone and muscle, and potential targets for therapeutic development.

AB Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis is the most spread clinical form of leishmaniasis in Brazil. However, only a few part of the people infected develop clinically perceptive disease, suggesting the influence of human genetic components in the CL pathogeny. The rs2275913 SNP is the nucleotide variant of the IL17A gene. The A allele is associated with a vast number of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Here, we investigated the association of the rs2275913 SNP (G/A) from IL-17A and two forms of susceptibility to CL in Brazil by case-control study. Furthermore, we evaluated the functional relevance of this SNP during the immune response of the host and analyzed its impact in the parasite elimination. Weak associations of A allele with susceptibility to L. braziliensis infection or to symptomatic CL were observed, and a tendency of A allele carriers to be more susceptible to infection and cutaneous disease. Functional analysis of the Th17 cell phenotypes revealed lower frequencies of CD4 + IL-17+ cells in samples of infected people with AA/AG genotypes. Furthermore, people carrying the A allele maintain higher parasite loads, reinforcing the genetic susceptibility findings. This study adds knowledge about the influence of a significant genetic variation on IL-17 promoter on CL pathogenesis, and may contribute to enhance the knowledge about the role of IL-17 in the L. braziliensis infections.

AB Responsiveness to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in hemodialysis (HD) patients who had been exposed to the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and persistently generate antibodies against HEV remains unknown. Interferon (IFN)-lambda 3 positively correlates with the surface HBV antibodies (anti-HBs) in both healthy and HD subjects. We aimed to show whether HD patients differ in circulating IFN-lambda 3 and vaccine-induced anti-FIBs titers concerning natural HEV immunization. HBV/HCV negative HD patients (31 HEV IgG positive, 45 HEV negative), HBV vaccinated and receiving booster doses as needed, had been tested for anti-HBs titers (CMIA) and IFN-lambda 3 concentrations (ELISA) in the blood collected before a dialysis session. There were no differences in circulating IFN-lambda 3 and anti-HBs titers between both groups. In responders to the HBV vaccine, there was a positive correlation between plasma IFN-lambda 3 levels and anti-HBs titers (r = 0.505, adjusted P = 0.01 in HEV exposed subjects; r = 0.523, adjusted P = 0.001 in controls). HEV past infection does not attenuate post-vaccination anti-HBs generation and does not influence a correlation between circulating IFN-lambda 3 levels and anti-HBs titers.

AB Humans and animals frequently experience dysmetabolism induced by inflammation. Zinc-alpha 2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a newly identified adipokine, is potentially involved in lipid metabolism. Our previous study revealed that the ZAG content increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To clarify ZAG's possible effects on inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism, we used gene overexpression and knockout mice as models to investigate the function of ZAG during inflammation. The results showed that LPS increased plasma triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acid and hepatic triglyceride, while ZAG overexpression decreased these effects. Furthermore, ZAG overexpression weakened inflammatory responses, suppressed lipogenesis, and improved mitochondrial function during inflammation. ZAG overexpression also increased beta 3-adrenoreceptor, protein kinase A, and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB), promoted the combination of CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and competitively inhibited the combination of nuclear factor-kappa B and CBP. After ZAG knockout, LPS-induced the hyperlipidemia worsened. ZAG knockout aggravated inflammatory responses, promoted lipogenesis, and weakened mitochondrial function during inflammation. ZAG knockout also decreased beta 3-adrenoreceptor and protein kinase A. The present study demonstrated that ZAG alleviated lipid metabolism disorders by weakening inflammatory responses. The beta 3-adrenoreceptor/protein kinase A/CREB pathway mediated the effects of ZAG on inflammation. These results will provide new insight for research on anti-inflammation.

AB Although salivary gland cancers comprise only 3-6% of head and neck cancers, treatment options for patients with advanced-stage disease are limited. Because of their rarity, salivary gland malignancies are understudied compared to other exocrine tissue cancers. The comparative lack of progress in this cancer field is particularly evident when it comes to our incomplete understanding of the key molecular signals that are causal for the development and/or progression of salivary gland cancers. Using a novel conditional transgenic mouse (K5:RANKL), we demonstrate that Receptor Activator of NFkB Ligand (RANKL) targeted to cytokeratin 5-positive basal epithelial cells of the salivary gland causes aggressive tumorigenesis within a short period of RANKL exposure. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis reveals that RANKL markedly increases the expression levels of numerous gene families involved in cellular proliferation, migration, and intra- and extra-tumoral communication. Importantly, cross-species comparison of the K5:RANKL transcriptomic dataset with The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer signatures reveals the strongest molecular similarity with cancer subtypes of the human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These studies not only provide a much needed transcriptomic resource to mine for novel molecular targets for therapy and/or diagnosis but validates the K5:RANKL transgenic as a preclinical model to further investigate the in vivo oncogenic role of RANKL signaling in salivary gland tumorigenesis.

TI Chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) expression increases with NAFLD stage and

AB CCL20 (CC chemokine ligand 20) is emerging as an important regulatory molecule in a pathway common to virus infection, alcoholic hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leading to the development of hepatic fibrosis. We previously observed upregulation of CCL20 in patients with NAFLD fibrosis and human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2 cells) in response to lipid loading. To date, the mechanisms mediating the relationship between CCL20 and hepatic fibrogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which CCL20 may contribute to fibrogenesis in NAFLD. We observed that CCL20 levels increased with worsening severity of liver histology in NAFLD patients (normal < steatosis < inflammation < fibrosis) and during LX-2 cell activation in a time-dependent manner. We found that treatment of LX-2 cells with CCL20 corresponded with increased levels of CCL20 and ACTA2, and decreased levels of PLAU and SERPINE1, effects mitigated by CCL20 knockdown. We identified a putative binding site for miR-590-5p, which we previously reported to be downregulated in NAFLD fibrosis, in the CCL20 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), and found that exogenous miR-590-5p functionally interacted with the CCL20 3'UTR to downregulate its expression. Transfection of LX-2 hepatic stellate cells with miR-590-5p mimic or silencing RNA resulted in decreased or increased CCL20 levels, respectively. Our results indicate an association between CCL20 and hepatic stellate cell activation that includes modulation of key ECM components and functional interactions with a miRNA previously implicated in NAFLD fibrosis. Together, these findings support a novel mechanism by which CCL20 may promote fibrogenesis in NAFLD.

AB This study examined the acute effects of combined tobacco smoking and exercise on immune-inflammatory responses in smoker populations with shorter or longer smoking history. The cohort comprised 14 young male adult (YSM) and 12 middle-aged (MSM) male active cigarette smokers matched for aerobic fitness and smoking behavior. Following an initial familiarization and baseline testing session, participants completed a smoking and exercise protocol. This protocol involved the inhalation of two cigarettes (12 mg tar, 1 mg nicotine) within 15 min, and following a 10 min recovery period, 40 min of cycling at 50% peak aerobic workload. Venous blood was obtained pre- and post-protocol for analysis of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), IL-lbeta (beta) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and total leukocyte count. There was no baseline differences between age groups for IL-6 or MCP-1 (p > 0.05), although higher basal IL-lra was evident in YSM (p < 0.05). Further, no significant differences existed between groups for post-exercise IL-lra or IL-6 responses; though MSM demonstrated an elevated MCP-1 at 4 h post (p < 0.05). No between-group differences for total leukocyte count, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes or monocytes (p > 0.05) were observed; although higher concentrations of basophils immediately post and 4 h post-exercise, and higher eosinophils at 4 h post-exercise were evident in MSM (p < 0.05). The current study highlights that prolonged elevations in MCP-1, alongside leukocytosis, accompany inhalation of tobacco smoke prior to exercise.

AB The intractability of Graves' disease (GD) and the severity of Hashimoto's disease (HD) vary among patients. Both genetic and environmental factors may be associated with their prognoses. To clarify the role of methylation of the IFNG gene in the pathogenesis and prognosis of (AITDs), we examined interferon gamma (IFNG) methylation levels at various CpG sites and genotyped IFNG + 874 A/T and + 2109 C/T polymorphisms. We analyzed methylation 59 patients with HD, 57 patients with GD and 26 healthy volunteers by pyrosequencing. We genotyped IFNG gene polymorphisms from 207 patients with GD, 208 patients with HD, and 102 healthy controls. The methylation levels of IFNG 54 CpG were higher in patients with intractable GD than in those with GD in remission, but there was no difference between patients with severe and mild HD. In carriers of IFNG + 2109 T (CT + TT) (85.5% in controls), the 54 CpG methylation levels were significantly higher in patients with intractable GD than in those with GD in remission. On the other hand, in carriers of IFNG + 2109 CC, the 4293 CpG methylation levels were higher in intractable GD patients. The methylation levels of IFNG 54 CpG and 4293 CpG were negatively correlated with the age in HD, especially severe HD, patients and GD patients, respectively. There was no circadian variation but considerable daily variation in the methylation levels of IFNG 54 CpG. In conclusion, both the methylation levels of CpG sites and the functional polymorphisms in the IFNG gene were associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of AITD, especially with GD intractability.

AB Objective: New clinical indicators are urgently needed for predicting the progression and complications of hand foot -and-mouth disease (HFMD) caused by EV-A71 infections.
   Materials and methods: Serum specimens from 132 EV-A71 HFMD patients and 73 health children were collected during 2012-2014 in Shenzhen, China. The specific cytokines/chemokines were detected with a 274-human cytokine antibody array, followed by a 38-inflammation cytokine array, and further validated by ELISA.
   Results: Cytokines varied in different severity of EV-A71 HFMD patients. The ROC curve analysis revealed 5 serum cytokines with high sensitivity and specificity in predicting the disease progression. Eotaxin, IL-8 and IP10 have showed high AUC values (0.90-0.95) for discrimination between the health controls and the patient group. The three cytokines showed high sensitivity (80-91%) and specificity (88-95%). MMP-8 had a high sensitivity and specificity to predict mild HFMD (100%, 100%). IL-1b and leptin discriminated the severe/critical group from the mild group (79% and 69% in sensitivity, 73% and 63% in specificity).
   Conclusions: Eotaxin, IP-10 and IL-8 could be potential indicators for predicting HFMD progression with EV-A71 infection. MMP-8 is a specific indicator for mild infection, while IL-lb and leptin display potential for predicting the severity and criticality.

AB Dengue virus poses a considerable clinical problem, with the four closely related serotypes of dengue virus (DENY) infecting around 50-100 million people per year world-wide. The drastic increase in the dengue infection could be partly attributed to geographic expansion of the vector due to increasing urbanization, unavailability of specific antiviral therapies, licensed dengue vaccine, and poor understanding of the host immune responses. It has been reported that the immune-dominant envelope protein (E protein) domain III region (EDIII) of DENV is one of the most potent vaccine candidates because of its ability to trigger host immunity by inducing production of protective neutralizing antibodies. However, its role in the modulation of innate inflammatory responses hitherto remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that EDIII protein of DENV induces pro-inflammatory signature by inducing production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells through NF-kappa B pathway. Also, we observed increase in the maturation of IL-1 beta, which was found to be associated with increased ROS production and potassium efflux. Further, our findings reveal that the IL-1 beta production by EDIII protein is mediated through caspase-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion this study unearths the role of DENV EDIII protein in modulating innate inflammatory responses, which might provide possible mechanism of pathogenesis and open-up new avenues for the development of therapeutics against DENV.

AB Background: We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor roflumilast with CHF6001, a novel PDE4 inhibitor designed for inhaled administration, using human alveolar macrophages (AM) and lung tissue explants models.
   Methods: AM from 13 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and 10 smoking controls and lung tissue from 7 COPD patients were stimulated with LPS following preincubation with roflumilast (0.000001-10 mu M), CHF6001 (0.000001-0.1 mu M), or vehicle. After 24 h, supernatants were analysed for cytokines by ELISA. The effects of both compounds on the phosphorylation and cellular localisation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Extracted RNA was used for quantitative PCR analysis of PDE4 A, B and D mRNA.
   Results: PDE4 A, B and D expression were increased in alveolar macrophages and lung tissue of COPD patients compared to controls. Roflumilast and CHF6001 significantly reduced TNF-alpha production in AM and lung tissue. CHF6001 was more potent than roflumilast with lower EC(50)s of 0.02, 0.01 and 0.31 nM compared to 0.87, 0.47 and 10.8 nM in respective samples. PDE4 inhibition also inhibited secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL4 from macrophages. Both compounds increased nuclear levels of phosphorylated CREB.
   Conclusion: PDE4 inhibitors caused a robust anti-inflammatory effect on TNF-alpha production from COPD AM, with inhibition of selective chemokines also observed. CHF6001 caused more potent inhibition of TNF-alpha production from COPD AM and lung tissue compared to roflumilast.

AB Cystatins are natural inhibitors of cysteine peptidases. Recently, cystatins derived from plants, named phytocystatins, have been extensively studied. Among them, CsinCPI-2 proteins from Citrus sinensis were identified and recombinantly produced by our group. Thus, this study described the recombinant expression, purification, and inhibitory activity of this new phytocystatin against human cathepsins K and B and assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of CsinCPI-2 in vitro in mouse and in vivo in rats. In addition, the pro-osteogenic effect of CsinCPI-2 was investigated in vitro. The inflammatory response of mouse macrophage cells stimulated with P. gingivalis was modulated by CsinCPI-2. The in vitro results showed an inhibitory effect (p < 0.05) on cathepsin K, cathepsin B, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha gene expression. In addition, CsinCPI-2 significantly inhibited in vivo the activity of TNF-alpha (p < 0.05) in the blood of rats, previously stimulated by E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CsinCPI-2 had a pro-osteogenic effect in human dental pulp cells, demonstrated by the increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, deposition of mineralized nodules, and the gene expression of the osteogenic markers as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx-2), ALP, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein (BSP). These preliminary studies suggested that CsinCPI-2 has a potential anti-inflammatory, and at the same time, a pro-osteogenic effect. This may lead to new therapies for the control of diseases where inflammation plays a key role, such as periodontal disease and apical periodontitis.

AB Adherens junction protein p120 is thought to be crucial for maintaining vascular integrity, which is important in many pathologies and diseases including atherosclerosis, vascular malformations, hemorrhagic stroke, sepsis and others. However, the mechanisms responsible for this is not completely understood. In this study, using an unbiased proteomics approach, followed by other experimental techniques, we identified that in HUVECs p120 overexpression inhibits LPS/TNF alpha-induced angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) expression, a key switch of endothelial destabilization. Interestingly, p120 overexpression did not inhibit LPS/TNF alpha-induced expression of adhesion molecules/cytokines including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-6 in our experimental system. Furthermore, this p120-mediated repression of Ang2 is in an NF-kappa B independent manner, possibly via transcription factor Ets1. Our results demonstrate that p120 influences vascular integrity by secreted signals, providing new insights into the mechanisms of p120-mediated vascular stability.

AB The NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1 beta release and pyroptosis (cell lysis) have recently been proposed to be essential for the progression of urinary tract infection (UTI) and elimination of intracellular bacterial niches. However, the effects of IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA) on immune responses during UTI, except for its ability to disrupt IL-1 beta signalling, are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IL-1RA in UPEC colonization of bladder epithelial cells and the subsequent host inflammatory response. Human bladder epithelial cells (5637) and CRISPR/Cas9 generated NLRP3 and caspase-1 knockdown cells and IL-1RA knockout cells were stimulated with the UPEC isolate CFT073. The results showed that the UPEC virulence factor alpha-hemolysin is essential for IL-1RA release, and that the inflammasome-associated proteins caspase-1 and NLRP3 affect the release of IL-1RA. IL-1RA deficient cells showed a reduced adherence and invasion by CFT073 compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that IL-1RA may oppose mechanisms that protects against bacterial colonization. A targeted protein analysis of inflammation-related proteins showed that the basal expression of 23 proteins and the UPEC-induced expression of 10 proteins were significantly altered in IL-1RA deficient bladder epithelial cells compared to Cas9 control cells. This suggests that IL-1RA has a broad effect on the inflammatory response in bladder epithelial cells.

AB Background: No earlier study summarized findings on the effect of statins on inflammatory biomarkers in apparently healthy individuals or those with chronic diseases. This study was done to systematically review earlier publications on the effect of statins on serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in apparently healthy individuals or those with chronic diseases.
   Methods: We searched relevant publications published up to December 2018 in PubMed, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. For this purpose, suitable MESH and non-MESH keywords were used. Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that examined the effect of statins on serum concentrations of CRP and IL-6 in apparently healthy adults or those with chronic diseases were included.
   Results: Overall, 18 studies with 23 effect sizes, that enrolled 32,156 individuals (38% female and 62% male; mean age: 44.79 years) were included. When we combined 21 effect sizes from 16 studies, we observed a significant reduction in circulating levels of CRP following administration of statins [Weighted Mean Difference (WMD): 0.80; 95% CI: 1.05, 0.56]. Combining 12 effect sizes from 11 studies, a significant reduction was found in serum CRP concentrations following administration of Atorvastatin (WMD: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.35). Pooling 5 effect sizes from 2 studies, we found a significant reduction in serum concentrations of CRP following administration of Simvastatin (WMD: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.10; I-2 = 88.5%). Combining 6 effect sizes from 5 studies, we found a significant reduction in serum IL-6 concentrations after Atorvastatin therapy (WMD: 2.13; 95% CI: 3.96, 0.30; I-2 = 98.6%).
   Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that statins administration in apparently healthy people or those with chronic diseases help reducing serum CRP concentrations. In addition, Atorvastatin administration resulted in reduced serum IL-6 concentrations in these people.

AB Glutamate related excitotoxicity and excess of cerebral levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) are interrelated and well documented abnormalities noticed in many central nervous system diseases. Contribution of kidney type glutaminase (KGA) and shorter alternative splicing form (GAC) to glutamine degradation in astrocytes has been recently a matter of dispute and extensive study but the regulation of the GLS isoforms by inflammatory factors is still not well known. Here we show that treatment of cultured rat cortical astrocytes with pathophysiologically relevant (50 ng/ml) concentration of TNF alpha specifically increases the expression of KGA but not GAC and increases activity of GLS. No changes in the expression of either of two GLS isoforms were observed following treatment with other tested cytokines IL-113 and IL-6. The TNF alpha mediated KGA expression was associated with increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha on KGA expression was reduced by selective inhibition of (STAT3) but not by inhibition of STAT1 nor nuclear transcription factor kappa. Additionally, the role of miRNA in TNF alpha induced expression of KGA in astrocytes was excluded, since the expression of miR-23a/b and miR-200c, potential regulators of KGA expression, was unchanged. This study documents increased KGA expression in the astrocytes under inflammatory stimulation, identifying TNF alpha as a cytokine mediating this response, and demonstrates the specific and selective involvement of STAT3.

AB Background: Cancer is a high-impact disease throughout the world. A negative correlation has been established between the development of cancer and the Th2 immune response. Infection by helminth parasites is characterized by the induction of a strong and long-lasting Th2 response. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the immune response induced by the infection with the helminth Hymenolepis nana, on the tumorigenesis induced by dimethylbenz-anthracene (DMBA) in mice.
   Methodology: Four different groups of 14 female BALB/c mice were formed; Group A, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle) was administered cutaneously, Group B infected with H. nano, group C, cutaneously DMBA and finally Group D infected with H. nana and cutaneous DMBA. The tumor load was determined in those animals that developed cancerous lesions. In all groups were determined: serum concentration of IgE, IFN gamma, IL 10, IL-5 and malondialdehyde (MDA). The inflammatory infiltrate was analyzed from skin samples and the expression of the main eosinophilic protein and myeloperoxidase was determined.
   Results: The group previously infected with H. nana had a reduced amount of tumors with smaller size, in comparison to the group that received only DMBA; this reduction was associated with lower levels of IFNy and IL-10, while levels of IgE, IL-5 and MDA were higher. Further, the number of eosinophils and neutrophils was statistically higher in the animals that were previously infected with the helminth and developed less tumors.
   Conclusion: The immune response induced by H. nana infection is associated with the reduction of tumors probably due to the activity of eosinophils and neutrophils.

AB Reflux esophagitis is a result of esophageal exposure to acid and bile during episodes of gastroesophageal reflux. Aside from chemical injury to the esophageal epithelium, it has been shown that acid and bile induce cytokine-mediated injury by stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. During the repair and healing process following reflux injury, the squamous esophageal cells are replaced with a columnar epithelium causing Barrett's metaplasia, which predisposes patients to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We identified a novel player in gastroesophageal reflux injury, the TGFB family member Activin A (ActA), which is a known regulator of inflammation and tissue repair. In this study, we show that in response to bile salt and acidified media (pH 4) exposure, emulating the milieu to which the distal esophagus is exposed during gastroesophageal reflux, long-term treated, tolerant esophageal keratinocytes exhibit increased ActA secretion and a pro-inflammatory cytokine signature. Furthermore, we noted increased motility and expression of the stem cell markers SOX9, LGR5 and DCLK1 supporting the notion that repair mechanisms were activated in the bile salt/acid-tolerant keratinocytes. Additionally, these experiments demonstrated that de-differentiation as characterized by the induction of YAP1, FOX03 and KRT17 was altered by ActA/TGF beta signaling. Collectively, our results suggest a pivotal role for ActA in the inflammatory GERD environment by modulating esophageal tissue repair and de-differentiation.

AB Background: Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a disorder with an important inflammatory component, where vasoocelusion is major contributor to the disease pathophysiology. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important regulatory role in the process of inflammation. We investigated the expression TL1A/DR3/DcR3 cytokine signaling pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their corresponding plasma levels in SCA subjects who presented with acute painful episodes.
   Materials and methods: PBMC were isolated from the blood of SCA subjects and normal healthy controls. RNA isolated from PBMC was used for real time gene expression of TL1A/DR3/DcR3. Gene expression was compared in subgroups within SCA subjects with co-inherited fetal hemoglobin (HbF) or alpha-globin gene deletions. Plasma prepared from blood was used for determination of TL1A/DR3/DcR3 proteins by ELISA assays.
   Results: In the PBMC of SCA subjects, expression of TL1A and DcR3 is elevated, while DR3 expression is lowered in comparison to normal control PBMC. In SCA subjects with HbF > 10%, TL1A/DcR3 expression is lower, while HbF < 10% is associated with increased TL1A/DcR3 expression. Moreover, subjects with HbF > 10% appear to have significantly fewer pain episodes in comparison to those with HbF < 10%. Deletion of alpha-globin genes appears to have no significant effect on TL1A/DR3/DcR3 expression. Circulating levels of TL1A, DR3 and DcR3 in plasma were significantly elevated in SCA subjects.
   Conclusions: Elevated TL1A and DcR3 expression in PBMC of SCA subjects during painful vasoocclusive crisis, suggest an altered TL1A expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of vasoocclusive crisis in SCA. HbF > 10% appears to moderate TL1A elevation, while HbF < 10% exacerbates TL1A/DcR3 responses. Furthermore, subjects with HbF > 10% have significantly lower pain episodes reported as compared to subjects with HbF < 10%.

AB Background: In the search for the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), inflammatory markers have emerged as potential candidates. The present meta-analysis was performed on studies examining circulating concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines in people with ASD compared with control subjects without ASD.
   Methods: We identified potentially eligible studies by systematically searching electronic databases from inception to February 2018.
   Results: Twenty-five studies with a total of 1754 participants (1022 patients with ASD and 732 control subjects) were included in the mate-analysis; 4 for interferon (IFN)-alpha, 9 for interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), 9 for IL-4, 6 for IL-5, 3 for IL-9, 14 for IL-10, 7 for IL-13, and 6 for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. We found a moderate decrease in plasma levels of IL-10 (SMD = 0.59) and a small decrease in serum levels of IL-1Ra (SMD = 0.25) in patients with ASD. On the contrary, serum IL-5 levels were slightly increased (SMD = 0.26) in these patients. We conducted meta-regression analyses to investigate the possible effect of moderatos on the effect size (ES) of difference in mean levels of IL-10. Difference in the mean age between patients and controls showed a negative influence on the ES and was able to explain about 0.4 of total between-study variance. In contrast, latitude exerted a positive effect on the ES and explained a lower proportion (0.1) of total between study variance.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence for the lower concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL 10 and IL-1Ra in autistic patients compared with control subjects. Also, meta-regression analyses point to the interaction of latitude, age, and gender with peripheral alterations of associated anti-inflammatory cytokines.

AB Equine endometrosis (endometrial fibrosis) is a degenerative chronic process that occurs in the uterus of the mare and disturbs proper endometrial function. Fibrosis is attributed to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The turnover of ECM is mediated by matrix metallopeptidases (MMP). Previously, it was shown that cytokines modulate MMP expression in other tissues and may regulate fibrosis indirectly by attracting inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation and directly on various tissues. However, the regulation of MMP expression in equine endometrosis is still relatively unknown. Thus, our aim was to determine if interleukin (IL)-1f3 and IL-6 regulate ECM, MMPs, or their inhibitors (TIMPs) and whether this regulation differs during endometrosis in the mare. Endometrial fibrosis was divided into four categories according to severity: I (no degenerative changes), HA (mild degenerative changes), IIB (moderate degenerative changes) and III (severe degenerative changes) according to Kenney and Doig classification. Endometrial explants (n = 5 for category I, HA, IIB and III according to Kenney and Doig) were incubated with IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml) or IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Secretion and mRNA transcription of collagen type 1 (Collal) and type 3 (CoL3a1), fibronectin (Fnl), Mmp-1,-2, -3,-9,-13, Timp-1,-2 were analyzed by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. IL-1 beta treatment up-regulated secretion of COL1, MMP-2, TIMP1, and TIMP2 in category I endometrial fibrosis tissues (P < 0.05). IL-6 treatment up-regulated secretion of ECM, MMP-2, and MMP-3 and down-regulated secretion of MMP-9 in category I tissues (P < 0.05). In category IIA tissues, IL-1 beta and IL-6 treatment up-regulated secretion of COL3 (P < 0.05; P < 0.05), and IL-6 treatment also down-regulated secretion of MMP-9 (P < 0.05). In category IIB tissues, IL-1 beta treatment down-regulated secretion of COL3 (P < 0.05) and up-regulated secretion of MMP-3 (P < 0.01), while IL-6 treatment up-regulated secretion of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 (P < 0.05). In category III tissues, IL-1 beta treatment up-regulated secretion of COL1, MMP-1, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 (P < 0.05), and IL-6 up-regulated secretion of all investigated ECM components, MMPs and TIMPs. These results reveal that the effect of IL-1 beta and IL-6 on equine endometrium differs depending on the severity of endometrial fibrosis. Our findings indicate an association between inflammation and development of endometrosis through the effect of IL-1 beta and IL-6 on expression of ECM components, MMPs, and TIMPs in the mare.

AB Objective: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) is the specific receptor for BDNF. Our aim in this study was to investigate serum BDNF level and TrkB expression on peripheral blood T cell surface in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and explore potential relationship between serum BDNF and SLE.
   Methods: Samples from fifty SLE patients and thirty healthy controls were evaluated. Serum BDNF level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the percentages of TrkB expression on the surface of CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry. The SLE patients were divided into subgroups according to whether they exhibited brain, kidney or lung involvement, and whether the disease was active or inactive.
   Results: Serum BDNF levels in SLE patients were decreased when compared to the controls (p < 0.001). Comparing with the SLE individuals without systemic involvement, the BDNF levels were decreased in SLE patients with lupus nephritis (p = 0.042) and in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations (p = 0.04). On the other hand, the BDNF level was significantly increased in the inactive SLE group (p < 0.001) compared to the active SLE group. In addition, the percentages of TrkB expression on CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T cell surface in SLE were significantly higher (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively) than that in the controls.
   Conclusions: Serum BDNF level combined with TrkB expression on T cell surface can reflect SLE activity. It is possible that BDNF may be used as a potential serological biomarker for disease activity of SLE. In addition, the significant decrease in serum BDNF level may imply systemic involvement of SLE, as well as, possibly, differ. entiate neuropsychiatric SLE from hormone-induced mental disorders.

AB Measurement of cytokines in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a useful method to assess human immune responses in a large range of pulmonary diseases. One of the major pre-analytical challenges of cytokine analysis is the quality and stability of cytokines in the timeframe between sample collection and the separation of supernatant from cells.
   To evaluate if the method of storage may affect cytokine quantification, whole blood and BALF were collected, aliquoted, and left at room temperature (RT) to be processed at different time points. In addition, sera and BALF were left either at RT or at 4 degrees C for 24 h after cell separation to test cytokine variations in the absence of cells. Samples were analysed by a multiple array containing ten cytokines.
   Most of the cytokines analysed (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-23, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) did not show significant variations in whole blood and BALF. Levels of IL-8 however, increased after storage of whole blood and BALF for 24 h at RT. Ex vivo IL-8 production seems to correlate with higher numbers of macrophages in collected BALF.
   These data demonstrate that many cytokines are stable for a brief time after sample collection. For IL-8, freshly collected whole blood and BALF should be quickly processed and frozen to avoid false positive results.

AB Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis for which current standard chemotherapeutic treatments offer little survival benefit. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)s have garnered interest as therapeutic targets to augment or replace standard chemotherapeutic treatments because of their ability to promote cell growth, migration, and survival in various cancers. Met and Ron, which are homologous RTKs activated by the ligands hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), respectively, are over activated and display synergistic malignant effects in several cancers. Despite the homology between Met and Ron, studies that have directly compared the functional outcomes of these systems in any context are limited. To address this, we sought to determine if the HGF/Met and MSP/Ron systems produce overlapping or divergent contributions towards a malignant phenotype by performing a characterization of MSP and HGF driven signaling, behavioral, and transcriptomic responses in a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) cell line in vitro. The impact of dual Met and Ron expression signatures on the overall survival of PAAD patients was also assessed. We found HGF and MSP both encouraged PAAD cell migration, but only HGF increased proliferation. RNA sequencing revealed that the transcriptomic effects of MSP mimicked a narrow subset of the responses induced by HGF. Analysis of clinical data indicated that the strong prognostic value of Met expression in primary PAAD does not appear to be modulated by Ron expression. The relatively reduced magnitude of MSP-dependent effects on primary PAAD cells are consistent with the limited prognostic value of Ron expression in this cancer when compared to Met. Although HGF and MSP produced a differing breadth of responses in vitro, overlapping pro-cancer signaling, behavioral, and transcriptional effects still point to a potential role for the MSP/Ron system in pancreatic cancer.

AB Nod-like Receptor Protein3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages infected with Leishmania sp. enhances the secretion of IL-1 beta. Excess IL-1 beta production is linked to disease severity in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. mexicana. Blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cell cultures from skin biopsies of patients with CL caused by L. braziliensis inhibited the release of IL-1 beta. We hypothesized that common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL1B and in its receptor antagonist IL1RN genes may be predictive of CL caused by L. guyanensis. The SNPs-511T/C (rs16944) and + 3954C/T (rs1143634) of the 11.1 beta and ILIRN VNTR (rs2234663) were assessed in 881 patients with CL and 837 healthy controls by PCR-RFLP and direct PCR respectively. Plasma cytokines levels were also assayed. The plasma levels of were higher in patients compared to control subjects. In contrast, increased plasma levels of IL-1Ra were observed in controls. The rs16944 C/C genotype was more common among the patients (OR = 1.5 [95%CI 1.1-2.0]; P = 0.004) and the C allele suggests susceptibility to CL (OR = 1.2 [95WOCI 1.1-1.4]; P = 0.003). The rs16944 C/C genotype shows a tendency to correlate with lower levels of the IL-1Ra cytokine. Low levels of IL-1Ra cytokine and rs16944 C/C genotype seem to confer susceptibility to L. guyanensis-infection in the Amazonas.

AB Background: The identification of meaningful biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB) has potential to improve diagnosis, disease staging and prediction of treatment outcomes. It has been shown that active pulmonary TB (PTB) is associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in systemic immune profile, suggesting a chronic inflammatory imbalance. Here we characterized the profile of PTB and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) in a prospective cohort study.
   Methods: We measured a panel of 27 inflammatory cytokines, soluble receptors, and lipid mediators in peripheral blood from patients with PTB or EPTB from a prospective clinical study in China. Multidimensional analyses were performed to describe associations between plasma levels of biomarkers and different TB disease presentation profiles.
   Results: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection induced changes in both the expression and correlation profiles of plasma mediators of inflammation in patients with PTB compared to those with EPTB. Increases in mycobacterial loads in sputum smears were associated with rises in concentrations of several molecules involved in TB pathogenesis, such as IL-1 beta, IFN-alpha, IL-10 and PGF2 alpha. Moreover, PTB patients presenting with severe disease exhibited a distinct inflammatory profile hallmarked by heightened levels of TNF-alpha, IL-113, IL17, IL-18 and IL-27. Interestingly, while antitubercular treatment (ATT) resulted in early changes of plasma concentrations of markers in PTB, changes were delayed in EPTB patients. Exploratory analyses of the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) of the inflammatory mediators before and during ATT suggested the occurrence of infection and/or treatment-induced long lasting "inflammatory imprinting" of biomarker profiles in TB. At 24 weeks post ATT commencement, markers underlying the observed increases in MDP scores were IL-27 in PTB and IL-1 beta in EPTB patients.
   Conclusion: Our findings describe systemic and durable changes in the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators in both PTB and EPTB and emphasize the role of M. tuberculosis bacterial burden and site of disease in modulating patient immune biomarkers.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the type of chronic infectious disease which majorly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB). Emerging data suggest that interferon gamma (IFNG) and its receptor IFNGR1 may be involved in the risk of TB.
   Methods: A total of 636 TB patients and 608 healthy controls were selected. The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and TB was estimated by logistic analyses adjusting for age, gender and smoking status. SNPs genotyping was done by using the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR).
   Results: The IFNG rs1861494 allele C was related to an increased risk for TB (OR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.06-1.48; P = 0.009). Compared with TT genotype, CT (OR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.01-1.63; P = 0.040) and CC (OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.04-2.19; P = 0.031) were also risk factors for TB. In the subgroup analysis, the association was stronger among participants < 25 years (OR = 2.40, 95%CI: 1.70-3.38; P < 0.001) and male groups (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.03-1.66; P = 0.030). In addition, IFNG rs1861494 was associated with anti-TB treatment outcome (OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.52-0.94; P = 0.017). We also detected that IFNGR1 rs2234711 influenced the IFNG production.
   Conclusion: IFNG rs1861494 polymorphism was associated with TB, particularly in the younger and male subgroups.

AB Interleukin (IL)-22, a member of the IL-10 family, plays a role in antiviral immune responses to a number of viral infections. However, it is unclear whether IL-22 is involved in the mucosal immunity against herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT). In this study, we studied whether IL-22 could inhibit HSV-2 infection of human cervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7 cells). We showed that End1/E6E7 cells express the functional IL-22 receptor complex (IL-22R1 and IL-10R2). When treated with IL-22, End1/E6E7 cells expressed the higher levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs: ISG15, ISG56, OAS-1, OAS-2, and Mx2) than untreated cells. In addition, IL-22-treated cells produced higher levels of the tight junction proteins (Z0-1 and Occludin) than untreated cells. Mechanistically, IL-22 could activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by inducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. These observations indicate the potential of IL-22 as an anti-HSV-2 agent in the FRT mucosal innate immunity against HSV-2 infection.

AB Introduction: The role of CXC chemokine receptors (CXCRs) in gastric cancer (GC) has been an increasing focus. However, comprehensive prognostic values of CXCR members in GC are yet to be clearly defined.
   Methods: Multiple public available datasets, including Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, oncomine, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), SurvExpress platform and the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER), were used for mRNA expression and prognostic characterization. Nomogram method was used for clinical model prediction.
   Results: CXCR3, CXCR4 and CXCR5 displayed significantly up-regulated expression in tumor compared to normal. High mRNA expression of CXCR2 (HR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.62-0.95, p = 0.014), CXCR3 (HR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.61-0.90, p = 0.0024), CXCR4 (HR = 0.7, 95%CI: 0.58-0.86, p = 0.00048), CXCR5 (HR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.59-0.87, p = 0.00093) and CXCR6 (HR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.54-0.81, p = 4.9e 05) was significantly associated with favorable overall survival (OS). The prognostic values of CXCR members were also explored in subtypes, including HER2 status, Lauren classification, pathological stages. The low risk group of CXCR signature displayed a significantly favorable OS compared to the high risk group (HR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.21-4.69, p = 1.057e 09). Nomogram clinical models were established for both OS (C-index: 0.692; 95%Cl: 0.648-0.736) and recurrence free survival (C-index: 0.731; 95%0: 0.675-0.786). In addition, CXCR6 and CD8 + T cells featured the highest correlation (partial-cor = 0.781, p = 4.17e 77).
   Conclusion This study identified distinct expression and prognostic values of CXCR members in GC using public databases.

AB There is an urgent need for effective treatments to reduce the large and growing burden of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its consequences. Inflammation is believed to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of AKI. Macrophage autophagy is considered protective against inflammation. Previous study discovered that ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpene carboxylic acid found in many plants as apples, bilberries, cranberries and so on, promoted cancer cell autophagy. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of UA on ameliorating AKI and the role of macrophage autophagy in the context of inflammation. The data from in vivo experiments showed that pretreatment of mice with UA significantly suppressed xylene-induced ear oedema as well as protected against LPS-induced AKI. Related mechanisms were further studied through in vitro experiment. As expected, UA decreased inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta secretion in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, UA blocked LPS-induced TLR4/MyD88 pathway. More importantly, enhanced autophagy of macrophages by UA through increasing the expression of both LC3B and Beclin-1 led to alter macrophage function. What is more, similar to UA, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA obviously decreased inflammation factors releases hinting the vital role of autophagy in regulating inflammation. In all, above study suggested that UA is a potential anti-inflammatory natural compound for treating AKI by inducing autophagy.

AB Knowledge of the diversity of microbial communities and their relationship with biogeochemical cycles is a key factor in understanding and improving the performance of constructed wetland (CW) systems, allowing improvements in design and operation methods to reach the desired effluent quality. Assemblies of microbial groups in CWs are driven by several factors, including the environmental conditions of the mesocosm and substrate availability. This study combined physicochemical analyses, high-throughput DNA sequencing, and statistical methods to gain an insight into the influence of operational conditions on the bacteria and archaea communities in a modified constructed wetland system treating raw-light greywater. The EvaTAC system is composed of an upflow evapotranspiration and treatment tank (CEvaT) which has an inbuilt anaerobic chamber (AnC), followed by a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW). Samples were collected after five years of system operation in both units: sludge from the AnC, coarse gravel from the CEvaT, and fine gravel from the CW. The results showed that the system operated predominantly in anaerobic conditions, with redox potential (Eh) increasing from the inlet (-364.1 mV) to the outlet (-240.4 mV) zone. The Eh was the environmental condition that most influenced the microbial community diversity and richness, and, as well as Eh, increased along the light greywater (LGW) flow. Conversely, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased, thus suggesting a negative correlation among these factors. The clustering analyses of microbial community showed that, besides environmental conditions, the media filter and related depth could also be drivers of microbial community composition. The bottom layer of CEvaT was assigned to the Proteobacteria and Synergistetes phyla indicating the accomplishment of the first steps of anaerobic digestion. The next layer was characterised by the presence of Desulfovibrio, Syntrophobacter, and Methanobacterium, microorganisms responsible for the sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis processes. Finally, in the CW zone, the community composition was dominated by microorganisms involved in the methane oxidation, such as Methylosinus, Bradyrhizobium, and Candidatus Koribacter. This study explored the universe of bacteria and archaea communities, and is an initial step in elucidating microbial diversity conversions in CW systems treating greywater, which is important knowledge to steer the conversion pathway and establish the ideal environmental conditions for the development of desired microbial communities in these systems.

AB Revegetation is an effective strategy for enhancing soil quality, but the impact of revegetation on soil processes is currently not well understood, especially in subhumid desert lands across a chronosequence of recovery. Therefore, this study aims to assess the soil nutrients and enzyme activities under successive (from 2013 to 2016) revegetation by Avena sativa, Festuca sinensis and Elymus nutans in subhumid desert on the southeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (STN), total phosphorus (STP), ammonium nitrogen (SAN), nitrate nitrogen (SNN), available phosphorus (SAP), saccharase, alkaline phosphatase and urease activities were measured in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers during the growing season in 2016. The results indicated that the restoration by grasses promoted soil nutrients and enzyme activities, but there was a sharp decrease in soil nutrients and enzyme activities after one-year of recovery in the subhumid desert. Compared to the control, revegetation significantly decreased the SOC (36.5%), STN (40.8%), STP (31.5%), saccharase (44.7%), urease (38.5%) and alkaline phosphatase (18.0%) activities in the 0-10 cm soil layer (P < 0.05) after one-year restoration. Recovering by grasses was an efficient way to restore the subhumid desert. However, this process might consume large amounts of soil nutrients and limit soil enzyme activities at the beginning succession stage, which was different from dry or semiarid desert land. Choosing a suitable mixing ratio of artificial grasses and adding fertilizer to the soil at the beginning stage of revegetation are advised for restoring desert lands in alpine areas.

AB Mangroves are critical inter-tidal ecosystems with high productivity and ecological significance. Afforestation was regarded as one of the key projects worldwide in recovering mangrove ecosystem function. Laguncularia racemosa, a non-native mangroves species in China has been used in mangrove afforestation, while its invasiveness is widely concerned. Understanding how it tolerates shade and salinity stresses is crucial as these factors can affect its invasive potential. However, the effects of soil salinity and light on mangroves (especially on non-native species) are ambiguous. We examined the combined effects of salinity and light on the growth and physiological responses of L. racemosa and predicted an extensive range of dispersal habitats for L. racemosa in a typical estuary using Kriging model. The field surveys showed that the seedling density and seedling height were positively correlated with light availability but negatively correlated with salinity. Our greenhouse experiment also demonstrated that moderate shading (60-80% PAR) and low salinity treatments (0-10 psu) enhanced the survival and growth of seedlings, whereas high salinity limited their assimilation rates (A), independent of the light levels. Under high salinity (30 psu) and low light level (20%), L. racemosa seedlings employed a water-saving strategy (248.96 +/- 24.27 mu mol.mmol(-1) in instantaneous water use efficiency), which helped them to improve their adaptability to stressful environmental conditions and maintain their growth. Our findings indicate the combined effects of salinity and light on the growth strategies of L. racemosa as well as its environmental tolerance to high salinity which limits its growth and survival in coastal ecosystems. These results can provide a reference for the management of non-native mangrove species in China and worldwide.

AB The present study was conducted to examine how different organs of plants (leaf, stem and root) of Tamarix aphylla and Tamarix kotschyi could affect carbon sequestration in soil depths ranging from 0 to 15 cm and 15 to 30 cm. This study was carried out in the Ahoochar region, 25 km north of Shiraz, during 2015-2017. This study was carried out in two separate factorial experiment arranged in a randomized complete design. The first factor was the type of plant species in both experiments. The second factor was the plant organs in experiment I and different soil depths in experiment II. The results showed that there was a higher degree of carbon sequestration in depths that ranged from 0-15 cm, compared to soil at 15-30 cm depth. The results of correlation coefficients showed that the percentage of clay was the strongest parameter that contributed to carbon sequestration. Furthermore, Tamarix aphylla and T. kotschyi showed similar amounts of organic carbon stored in their tissues. Stems had higher amounts of stored organic carbon compared to the leaves. In general, it was observed that carbon sequestration reached its highest level (54.15 t/ha) in soil with T. kotschyi at 0-15 cm depth. The stem of both plants had a higher ability for carbon sequestration.

AB As fen peatlands have been heavily disturbed by resource extraction in northeastern Alberta, Canada, fen construction has been completed. In order to optimize biogeochemical function of future constructed fens, it is beneficial to understand methane (CH4) cycling of newly constructed fens, and how revegetation strategies influence CH4 dynamics. Here, we investigate the effects of two vascular species used for fen construction on CH4 dynamics. A factorial greenhouse experiment using peat columns and a laboratory incubation experiment were used to understand differences in CH4 production, emissions, pore water concentration, and oxidation between Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. and Juncus balticus Willd. The experiment also considered how water sourced from the constructed fen influenced CH4 dynamics compared to natural rich fen water. Higher pore water CH4 concentration and potential CH4 production were found at C. aquatilis columns, possibly associated with higher labile carbon throughout the column. In columns with J. balticus, evidence to support radial oxygen loss reducing CH4 concentration and production was found. Water sampled from peat columns with constructed fen water had higher Fe (all cation forms), Mn (all cation forms), SO42-, and NO3- compared to columns with rich fen water, which corresponded to lower CH4 emissions and pore water concentration. Results from this study could be used to inform revegetation designs of future constructed fens that consider greenhouse gas emissions, including CH4, as a reclamation goal.

The objectives of the study were: (1) to determine BC cover changes on a chronosequence and toposequence of tailings dumps and their correlation with vegetation structural and substrate attributes and (2) to determine vegetation community changes along a BC cover gradient. We hypothesized that: (1) BC cover significantly increased with tailings dump age and that it was positively correlated to vegetation cover, species richness, density, and (2) vegetation communities significantly varied along a BC cover gradient. Occurrence patterns of BCs and their relationship with vegetation attributes and substrate properties were assessed on six gold tailings of different ages (10, 17, 30, 82, 92 and 110 years). BC cover and vegetation attributes were studied in 1-m(2) quadrats. Texture, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (N), organic carbon (OC) and available metals (Zn, Ni and Mn) for surface tailings in patches with and without BCs were determined for each dump. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, ordination analysis and Spearman correlation analysis. Two-way analysis of variance shows that age and topographic position had significant effect on BC covers. BC cover significantly increased with age as hypothesized, to a peak at 92 years and declined thereafter. Cyanobacteria and algae significantly decreased with age, while lichens and mosses increased significantly. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed a positive correlation between BC and vegetation cover, species richness and density on the four youngest dumps (10-82 years) which was however negative on the two oldest dumps (92 and 110 years). Areas of different BC cover classes (high = 70-100%, medium = 30-69%, low = 6-29% and very low <= 5%) were associated with different vegetation communities, with high and medium classes forming a similar vegetation community. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on tailings physicochemical properties showed that BC plots on the three younger dumps separated from those on the three older dumps, mainly based on variation in silt and total nitrogen content. The results point to the existence of a succession stage dependent relationship between BCs and vegetation. This suggest existence of a potential mutual relationship between BCs and vegetation on mine tailings, thus BCs can be used as proxy indicators of vegetation development.

AB Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs), comprising a floating matrix or framework vegetated with emergent wetland plants whose roots extend into the water below, have potential for treatment of wastewaters. Low oxygen concentrations beneath FTWs and wash-out of microbial communities can limit decomposition of organic matter and nitrification of ammonium-N in domestic wastewaters. This study aimed to test the utility of two different configurations of FTWs supplemented with mechanically aerated Biofilm Attachment Surfaces (BAS) to provide post-primary treatment of domestic wastewater. Two pilot-scale FTW treatment trains were developed at a domestic wastewater treatment plant in Hamilton, New Zealand using ten 1 m(3) volume tanks, with 1 m(2) square floating mats planted with Carex virgata. These were: (1) a single-pass (direct flow-through) system comprising an aerated FTW tank with subsurface BAS followed by four non-aerated FTW tanks in series, where (endogenous carbon inputs from wetland plants, along with organic carbon from the wastewater would promote denitrification; and (2) a recirculating system incorporating a pre-anoxic phase settling tank with FTW and BAS, followed by an aerated FTW tank with BAS from which 4/5 of the outflow was recirculated back to the initial anoxic stage where the (endogenous) organic matter in the incoming wastewater would provide the primary source of carbon to promote denitrification. The remaining 1/5 flowed into three non-aerated FTWs in series. Performance of each treatment stage was monitored monthly for one year from February 2015 to January 2016 for organic matter (BOD5: Biochemical Oxygen Demand; TSS: Total Suspended Solids), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and E. coli removal. The single-pass system had almost complete removal of both TSS and cBOD(5) with >93%, maintaining the final effluent TSS and cBOD(5) concentrations at below 5 and 4 mg L-1 respectively. The single-pass system had a lower NH4-N reduction (4.9 g m(-2) d(-1)) compared with that in the recirculating system (6.9 g m(-2) d(-1)), but achieved higher denitrification (1.7 g m(-2) d(-1)) than that in the recirculating system (1.4 g m(-2) d(-1)) as more organic carbon from the inflow wastewater was available in the single-pass system for denitrification. The recirculating FTW system achieved slightly higher removal of Total-P (TP: 44.9%) and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP: 29.7%) than those in the single pass FTW system (TP: 36.7%; DRP: 24.3%), and both systems had a similar similar to 3-log E. coli reduction (from 10(6) to 10(3) MPN 100 ml(-1)) during the one-year experimental period. This one-year pilot-scale FTW study showed that FTWs supplemented with mechanically aerated BAS could be a practically option to retrofit existing waste stabilisation ponds to enhance organic matter, nitrogen and E. coli reduction. Furthermore, they may have some potential advantages over other types of intensified constructed wetlands, since they dont need costly graded gravel (or other solid media), provide ready access to aeration diffusers for maintenance purposes, have low susceptibility to clogging, and can be more readily de-sludged if required.

AB A rural landscape is the result of the interaction among natural elements and human activities which takes place in time and space. It represents a non-renewable resource that can provide incomparable information on the general state of the environment. The rapid transformations that are taking place in the last century push towards the implementation of monitoring actions able to take into account the various components of the land use, including their concurrent time evolution as well.
   We performed an analysis of temporal transformations of a rural landscape using an open-source GIS approach that allowed for mainstreaming of the main features of this rural landscape, i.e. land use patterns, naturalness dynamics, landscape diversity and visual quality. These four parameters have been selected since they represent those which most affect the processes at the base of the environmental planning and management of a rural landscape. The survey has been carried out over a period of 138?years, using historical maps, interpretation of aerial photos and implementing digital cartography, that have been retrieved with reference to a study area located in the Basilicata Region (southern Italy), which is considered a territory with an high rural - i.e., both natural and agricultural - landscape value.
   This methodology has allowed for the examination of the landscape from different points of view, experimenting the performance of a multi-temporal and inter-disciplinary analysis. The main results show - since the landscape has been completely transformed by man in terms of land use - that the areas covered in the past by forest have been transformed into agricultural areas, as opposed to some areas where re-naturalisation processes have taken place. Starting from this first analysis, the implemented methodology, based on a multidisciplinary approach, has enabled to identify the transformations which have greatly influenced the time evolution of the study area. The resulted assessment of land use patterns, landscape diversity, naturalness dynamics and visual quality of this study area, thus enables suitable strategies for the restoration of the local rural ecosystems.

AB In Albertas Western Boreal Plain, oil sands mining strips overburden materials including vegetation and soils, leaving unnatural, undulating landforms where wetlands previously covered > 50% of the landscape. Due to their complexity, the re-establishment of peatland ecosystems had not been tested prior to two fen reclamation projects on oil sands leases north of Fort McMurray. One of which, the Nikanotee Fen, was constructed using peat stripped as part of the mining process and placed in an engineered watershed designed to provide the requisite groundwater supply to support fen hydrological functions and vegetation. The unknown effects of disturbed, placed peat and vegetation treatments on the constructed fens soil water dynamics were studied from 2013 to 2015, the first three growing seasons post-construction. Water table, soil moisture (theta), pore water pressure (Psi), evapotranspiration (ET) and surface elevation were monitored in thirty-one study plots designed to test revegetation strategies, including control (bare peat), moss, seedling, mulched moss and mulched seedling treatments. Fifty-four peat samples were tested for a suite of hydrophysical parameters, including saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention. Plot water table positions fluctuated 36 cm below ground surface (bgs) despite a relatively small range in surface elevation between plots (similar to 24 cm), where plots located at higher elevations had consistently lower and more variable water tables. Although average plot water tables all ranged within 5-7 cm bgs, theta, Psi and ET differed significantly between certain plot types (p < 0.05). The observed hydrology is partially affected by the heterogeneous peat properties across the fen, created by the salvage and placement methods of the peat, which significantly differed with location (p < 0.05). The variability in the hydrophysical properties and surface elevations, thus water table position, appear to mask the effects of vegetation and treatment type on plot hydrology, at least at this early stage of development. While significant increases in plot Psi and theta were observed from 2013 to 2015, further studies are required to track the effects of greater vegetation establishment and peat formation and elucidate the effects of different vegetation treatments.

AB Standard extensive green roofs (EGRs) with their shallow substrate layers represent extreme sites for plant growth and therefore are planted mostly with drought-resistant species, including non-native plant species. As standard EGR substrates often lack potentially mutualistic soil microorganisms, it has been stated that inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) might increase plant performance and drought resistance. Aiming to support native biodiversity on EGRs, we tested whether AMF inoculation into standard green roof substrate can enhance plant performance and drought resistance of regionally occurring native dry grassland species.
   The results of a pot experiment with 11 native plant species growing with and without AMF inoculation showed considerable differences in fitness-relevant plant traits. Over 88 days of moderate drought conditions, inoculated plants produced 2.5 times more above-ground biomass than control plants. In addition, the number of inflorescences on inoculated plants was significantly higher in 5 out of 7 flowering species. Under severe drought stress created by stopping the water supply, however, inoculated plants wilted on average 2.38 days earlier than control plants.
   Although the underlying mechanisms of the observed results remain unresolved, AMF inoculation might help to enhance an earlier and higher seed set, facilitating the establishment of a soil seed bank, which is necessary for a self-sustaining plant population in drought-governed habitats such as EGRs.

AB Constructed free water surface wetlands (CWs) are used to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to receiving waters in highly impacted catchments by e.g., agricultural land use. In this paper, we evaluated the retention effectiveness of a Swedish CW in two consecutive hydrological years, 3-4 years after construction respectively. We compared nutrient loads based on concentrations from flow-proportional sampling (C-fp) and turbidity and nitrate concentrations measured with optical sensors (C-s). CW's retention was estimated based on differences between inlet and outlet concentrations and flow (Q) at both the inlet and outlet (2Q), or only at the inlet (1Q). In the first year (2012/2013), with a cold winter (mean topsoil temperature -0.2 degrees C), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3N) retention was 32% (C-fp and C-s, 2Q). In the second year, with a mild winter (mean topsoil temp 1.8 degrees C) and less water runoff, the corresponding values were 37% (C-fp, 2Q) and 39% (C-s, 2Q). Nitrate-nitrogen retention was significantly correlated to water residence time and temperature, and was most effective relative to the load (80%) in summer and least effective (40%) in winter. Quantitatively, however, summer NO3N retention contributed only 7% (2Q) or 8% (1Q) of yearly NO3N mass retention. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations were significantly correlated with suspended solids (SS) concentrations at both inlet and outlet. Seasonal PP retention (C-fp, 2Q) was related to particle residence time estimated from turbidity measurements by sensors, and was less effective in the cold winter (3%) than in the mild winter (32%) (C-fp, 2Q). Yearly retention (2Q) as a mean of the two years was: SS 40%, total P 36%, PP 34%, dissolved reactive P 30%, total N 56%, NO3N 35%, organic N 75%, and organic C 30%. Overall, the wetland satisfactorily removed nutrients from agricultural drainage water. However, longer-term studies over a range of flow and temperature conditions are needed to evaluate climate conditions and hydrological residence time as key factors in nutrient removal efficiency.

AB Loss of natural tidal marshes has caused rapid population declines for many bird species, raising the question about whether managed marshes can be used for bird conservation. Although many studies have indicated that managed marshes can provide a complementary habitat for birds, it is unclear how the breeding habitats provided by managed marshes compare with those provided by natural marshes. We compared habitat conditions (vegetation and food) and breeding performance of a common reed specialist, the Oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis), in natural and managed artificial reed marshes (about 2 km x 5 km) at Chongming Dongtan, an estuarine wetland in China. We found that vegetation was denser and warbler food resources were greater in managed than in natural marshes. The density of breeding territories, nest density, clutch size, egg size, and fledgling number per nest were greater in managed than in natural marshes. Breeding failure was reduced in managed marshes because of a reduced risk of nest predation. However, the high nest position on the reeds in the managed marshes increased the risk of nest destruction by strong wind. The better breeding performance in managed than in natural marshes could be attributed to the following factors: the high and stable water level in the managed marshes increased reed growth and arthropod reproduction and decreased access by terrestrial predators; dense vegetation helped conceal nests from predators; and human activities in the managed marshes deterred nest predators. The results suggest that managed marshes can provide quality breeding habitat for the Oriental reed warbler and probably for other marsh birds and can therefore help compensate for the loss of natural marshes. The preference of the Oriental reed warbler for managed marshes largely depends on the suitable habitat conditions. The current study highlights the importance of maintaining a relatively high and stable water level.

AB Regulation measures like the installation of weirs led to distinct shifts in riparian plant communities and to a decline of typical riparian plant species occurring along the river shoreline, which is naturally poor in woody plants. These regulation measures include also run-of-river impoundments or weirs that cause distinct differences in hydrodynamic conditions in their direct proximity upstream and downstream. In the course of the year, the downstream reaches are exposed to significantly higher water level fluctuations than upstream. Thus, these reaches are assumed to provide also suitable habitat for riparian plant species of habitats being exposed to frequent disturbance by alternating water levels.
   We investigated the riparian vegetation in direct proximity upstream and downstream of nine weirs along the two regulated rivers Lahn and Fulda. Sampling was conducted in the transition zone from water to land directly above the actual water level during the summers 2016 and 2017. Differences in species composition were analyzed by means of NMS and indicator species analysis. Results of the indicator species analysis were used for further analyses regarding species functional traits and species habitat origin.
   A grouping of the releves in accordance to the weir reach, dissimilarities in site conditions, significant indicator species for each weir reach and common indicator species upstream along both rivers point towards differences in species composition upstream and downstream. Due to rather constant water levels, upstream species composition consisted mainly of perennial species from reeds of still waters, swamp and alluvial forests and terrestrial habitats that were mainly competitors. By contrast, species from reeds of flowing waters, flooded meadows and grasslands and typical riparian plant communities (Bidention tripartitae, Chenopodion rubri) occurred more frequently downstream. Species downstream exhibited also less competitive power and short life cycles as a result of higher water level fluctuations.
   Upstream and downstream species composition clearly reflect the observed hydrodynamic conditions, restricting continuity to the area within two weirs. This distinctly differs from natural conditions, which leads to the establishment of novel riparian plant communities. As downstream reaches in direct proximity to weirs are related to higher water level fluctuations in the course of the year, these areas are of essential meaning as refuge for typical riparian species. Against this background, we recommend to decrease bank steepness downstream to increase the effect of water level fluctuations, which would lead to the establishment of suitable habitats for typical riparian plant species.

AB The deployment of artificial reefs to enhance the abundance of reef-associated species in the coastal waters of China occurs on a very large scale. However, the ability of these artificial structures to mimic natural habitats for fauna has not been evaluated. This study examined the benthic fish and macroinvertebrates assemblages (sampled using trap nets) of artificial reef complexes deployed in shallow, nearshore (9-11 m) and deeper, offshore waters (20-30 m) in the Lidao artificial reef zone (Yellow Sea, China) to determine whether they differed from assemblages on adjacent habitats: i.e. natural reefs in nearshore and bare substratum in offshore waters. It also investigated the extent of any temporal variation in these assemblages. A greater total number of taxa were identified in offshore than nearshore waters, but nearshore waters supported higher total mean numbers and biomass. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of the benthic fish and macroinvertebrate fauna between artificial reefs and their corresponding natural habitats in both depths. Faunal composition in both depths showed strong patterns of temporal variation, mainly due to changes in the abundance of some transient fish species such as Conger myriaster and Pseudopleuronectes herzenstein, which matched seasonal patterns in water temperature and clarity. The similarity of community structure between nearshore artificial reefs and natural habitats implies that the artificial reefs are mimicking natural habitats, which facilitates functional connectivity. Thus, in the Lidao artificial reef zone, artificial reefs and natural habitats can be considered as integrated habitat management units. In the offshore waters, however, the lack of a difference in composition between habitats possibly reflects the observed sinking of the artificial reefs. This highlights the importance of detailed site assessments before the deployment of artificial reefs, particularly in silty sediments.

AB Chinese urban lakeside with dense water networks are experiencing the increasingly intensified social-economic activities and serious surface water pollution. The estimation of water environmental capacity and pollution load reduction are crucial supports for restoring lakeshore aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a feasible environmental model and some model parameter identification methods were used to calculate the water environmental capacity and pollution load reduction for a typical urban lakeside, namely, Lake Taihu. The results indicated that the regional annual environmental capacities for TN, TP, CODMn, BOD5, and NH3-N were 99.25, 7.77, 37.36, 144.63, and 95.85 t under reduced 20% objective, respectively and -37.31, 9.28, 185.81, 27.14, and 148.80 t under Class III objective, correspondingly. The TN, TP, CODMn, BOD5, and NH3-N pollution loads are required to be reduced by 60%, 56%, 77%, 62%, and 51% for satisfying the reduced 20% water quality objective, respectively, and 115%, 47%, -16%, 93%, and 24% for achieving Class III objective, respectively. Among the rivers, the Liangxi, Maligang, and Lucun Rivers had large environmental capacities and pollution load reductions under both objectives, constituting more than half of the total regional values. The TN, TP, BOD5, and CODMn environmental capacity and pollution load reduction were significantly higher during the rainy period than during the other periods.

AB Excessive proliferation of filamentous green algae (FGA) is a problem that commonly occurs following the remediation of submerged macrophytes during lake restoration. Cultivation of submerged macrophytes changes the physical and chemical environment and micro-habitats for survival and growth of FGA. However, effects of submerged macrophytes on FGA and the mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, artificial grass (controls) and two submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton maackianus and Vallisneria natans) with different leaf complexity were cultivated at densities of 3, 6, and 9 in aquaria for a month. The proliferation of FGA, photosynthetic performance of macrophytes, and possible roles of bacteria in the interaction of macrophytes and FGA were studied. Compared with controls, planting of P. maackianus promoted the proliferation of epiphytic FGA, and the effects were density-dependent. Also, density-dependent decrease of photosynthetic performance of P. maackianus were observed. However, in the groups of V. natans, proliferation of epiphytic FGA showed density-dependent inhibition, but photosynthesis of V. natans showed density-dependent promotion. Furthermore, photosynthesis of macrophytes was negatively correlated with growth of epiphytic FGA (Chl a contents). Abundances of epiphytic bacteria taxa such as members of orders Rhodobacterales, Nitrosomonadales and Gemmatimonadales on P. maackianus were greater than those on V. natans. The abundances of these bacteria were positively related to Chl a contents of epiphytic algae (FGA). Thus, proliferation of FGA might be partly attributed to accumulation of certain bacteria taxa on the submerged macrophytes planted during lake restoration. To avoid excess proliferation of FGA, careful selection of submerged aquatic macrophytes is needed.

AB CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 anharmonic vibrational frequencies match experiment or higher-level theory to within an average of 10.3 cm(-1) for a sample set of 11 molecules. This is further reduced below 7.0 cm(-1) when extreme differences are removed from the data set. CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 and CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 frequencies differ on average by 4.8 cm(-1). The CCSD(T)-F12b frequencies require orders of magnitude less computer time than higher-order theory and cc-pVDZ-F12 less than cc-pVTZ-F12, especially as the number of atoms increases. Hence, utilization of these levels of theory may provide accurate vibrational frequencies for larger molecules provided that the core-electron correlation is not significant.

AB In this study we have explored by means of polarizable molecular dynamics simulations and small-angle X-ray diffraction, a subset of liquids belonging to the following three different classes of compounds: pentyl ammonium nitrate, 1-pentanol and 1-pentanoic acid. The presence of a low-Q peak in the X-ray spectra of the liquids provides evidence that a long alkyl chain is connected to the polar moiety and it is sufficient to establish nanodomain segregation in the liquid. From the calculations, we have obtained the theoretical scattering patterns that reproduce very nicely the experimental spectra in the low-Q ranges. From detailed analyses of the radial distribution functions, we infer that the medium-range ordering in these liquids stems from the joined effects of both strong and weak interactions.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been attracting considerable interests for the potential applications in nano-optoelectronic devices. Here, we study the electronic and optical properties of the ZrS2/HfSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayer, which presents an intrinsic type-II band alignment. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are separately dominated by the ZrS2 and HfSe2 layers, respectively. More importantly, the superior optical absorption of the heterostructure can be reached to the 10(6) amounts in ultraviolet region. Our results suggest that the 2D ZrS2/HfSe2 vdW heterobilayer would be likely utilized in the optoelectronic devices.

AB Miniaturization is an important direction of the development of science and technology. With the rapid development of micro electro mechanical system, microfluidic system based on microfabrication system has begun to exist in large numbers in laboratories. Micromixer is the focus of microfluidic system, widely used in biomedicine, materials science, aerospace and other fields of science. Passive micromixer is different from ordinary active micromixer, it does not require the input of external energy, but the design of a three-dimensional junction to control the mixing process. In this paper, we design a structure base on topology optimization method. This structure allows the two solutions to reverse flow and enhance the chaotic convection. This paper takes the circular structure as the original structure, and a series of topological micromixers with circular (TMCx) structures are analyzed by numerical simulation. These structures are TMC, TMC0.25, TMC0.5, TMC0.75, Circular micromixer. We analyze their mixing efficiency and pressure drop under different Reynolds number. By comprehensive comparison, it is concluded that TMC0.75 is the optimal structure. In addition, it is proved that the Circular micromixer in this paper has better performance than the Square wave micromixer in the previous paper.

AB We present a novel study of a PbCrO4 Liesegang pattern exhibiting revert spacing. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements are carried out, and are shown to support the adsorption of CrO42- on the precipitate, which becomes more enhanced as we move farther from the gel interface. Such an ascending differential adsorption scenario favors revert spacing over the direct spacing trend.

AB Polymers are widely mixed in colloidal dispersions to make better materials. It is important to understand the effects of the addition of polymers. In the present work, we studied micro structure of the coated surface of the mixture by using a purely theoretical method (an integral equation theory). To corroborate the theoretical results, our original analysis method for colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy was also applied. It was found that the addition of non-adsorbing polymers enhances the stratification of the colloidal particles near the substrate. Meanwhile, the polymers themselves are not stratified unlike the colloidal particles.

The Field emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observed that the nanorods assembled together to form the flower like in undoped ZnO and after Fe doping it turns into nanoellipsoid like morphology. NO2 gas response analysis revealed that Fe-doped ZnO nanoellipsoids displayed a higher selectivity compared to undoped ZnO. Among the different doping concentration 8 wt% exhibited the highest response of 209.8 when exposed to 100 ppm concentration of NO2.

The calculated values of adsorption free energy of H* (Delta G(H*)) reveal that (0 1 1) surface has high HER catalytic activity. In addition, the formation of monovacancy defect with Fe or P at (0 1 1) surface keeps good HER catalytic activity. We hope this letter can shed new light on further understanding HER in relation to FeP system and give guidance for design of transition metal phosphides.

AB Molecular adsorption on carbon nanotube (CNT) films follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm even for polar molecules at low gas pressures. Therefore, this film can be applied to gas sensors. In order to clarify the effect of thickness on sensor response, we fabricated CNT films of different thicknesses and observed their behavior. Because the adsorption is expected to occur near the surface, we determined the effective penetration thickness for the gas molecules and identified an approximate thickness of 7 mu m.

AB Effects of both rare earth elements and polarization electric field were combined to obtain a series of new photocatalysts, Bi2ZnOB2O6: xY(3+). Tests results showed that the Y3+ had doped into the BZBO lattice and reduced the band gap. The optimum photodegradation activity of Bi2ZnOB2O6: xY(3+) was 1.57 times as higher as the pure Bi2ZnOB2O6 in Rhodamine B photodegradation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Bi2ZnOB2O6: xY(3+) was mainly ascribed to the dopants and polarization electric field in promoting the photoabsorption ability and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.

AB CuPc organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated based on bilayer gate insulator consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and methyl methacrylate co glycidyl methacrylate (P(MMA-GMA)). The complementary property of two polymer materials overcomes the drawbacks of each other, and then improves the dielectric properties of the composite insulator: a higher equivalent permittivity(k similar to 6.0), hydrophobicity, ultra-smooth (1.47 angstrom) and good compatibility with CuPc. The crystal quality of CuPc film have been improved effectively. As a result, a carrier mobility of 6.55 x 10(-2 )cm(2)/Vs and a threshold voltage of - 3 V have been obtained. The I-ds has increased double with the same insulator thickness.

AB Inhibiting the A beta aggregation and understanding the kinetic process of A beta fibrillation are very important for exploring possible tactics to treat AD. Here size-effect of Au NRs are reported to modulate the process of A beta fibrillation. The results indicate that CTAB-stabilized Au NRs could efficiently suppress A beta fibrillation and the inhibition efficiency of larger Au NRs is better. We calculated the relationship between A beta aggregation rates and the sizes of Au NRs and found that the rate constant k was a quadratic function of diameters or lengths. This work provides a new strategy for exploring size-effect of nanoparticles on A beta fibrillation.

AB The effect of surface intrinsic defects on the structural stability and electronic properties of the all-inorganic halide perovskite CsPbI3(0 0 1) film have been investigated systematically using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The calculated results indicate that the surface with CsI termination is more stable than that with PbI2 termination under all considered equilibrium growth conditions. The formation of vacancy depends on the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The anion vacancy is the dominate defect under Pb-rich condition and the cation vacancy prefers to form under I-rich condition. The cation vacancies show the p-type semiconductor characteristic. The anion vacancies all are present the n-type semiconductor characteristic. The results may provide the theory basis and guidance for improvement of stable all-inorganic halide perovskite.

AB The Kernel Energy Method (KEM) has been widely applied to predict the properties of large molecules from kernels fragments in a fast and reliable manner. Kernels are typically made of many atoms raising the question: Is the accuracy of KEM traceable to the atomic level? An exact atomic decomposition of the molecular energy within the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), termed "Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA)", performed on a triglycyl model demonstrates that this is not the case. The kernel energies are found to be up to an order of magnitude more accurate than the underlying IQA atomic energies. The accuracy of KEM energies is, thus, the result of a subtle cancellation of errors among the different atoms composing the kernels.

AB Using the density functional theory, we investigate the effect of partially hydrogenation and fluorination on the mechanical and electronic properties of the graphene nanoribbon under strains. The results demonstrate that stress and Young's modulus of partially substituted hybrid systems by FGNR's are smaller than those by GANR's and FGANR's. However, substitutions by FGNR's increase the band gap of AGNRs more than ones by others, regardless of nanoroads and strains. Interestingly, for the hybrid system with 5-nanoroad of FGANR's, two highest valence bands near Fermi level are almost in consistence, and the band widths get narrow according to increase of strain.

AB Green fluorescence from perylene liquid in the molten state was observed, which differed substantially from the orange fluorescence from the sandwich excimer generally observed in concentrated solutions and in stable alpha-phase crystals. The peak position of the green fluorescence was similar to those in unstable beta-phase crystals and in densely doped polymer films. Results from analysis of spectral components indicate that the green fluorescence is emitted from an excimer with non-parallel geometry, populated by thermal activation of the excimer with sandwich geometry.

ID EXCHANGE-ENERGY; ELECTRON-DENSITY
AB This letter investigates the accuracy of the semi-local machine-learned kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) for potential energy curves (PECs) in typical small molecules. The present functional is based on a previously developed functional adopting electron densities and their gradients up to the third order as descriptors (Seino et al., 2018). It further introduces new descriptors, namely, the distances between grid points and centers of nuclei, to describe the non-local nature of the KEDF. The numerical results show a reasonable performance of the present model in reproducing the PECs of small molecules with single, double, and triple bonds.

We validate our methods with a hydrogen cluster containing a deuterium molecule (H-2)(19)D-2.

AB In this work, we design four multi-copper-mediated ring-expanded base pairs, which possess improved electromagnetic properties due to the introduction of cyclopentadienyl radicals and copper ions. These designed base pairs have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps and lower ionization potentials than those of the corresponding natural base pairs. Trans-rG(3Cu)rC and rA(2Cu)rT possess open-shell singlet ground states. They exhibit variable degrees of magnetic exchange interaction. In addition, their transverse electronic communication by the charge-transfer transitions in the UV absorption spectra is enhanced significantly.

AB We investigate a novel 2D carbon allotrope (net-Y) as anode material candidate for Na-ion battery based on density function theory (DFT) calculation. Na-decorated net-Y exhibits good metallic properties with moderate average open circuit voltage of 0.44 V and diffusion barrier of 0.35 eV. Moreover, the calculated maximum Na storage capacity can get to 1787 mAh/g. Furthermore, the first principles molecular dynamics (MD) were performed to demonstrate the thermostability of the Na-ion battery in the near room temperature. Net-Y can be a potential anode material in Na ion battery field with large capacity, low diffusion energy barrier and good thermostability.

AB We have studied with the sphere-in-contact model the structure of rhombohedral graphite and found that there are molecular channels 22.7 degrees with respect to the material symmetry axis. We show via theoretical simulations with the Laue equation, Kramers equation and Duane-Hunt law that X-ray radiation (lambda < 1.34 angstrom) that is traveling along these molecular channels would have a larger mean-free-path. This suggests that stacks of rhombohedral graphite can become effective filters for X-ray sources, such as the ones used in Laue photography and other X-ray techniques that use Bremsstrahlung.

AB Due to the absence of tryptophan synthase (TrpS) in human, this enzyme has become a popular drug target for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and trachoma. In this work, the channeling of indole between the two subunits of TrpS was examined using steered molecular dynamics simulation. Through the simulations conducted, interactions between indole and residues lining the channel were scrutinized to provide insights that may be informative for the development of drugs that could potentially inhibit the enzyme.

AB The substitution effect on the optical emission properties of an airplane-like pyrene-based fluorophore is systematically investigated based on first-principles calculations. It is found that functional modification at the para position to the donor fragment allows for modulation of both the emission color and quantum efficiency. As the electron negativity of the substituent is increased, the luminescence becomes blue-shifted and brighter. The correlation between the Hammett substituent constant and emission properties has been well established, which provides a predictive strategy for the rational design of efficient and full-color pyrene-based fluorescent emitters.

AB The Cu2O/ZnO heterojunction with novel hollow microspheres was prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The morphology was significantly changed from octahedron to hollow microsphere after adding zinc acetate. The microsphere Cu2O/ZnO materials exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen yields (129.6 mu mol/g), almost 10.3 times higher than pure Cu2O. The separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were effectively promoted due to the formation of p-n heterojunction between ZnO and Cu2O. In addition, the hollow structure and shell permeability of Cu2O/ZnO microsphere could also improve the utilization of visible light.

AB This work studied a hydrogen storage material which could absorbed hydrogen under room temperature and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure. This material was obtained by hydrolysis of NaBH4 (HPSB) and the hydrogen absorption and desorption performance was tested by PCT apparatus. The results showed that mixed-catalysts affected significantly the hydrogen storage capacity of the HBSP. When ratio of the catalysts Pr6O11 and CoCl2 was 7:3, the maximum hydrogen released amount of the HPSB(Pr6O11) hydrogen storage system reached 1.35 wt%.
   In order to improve the hydrogen absorption and desorption performance, TiO2 as catalyst were added to the HPSB(Pr6O11) hydrogen storage system. The results show when the catalysts Pr6O11 to CoCl2 doped ratio was 7:3 and the amount of TiO2 accounts for 9 wt% of the hydrogen storage system, the maximum hydrogen released of the HPSB(Pr6O11)-TiO2 hydrogen storage system reached 1.78 wt%. TiO2 obviously improve the hydrogen storage performance of HPSB hydrogen storage system.

AB Understanding the habitat preferences of a fish species is crucial for protecting fish resources because it can guide development of appropriate conservation measures. Field surveys suggest that water flow velocity and substrate are the main influences on fish microhabitat selection. Controlled experiments are better suited to assessing fish microhabitat preferences than field surveys but experimental data are not yet sufficient for cyprinids. We conducted experiments with Schizothorax wangchiachii in an experimental system comprised of four parallel channels, with a different substrate type in each channel. Fish preference for each substrate was tested at four levels of water flow. Results show that flow velocity influences channel preference more than substrate type. Test fish entered channels more frequently as flow velocity increased from 0.01 m/s to 0.37 m/s. Surface stability and interstitial space were the major factors influencing preference for substrate type. The horizontal velocity gradient perpendicular to flow direction, resulting in shear stress, was hypothesized to be a third explanatory variable for channel preference, but it did not significantly influence channel preference. Test fish spent most of the day in a shaded (shelter) area and were far less active during the day than at night. This study provides information on S. wangchiachii preferences for water flow and substrate, circadian rhythm and daylight sheltering, information that will help guide efforts to conserve wild populations of S. wangchiachii.

AB Roughing Filters are natural systems widely used as an efficient, cost-effective and simple treatment method, especially in low income regions. In this study, an experimental Horizontal Roughing Filter (HRF) with two design modifications, i.e., varying (3 and 4) number of compartments and gravel media sizes, was operated and monitored for 2 years under three filtration rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 m/h) as polishing stage of a Waste Stabilization Ponds facility. The proposed modification of the WHO-approved HRF with 3 instead of 4 compartments and with modified gravel sizes showed an improved performance in terms of turbidity, TSS, BOD5, COD and chlorophyll-a reduction, complying with the local standards for irrigation reuse, while lower filtration rates were found to further enhance the efficiency. The experimental results were successfully modelled with the Subwet software, which proved to be a reliable tool for performance verification and HRF design. This study demonstrated that the combined system of Waste Stabilization Ponds and Roughing Filters can be an attractive and effective treatment scheme based only on ecological processes, providing a high treated effluent quality with limited costs and simple operation and maintenance.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the potential of phytoremediation of Vetiveria zizanioides and Oryza sativa to nitrate (NO3--N) and organic matter (COD - chemical oxygen demand) removal in subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland systems (VFCWs). The tests were carried out in models of 2 beds with a surface of 0.24 m(2) and depth 0.70 m each at various hydraulic loads (H-L) and COD constant in influente wastewater. The VFCW-1 bed was planted with the Vetiveria zizanioides and the VFCW-2 bed with the Oryza sativa. During the 22 weeks of research, the hydraulic load of the analyzed beds was: H-L1 = 148 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1), H-L2 = 239 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1), H-L3 = 350 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1), H-L4 = 473 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1). The VFCWs were fed from two reservoirs, one with mineral medium and nitrate, and the other one with fructose as organic matter. Based on the conducted tests, it was found that in both analyzed systems (VFCW-1 and VFCW-2) the highest NO3--N removal rate was found under H-L2 - the median is 59 and 42% respectively. The most effective removal of COD in the VFCW-1 system was obtained at a H-L2 - 55%, while in the system VFCW-2 at a H-L1 - 43%. The research shows that the low H-L and high COD/NO3--N ratio ensures good effects of nitrate and organic matter removal in VF type constructed wetland systems. It has been shown that the analyzed plants, especially Vetiveria zizanioides have good phytoremediation potential in the field of nitrate nitrogen and organic substance removal and can be recommended for use on a full scale of technology.

AB Environmental degradation by contaminants is a serious concern in the developing world. The remediation strategies to overcome the problem of environmental degradation should be assorted for its ecological impacts. Phytoremediation is a green technology for the removal of pollutants from various environmental compartments by employing green plants. An ideal phytoremediation plant candidate should possess some characteristic features such as exhibiting stronger growth traits with high biomass, unpalatable nature, exuberant root system, hyper accumulation of target contaminants accompanied with stress tolerance attributes. The growth of natural vegetation is prevented by the barren and uncongenial conditions prevailing in the contaminated sites, but however invasive plants are capable of establishing themselves on those sites due to their opportunistic incursive nature. Since, it is hard to eradicate an invasive species once after their establishment in a new habitat or ecosystem, they can possibly be controlled by sustainable management through the way of exploiting them in contaminant remediation, thus phytoremediation. Therefore, it is of foremost requisite to determine the ability of invasive species in offering various ecologically viable services including contaminant remediation through scientific exploration. In this review, the implications of using invasive plants in contaminant remediation with accompanying challenges and scopes involved are discussed with the available volume of literatures in contaminant remediation using plants, especially the invasive plants.

AB Denitrification has been considered the main pathway converting nitrate (NO3-) to dinitrogen gas (N-2) in denitrifying bioreactors. Here, the importance of an alternative nitrogen (N) removal process, namely anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), was assessed by monitoring the removal of N species from partially nitrified municipal wastewater passing through fifteen mesocosm scale (similar to 700 L) bioreactors containing woodchip, coconut husk or gravel during their initial and eighth year of operation. Additionally, lab experiments using a N-15 isotope-pairing technique were performed to partition production of N-2 to these different microbial processes. The effective removal of both NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) and the formation of hybrid N-2 (i.e. N-29(2)) observed in this study demonstrated that, along with denitrification, anammox was an effective pathway for N removal when both NO3- and NH4+ were present. Anammox removal rates ranged from 0.6 to 3.8 g N per m(3) per day, while denitrification rates ranged from 0.7 to 2.6 g N per m(3) per day. The contributions of anammox to N removal was dependent on media, with anammox becoming more dominant in bioreactors where denitrification was carbon limited. Designing denitrifying bioreactors to support both denitrification and anammox expands the utility of these passive approaches for improving treatment of wastewater.

AB Denitrifying bioreactors are simple, low-cost ecotechnologies designed to reduce nitrate (NO3-) present in septic tank effluent and drainage water. Recent studies indicate that, in addition to significant reduction in NO3- loads, these systems are also able to remove microbial contaminants from municipal wastewater. However, the removal of microbial contaminants in denitrifying bioreactors remains poorly characterised and factors that control removal in denitrifying bioreactors remain unexplored. In this study, the removal efficiency of faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms (TC) as a model for bacterial pathogens and F-specific RNA bacteriophage (FRNA bacteriophage) as a model for viruses was assessed for mesocosm-scale (similar to 700 L) bioreactors receiving municipal wastewater. Systems were filled with two different slow-release carbon sources: woodchip and coconut husk. The effect of media age on attenuation of microbial contaminants was assessed by comparing the performance of 8-year old systems with equivalent newly constructed woodchip and coconut husk bioreactors. Additionally, removal performance of these carbon substrates was compared to that of gravel, a non-carbon substrate commonly used in subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands. Substantial reduction of E. coli, TC and FRNA bacteriophage from primary treated municipal wastewater was achieved in all bioreactors. Mean annual log(10) removal efficiencies were similar between microbial indicators ranging from 1.4 to 1.9 for TC, 1.3 to 1.8 for E. coli and 1.3 to 2.0 for FRNA bacteriophage. All denitrifying bioreactors showed consistent year-round performance and long-term performance which did not markedly change in the ninth year of operation. The woodchip or coconut husk bioreactors achieved microbial effluent quality within the same range of log10 removal rates achieved in gravel-based systems. This suggests that denitrifying bioreactors, as well as reducing N loads, can effectively reduce microbial contaminants in wastewater, providing a complimentary disinfection role. Further research is needed to increase understanding of factors affecting removal of microbial contaminants in denitrifying bioreactors to support design of these systems for microbial contaminant removal.

AB Although the influences of desertification and nitrogen (N) addition in shaping species composition and community structure have long been explored, our understanding of the underlying processes is not yet strong. Analyses of trends in the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity can be informative of the processes response to N addition and desertification in desert steppe ecosystems. Our investigation of the changes in beta diversity under desertification and N addition in a desert steppe ecosystem in northern China showed desertification to significantly decrease beta diversity among communities, which leads to species homogenization. Further, decreases to the turnover component of beta diversity was likely an important factor causing homogenization under desertification. Although nitrogen addition did not fundamentally influence beta diversity, dissimilarity caused by nestedness significantly increased with nitrogen addition. The contrasting effects of desertification and N addition on the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity suggest that the ordered loss of plant species with desertification improvement. Overall, our findings provide strong evidence that the effects of desertification and N addition on beta diversity change with ecological processes. We recommend that conservation strategies that focus management practices on prevention of desertification will be most effective in maintaining species diversity.

AB Vertical forests comprise of high-rise buildings with trees planted on their balconies. When trees are planted on a building, they change its exterior, and may influence local wind pressure and global aerodynamic forces. Wind-borne debris caused by local extreme wind pressures lead to negative effects on living environments, and large acceleration responses induced by global aerodynamic forces result in occupants' uneasiness. Therefore, it is important to investigate the local and global wind loads on vertical forests. In this study, wind tunnel tests of simultaneous multi-channel pressure measurement were conducted to investigate the effects of trees on local wind pressures (mean and fluctuating wind pressures on different positions of building facades). High-frequency-base-balance (HFBB) wind tunnel tests were performed to probe the impacts of trees on the global aerodynamic force of the building (base bending and torsional moments). Pressure measurements reveal that trees have minimal effects on mean and extreme values of wind pressure on windward and leeward facades; however, trees decrease the values of extreme wind pressure at the separation area. The results of HFBB show that vegetation slightly increases the intensity of mean global wind load at along-wind directions, decreases the peak value of power spectral density (PSD) of lift forces corresponding to vortex shedding. In general, trees on balconies reduce wind pressures at separation area as well as the across-wind fluctuating forces for the building with the side ratio of 1.67. However, there is no significant effects on the rest of wind pressures and loads. Therefore, to some extent, trees planted on balconies were found to improve wind-resistant performance of vertical forests compared with conventional high-rise buildings.

AB To deeply remove nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from constructed wetlands (CWs), the authors found that CWs can be combined with the use of photovoltaic energy for best results. Thus, electrolysis-integrated, biochar-amended, horizontal (subsurface)-flow-constructed wetlands (E-BHFCWs) were combined with free-water, surface-constructed wetlands (FWSCWs) to remove N and P from secondary effluent water of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Photovoltaic energy was used for electrolysis to intensify the removal of nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), and phosphate phosphorus (PO43--P) in E-BHFCWs. In addition, FWSCWs were constructed to further remove NO3--N, NH3-N, PO43--P and iron ions in effluent of E-BHFCWs and to enhance DO concentration. For the E-BHFCWs combined with FWSCWs, the removal rates of NO3--N, NH3-N, and PO43--P were 73.28%, 53.11% and 67.58% respectively. The removal amounts of NO3--N, NH3-N, and PO43--P were about 211.08 kg N/a, 64.81 kg N/a and 10.46 kg P/a by E-BHFCWs. Photovoltaic electrolysis in E-BHFCWs was able to enhance NO3--N removal through electrochemical reduction by iron cathodes, enriched hydrogenotrophic bacteria in the substrate, and by modified biochar substrate in situ with iron ions. Meanwhile, NH3-N was mainly removed by modified biochar adsorption, nitrifying microbes, and plant uptake. The removal rate of PO43--P was also enhanced due to the formation of ferric ions by the anodization of sacrificial iron anodes, causing chemical precipitation, physical adsorption, and flocculation of PO43--P. Thus, E-BHFCWs combined with FWSCWs are capable of effectively promoting removals of NO3--N, NH3-N, and PO43--P and provide a new insight into a new energy flow that can enhance N and P removals of CWs.

AB Greywater is an alternative water resource, having many favourable characteristics over stormwater or wastewater. In particular, it can be supplied consistently and generated close to desirable end-use applications. Although greywater is considered to contain a low level of contamination, treatment is still required before the end-use, and passive filtration such as biofiltration became a popular option due to its low maintenance and low energy consumption. To this end, a laboratory experiment was conducted with synthetic greywater over 12 months to test the influence of operational characteristics and design factors on pathogen removal from greywater. The role of plants types, saturated zone, and the absence/inclusion of antimicrobial material were tested in a total of 80 biofilter columns. The results showed that the biofilters obtained a median E. coli logarithmic removal of 3.0 across the tested configurations and produced quality of water that meets indoor non-potable use standard (NRMMC, 2006). Further, the infiltration rate and event size were found to significantly influence E. coli removal in greywater biofilters (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The presence of antimicrobial media also significantly improved E. coli removal (up to 1.4 log) compared to non-amended media (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Vegetation also played a significant role in removing E. coli (ANOVA < 0.05). This study successfully suggested the great potential for the application of biofilters to greywater treatment and identified key design factors for consideration prior to implementation.

AB Four macrophytes commonly used to clean up Cu contaminated effluents, i.e. Arundo donax L., Cyperus eragrostis Lam., Iris pseudacorus L. and Phalaris arundinacea L., were assessed to produce Cu-rich plant biomass intended for ecofriendly catalyst preparation. 7-month-old plants were exposed to a Cu gradient (0.08, 2, 10, 20 and 40 mu M Cu) in batch conditions during 2 months. Copper exposure affected the root DW yield of C. eragrostis from 2 mu M Cu, whereas I. pseudacorus and A. donax developed well. Maximum Cu concentration in the biomass of C. eragrostis and P. arundinacea (i.e. 255 and 838 mg Cu kg(-1) DW respectively) did not reach the 1000 mg Cu kg(-1) DW threshold value needed to produce Cu-ecocatalysts. Copper concentrations in the roots of I. pseudacorus and A. donax exceeded this threshold value at 40 mu M and over 10 mu M Cu, i.e. 1099 and 1809 mg Cu kg(-1) DW, respectively, making them relevant candidates for producing Cu-ecocatalysts.

AB Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) using ureolytic bacteria has emerged as a promising technology with several applications in geotechnical engineering. In the current study, bacterial isolates from marine environment (coastal sandstones) have been investigated for their calcification potential. The isolated ureolytic bacterial strains NIOT-1 exhibited high urease activity and identified as Sporsarcina pausterii, were selected for further studies. The laboratory tests revealed that Sporsarcina pausterii NIOT-1 precipitated calcite crystals between the sand particles through the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, which increased the ammonium concentration to the maximum of 366.54 mM and pH of 8.32. The petrological analysis of the samples indicated that the dominant carbonate phase was calcite. This precipitation of calcite crystals between the sand particles resulted in the physical stabilization of sand leading to the unconfined compressive strength to 3950 kpa. The strength of the laboratory made calcareous sandstone was comparatively higher when compared with the naturally formed calcareous sand rocks (3100 kpa (Uvari) and 1000 kpa (Pudumadam)) along the coasts, but the naturally formed ferrugineous sandstone belongs to Vepalodai was higher compared to all (30500 kpa). This has been envisaged by adopting MICP techniques in preventing the beach sand movement to protect eroding shoreline and to protect coastal populace at critical pockets of the coast as a nonconventional coastal protection measure.

AB Land abandonment is an important topic of discussion in many European countries but is particularly relevant for Central and Eastern Europe. When analyzing this issue, a major challenge is to assess the extent and dynamics of these changes in a way that combines high accuracy and a large study area. The article presents the phenomenon of land abandonment in Poland after the political transformation that took place at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s. The analysis covered an area of about 15,000 km(2) that is characterized by unfavorable land fragmentation indicators and the dominance of small-area farms. The region was intensively used for agriculture until the fall of socialism; since then, the phenomenon of land abandonment has increased rapidly. The proposed method for identifying abandoned land uses Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data to precisely determine the extent of tree cover and the height of trees. Assuming the correlation between the height of trees and their age allowed estimation of the long-term changeability of land abandonment. The study covered the extent and dynamics of changes in tree cover in over 1800 villages. The results indicate that the problem of land abandonment noticeably and permanently changes the spatial patterns of land use in Southern Poland. The identified extent of forest cover has increased continuously since the political transformation in 63% of the studied villages. In total, over the last quarter of a century, land abandonment related to forest expansion on agricultural land has been observed in an area of 93,600 ha, which is 10.5% of the entire region. The proposed method has shown its usefulness in analyzing land abandonment at the regional level. It allows not only precise identification of the size of areas covered with tall vegetation, but also approximate assessment of the dynamics of these changes over time.

AB Extensive areas around the world have soils polluted with heavy metals due to anthropogenic activities and are in need of restoration. Natural regeneration or active restoration of vegetation on mine wastelands, such as tailings dams, is difficult due to the harsh environment resulting from poor nutrient availability, low pH and elevated levels of heavy metals. Thus, selection of native trees that thrive in in such a harsh environment and can stabilize or remove heavy metals from the soil is a key step in phytoremediation of these areas. In this study, we examined the floristic composition and biological traits of species that colonized copper mine tailings dams in Zambia, an environment with elevated copper concentrations, low nutrient content and low pH, with the aim of identifying species suitable for phytoremediation. We found relatively little overlap (16%-26%) between species pools occurring on tailings dams and nearby native forests although the overall species richness was similar (10-12 species per 15 stems). The species colonizing the tailings dams were disproportionately light-demanding (93%), moderately tolerant to elevated copper concentration (87%), suitable for erosion control (75%) and had endomycorrhizal symbiosis (47%). Nitrogen-fixing species tended to be more abundant on tailings dams (29%) than in natural forest stands (23%). None of the species were copper accumulators, but rather facultative metalophytes, or possibly even excluders as evidenced by their bioaccumulation factors below one. Restoration of degraded lands would be aided by field trials targeting species with these beneficial traits to identify other suitable plants to accelerate the revegetation process.

AB Constructed floating wetlands (CFWs) have been tested in different climatic regions and aquatic habitat types for nitrogen (N) removal from surface water, but there is limited knowledge about their applicability for N removal in cold climate regions. Most CFWs studies are conducted at the micro- or mesocosm scale, while the application of CFWs at in situ is rare. Moreover, most CFWs studies have focused on plant N accumulation without considering macrophyte root-associated denitrification as a possible N removal pathway. Here, we study the N removal potential of CFWs through N accumulation by macrophytes and potential denitrification activity (PDA) associated with plants. At a mining area in the sub-arctic region of Sweden receiving N-rich mine effluents, we tested the concept of CFWs and evaluated the performance of six native, emerging macrophyte species planted in CFWs. The CFWs were deployed in two types of systems: in situ in the recipient lake, subjected to ambient N concentrations, and CFWs placed in water-side "eco-tanks", subjected to higher N concentrations. We showed that macrophyte establishment in CFWs is feasible under cold climatic conditions, both in situ and eco-tanks. The standing biomass of macrophytes, bulk N accumulation in plant biomass and PDA in mesocosms were 0.54-2.25 kg m(-2), 7.56-24.75 mg N m(-2) d(-1) and 31.82-2250.77 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1), respectively. In the recipient, the variation was larger and the values were higher (standing biomass, 0.37-6.74 kg m(-2); bulk N accumulation, 8.09-106.93 mg N m(-2) d(-1); PDA, 11.89-8446.15 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Macrophyte root-associated denitrification was the main N removal pathway in the CFWs. Given the demonstrated applicability of CFWs and the high denitrification rates that can be obtained, future studies should focus on designing CFWs to enhance denitrification as this process leads to permanent removal of N from the water phase.

AB This article describes the first implementation of green treatment technology for wastewater from agritourism facilities in Romania. The general concept was based on the principles of a nature-based treatment system (NBTS) developed, tested and successfully operated in cold climate in Norway. Two NBTSs, each constituting a three-element system equipped with a septic tank, a pre-treatment section and a filter/wetland bed, were constructed and set in full operation in Mara and Vadu Izei villages (Maramures County, Northern Romania, Carpathian Mountains). Both systems revealed sufficient adaptation to wastewater treatment during the first year of operation. The highest removal rates of BOD5, CODCr, N-tot and P-tot reached 93-97%, 94-98%, 97-98% and 98-99%, respectively. In addition, these parameters did not exceed their permitted values in effluents discharged to water bodies. Both systems demonstrate integrated measures of ecological engineering implemented as "treatment gardens" perfectly suited to the tourist facilities, rural surroundings and cultural landscape of the region.

AB A horizontal flow wetland (HF) was integrated, in a cascading vertical set-up (vertECO), in a Mediterranean tourist facility for decentralized treatment of real low load greywater streams. 15 different plant species were tested in LECA substrate at three different hydraulic retention times (HRTs: 1.9, 1.4 and 1.0 days) with additional aeration improving degradation processes. Beyond standard parameters, several organic micropollutants (14 pharmaceutical organic compounds and 12 endocrine disruptive compounds) were monitored over a 22 month period. The removal efficiency for standard parameters was very high, on average more than 90% for many parameters (COD, BOD5, TSS, VSS and turbidity) and more than 80% for TOC. BOD5 removal could be correlated with the temperature, while TN, TKN and NH4+-N showed the highest removal efficiency at the lowest HRT. The effluents consistently met the standards for various reuse applications, at all three HRTs, according to Spanish Legislation (RD, 1620/2007) and EU draft. In terms of organic micropollutants, influent greywater was characterized by high concentrations and variability (for example up to 256.1 +/- 875.3 mu g L-1 for acetaminophen, 88.7 +/- 424.5 mu g L-1 for ibuprofen). More than 95% of removal by vertECO was achieved for most of the compounds (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, salicylic acid, caffeine, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, triclosan, methyl-, ethyl- and propylparaben) and more than 80% for diclofenac, atenolol and trimethoprim. On the other hand, hydrochlorothiazide, sulfamethoxazole and salbutamol could not be reduced by more than 30%. Statistically significant differences were found at different HRTs for acetaminophen, atenolol, ibuprofen, ethylparaben, TCPP and TBEP (p < 0.05). Conversely, most of the evaluated micropollutants were consistently removed without apparent influence from temperature.

   RESPONSES
AB Tropical grassland-savanna mosaics are threatened globally, but they are challenging to restore because highly competitive pasture grasses inhibit recovery and are not shaded out by the patchy tree cover. We analyzed the outcomes of restoration projects and experiments established over four years in 55 ha of abandoned pastures dominated by invasive C4 grasses within the Neotropical savanna, Central Brazil. We tested the efficacy of direct seeding native grasses, forbs, shrubs and trees in reducing invasive grass cover and increasing native ground cover. We performed a series of experiments aimed at answering questions about the effect of seeding density, soil plowing to control invasive grasses, life form of ground cover species (grass, forb or shrub) and soil type on restoration outcomes. Relative native cover reached 34 +/- 3% three rainy seasons after the first seeding experiment. Higher seeding densities and more soil plowing repetitions increased relative native cover. Soil type interacted with the life form of ground cover species to strongly influence relative native cover; two years after seeding, the highest relative native cover was achieved in rocky soils seeded with grasses (78 +/- 6%) and the lowest was for seasonally waterlogged soils seeded with shrubs (15 +/- 4%). Direct seeding can effectively establish many native Neotropical savanna species of different life forms with better restoration outcomes on rocky soils and with higher seeding densities. Further research is urgent to improve restoration methods, especially to control invasive grasses, to be able to achieve the large-scale restoration targets set internationally.

AB This is an updated version of a review written by the author in April 2018 at the request of The Friends of the Everglades, an NGO based in Miami, Florida, on a plan developed primarily by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) to mitigate coastal pollution that has resulted from discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastline and eventually to "send the water south" to the Florida Everglades instead. This EAA Reservoir project was included by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a 2018 U.S. Congressional bill that was approved. In May 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to spend $200 million to begin construction of this restoration, three times the amount requested by the state of Florida. While supported with enthusiasm by the Florida state legislature, the SFWMD, and some NGOs such as The Everglades Foundation, a change in leadership in the state of Florida after November 2018 elections and especially in the leadership of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has led to a renewed public optimism for major improvements in water quality management in south Florida. It is therefore timely for this review of the advantages and shortcomings of this "EAA (Everglades Agricultural Area) Reservoir Plan" to be widely disseminated in an international forum such as Ecological Engineering to encourage discussions among scientists and engineers.

AB We analysed the eco-hydrological characteristics of the Bojiang Haizi River basin, which is the location of the Erdos Larus Relictus Nature Reserve plateau salt marsh wetland. The study found that the restoration of the plateau salt marsh is more of a water quality problem than a water quantity problem. Simply maintaining the balance of water volume without considering water quality will destroy the original stable ecosystem. Therefore, water balance analysis was conducted for the overall water resources in the basin on the basis of simulated data of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool module. We examined remote sensing and water quality monitoring data via geographic information system-3D technology to meet the requirements of water quality and quantity in wetland restoration. We established the hydrological dynamic relationship model of lake storage capacity-elevation-area-salinity and found that the lake presents an alternating cyclic rule of salt accumulation and dilution during seasonal changes. This pattern is an important guarantee for the healthy and sustainable development of the salt marsh wetland. Lastly, the survival salinity of the organism was selected as the target salinity (5 g/L), and the corresponding target water amount was simulated as 20.17 x 10(6) m(3); the target lake area was 9.48 km(2). Through an analysis of three water transfer scenarios, we found that under the optimum balance condition between water quantity and salt concentration, simulating the water transfer mode in precipitation replenishment is an effective means to restore the wetland during breeding season. The findings of this study may improve our understanding of the eco-hydrological characteristics of plateau salt marsh wetlands and help managers protect and restore water balance using water-salt dynamic models.

AB Changes in microbial communities and drivers of their composition in different restoration approaches are largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different ecosystem restoration approaches on bacterial community diversity and whether changes in soil physico-chemical properties are driving bacterial community dynamics. Soil samples were collected from restored lands covered with grass, coniferous forest, young conifer-broadleaf forest, mature conifer-broadleaf forest, and natural broad-leaved forest and bare land. The bacterial community was determined by 16S rDNA sequencing while soil physico-chemical properties were determined using standard methodologies. We found that the physico-chemical properties of degraded red soil were improved following re-vegetation. Soil bulk density and soil pH decreased while soil moisture content increased in restored sites compared to bare land. Soil organic carbon, total P, K, N, and available P and K contents were the highest in conifer-broadleaved forest soil. Soil bacterial community diversity significantly increased following restoration of degraded landscape, with Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, WPS-2, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being dominant. The major bacteria phyla were positively correlated with soil chemical properties, but negatively correlated with soil physical properties and pH. It can be concluded that favorable changes in soil physico-chemical properties following restoration mediate bacterial community diversity, depending on vegetation cover types used to restore the degraded land.

AB The contributions of organic matter via fine litterfall to the soil were evaluated in three sites that were rehabilitated 7, 10, and 21 years earlier, respectively, located in an opencast coalmine at El Cerrejon (La Guajira, Colombia). We placed forty litterfall traps in four plots at each reclaimed site and in a tropical dry mature forest, which was used as a reference ecosystem. Fine litterfall (including woody material up to 2 cm in length) was collected monthly from October 2013 to November 2014. Values for the highest fine litterfall recorded in the 21-year-old site (2.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were more than double those recorded in the 7-year-old site (1.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). Soil carbon and nitrogen contents were greater in the rehabilitated sites than in the unrestored substrate. Soil phosphorus (P) increased significantly 7 years after rehabilitation. The high return of organic matter and nutrients via fine litterfall in the three rehabilitated sites suggests that the rehabilitation approach employed in this opencast coalmine was successful in terms of enriching soil organic matter content and nutrient status and that it could serve as a model for the rehabilitation of similarly degraded mining habitats.

AB Along with the development of large-scale hydropower projects, many changes are arising both on the river channel and the ecosystems, which leads to the formation of a dam-reservoir-river system. The system is of significance to China due to the large-scale utilization of hydropower. However, such projects may cause significant impacts on local vegetation dynamics, which is of importance to local decision makers and water resources managers. In this research, the spatio-temporal variations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climatic factors (CFs) under multiple time scales (i.e., annual, seasonal, and wet/dry periods) and the spatio-temporal pattern of the correlation of NDVI-CFs under the scales of annual and wet season were analyzed in the system by using the statistical methods. The response of NDVI to CFs in the basin was explored at the monthly scale. The main results indicated that from 1999 to 2013, the annual average NDVI had a significant overall upward trend. The distributions of the NDVI and its trend had the spatial and seasonal differences, with majority areas showing medium-high and high vegetation cover and a slight improvement in the grade of vegetation cover change of more than 40% of the total area. In the basin, temperature (T) and evapotranspiration (ET0) showed an upward trend, and precipitation (P) and the humidity index (HI) were the opposite. The corrections of NDVI-T and NDVI-ET0 were positive, and that of NDVI-P and NDVI-HI were negative. Also, the vegetation growth was mainly affected by the amount of P, and its time-lag period to the P was two months. In the scale of the eight cascade hydropower stations, the vegetation coverage and the correlation of NDVI-CFs around the Jinanqiao and Longkaikou hydropower stations were the best, and those near the Ludila and Guanyinyan were the worst, indicating that the vegetation coverage was affected by the cascade hydropower stations development. Therefore, the results may be beneficial for sustainable watershed ecosystem management in the system, as well as ecological development planning around the cascade hydropower stations.

AB To improve the ecosystem services of wetlands in response to global climate change, wetland restoration projects have become prevalent worldwide. Restored wetlands have the potential to remove external nitrogen through denitrification, but incomplete denitrification may increase nitrous oxide (N2O) release. In order to comprehensively understand nitrogen removal and N2O emission processes in restored wetlands, we conducted carbon (anhydrous sodium acetate) and nitrogen (sodium nitrate) addition experiments in the Fengxian coastal wetland site. These experiments explored the roles of external nitrogen, carbon sources, and wetland plants in nitrogen removal and N2O emission. With the addition of nitrogen, the removal of external nitrogen was significant at the restored wetland site, but led to increasing N2O release. However, by adding carbon sources, the restored wetland could not only enhance nitrogen removal efficiency through denitrification, but also significantly reduce N2O emission. Our results demonstrate that carbon availability could improve the ecological functions of coastal restored wetlands by improving water quality and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The construction and operation of water conservancy projects changes the original flow regimes of rivers, and thus disturbs the habitat conditions of aquatic organisms. As an important aquatic living resource, fish is sensitive to the flow changes of the river, especially in the important periods such as spawning seasons. Existing studies indicates that flow regimes are effective stimulus for the fish spawning. In this study, an identification algorithm composed of three times of denoising is proposed to identify those rises with a certain magnitude and duration, which are deemed to be effective for spawning stimulus. Characteristic parameters including the number of the flood processes in the spawning season, the duration of each flood, and the growth rate of rising are statistically analyzed for the identified processes. The application on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in China, where almost no human intervention occurs, indicates that there indeed are some regularity for the flow regimes in the spawning season, even in different hydrological years. 4-6 times of floods composing a flow rising process is in need, and each of them should last for about 11 days. The desired daily growth rate is around 60 m(3)/(s.d) for the studied case. Such results are conductive for reservoir operation and the management of the river.

AB Fire is a common disturbance both from natural source and anthropogenic activities and an important factor in driving the variation of soil organic carbons. A 5-year study was conducted to examine the influence of annual prescribed fire on soil organic carbon (SOC) fraction in a fire-prone plant community, Triarrhena lutarioriparia community, in Poyang Lake, China. The results showed that after burning the contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) increased significantly from 78.53 mg/kg to 131.72 mg/kg, 365.58 mg/kg to 603.42 mg/kg, and 14.82 g/kg to 20.56 g/kg, respectively, during the 5-year studying period. On the other hand, the contents of total SOC and heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) only increased slightly from 53.67 g/kg to 61.39 g/kg and 33.45 g/kg to 37.46 g/kg, respectively. The results strongly suggested that DOC was more sensitive to the prescribed fire than SOC. Moreover, the annual ratios of DOC, SMBC and LFOC to SOC significantly increased after burn treatments. Taken together, prescribed fire could greatly increase the contents of soil active organic carbons, and enhance the carbon cycle in Poyang Lake. Thus, it could be taken as an exercisable measure to improve the carbon capacity and maintain the soil productivity in the lake wetland.

AB Bioretention basins are a prominent type of vegetated stormwater infrastructure that provides various ecosystem services, such as carbon (C) sequestration. Despite the key role of organic matter in the performance of bioretention basins, there is little understanding of their C accumulation properties. Using detailed field studies, we investigated the spatial, temporal and vertical variation of C capture in the soil of 25 subtropical bioretention basins in Australia. A thirteen-year soil chronosequence was used to estimate C sequestration rate. It was observed that the bioretention basins displayed a spatially uniform depositional pattern of C in their ponding area. The mean areal C density of soil in the upper 20 cm was 3.8 +/- 0.3 kg Cm-2, from which 32% was associated with the top 5 cm of soil. There was a strong influence of age on C density only throughout the first top 20 cm of the soil profile with a C sequestration rate of 0.31 kg Cm-2 yr(-1). Carbon quickly accumulates in the top 5 cm layer while in the lower depths it accumulated at a more gradual rate. The results show that bioretention systems could be designed for the enhancement of their C sequestration potential, and amendments in their design, such as addition of a carbon source layer, are important for better managing carbon availability in the basins.

AB Ecological concrete could protect the slopes along a motorway or on a river bank and prevent water/soil loss and beautify and built the environment compared to ordinary concrete. Overlaying soil, as a key component of ecological concrete, plays an important role in greening rate of ecological concrete. However, natural soil used as overlaying soil cannot meet plants growing demand due to its unsatisfying scouring resistance and water retention properties. In this paper natural super absorbent polymer (SAP) was utilized to modify the natural soil for the preparation of a material with enhanced scouring resistance and water retention performance which are indispensable for growing plants in ecological concrete. Experimental results suggested that 1.5 wt% SAP content in the soil was the most suitable option. At this natural soil replacement level, the scouring resistance increased by 68.9% while its water retention performance improved by 11.1% at the age of 160 h. In addition, other performance improvements of the soil were determined including increasing of the water absorption rate which was tested increasing by up to 69.4% and the cone index of up to 0.39 MPa, and the advancements of perennial ryegrass were measured increasing of the survival ratio which was found increasing by up to 97.9% and the dry weight of up to 2.16 kg/m(2).

AB A field-based experimental study has been undertaken within a full-scale constructed wetland, designed to treat runoff from agricultural land in Knapwell, Cambridgeshire, UK. The effects of flow rate variation and natural vegetation ageing on the mixing characteristics are investigated over a eight month period. Detailed fluorometric measurements were made to examine the longitudinal spreading of a solute within the wetland. Between a UK November winter period, and June summer period, 125 tracer tests were undertaken for a range of dry weather and storm flow conditions, using an automated daily injection tracer system. The longitudinal dispersion results show that the dispersion is influenced by the flow rate for low discharge conditions, however, for higher discharges, the longitudinal dispersion becomes independent of discharge. Residence Time Distribution (RTD) curves are examined through a series of flow conditions for each testing month, ranging from transitional (Re similar to 2000) to turbulent (Re similar to 7000) flow conditions. For the conditions measured, differing flow rates produce changes in the RTD, demonstrating that higher flow rates induce shorter mean residence times, generating predominantly an advective flow regime. The effects of plant age are prominent on the mixing pattern. Towards the end of the annual plant cycle, in February/March, mixing pattern approaches complete mixing, longitudinal mixing increases significantly due to long tails on the RTDs, and mean flow velocity is retarded. This indicates that the dormant plant period, which normally takes 5-6 months (October to March), alters progressively the mixing pattern in the system in such a way that it is significantly different from the mixing pattern during the growing plant season.

AB Green roofs are gradually being accepted and implemented across North America as they can mitigate many of the negative effects that urban areas have on humans and the environment. As rooftops are filled with living plants, individual species need to be tested for longevity and suitability. Twenty-two plant species including herbaceous perennials, grasses, and sedum were evaluated on a green roof at substrate depths of 4.5, 10, and 20 cm over an eight-year period in East Lansing, Michigan. Plants were irrigated when needed during the first two years, but had to rely on natural rainfall thereafter. All five species of sedum were still present at the end of the eight-year period, but only seven of the 17 herbaceous perennials and grasses survived. Of the herbaceous perennials and grasses, Allium cernuum was by far the dominant species in both the 10 and 20 cm deep zones. Sporobolus heterolepis and Koeleria macrantha also established themselves in the 20 cm zone, but all other species were either only present in trace amounts or had completely disappeared. Substrate moisture was probably the major factor in terms of species survival and a drought during 2016 was likely the cause for the large loss of species. Deeper substrates supported a larger variety of species, but plant species diversity decreased over time at all substrate depths. This study emphasizes the fact that if herbaceous perennials and grasses are to be successful on green roofs, then irrigation may be critical to mitigate drought and maintain species diversity. It also points out the importance of long-term studies to accurately evaluate green roof plant communities and provides the framework for a continuation of the same study in other areas of the world.

AB The ability of As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata (PV) to remove As from real As (75.2 mg/kg) contaminated farmland soils under two soil moisture treatments [water retention (WR) and non-water retention (NW)] and three types of P fertilizers (acidic, alkaline and weakly acidic P fertilizers, indicated by SSP, CaP and KP, respectively) under field condition over 5 months was investigated for the first time. The results showed that yields of PV were increased by water retention irrespectively of P treatments. The results revealed that the uptake of As by PV was significantly increased by CaP and KP treatments, the opposite was observed with SSP treatment. Under WR condition, the uptake of As by PV treated with CaP and KP treatments was further significantly increased compared with SSP treatment. This study suggested that the combination of P fertilizer with soil moisture control is a more promising approach to increase remediating efficiency of PV under the real field conditions.

AB In spite of the well-known green roof benefits, their widespread adoption in the management practices of urban green infrastructures requires the design of adequate structural factors/levels or its optimal combination. Using the Taguchi method, this study assessed the structural factors affecting runoff retention of extensive green roofs. The structural factors considered in this study consisted of substrate material, substrate depth, slope and vegetation type, each of which had three levels. Nine runoff plots of extensive green roofs were designed according to the Taguchi's orthogonal array L-9 (four factors at three levels). An analysis of the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was used to evaluate the runoff discharge of green roofs. The results showed that substrate material S2 has lower runoff discharge than substrate S1 and S3. The amount of runoff discharge increases as the substrate depth increases from 5 cm to 15 cm. There were slight differences in runoff discharge among vegetation types of green roofs. The runoff discharge of green roofs with 2% slope was higher than the runoff discharge of 7% and 12% slope gradients. Substrate material aspect made the greatest contribution of runoff retention (53.9%) and followed by substrate depth contribution (26.2%). The results from regression analysis of the predicted versus measured runoff discharge showed that the Taguchi method is able to predict the runoff discharge well (R-2 = 0.96, p < 0.001), and it confirmed the high credibility of the Taguchi method to predict runoff retention in response to different combinations of factors and levels.

AB Over the last few years, wild ungulate populations have increased their number and distribution range in developed countries all over the world, causing conflicts between animals and humans, and situations of environmental concern. In many cases, those populations are managed inefficiently or management does not even exist due to the absence of useful tools. This work presents the second part of a management matrix model for wild ungulate populations under density dependent conditions, between the new term Optimum Capacity and the known Carrying Capacity, the model can be easily adapted to every population and species by knowing some basic biological parameters. In this case, it has been adapted to a real red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in an undesired high density and through the model the management actions required have been known to improve the situation. As a result, it is possible to simulate a real population growth in order to foresee its evolution and to test different management practices to achieve the management target. The model gives every necessary parameter to guarantee the stability and the sustainability twice a year, after the reproduction season and after the extracting season. Also, as a novelty, the differences between the left and the right product of the extraction matrix and the biological matrix have been proven and explained in a real situation.

AB Dissolved oxygen is one of the most important water quality parameters in relation to aquatic life, and one of the most direct indicators of water pollution. The present study employs a novel methodology for the estimation of riverine dissolved oxygen using neural network models taking the spatial homogeneity of the water quality sampling sites into account. In three alternative configurations, a multivariate linear regression model, a radial basis function neural network and a general regression neural network are applied to discover which is best able to forecast dissolved oxygen effectively. Data from 13 water quality monitoring stations of the River Tisza are used, including runoff, water temperature, electric conductivity and pH. The three configurations are as follows: (i) a randomly chosen training and test set (which is then considered the reference model), (ii) a training and test set chosen in a spatially controlled way and (iii) a data set composed of two homogeneously behaving sampling sites with the addition of the site lying closest to these downstream. It was found that if the input of the linear model or the neural networks consists of a group or groups of sampling sites displaying homogeneous behavior, better performance is achieved in the estimation. Specifically, the best estimation of dissolved oxygen was achieved in the middle and lower reaches of the river, with an average of 81% and 87% of variance explained, respectively; the General Regression Neural Networks gave the best performance, in the middle reaches 85%, and 90% in the lower ones, even in the presence of a high degree of anthropogenic activity, as is the case with the River Tisza.

TI Dynamics of nitrate degradation along an alternative latrine improved by

AB Nutrients, like nitrate and phosphate, and pathogens are the primary contaminants released into groundwater by on-site sanitation systems, which are an effluent disposal outcome for regions not covered by sanitation infrastructure, as periurban communities in developing countries. As appropriate setback distances between pit latrines and supply wells often cannot be met to avoid groundwater contamination, especially in a densely-populated situation, efficient, low-cost and accessible technologies are extremely necessary to protect water resources and surpass critical and persistent public health problems. This paper presents 1-year field-testing of an alternative latrine (AL) that incorporates two waste materials as permeable reactive barriers (PRB) in an irregular settlement at the municipality of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag in contact with wastewater effluent increases its pH level, which causes pathogens inactivation and phosphate adsorption. Sawdust under water saturation creates reducing conditions that encourage the growth of denitrifying bacteria that remove nitrate. A control latrine (CL) was constructed 90 m apart from AL with similar hydraulic characteristics and nonreactive materials for hydrochemical comparison. It was evident for AL the formation of well-defined nitrification and denitrification reaction zones, whereas CL overall presented nitrogen in its ammoniacal form, with incipient nitrate production at CL bottom, indicating that nitrification is probably boosted below that. BOF slag had attenuated microorganisms and phosphate almost completely, but nitrate removal average efficiency was 42%. The high pH effluent generated in BOF media may have also affected in the short-term the denitrifying bacteria in sawdust barrier 1 m below. The inverted position of the reactive barriers, i.e., sawdust PRB overlying BOF slag PRB, should be a more suitable design to achieve nitrate and pathogens removal. This kind of sanitation solution employing cheap and accessible waste materials have never been applied in the design proposed in this paper and also was a novelty for Brazilian context, proving to be a suitable technology to meet local needs.

AB We present the results of flume experiments specifically designed to investigate the conditions required for successful bank protection using fascines, considered in the early and critical stage of their installation (no developed root system), in the alpine context. A total of 145 runs were performed with erodible banks, considering different combinations of protection design (no protection, rip-raps, twigs), bed mobility (with or without bedload), discharge (from low to exceptional floods), and bend curvature radius. None of the runs showed any direct fascine grabbing by the flow observed; all destruction was the consequence of bank scouring, erosion and collapse around the structure. In all cases, most destructive effects resulted from water recirculation inside the bank. Thus, we conclude that all measures aiming to reduce water circulations during the first stage of the fascine construction and development are recommended. This include large bend curvature radii (when possible), fining of the filling material, use of antiscouring twigs, optimisation of the programming of the works with consideration of the hydrology (shape of hydrographs) and regular survey of the structure. Our experiments show that anti-scouring twigs have a real protective effect by modifying the local hydraulics and promoting sediment deposition at the bank toe.

TI The effects of restored hydrologic connectivity on floodplain trapping

AB River channelization and artificial levees have decreased the hydrologic connectivity of river-floodplain systems around the world. In response, restoration through enhancing connectivity has been advocated to improve the functions of floodplains, but uncertain benefits and the possibility of phosphate release from re-flooded soils has limited implementation. In this study, we measured change in floodplain P, N, and sediment mass balances after restoration along channelized reaches in the lowland Pocomoke River, Maryland USA. Two floodplains (one headwater, one mainstem) restored through partial levee breaches were compared to two additional mainstem floodplains (one natural unchannelized, one unrestored channelized). Potential soluble reactive P (SRP) release from soil cores during experimental laboratory floods; soil P, Fe, and Al fractionation; and deposition and P and N content of sediment were measured before and after the restoration period, as well as in situ inputs and release of SRP and dissolved inorganic N from soils after restorations. Potential SRP release, during both the before and after restoration period, was greatest at the channelized mainstem and restored mainstem sites, lower at the restored headwater site, and small at the natural mainstem site. Both restored sites had smaller potential SRP release after restoration compared to before restoration. In situ SRP release slightly exceeded inputs to soils at connected sites during the post-restoration period, with less net release at the restored sites compared to the natural mainstem site. The magnitude of gross and net SRP release from soils in the field was smaller than, and uncorrelated with, potential SRP release estimated from laboratory experimental floods. Gross soil SRP release rates in the field were predictable using the ratio of soil oxalate-extractable P/Al. Sedimentation inputs of P and N increased at all sites during the post-restoration period, with rates at restored sites intermediate compared to the much higher rates at the natural mainstem site and somewhat lower rates at the channelized mainstem site. These sediment inputs of nutrients were much larger than rates of inorganic P and N release from soils, indicating net trapping of P and N after restoration. Restoring floodplain hydrologic connectivity showed moderate success at increasing the trapping of P, N, and sediment, with relatively little phosphate release, and therefore improving water quality.

AB Forested riparian zones in agricultural landscapes provide multiple ecological services including nutrient abatement and carbon (C) sequestration. However, limited information exists on CO2 emissions from rehabilitated riparian forests, which could negate their C sequestration potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate temporal and spatial variation of CO2 emissions, and its relationship to soil and vegetation characteristics, in a 30-year old riparian zone rehabilitated with trees (RH) compared to a 150-year old undisturbed natural (UNF) riparian forest. Soil moisture, temperature, C, total nitrogen (TN) and vegetation characteristics (light intensity, distance to the nearest tree) were significantly (p < 0.05) different between RH and UNF sites. Soil CO2 emissions were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the RH (27 mg CO2-C m(-2)h(-1)) than in the UNF (18 mg CO2-C m(-2)h(-1)) riparian forest. Both riparian forests exhibited strong seasonal patterns of CO2 emissions with significantly greater (p < 0.05) emissions during the summer. Carbon dioxide emissions were significantly different (p < 0.05) with respect to location (perpendicular and parallel) from the stream. For example, emissions were significantly different (p < 0.05) among perpendicular locations in the RH site, but among parallel locations in the UNF site. Emissions of CO2 were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) to soil moisture and temperature in the RH site, and significantly correlated (p < 0.05) to temperature, SOC and TN content in the UNF site. Carbon dioxide emissions were not significantly correlated (p < 0.05) to vegetation characteristics. We concluded that the younger RH site generated contrasting soil and vegetation characteristics that influenced spatial CO2 emissions differently compared to a mature riparian forest. However, our study also found that seasonal changes had a stronger influence on CO2 emissions than spatial variability in both riparian forests.

AB In Korea, rapid urbanization has changed the land use in rural areas, which has resulted in an increase in the number of weirs that are left untended in streams. Previously, changes in stream morphology and fishes were studied following the removal of such weirs. The present study was conducted to investigate changes in the habitat of the macroinvertebrate community after weir removal using physical habitat simulations (PHSs). The functional group approach was used in the PHSs for the macroinvertebrate community. In the functional group approach, macroinvertebrates are classified based on the traits of their food acquisition (i.e., the functional feeding group) or habitat selection (i.e., the functional habit group). In the present study, macroinvertebrate species were divided into the functional habit groups (FHGs) of swimmers, clingers, burrowers, and sprawlers. Hydraulic simulations and habitat simulations were carried out using the River2D model and habitat suitability curves (HSCs), respectively. The distributions of the composite suitability index (CSI) for the FHGs were obtained over the entire study area, and the changes in the suitability of the habitat for the target FHGs were evaluated. The simulation results indicated that habitat suitability for swimmers, clingers, and sprawlers was improved. However, habitat suitability for burrowers was degraded after the weir was removed. Consequently, the removal of the weir increased the diversity of the macroinvertebrate community, thus improving the health of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Temperature in cities cores has realized always warmer than the surroundings, which is described as Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Using of vegetation is one of the effective methods to combat this phenomenon. This study used urban parks (27 parks) located on three distance levels from the Melbourne city centre, which were choose by graduated size. Parks were heavily tested eight measuring time per day (six major and two minor) per month. Handheld measurement device used to measure Land Surface Temperature (LST) used to collect data during all transect points, which extended up 0.295-3 km beyond each park's perimeter. Study results presented that average maximums Park Cool Island (PCI) between 3 degrees C and 10 degrees C for all rings, however, parks close to the city centre showed higher PCI than the others during the first part of average maximums of Park Cooling Distance (PCD) up to 1100 m. Closest parks to the city (Ring 1) extended PCD to 3000 m, however, the other parks reached farther than 2000 m. Study concluded that all parks provided cooling benefits to the surrounding urban area. Urbanization was strongly effected on cooling magnitude (PCI) in the first cooling distance, which reached to 746 m. In the other words, parks decreased temperature in the built up areas started from the edge of parks to 746m (Ring 1 > Ring 2 > Ring 3).

AB The effective restoration of degraded areas, resulting in the sequestration of significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) and labile soil organic carbon fractions (LOCF), is essential for mitigating global climatic changes. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of the responses and magnitudes of SOC and LOCF during restoration processes in degraded land like karst ecosystems. In this study, we selected four different restoration strategies: (1) not subjected to any management practices, mainly bare land (BL); (2) Pinus yunnanensis plantation (PY), native and characterized by slow growth and high drought resistance; (3) Eucalyptus maideni plantation (EM), non-native and characterized by rapid growth and high adaptability; (4) natural regeneration of secondary forest (SF). The SOC concentrations, SOC stocks, sensitive indicators of LOCF (microbial biomass C (MBC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C), dissolved organic C (DOC), water soluble organic C (WSOC)), non-labile C (NLC), and the carbon pool management index (CPMI) were investigated. The different reforestation strategies had significant effects (p < 0.05) on SOC stocks; compared with BL, the SOC stocks of SF, EM, and PY increased by 57.7, 38.0, and 26.9%, respectively. Both the LOCF and the NLC stocks were significantly increased by the different restoration strategies relative to the BL, while natural vegetation restoration was more beneficial for C sequestration than afforestation. Compared with BL, in SF, EM, and PY, the CPMI increased by 70.1, 35.8, and 32.6%, respectively. These findings suggest that although afforestation can significantly increase C sequestration, natural regeneration may be a more effective approach in terms of SOC sequestration. Soil C accumulation would be limited by nitrogen and phosphorus during the vegetation restoration in the karst areas. In degraded karst ecosystems, the CPMI could be used as a representative index in evaluating the impacts of vegetation restoration on SOC concentration and soil quality.

AB The replacement of natural marine habitats with less structurally complex human infrastructure has been linked to the homogenisation of epibenthic assemblages and associated changes in fish assemblages. To mitigate these impacts, eco-engineering efforts have focussed on increasing the physical and biogenic complexity of artificial structures, in the form of crevices added to seawalls and the seeding of the substrate with habitat-forming organisms such as oysters. While these studies have assessed how these interventions affect epibenthic assemblages, the effect of these strategies on the behaviour, such as feeding and habitat use, of different functional groups of fish (e.g. cryptobenthic and pelagic) remains uncertain. To do this, we manipulated complexity on seawalls by adding concrete tiles with different physical (flat or structured with crevices and ridges) and biogenic (seeding with two common habitat-forming species or naturally recruited fouling) complexities. We assessed pelagic and cryptobenthic fish species composition, abundance, interaction time with the tiles and number of feeding bites on three occasions 8-12 months after deployment. Cryptobenthic fish interacted more with physically complex tiles than flat tiles, regardless of biogenic complexity. In contrast, cryptobenthic fish fed more from flat tiles compared to physically complex tiles, and also appeared to feed more from tiles seeded with oysters. Pelagic fish interacted and fed more from naturally fouled tiles compared to unfouled control tiles, regardless of physical complexity. This study showed that manipulating complexity at the scales used here affects behaviour of fish, but it does not affect fish community. Increasing physical complexity facilitated fish use of seawalls as habitat by providing refuge, while it also hindered fish feeding by providing refuge for their prey. Cryptobenthic fish are important trophic linkages in their ecosystems and we have shown that by changing habitat complexity, we can change the habitat use and feeding activity of these fish, allowing them to fulfil this essential ecosystem role.

AB Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are xenobiotic chlorinated aromatic compounds with high toxicity to both fauna and flora. PCBs can enter the environment through close interactions of multiple environmental matrices such as sediments, soils, water and food web. Biogeochemical cycle of PCBs can transport them far from their initial source of production. The present study aims to investigate the effects of organic and chemical amendments during rhizoremediation of PCBs in aged contaminated soil. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) was grown in PCB-contaminated soil, whereas different combinations of two biochar (i.e., beech woodchip and green garden waste) and a surfactant (i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate) were applied to assess the removal efficiency. The overall system's performance was evaluated based on plant growth, PCBs degradation, and proliferation of PCBs degrading bacteria after 5-months of sowing of ryegrass. We found that PCBs removal was significantly high in the vegetated soils as compared to the un-vegetated soils. Maximum removal (85% of total PCBs load) was observed in the presence of green garden waste biochar whereas less removal was observed with the surfactant application. The observations on PCBs degrading bacteria and plant growth parameters were consistent with the degradation scheme, which suggest the potential role of bacteria in the overall degradation process. We conclude that appropriate combinations of vegetation, soil amendments, and PCB degrading bacteria can help to improve the degradation of PCBs impacted soils.

AB Chemophytostabilization is a valuable alternative to many traditional methods of reducing the concentration of heavy metals in soil affected by industrial activity. In this study two soil additives - Na-bentonite and green compost were used separately and as a mixture combined with Festuca arundinacea to reclaim soil highly contaminated with Cd, Zn and Pb. It was found that a decrease in heavy metal concentrations (57-87% for Cd, 48-91% for Zn and 30-82% for Pb) in the amended soils was connected with the application of soil additives rather than with plant vegetation. Both of the soil additives contributed to achieving a higher biomass of F. arundinacea (1.5- to 9.5-fold) than in the non-amended soil. The accumulation of Cd, Zn and Pb in the plant organs was generally higher in the roots than in the shoots. Both soil additives positively influenced the soil enzymes activity and microbial functional capacity. Moreover, they altered the structure of microbial communities in the chemophytostabilized soils. The calculated soil quality indices confirmed that the combined amendments with grass vegetation were most effective in the soil reclamation than other treatments. The obtained results clearly indicate that the chemophytostabilization creates new opportunities for using bentonite and green compost as well as tall fescue grass to limit the transfer of toxic metals from polluted soils to the trophic levels of ecosystems.

AB Urbanisation is seen as one of the most important drivers for species extinction. The aim of our study was to compare vascular plant species richness of 35 artificial urban stormwater ponds (STOPON) designed to control water flow, with 35 control ponds (CONTROL) in the surrounding landscape. For both plot types, we gathered a variety of environmental parameters to determine the drivers of plant species richness. Based on the results, we discuss the relevance of STOPON for biodiversity conservation in urban areas and give recommendations for biodiversity-friendly construction and pond management.
   Our study showed that the environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. STOPON were especially larger than CONTROL; as a consequence, the aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial zones had a greater extent at STOPON. Accordingly, the overall and mean number of aquatic, salt-tolerating aquatic and threatened plant species was higher at STOPON than at CONTROL. However, species density of all three plant indicator groups did not differ among the two plot types.
   The greater plant species richness of STOPON was driven by a higher habitat heterogeneity which was especially explained by (i) the genuine effect of habitat area on habitat heterogeneity, (ii) the existence of three similarly large habitat zones (terrestrial, semi-aquatic, aquatic) and (iii) the regular management, which represses shading plants, creates open soil and activates the soil seed bank. Due to the high species richness of threatened plant species STOPON play an important role in biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

AB Hydrogen peroxide is widely recognized as the most stable of the reactive oxygen species ( ROS) produced by both biotic and abiotic pathways in natural waters. Its high reactivity in mediating redox transformations may, directly or indirectly, affect aquatic ecosystem functions, including primary productivity. However, environmental interactions between photoautotrophs, particularly cyanobacteria, and hydrogen peroxide are poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of hydrogen peroxide and cyanobacterial interactions, we determined the hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the presence and absence of cyanobacterial blooms in southwest Florida. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined using a fast response amperometric hydrogen peroxide microelectrode. Our measurements ranged from 0 to 5.3 mu M in freshwater bodies (ponds, lakes and the Caloosahatchee River) and 0 to 92.9 mu M in rainwater. In general, hydrogen peroxide levels were highly associated with cyanobacterial bloom conditions, indicating the potential role of cyanobacteria in hydrogen peroxide production in freshwater. To determine the potential biodegradation of hydrogen peroxide during sample transportation in the dark condition, water samples were passed through 0.2 mu m pore size filters immediately after sampling and compared with unfiltered water samples in the laboratory. We found that filtered water samples retained higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than unfiltered samples with a mean biodegradation rate of 44 +/- 10.6 nmol/h. Out of a total of 26 samples, only one unfiltered sample showed a higher hydrogen peroxide concentration than the filtered samples. Overall, our study found the microelectrode technique could accurately measure hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the samples from various freshwater bodies. This measurement method revealed that hydrogen peroxide concentrations vary with temporal and spatial dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms.

AB Organotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria can utilize small volatile fatty acids with nitrate as electron acceptors with less energy consumption and no biomass production. To achieve a faster and stable start-up of organotrophic anammox process, in this study, the growth of organotrophic anammox bacteria seeded from hybrid constructed wetland (CW) sediment under different TOC/TN ratios and different chloramphenicol concentrations were investigated. The incubation study was conducted at the TOC/TN ratio = 0.0375-0.1 or 0.1-0.2 for the period of over five months by using serum bottles. The anammox bacteria revealed a higher activity when the TOC/TN ratio was 0.1, with the removal efficiency of NH4+-N (60-80%) and NO2--N (similar to 100%). The relative abundances of anammox in the incubated CW sediment were about 30% higher in comparison with the municipal waste water treatment plant sludge, suggesting the CW sediment could be a viable source for the enrichment of organotrophic anammox bacteria. On the contrary, the continuous addition of 50 mg/L chloramphenicol completely inhibited the anammox activity in our study. Following the results of the batch tests, Candidatus Brocadia caroliniensis was successfully enriched with the CW sediment in an auto-controlled SBR for the period of 40 days.

AB In this work, we developed a process for preparing hexagon-like shaped MoSe2 monolayers with sawtooth edge via controllable chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique in atmospheric pressure, resulting in large-scale MoSe2 atom layers with the size of similar to 20 mu m and the height of similar to 0.8 nm. Raman, Photoluminescence (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations affirmed that the grown products possess high quality, and the electrical measurement results of the device with the mobility of 0.21 cm(2) V(-1 )s(-1) based on as-obtained products manifest that the underlying applications of MoSe2 in nanoelectronic field.

AB We examine the effect of nitrogen dopants in Few-layer graphene (FLG) cathodes on anion intercalation. Different nitrogen dopant configurations within the FLG were achieved by varying the synthesis parameters and their effects are compared. The dopant configurations of the samples were determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and formation energies were calculated using density functional theory, allowing correlation between cell performance and dopant configuration. The reduced ion intercalation within the nitrogen doped FLG, and thus poor charge/discharge characteristics of nitrogen doped FLG cathodes, is attributed to the reduced mobility of the chloroaluminate ions in the presence of nitrogen dopants.

AB We present a dc magnetization study of the critical phenomena of a manganite oxide La0.5Ca0.2Ag0.3MnO3 single crystal. Based on the assumption of a continuous (second order) manganite transition for our sample, we have determined the critical temperature TC = 264 K and the critical exponents beta = 0.18259 +/- 0.004 (beta: critical exponent for the temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization just below T-C), gamma = 0.81967 +/- 0.0. 029 (gamma: critical exponent for the inverse initial susceptibility just above T-C) and delta = 5.45 +/- 0.006 (delta: critical exponent for the Widom scaling relation (T = T-C)). From the field dependence of the magnetic entropy Delta S-M (vertical bar Delta S-M vertical bar proportional to H-n) and the relative cooling power (RCP) (RCP proportional to H boolean AND (1+(1/delta))), it was possible to evaluate the critical exponents of the magnetic phase transitions. Their values are in good agreement with those obtained from the critical exponents using a modified Arrott method.

AB The sol-gel method was used to synthesize Gd-SiO2-TiO2 composite photocatalysts. When the doping amounts of Si and Gd reached 9.1 mol% and 0.2 mol% respectively, the sample showed the optimal photocatalytic activity during the methylene blue (MB) degradation. When the calcination temperature was lower than 550 degrees C, Gd-SiO2-TiO2 photocatalyst has an anatase crystal structure. After doping of Si and Gd, the absorption wavelength thresholds of the sample approached 407 nm with the energy gap of 3.05 eV. Gd-SiO2-TiO2 photocatalyst showed the degradation efficiency about 90% to methylene blue (MB) under irradiation of simulated sunlight.

AB The adsorption of formic acid at smectite edges is investigated by DFT calculations using a model system based on pyrophyllite. Two cases are considered: (I) only the Si atoms are saturated with water molecules and the edges are exposed at the vacuum; (II) all the exposed Al cations are also saturated, and the edges are in equilibrium with an aqueous environment at 298 K. In the former case, adsorption is strong, and involves the formation of monodentate e bidentate species. Most of complexes have a negative formation energy also in wet conditions, which indicates the occurrence of stable aqueous interfaces.

AB A Smoluchowski-like equation is accounted for modeling the end-to-end looping kinetics. The phenomenon of looping is represented by a Dirac delta function sink of finite strength, placed at a point where the end-to-end distance between the monomers is zero. The sink is a physical quantity determining the possibility of looping at that point. We formulate two different rate constants, showing arrhenius type behaviour, which are obtained using the Green's function method. The long term rate constant depends directly on relaxation time and inversely on the bond length and for shorter polymer constructs, the end-to-end looping is faster than the longer one.

AB In this study, we present the changes in molecular solar thermal energy storage properties of the 3-amino-substituted-dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photo- and thermochromic system induced by physisorption of the system onto different nanoparticles. The calculations are carried out with a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical method where the molecules are described by density functional theory. The nanoparticles are represented using molecular mechanics.
   We find that both the energy storage capability and back reaction barrier for the system can be influenced by the nanoparticles. The influence depends on the type of nanoparticle, the orientation of the molecular system, and the molecule-cluster separation.

From an analysis of the vibronic emission spectrum of the 4-chloro-m-xylyl radical, the D-1 -> D-0 electronic transition energy was confirmed and the assignments of vibrational frequencies were accomplished in the ground state.

AB A J-dependent rotational Hamiltonian method is presented for analyzing rovibrational spectra. The method is designed to: assign/verify (J, K-a, K-c) and v quantum numbers to rovibrational energy levels; fit flexible rotor rotational constants to experimental/theoretical rovibrational energy level data; interpolate/extrapolate missing energy level data; assess the quality/consistency of the rovibrational data. The method resembles the standard "effective Hamiltonian" approach (Watson, 1967, 1968) except that the rotational constants themselves depend on J, which provides a number of advantages. The method is applied here to three molecules: HO2, H2O, and O-3.

AB Lithium, as one of the most important green energy, its exploitation and application attract great attention. Solvent extraction has been the most popular method among the techniques of extracting lithium in recent years. In this paper, many kinds of organic extractants, including EA, BA, MIBK, DIBK, N523 and TBP, were selected as organic extractants to investigate the influence on the lithium extraction from high mass ratio of Mg/Li aqueous solution. The results of extraction experiment indicated N523 and TBP were superior to the others on lithium extraction efficiency. Through the investigation of extraction equilibrium, the stoichiometry of the formed extracted complexes was determined. The Raman spectrum showed the FeCl4- formed in the extraction process. The FT-IR results presented the extraction reaction made the functional group of organic extractant shifting to lower wavenumbers, suggesting the new chemical bond form. Further, their solubility was investigated considering the application of organic extractants.

AB Multinuclear chain-like triazole Fe (II) complexes feature the spin-crossover effect, in which the Fe centers change from a low-spin (LS) ground state to a high-spin (HS) state. We determine force constants for bond stretching and bending of the HS and LS Fe atoms for use in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations by fitting to DFT data. We find that these force constants are independent of the chain length beyond the pentanuclear molecule. This allows us to model large molecules using molecular dynamics simulation. As test case we provide examples of the molecular dynamics induced by sudden spin switching a nonanuclear molecule.

AB Interaction energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy for (HF)(n)@C-60, n = 1-4 were calculated using the density functional theoretic method (DFT(MN15)/aug-cc-pVTZ//aug-cc-pVDZ). The interaction energy was found to be - 14.9 kcal/mol for HF@C-60 and - 5.1 kcal/mol for (HF)(2)@C-60. The HF dimer has the two HF molecules forming an L-shaped structure with an extremely short hydrogen bond. While the trimer retains its hydrogen bonded triangular shape inside the cage, the tetramer has the fluorine atoms arranged in a pyramidal shape. There is an elongation of the HF bond length and a significant red shift in the H-F vibrational frequency in all cases.

AB We predict SO2-sensing performance of Pd, Ag, and Au, Pt -doped MoSe2 monolayer by the density functional theory (DFT). The results demonstrate that the adsorption of SO2 gas molecule on the MoSe2 is energetically favorable, which gives rise to the most stable configurations. Besides, the SO2 gas molecule are physisorbed on the pristine MoSe2 monolayer surface due to the weak interface combination, with metal doping, the adsorption energy and chemical adsorption are all enhanced. Most notably, the meatal doped MoSe2 monolayer might be a good candidate for low-cost, highly active, and stable catalysts and gas sensors, providing an avenue to facilitate the design of high active MoSe2-based two-dimensional gas sensors.

AB Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) gallium (Gaq3) is an alternative compound to tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) which is an organic light emitting diode (OLED) material. The performance of Gaq3 incorporated into OLEDs has been seen to be superior compared to that of Alq3-based ones but the OLED properties of a substituted Gaq3 complex has been not studied yet. For this reason, the OLED performances of Gaq3 and its derivatives were investigated theoretically. Gaq3, functionalized Gaq3 derivatives and their dimers were designed. While monomer calculations were performed on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, dimer computations were carried out on the B3LYP/TZP level. The reorganization energies (lambda e and lambda h), ionization potentials and electron affinities (adiabatic and vertical), energy gaps, effective transfer integrals (Je and Jh) and charge transfer rates (Ke and Kh) of the aforementioned molecules were calculated. Based on these parameters, the OLED behaviors of the compounds were estimated.

AB Density functional theory calculations were performed with M06-2X/6-31 + G(d) to examine the structural and spectral features of sparfloxacin and its boron complexes and to reveal their non-linear optical and biological activities. The molecular electrostatic potential analysis was carried out on the deprotonated sparfloxacin system using ESP charge analyses to examine the surface reactivity and to show. Our results suggest that quantum chemical parameter rankings were indicated that dibromosparfloxacinateboron(III) complex could be a good candidate for NLO applications. Furthermore, molecular docking calculations between boron complexes and proteins (ID: 2ITN and 2ITV) were performed. As a result, the hydrogen bond (-F atom - "A-745: LYS-2HZ") between complex (1) and 2ITN was determined. The interaction energies between difluorosparfloxacinateboron (I) and target proteins (2ITN and 2ITV) were calculated as - 473.4 and - 335.9 kJ mol(-1), respectively. This complex was found as the best drug candidate for lung cancer.

AB Energy transfer plays an important role in the preservation and application of energetic molecules. An atomic-level understanding is necessary to delineate the chemical reaction mechanism, aiming at the possible modulation of related processes. In this work, by exciting the C-H stretching motion of nitromethanes, we studied intermolecular vibrational energy transfer by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD). It was observed for the first time that intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) can be slower than intermolecular energy transfer in this system. More importantly, the energy-transfer process could lead to conformational rearrange. These findings offer a guidance for modulating the energy-transfer process and provide a theoretical basis for better understanding intermolecular vibrational energy transfer in energetic systems.

AB The evaporation of R32/R1234yf nanodroplets on smooth substrates was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. A new method was proposed to locate the interface between vapor and liquid molecules. Results show that during evaporation, the dynamic contact angle of R32 reduces continuously, and that of the R32/R1234yf mixture decreases to a certain extent and then remains relatively constant. As the mole fraction of R1234yf increases, the evaporation rate tends to be slower and the number of evaporated molecules decreases, leading to R1234yf-hindered evaporation. R1234yf significantly influences evaporation due to its preferential adsorption on the surface compared with R32.

Focusing on the anisotropy of a GNR validated by experiment and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculation, this study addressed three typical scenarios of LMP1-TRAF3 with a PEGylated GNR. The structure of LMP1-TRAF3 backbone, specifically the individual LMP1, changes with a PEGylated GNR included, and the variation is more significant along longitudinal axis than its transversal counterpart. Moreover, a heating-up GNR gains a more salient variation of LMP1 structure.

AB There remains a significant challenge to analyze the complex combustion reaction intermediates of hydrocarbon fuels at high temperatures. Herein, a model that simulates the fine electronic spectra of several typical combustion hydrocarbon intermediates, such as C-2*, CN*, OH*, and CH* radicals, is presented. The model incorporates temperature effects into an emission coefficient expression to obtain accurate electronic spectra. The theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the obtained experimental spectra only after taking into account the temperature effects. The model herein is applicable for identifying complex hydrocarbon fuel combustion intermediates, and thus, works towards establishing detailed combustion reaction mechanisms.

AB Stable metal clusters with high coordination numbers (N > 12) are scarce. In this paper, series of seventeen-coordinate metal clusters M@Li-17 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y) are proposed, where the lithium atoms compose the outer cage and the hetero-atom is centered. The unique structure is located as a low energy isomer by particle swarm optimisation algorithm. With the geometric and electronic shell closures, the high stability of M@Li-17 (M = Sc, Y) is predictable. For the 19-electron M@Li-17 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba), the electronic configurations are 1S(2)1P(6)1D(10)2S(alpha)(1)2S(beta)(0), which can obtain their stability by forming a low magnetic moment of 1 mu(B).

AB Based on density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function technique, we design planar four-coordinate Fe complexes-based molecular spin caloritronic devices with carbon nanotube bridges and electrodes, and investigate their spin caloritronic transport properties. The results show the thermally-driven spin currents are strongly dependent on the external magnetic field modulation. The underlying mechanisms are elucidated by Fermi-Dirac distribution function, spin-resolved transmission spectra, current spectra, spatial distributions of molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian orbitals. On the basis of these interesting spin caloritronic transport properties, we further propose the thermal spin molecular Boolean logic gates, such as AND, NOT, XOR and OR.

   Cytokine imbalance; Cytokine levels
ID LOCI
AB Background-Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD) occurs almost a decade earlier in the South Asian population as compared to the West. Inclusion of genetic information can prove to be a robust measure to improve early risk prediction of PCAD. Aim was to estimate the genotypic distribution and risk allele frequencies of 13 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) risk Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in loci identified by the CARDloGRAMplusC4D consortium namely MIA3 rs17465637; 9p21 rs10757274; CXCL12 rs1746048; APOA5 rs662799; APOB rs1042031; LPA rs3798220; LPA 10455872; MRAS rs9818870; LPL rs328; SORT1 rs646776; PCSK9 rs11591147; APOE rs429358; APOE rs7412 in Pakistani PCAD patients and controls. Moreover, the differential serum cytokine levels (IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-18:IL-10 & TNF-alpha:IL-10 ratios) with respect to the genotypic distribution of these selected SNPs were determined.
   Material and methods: The case-control study was carried out in National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Genetics Institute, University College London, UK. Subjects (n = 340) with > 70% stenosis in at least a single major coronary artery on angiography were taken as PCAD cases along with 310 angiographically verified controls. ELISA was performed for measuring the concentrations of serum IL18, TNFA, IL6 and IL10. Genotyping was done using TAQMAN and KASPar assays.
   Results: The risk allele frequencies (RAF) of APOE rs7412, CXCL12 rs1746048, 9p21 rs10757274, MIA3 rs17465637 and SORT1 rs646776 were significantly higher in the PCAD cases as compared to the controls. APOE rs429358 had the greatest influence among the selected GWAS/CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium CAD risk SNPs by significantly altering the serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-10 and TNF-alpha:IL-10 ratio. It was followed by APOE rs7412 and CXCL12 rs1746048 which significantly altered the serum levels of IL-18; TNF-alpha and IL-18; IL-18:IL-10 ratio respectively. The cytokine imbalance denoted by IL-18:IL-10 was significantly higher in the risk allele carriers MIA3 rs17465637 and CXCL12 rs1746048 while TNF-alpha:IL-10 ratio was significantly raised in the risk allele carriers of APOE rs429358; MRAS rs9818870 and LPL rs328.
   Conclusion: The association of the selected SNPs with differential serum cytokine levels especially the cytokine imbalance points towards their potential causal role in the immune inflammatory pathogenic pathway of PCAD.

AB Platelets are inflammatory anuclear cells with a well-established role in the development and manifestation of atherosclerosis. Activated platelets secrete a plethora of chemokines including CXCL4 or platelet factor 4 (PF4), CCL5, CXCL12 or stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha), CXCL16 and others, which initiate or promote local inflammatory processes at sites of vascular injury. These processes are mainly mediated by the recruitment of circulating haematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, monocytes or lymphocytes on vascular wall. Under acute ischemic conditions platelet-derived chemokines may promote the mobilization of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells and their homing at lesion sites. This review focuses on the role of platelet-derived chemokines in inflammation and atherosclerosis. Further, we discuss the clinical value of plasma levels of chemokines in the prognosis of atherosclerotic heart disease.

AB The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the major metabolic route of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in the pathway, as well as other enzymes in the pathway, have been shown to be highly regulated by cytokines. Hence, the KP has been implicated in several pathologic conditions, including infectious diseases, psychiatric disorders, malignancies, and autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Additionally, recent studies have linked the KP with atherosclerosis, suggesting that Trp metabolism could play an essential role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the vascular wall. This review summarizes experimental and clinical evidence of the interplay between cytokines and the KP and the potential role of the KP in cardiovascular diseases.

AB Atherosclerosis is considered an inflammatory disease of the arterial wall. Monocytes and monocyte-derived cells (most often termed macrophages) play an essential role in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, as they take up lipids leading to subsequent foam cell formation accompanied by release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, platelets have been discovered to represent an important cell type mediating inflammatory and immune processes in atherogenesis, mainly by secreting chemokines, which are stored in the platelets' alpha granules, upon platelet activation. Therefore, the interaction between monocyte-derived cells and platelets is of exceptional importance. In this review, we specifically focus on the chemokine (platelet factor-4, PF4) and its effects on monocytes and monocyte-derived cells. By formation of heterodimers dimers and -oligomers with CCL5, CXCL4 induces binding of monocytes cells to endothelial cell and thereby promotes diapedesis of monocytes into the subendothelial space. CXCL4 also affects the differentiation of monocytes as it induces a specific macrophage phenotype, which we suggested to term "M4". For example, CXCL4-induced macrophages irreversibly lose the hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger receptor CD163. The combination of CD68, S100A8, and MMP7 turned out to reliably identify M4 macrophages both in vitro and in vivo within atherosclerotic lesions. In human atherosclerotic plaques, M4 macrophages are predominantly present in the adventitia and the intima and their prevalence is associated with plaque instability suggesting that they are a marker of pro-inflammatory activity. Overall, CXCL4-induced M4 macrophages may represent a target for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in human atherosclerotic disease.

AB S100A12 is a member of the S100 family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins and have a variety of intracellular and extracellular activities. It exerts its proinflammatory effects by binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor that acts as a fatty acid transporter. Both S100A12 and CD36 are implicated in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. It has recently been demonstrated that S100A12 binds with high affinity to CD36. On the other hand, RAGE and TLR4 play a key role in the regulation of CD36 expression. These observations point to the fact that S100A12 is an interesting molecular target for the development of therapeutics. This Cytokine stimulus will focus on the possible mechanisms of S100A12-CD36 axis in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

AB Background and aims: IL-27 is an immunoregulatory cytokine belonging to the IL-6/IL-12 family that was found to be elevated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. We investigated whether IL-27 is related to post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and long-term prognosis in this patient group.
   Methods: We included 524 ACS patients, defined as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina (UA). A subgroup of 107 patients donated blood samples 6 weeks after the index event, and underwent a follow-up echocardiographical examination at 1 year. We measured plasma levels of IL-27, high sensitivity troponin T (hsTNT), C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and cystatin C at baseline and in the 6-week samples. The median follow-up period of the cohort was 2.2 years.
   Results: The incidence of the combined end-point of AMI and cardiovascular death was higher in patients with plasma IL-27 within the top two tertiles both at baseline and after 6 weeks. After correction for cardiovascular risk factors, medication, hsTNT, hsCRP, and eGFR, patients with baseline IL-27 levels within the highest tertile had a significantly elevated risk for the combined end-point compared with the lowest tertile (hazard ratio 2.70, 95% CI 1.06-6.90, p =.038). Additionally, higher baseline IL-27 levels were associated with deleterious left ventricular remodeling and deterioration of systolic and diastolic function during the first year of follow-up.
   Conclusions: Elevated IL-27 at the time of an ACS is independently related to impaired cardiac function and worse long-term prognosis. Our data warrants further mechanistic studies to elucidate the involvement of IL-27 in cardiac repair and remodeling after ACS.

AB Background: Corrective surgery for congenital heart defects is known to trigger a severe immune reaction. There has been extensive research on the effects of inflammation after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Interestingly, monocytes are observed to be non-responsive to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) under these conditions, indicating a state of immunodepression, which lays the ground for second hit infections after cardiosurgery with CPB.
   Objectives: The aim of this prospective study was to analyze immunodepression after pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass and to differentiate the effects of monocytic anergy on postoperative outcome.
   Methods: In a prospective trial, we quantified the immune responses in 20 pediatric patients (median age 4.9 months, range 2.3-38.2 months; median weight 7.2 kg, range 5.2-11.7 kg) with congenital ventricular septal defect undergoing heart surgery with CPB. Ex vivo LPS-induced protein expression of IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 was measured before (T1), immediately after (T2) and 4 h after (T3) cardiopulmonary bypass surgery using Luminex technology.
   Results: The innate immune system responds to CPB with an almost complete depression of monocytic function. Inflammatory IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-y are completely suppressed. IL-10, IL-1Ra and MCP-1 are still produced during suppression with IL-1Ra being overly secreted during reversion. Suppression of TNF-alpha expression after LPS-stimulation correlates closely with longer mechanical ventilation time (r = -0.619, p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: Cardiosurgery with CPB causes a state of immunodepression making pediatric patients more vulnerable to second hit infections. MCP-1, IL-10, and IL-1R play an important role in monocyte recovery, eventually permitting new therapeutic options for controlling immunodepression and inflammation. Standardized glucocorticoid therapy should be evaluated carefully for each individual patient.

AB IL-35 is a new anti-inflammatory cytokine identified in 2007, which inhibits inflammation and immune responses by inducing regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells and suppressing effector T cells and macrophages. The unique initiator and effector anti-inflammatory properties of IL-35 bring tremendous interest in investigating its role during cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, in which inflammatory processes are firmly established as central to its development and complications. In this review, we update recent understanding of how IL-35 is produced and regulated in the cells. In addition, we outline the signaling pathways affected by IL-35 in different cell types. Furthermore, we summarize the roles of IL-35 in atherosclerosis, diabetes, and sepsis. We propose a new working model that IL-35 and its receptors are novel homeostasis-associated molecular pattern (HAMP) and HAMP receptors, respectively, which explains the complex nature of IL-35 signaling as an anti-inflammatory initiator, effector and blocker. Thorough understanding of this topic is significant towards development of new anti-inflammatory therapies against CVDs and other diseases. (total words: 163)

AB The endothelial chemokine CXC motif ligand 16 (CXCL16) is involved in the recruitment and firm adhesion of CXCR6(+) cells to the atherosclerosis-prone aortic vessel wall. Recently we showed that CXCR6(+) platelets from flowing blood attach to CXCL16 expressed by activated endothelium on the luminal side of the blood vessel. With this study we supplement these findings with the observation that platelets bound to the inflamed endothelium are presenting CXCR6 to CXCL16-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and, thus, are mediating an increased adhesion of PBMCs to the arterial wall. Furthermore we identified endothelial CXCL16 as an important adhesion molecule promoting the firm adhesion of CXCR6-positive PBMCs to inflamed endothelium. Our results demonstrate that endothelial CXCL16 as well as platelet CXCR6 are acting as potent PBMC-adhesion ligands, inducing PBMC-adhesion to the atherosclerosis-prone vessel wall and thus promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.

AB IL-37 is a member of the IL-1 family, but unlike most other members of this family of cytokines, it has wide-ranging anti-inflammatory properties. Initially shown to bind IL-18 binding protein and prevent IL-18-mediated inflammation, its known role has been expanded to include distinct pathways, both intracellular involving the transcription factor Smad3, and extracellular via binding to the orphan receptor IL-1R8. A number of recent publications investigating the role of IL-37 in atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease have revealed promising therapeutic value of the cytokine. Although research concerning the role of IL-37 and its mechanism in atherosclerosis is relatively scant, there are a number of well-known atherosclerotic processes that this cytokine can mediate with the potential of modulating the disease progression itself. This review will probe in detail the effects of IL-37 on important pathological processes such as inflammation, dysregulated lipid metabolism, and apoptosis, by analyzing existing data as well as exploring the potential of this cytokine to influence these properties.

AB This review summarizes the current data on the interleukin (IL)-17A pathway in experimental atherosclerosis and clinical data.
   IL-17A is a prominent cytokine for early T cell response produced by both innate and adaptive leukocytes. In atherosclerosis, increased total IL-17A levels and expression in CD4(+) T helper and gamma delta T cells have been demonstrated. Cytokines including IL-6 and TGF beta that increase IL-17A expression are elevated. Many other factors such as lipids, glucose and sodium chloride concentrations as well as vitamins and arylhydrocarbon receptor agonists that promote IL-17A expression are closely associated with cardiovascular risk in the human population. In acute inflammation models, IL-17A mediates innate leukocyte recruitment of both neutrophils and monocytes. In atherosclerosis, IL-17A increased aortic macrophage and T cell infiltration in most models. Secondary recruitment effects via the endothelium and according to recent data also pericytes have been demonstrated. IL-17 receptor A is highly expressed on monocytes and direct effects have been reported as well. Beyond leukocyte accumulation, IL-17A may affect other factors of plaque formation such as endothelial function, and according to some reports, fibrous cap formation and vascular relaxation with an increase in blood pressure. Anti-IL-17A agents are now available for clinical use. Cardiovascular side effect profiles are benign at this point.
   IL-17A appears to be a differential regulator of atherosclerosis and its effects in mouse models suggest that its modulation may have contradictory effects on plaque size and possibly stability in different patient populations.

AB The interleukin (IL)-1 family is a group of cytokines crucially involved in regulating immune responses to infectious challenges and sterile insults. The family consists of the eponymous pair IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-18, IL-33, IL-37, IL-38, and several isoforms of IL-36. In addition, two endogenous inhibitors of functional receptor binding, IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-36Ra complete the family. To gain biological activity IL-1 beta and IL-18 require processing by the protease caspase-1 which is associated with the multi-protein complex inflammasome. Numerous clinical association studies and experimental approaches have implicated members of the IL-1 family, their receptors, or component of the processing machinery in underlying processes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pro-inflammatory and disease-modulating role of the IL-1 family in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, aneurysm, stroke, and other CVDs. We discuss clinical evidence, experimental approaches and lastly lend a perspective on currently developing therapeutic strategies involving the IL-1 family in CVD.

AB Despite advances in prevention and treatment, vascular diseases continue to account for significant morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Incidence is expected to worsen as the number of patients with common co-morbidities linked with atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as obesity and diabetes, continues to increase, reaching epidemic proportions. Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven vascular inflammatory disease involving multiple cell types in various stages of inflammation, activation, apoptosis, and necrosis. One commonality among these cell types is that they are activated and communicate with each other in a paracrine fashion via a complex network of cytokines. Cytokines mediate atherogenesis by stimulating expression of numerous proteins necessary for induction of a host of cellular responses, including inflammation, extravasation, proliferation, apoptosis, and matrix production. Cytokine expression is regulated by a number of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In this context, proteins that control and fine-tune cytokine expression can be considered key players in development of atherosclerosis and also represent targets for rational drug therapy to combat this disease. This review will describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive atherosclerotic plaque progression and present key cytokines that participate in this process. We will also describe RNA binding proteins that mediate cytokine mRNA stability and regulate cytokine abundance. Identification and characterization of the cytokines and proteins that regulate their abundance are essential to our ability to identify therapeutic approaches to ameliorate atherosclerotic vascular disease.

AB Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play a central role in the development and functional maturation of immune cells besides having pleiotropic effects on cells of the vascular wall. The production of CSFs is induced by multiple atherogenic and inflammatory stimuli and their expression levels are often correlated positively with advanced atherosclerotic plaques and adverse cardiovascular events in humans suggesting that CSFs play a critical role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis progression. Interestingly, recombinant CSFs as well as anti-CSFs are being increasingly used for diverse clinical indications. However, the effect of these novel therapeutics on atherosclerotic plaque progression is not well understood. Herein, we summarize the currently available literature on the complex role of CSFs in various stages of atherosclerosis and emphasize the necessity for conducting further mechanistic studies in animal models of atherosclerosis as well as the need for evaluating the cardiovascular safety of CSF-based therapies in humans.

AB Objectives: Little is known about the role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in young patients. The aims of this study were to compare serum levels of adipokines and expression of adipokines in peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with premature coronary artery disease (CAD), metabolic syndrome and healthy individuals.
   Design and methods: Sixty-five patients with premature CAD (men 18-45 years old and women 18-55 years old) formed the study group. The control groups were 75 patients with metabolic syndrome and 50 healthy individuals. For each group, RNA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes was determined for 24 different adipokines and 11 adipokines were examined in serum.
   Results: In individuals with CAD, serum visfatin levels were significantly higher than in metabolic syndrome and healthy controls (2.3 vs. 1.6 vs. 0.7 mu g/L, P < 0.001) while both omentin-1 (92.9 vs. 587.0 vs. 552.3 mu g/L, P < 0.001) and ZAG2 (45.5 vs. 72.5 vs. 77.1 mg/L, P < 0.001) levels were lower. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis for testing the validity of these adipokines in the diagnosis of CAD compared to control groups provided the following areas under the curve (AUC): omentin-1 AUC 0.97 (cut-off <= 222 mu g/L), ZAG2 AUC 0.89 (cut-off <= 51.7 mg/L) and visfatin AUC 0.74 (cut-off >= 1.0 mu g/L) (P < 0.001 in all cases). Visfatin and omentin-1 serum levels did not differ between the acute phase of myocardial infarction and the chronic phase of CAD. In patients with CAD, we found no significant relation between mRNA expression and adipokine concentration.
   Conclusion: Serum omentin-1, visfatin and ZAG2 could serve as biomarkers of premature CAD in young apparently healthy people.

TI IL-8 negatively regulates ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux via

AB Objective: Previous studies suggest that IL-8 has an important role in the regulation of cholesterol efflux, but whether miRNAs are involved in this process is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore whether IL-8 promotes cholesterol accumulation by enhancing miR-183 expression in macrophages and its underlying mechanism.
   Methods and results: Treatment of THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells with IL-8 decreased ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Using bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we found that miR-183 was highly conserved during evolution and directly inhibited ABCA1 protein and mRNA expression by targeting ABCA1 3'UTR. MiR-183 directly regulated endogenous ABCA1 expression levels. Furthermore, IL-8 enhanced the expression of miR-183 and decrease ABCA1 expression. Cholesterol transport assays confirmed that IL-8 dramatically inhibited apolipoprotein Al-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux by increasing miR-183 expression. In contrast, treatment with anti-IL-8 antibody reversed these effects.
   Conclusion: IL-8 enhances the expression of miR-183, which then inhibits ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Our studies suggest that the IL-8-miR-183-ABCA1 axis may play an intermediary role in the development of atherosclerosis.

AB Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is an important inducer of myocarditis, which, in susceptible individuals, can chronify and eventually lead to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The respective mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we analyzed expression of the TRAF6 gene, encoding TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a signal transduction scaffold protein that acts downstream of cytokine receptors, in heart tissue of susceptible and non-susceptible mouse strains. We found that after infection, TRAF6 expression was upregulated in both non-susceptible C57BL/6 wildtype and susceptible A.BY/SnJ and C57BL/6-TLR3 (-/-) mice, however, to different degrees. In infected HeLa cells, we also found moderately elevated TRAF6 levels after infection, in addition, activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), which can be activated downstream of TRAF6, was strongly enhanced in infected cells. To functionally analyze the role of TRAF6 with regard to infection progression, TRAF6 expression was knocked down in cultured HeLa cells using specific siRNAs. We found that reduction of TRAF6 expression had no effect on NF kappa B activation in response to infection. Taken together, our data suggest that CVB3 infection enhances TRAF6 levels, however, this induction might not be necessary for infection-induced NF kappa B activation.

AB Cytokines of the Interleukin (IL)-12 family, consisting of IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35, are important regulators in (chronic) inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, but also in cardiovascular diseases. Cytokines of the IL-12 family consist of two subunits and are known for their regulatory functions in the immunologic response, more specifically in the regulation and differentiation of T-helper (Th) cells such as Th1 and Th17 cells. Binding of these cytokines to its specific heterodimeric receptor results in the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling. Despite similarities in structure, the members of the IL-12 family have diverse, both pro and anti-inflammatory, effects and functions. Because of the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-12 cytokine family members on immune responses, the IL-12 cytokines have been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, but also in acute cardiovascular syndromes such as myocardial infarction and stroke. For example, patients suffering from cardiovascular disease display increased blood levels of IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27, while decreased IL-35 levels have been linked to a lower cardiovascular risk. In this review, we aim to highlight the current understandings of the IL-12 cytokine family and its specific family members to cardiovascular diseases, including both clinical and experimental studies. We will also discuss the potential of these cytokines as a biomarker in acute cardiovascular syndromes.

AB Objective: Irisin is a 112-amino acid peptide found in rat and human skeletal muscle after exercise. Previous studies had suggested that higher circulating irisin levels were associated with an increased risk of vascular atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we determined irisin levels in serum, and investigated their associations with functional outcomes in a 3-month follow-up study in Chinese patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
   Methods: From September 2015 to December 2016, consecutive first-ever AIS patients admitted to the Department of Emergency of our hospital were identified. Serum irisin levels were measured at admission. Functional impairment was evaluated at discharge using the modified Rankin scale. The levels of irisin were expressed as median and interquartile ranges [IQR].
   Results: The irisin level was obtained in 324 patients (97.6%) with a median value of 291.2 ng/ml (IQR: 214.1-404.2 ng/ml). There were significantly negative correlations between levels of irisin and NHISS (r = 0.272; P < 0.001) and BMI (r = 0.193; P = 0.003). A poor functional outcome was found in 99 patients (30.6%; 95%CI: 25.5-35.6%). The poor functional outcome distribution across the irisin quartiles ranged between 51.9% (first quartile: Q1) to 12.4% (fourth quartile: Q4). In a multivariate model using the Q1 of irisin vs. Q2-4 together with the clinical variables, the marker displayed prognostic information and increased risk of poor outcomes by 94% (OR for Q1, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19-3.42]; P = 0.018) and mortality 66% (OR for Q1, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.11-3.07]; P = 0.009). In addition, a model containing known risk factors plus irisin compared with a model containing known risk factors without irisin showed a greater discriminatory ability to predict poor outcomes (P = 0.01) and mortality (P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: A low serum irisin level is a predictor of poor early functional outcome in ischemic stroke patients. The underlying mechanisms of these associations remain to be investigated.

AB Mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by the sol-gel method were impregnated with different iron contents (0.0125, 0.025, 0.1, 1.0 wt%). The samples were characterized by XRD, UV-Vis DR, N-2 adsorption/desorption, SEM and TEM. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated in terms of the degradation and mineralization of acid orange 7 (AO7) in aqueous solution under UV-Vis and visible radiation. An iron loading of 0.1 wt% allowed enhance the photocatalytic performance. This behavior is attributed to the Fe3+ ions finely dispersed on the titania surface, whose presence decrease the band gap and could stabilize the separation between the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.

AB A nutrient-loading mesocosm study was conducted on baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) seedlings and a field study was conducted on baldcypress seedling diameter increase at five assimilation wetlands. Nitrogen additions ranged from 0 to 400 g N m(-2)yr(-1). Dependent variables included aboveand belowground biomass production, root to shoot ratio, and wood density. Aboveground biomass production increased steadily to the 400 g N m(-2)yr(-1) loading rate for both species, whereas belowground biomass production and root to shoot ratio increased to the 100 g N m(-2)yr(-1) loading rate then decreased slightly. Wood density for N. aquatica was higher than T. distichum and wood density for both species was largely unaffected by nutrient loading rate. Diameter increase for seedlings in the five assimilation wetlands averaged from 1.1 to 2.5 cm yr(-1) and was about ten times higher at all sites than that of nearby natural swamps. In all, high rates of nutrient loading did not negatively affect growth of either species.

AB The term 'assimilation wetland' has been applied to natural wetlands in Louisiana into which disinfected, secondarily treated municipal effluent is discharged with the dual purpose of improving regional water quality and enhancing vegetation productivity and soil accretion. Some municipalities began discharging treated effluent into wetlands prior to state regulations, which began in 1992. Here we review data and observations from five assimilation wetlands in the Mississippi River Delta receiving discharge of treated effluent for 26-70 years. In addition, we examine two adjacent forested wetlands, one that receives periodic Mississippi River input and one that does not. Information from these sites provides insight into how long-term nutrient input impacts coastal wetlands. Analysis of tree-ring, leaf litter, accretion, and water quality data shows that input of freshwater containing nutrients and sediments leads to enhanced wetland productivity and soil accretion via increased organic matter burial. In addition, long-term data indicate that assimilation wetlands continue to be nutrient sinks even after decades of effluent discharge, with both nitrogen and phosphorus reduced to background levels. Collectively, these data demonstrate that wetlands benefit from long-term discharge of treated municipal effluent. Properly managed wetland assimilation systems can function for long periods and lead to enhancement of degrading wetland communities in coastal Louisiana.

TI Municipal wastewater treatment costs with an emphasis on assimilation
   wetlands in the Louisiana coastal zone
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Wetland assimilation; Wastewater treatment costs; Secondary treatment;
   Tertiary treatment
ID RECOVERY; EFFLUENT; ENERGY; SYSTEM; DELTA
AB In recent decades, water quality standards for wastewater treatment have become more stringent, increasing costs and energy required to reduce pollutants. Wetland assimilation is a low-cost and low-energy alternative to traditional tertiary wastewater treatment where secondarily treated and disinfected municipal effluent is discharged primarily into freshwater forested wetlands in coastal Louisiana. In this paper, costs per gallon of treatment capacity for conventional secondary and tertiary treatment were compared to those for assimilation wetlands. Cost analysis reports were used to determine costs per gallon of treatment capacity for conventional wastewater treatment facilities, including costs for conveyance between the collection system and the assimilation wetland site, and between the treatment and disposal sites if they could not be co-located. Capital and operation and maintenance costs were considered. Because all wastewater treatment plants are required to treat at least to secondary standards, costs for primary and secondary treatment were combined. If necessary, these costs were adjusted for inflation to 2017 dollars using an average inflation rate of 2.19 percent and a cumulative inflation rate of 50.84 percent. To determine costs per gallon of treatment capacity for assimilation wetlands, actual costs provided by the project engineer were used when available. To simulate the future costs of facility construction and compare the replacement costs of conventional secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment facilities and treatment wetlands in the context of energy prices, U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) data for the price index for inputs to construction were used, as were the Energy Information Administration (EIA) data for the price of crude oil to model future wastewater treatment plant construction and operation costs. The cost for the Mandeville assimilation wetland included $1 million for the price of the land. Future costs of treatment facility construction and operation were modeled relative to average price of construction inputs between 1998 and 2015 using the projected price of crude oil. When treatment costs were compared among secondary, tertiary, and assimilation wetlands, mean cost for assimilation wetlands was $0.60 per gallon (> 1 MGD capacity) compared to $4.90 and $6.50 per gallon for secondary and tertiary treatment, respectively. The lower total costs and energy requirements for assimilation wetlands result in lower variability in the price of construction and operation. Wetland assimilation is more economical than conventional wastewater treatment, especially compared to advanced secondary and tertiary treatment. It is likely that energy costs will increase significantly in coming decades. Because conventional secondary and tertiary treatment are energy intensive, increases in energy costs will significantly increase the costs of these treatment systems. Treatment systems that combine lower technology (e.g., oxidation ponds) secondary treatment with wetland assimilation are less likely to be impacted by rising energy costs than traditional wastewater treatment.

AB This study applied the static chamber method to evaluate the CO2 fluxes from December 2013 to October 2014 in the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China. The study area was divided into Spartina alterniflora flat, Phragmites australis flat, Suaeda salsa flat and mud flat. Results showed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) presented obviously temporal and spatial variations during growing season, and slight fluctuation in non-growing season. Vegetated flats (S. alterniflora flat, P. australis flat and S. salsa flat) acted as CO2 sinks during growing season and CO2 sources during non-growing season; while mud flat acted as a CO2 sink through the entire period. Over the growing season, the estimated total NEE were -1202.83 g CO2 m(-2) in S. alterniflora flat, - 1129.16 g CO2 m(-2) in P. australis flat and -237.43 g CO2 m(-2) in S. salsa flat, respectively. Daytime NEE were significantly exponential related to light intensity in S. alterniflora flat and P. australis flat; whereas no overt exponential relationship was found between these two factors in S. salsa flat. In P. australis flat, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) in growing season were estimated to be 2874.05 and 1744.89 g CO2 m(-2), respectively; R-eco was significantly exponential related to air temperature and soil temperature at different depths, among which soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm was the most remarkable; temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco ranged from 2.72 to 3.67. Above ground biomass of P. australis over the entire growing season showed nonlinear relationships with NEE, GPP, and R-eco; while it showed significant linear relationships with these three factors during early and peak growing season. As for the mud flat acing as a CO2 sink, it is supposed to be caused by inorganic process, however the mechanism is not definite. Further research on the long-term and complete observations of CO2 exchange at the mud flat-atmosphere interface is necessary.

AB Constructed, and to a lesser extent, natural wetlands are increasingly used to treat treated wastewater effluent from small municipalities and industries. Wetland treatment efficiency evaluation typically involves comparison of solute inflow and outflow concentrations, or estimation of the export of nutrients per unit wetland area. A more holistic approach, which evaluated water and solute mass balances, in addition to seasonal changes in water quality, yielded an improved understanding of where nutrient storage occurred, long-term wetland treatment capabilities, and downstream water quality impacts of a flooded natural wetland receiving waste-water. The lowest solute concentrations in the flooded wetland were observed soon after ephemeral creek flow in the spring, increasing concentrations over the summer attributed to evaporation, and the highest concentrations under winter ice. Chloride accumulation in shoreline sediments was attributed to transpiration pumping, and high salt and phosphorus accumulation in lake and shoreline sediments were a long-term concern at Frank Lake. Limited historic data suggested water quality impacts on the receiving watershed, the Little Bow River, were significant, with about 80, 230, and 20 times increased mass fluxes for chloride, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen, respectively. The flooded wetland, Frank Lake, is not a sustainable approach to wastewater effluent treatment in its current form.

ID RETENTION
AB Vertical-flow constructed wetlands remove pollutants from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and have been in operation for approximately 20 years in Germany. More than 150 sites are currently operated in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, with most of them constructed according to the same guidelines. This number provides an adequate statistical population to evaluate the treatment efficiency of this design; however, most available data have not been collected in a standardized way.
   This study presents the results from a survey amongst operators of these plants, who provided long-term data for 24 sites. It also describes a statistical approach to harmonizing the data and evaluating the removal efficiencies of wastewater pollutants while considering errors and uncertainties with a Monte Carlo simulation. This method makes it possible to harmonize data from surveys and to draw generalized conclusions on the treatment efficiency of large-scale facilities. In this study, the evaluation could be adapted for the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and total phosphorus.

AB Over the past decades, extensive marshlands had been converted to paddy fields in the Sanjiang Plain, China; however, the effect of this land use change on ecosystem carbon budget is still much uncertainty. Valuation has been proved to have a great role for carbon budget characterizing directly. This study assessed carbon budget changes based on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration before and after marshlands conversion to paddy fields. By remote sensing data interpretation, the area of marshlands converted to paddy fields between 1982 and 2010 was 1.31 x 10(5) ha at ArcGIS 10.2.1 software environment. We used the ecosystem carbon sequestration and the total greenhouse gas emissions to analyze ecosystem carbon budget, and found that carbon budget of marshlands before conversion (37.75 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq) was significantly higher than that of their converted into paddy fields (22.31 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq) in the Sanjiang Plain, with the loss of 15.44 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq. By carbon tax payment, we further assessed that the economic loss of carbon budget caused by the marshlands conversion in the Sanjiang Plain was up to 8.64 x 10(8) Yuan. It can provide the reference for wetland ecosystem especially ecosystem service conservation.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are recognized as a useful method to reduce sediment and nutrient loading from arable land to surface waters. Automatic monitoring systems with continuously measuring sensors were utilized for several years to obtain accurate, up-to-date information of the retention performance of two differently dimensioned and located CWs in agricultural catchments in southern Finland. Here, results derived from the data recorded by the sensors measuring height, turbidity and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration of the water entering and exiting the Hovi (established in 1998) and Rantamo-Seitteli (est. in 2009) CWs are presented. Study periods ended in autumn 2014 and they lasted 7 years at Hovi and 4.5 years at Rantamo-Seitteli.
   Annual total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) per cent retentions were much higher in the older, more generously dimensioned (CW-to-catchment area ratio 5%) Hovi CW (TSS 74%, TP 58% and TN 54% on average during 7 years) than in the newer, more scantly dimensioned (CW-to-catchment area ratio 1.3%) Rantamo-Seitteli CW (TSS 7%, TP 12% and TN 9% on average during 4.5 years). Moreover, the annual retentions of the Rantamo-Seitteli CW appeared to decrease with increasing runoff, while the retentions at Hovi were not affected by runoff fluctuations. In terms of TSS and TP retentions in the Hovi CW, they were in this study at similar levels to those observed shortly after the establishment of the CW. Meanwhile, the retention of dissolved nutrient fractions, i.e. NO3-N and dissolved reactive P (DRP, based on water sampling) at Hovi were clearly higher in this than in the previous study. The results confirm the importance of CW dimensioning and locating near the sources of loading, and refer to improved performance as CWs get older with increasing vegetation and biological activity.
   Our experiences of CW measurements with sensors have been positive. The information obtained with new technology has provided retention estimates that are more accurate than they would have been if they were derived from sparse grab sampling.

AB In this paper, the metamaterial absorber based chemical sensor has been designed and measured experimentally. The proposed structure composed of gammadion copper resonator on the top of the FR4 substrate. There is an air gap between the copper plate and backside resonators to place the chemicals. Finite Integration Technique based high-frequency electromagnetic CST microwave studio has been used to simulate and observe the absorption changes of the chemicals depending on the electrical characteristics. The study has been carried out at the X-band frequency range (8-12 GHz). In the first stage, the relative dielectric constants of chemical liquids (acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, ethyl alcohol and benzene) have been measured by using vector network analyzer 85070E probe kit in the related frequency range, the absorption value of the sensor structure is observed for each chemical placed in the air gap region. It is obtained that there is a significant absorption difference between each chemical. Mechanisms of absorption have been presented through the surface current and electric field on gammadion resonator. Furthermore, the effect of the variation dimensions of the resonator on absorption value has also been investigated. The measured values are in good agreement with the simulation ones. In this perspective, the proposed structure is a good candidate for a future electrochemical sensor with instantaneous response.

AB Macroion-counterion systems with large differences in charge and size are models for describing complex electrostatics in colloids and biophysics. Pair correlation functions (PCF) of such a system, a negatively charged macroion with a mono and a divalent counterion were calculated by Integral equation theory in the hypernetted chain (HNC) approximation and by Monte Carlo simulation and were compared. The HNC solutions were obtained on a log spaced grid. The comparison shows that while macroion-macroion PCF calculated in the two theories agree, significant differences exist in the macroion-counterion and counterion-counterion PCF.

AB The mechanism of the (CH3)(2)CCH2 + H2S -> (CH3)(3) CSH reaction catalyzed by various superacids (HBF4, HAsF6, and HSbF6) was investigated theoretically using the ab initio CCSD(T) and MP2 methods and the aug-cc-pVDZ/LANL2DZ basis sets. The effects of surrounding solvent molecules were approximated by employing the PCM solvation model. The most important findings include the observation that each superacid considered is capable of effectively catalyzing isobutene hydrosulfurization as it reduces the activation barrier by ca. 95% in comparison to the uncatalyzed process.

Complete vibrational analyses of the molecule have been reported based on ab initio calculations. Raman and IR spectra captured at room temperature suggest the presence of both the dimeric D1 and D2 forms of the molecule. However, the IR spectra of the molecule recorded at elevated temperatures mark the explicit presence of the D2 form of the molecule. The theoretically simulated temperature dependent dynamic IR spectra have the capability to predict the dynamics of hydrogen bonded complex formation or destruction under external perturbation.

AB Using the empirical pseudopotential method, the electronic and optical properties of zigzag and armchair colloidal ZnO nanoribbons have been studied focusing on their thickness and width dependence. Our results indicate that contrary to what has been theoretically predicted for epitaxially grown nanoribbons, both colloidal types exhibit semiconducting behavior. Furthermore the absorption spectra for both nanoribbons are mainly dominated by y-polarized transitions while for the case of zigzag nanoribbons there is a higher energy x-polarized peak. The increase of confinement along the y-direction in zigzag nanoribbons leads to a suppression of the y-polarized peak, leaving back a purely x-polarized optical gap.

AB The S-2 fluorescence quantum yield of an electron-donor-connecting porphyrin, 5-(9-phenanthryl)-10,15,20-iris (4-pyridyl)porphyrin zinc complex, was significantly smaller than that of its reference compound (5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin zinc complex), whereas the S-1 fluorescence was not quenched by the phenanthryl moiety. In addition to S-2 fluorescence quenching, the emission of intramolecular exciplex was observed. These phenomena suggest the electron transfer from the phenanthryl moiety, resulting in the formation of non-emissive charge separation or emissive exciplex states, depending on solvent polarity. These states relax to the S-1 state, leading to the intersystem crossing to the T-1 state and singlet oxygen generation.

AB We report a one-step process to prepare high activity few-layers g-C3N4 by a self-exfoliated method. Two kinds of few layers materials are obtained from heating melamine (M-CN) and urea (U-CN), respectively. Although both materials exhibit similar high specific surface area, the conducive band position of M-CN ( -1.89 eV) is obviously lower than U-CN ( -1.45 eV). As a result, the M-CN sample exhibits a much higher hydrogen evolution rate than U-CN. Remarkably, the hydrogen evolution rate of M-CN is 37 higher than the bulk. Our results provide a new strategy for the preparing few-layers g-C3N4 for high photocatalytic performance.

AB In this study, the effect of hydrostatic strain on the structural, electronic and optical properties of CsPbI3 was investigated by using first-principles calculations. The calculated results show that the band gap of CsPbI3 can be tuned from 1.03 to 2.14 eV when the strain ranges from - 5% to 5%. A suitable band gap (1.34 eV) of CsPbI3 can be obtained under a strain of -3% (1.40 GPa). The calculated elastic constants further imply that this compound is stable under the abovementioned condition. Moreover, bandgap narrowing leads to the stronger optical absorption in the visible light region.

AB New insights into controlling boundary layer thickness are investigated in growth of hierarchical metal oxides on a tilted substrate. Cr2O3-decorated ZnO nanostructures with different densities and lengths were successfully synthesized by a combination of chemical and physical techniques and investigated as a H2S sensor. By tilting the substrate relative to the incoming gas flow, a boundary layer of non-uniform thickness was created over the substrate. The sensing results of Cr2O3-ZnO hierarchical structures indicated that decoration of the Cr2O3 nanoparticles on ZnO nanostructures significantly enhanced the response to H2S, Liquefied petroleum gas and ethanol at low temperature.

AB Precursors calcined egg shell and agar are used to synthesize calcium carbonate particles by solvothermal method using ethylene glycol/water solvent system. The synthesized products are calcined at 700 and 900 degrees C for 5 h. Calcination temperature has significantly influence the morphology and composition of particles. Calcium carbonate particles are converted into calcium hydroxide particles after calcining at 900 degrees C for 5 h. Reitveld refinement is performed on XRD data of all products and their structural models are constructed. Data analysis shown that crystal system of all products is same, but the atomic coordinates have changed after calcination treatment. Scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques are used for analysis of surface and internal morphology of products. Prepared products are used as catalyst for degradation of Congo red in aqueous medium. Prepared products are also used as fuel additive. Results indicate that the products possess significant potential to be used as catalyst and fuel additive. The product is comprised of oval shaped particles. The size of these oval shaped nanoparticles lies in the range of 80-120 nm.

AB MP2/6-311 + G(d,p) was employed to study the mechanism of the initial step of ring opening of temozolomide (TMZ-H) and its substituted, TMZ-R (R = Cl, OH, CF3) analogues. The study reveals that the difference formation energies of substituted MTIC acids with respect to MTIC acid are ranging between 0.44 and 1.58 kcal/mol. The ring opening of TMZ-R along pathway-2 leads to the lowest conformer (D), whereas reactions along pathway-1 give rise to lower transition states. The barrier energies of TMZ-R are 1.60-3.75 kcal/mol larger than TMZ-H. The conformational analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonds do not have a stabilizing effect in water solvent.

AB In this paper, using a indirect competitive immunoassay, a electrochemical immunosensor based on hexestrol (HEX)-2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (AET)-gold nanoparticles (Au NPs)-glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was favorably prepared to simultaneous detection four phenolic estrogens: HEX, diethylstilbestrol (DES), dienestrol (DE) and bisphenol A (BPA). The HEX-AET-Au NPs-GCE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectrum (IR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A design strategy of HEX-AET-Au NPs-GCE was introduced by nano-sized effect, self-assembly and specific immune technology. The amperometric response sequence was DES > DE > BPA > HEX by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with detection limits of 0.25, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 ng-mL(-1), respectively (S/N = 3), which indicates satisfactory linear range and selectivity. Compared with HPLC-MS/MS method, the accuracy of DE detection in real samples was carried out by the HEX-AET-Au NPs-GCE, which displays potential applications in phenolic estrogens detection of environment and food.

AB In this work, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of the combined InSe/Ca(OH)(2) heterostructure through density functional theory. It suggests that a combination of InSe and Ca(OH)(2) tends to a significant decrease in the band gap of the heterostructure, which may result from the vacuum energy difference of the monolayers. The InSe/Ca(OH)(2) heterostructure mediates by the weak vdW interactions and possesses a type-II semiconductor with a direct band gap of 0.55 eV, which can also be engineered by applying electric field or vertical strains. The semiconductor-to-metal and direct-to-indirect transitions can also emerge, which make InSe/Ca(OH)(2) heterostructure promising material for electronic nanodevices.

AB The surface structure instability of the nanoscale Hydroxyapatite (HAP) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets under the dynamic chemical environment capable of forming host-guest complexes has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). From the NMR and SPM studies, we have found that the interaction between the nanoHAP and rGO sheets is occurred through the surface POxH- group of nanoHAP with epoxy carbon of rGO. Complexation of rGO sheets with nanoHAP facilitates electron transfer between them and an enhanced piezo response of 65 +/- 2.5 pm/V at the nanoHAP intercalated rGO region.

AB Relativistic unrestricted time-dependent density functional theory calculations were performed for obtaining the absorption spectra of gold-cluster complexes Au-4 - S - CnH2n - S'- Au-4' (n = 2-5). The range-separated ex- change-correlation functional CAMYB3LYP was used to properly predict charge transfer excitations. The absorption UV-vis spectrum is not affected by size if structure and metal-molecule bonding remains similar. Changes in the 'local' structure and bonding have drastic effects on these systems' electronic transitions. The HOMO-LUMO gap of the cluster complexes shows a zig-zag behavior typical of gold nanoclusters with respect to the size of the alkanedithiol chain (n).

AB The saturated solubilities of DL- Tyrosine, DL-Leucine, DL-Isoleucine and DL-Threonine in binary aqueous dipolar aprotic acetonitrile solvent were estimated by 'formol titrimetry' at nine equidistant temperatures under 0.1 MPa pressure. The chemical effects of the standard transfer energetics of these amino acids obtained after elimination of cavity forming, dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole interaction effect from the total, are useful to know about chemical stability of it in such system and solvent-solvent interaction therein. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions of standard transfer Gibbs free energies and entropies, as obtained after subtraction of dispersion from chemical interaction are guided by the attached side chains.

AB Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is demonstrated for Ag nanodecahedra with different morphological qualifies or purifies that involve the presence/absence of rounded/regular polyhedra and/or of small quasi-spherical particles. UV-vis extinction spectra exhibit two characteristic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks and are almost identical between the examined samples (namely, rather insensitive to their morphological quality). In contrast, MCD profiles are strongly quality-dependent. Spectral deconvolution analysis of both extinction and MCD gives a useful relationship between the quality and spectroscopic features. We then propose that MCD spectroscopy is facilely applicable to the evaluation of morphological quality in Ag nanodecahedra.

The vertical detachment energies (VDE) and electron affinities (EA) show a monotonic increase with carbon chain length and are used in thermochemical cycles in conjunction with previously reported gas phase acidities of their corresponding alcohols to determine the O-H bond dissociation energies for these alcohols.

AB The expression of solvatochromic Stokes shift was deduced using self-consistent SS-PCM/TD-DFT method based on the novel nonequilibrium solvation theory. As a typical case, a fluorescent dye of 2,5-bis (6-amine-benzoxazol-2-yl) thiophene (BBTA) was investigated. The obtained absorption and emission energies as well as Stokes shift for BBTA in DMSO are in line with available experimental findings. The contributions to the solvatochromic shift are discussed and the electrostatic components are found to be crucial for the electronic absorption and emission spectra in polar solvents. We hope this work can shed new light on the synthesis and application of fluorescent organic dyes.

AB To reveal the photochromism (PC) in double-layer metal oxide films, we investigated reduction, considered to be the cause of PC, by XPS and confirmed reduction occurred near the interface. We synthesized various double-layer metal oxide films to investigate the conditions for PC and confirmed several showed PC than reported to date. From these results and consideration of the band structures of the systems, we suggest a mechanism for PC, involving electron movement through the interface and reduction of the interface by those electrons. Consequently, we found requirement about the electronic structure for PC to occur in double layer metal oxide.

AB The electronic structures and magnetic properties of TM-doped LaZnAsO (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) were investigated based on first-principles calculations. Except Ni-doping, other systems can exhibit magnetism. The magnetism comes mainly from the d orbitals of TM dopants and the As-p orbitals near-neighboring the TM dopants. For the study of the preferred coupling, the Cr, Fe and Co-doping configurations are ferromagnetic ground states, while the antiferromagnetism are more stable for V and Mn-doping. The p-d hybridization between TM-3d and As-4p leads to the ferromagnetic coupling for the TM-TM pairs, which is the magnetic mechanism of the FM state.

AB TiO2 nanowire arrays prepared on Ti alloy substrate as electrode materials for supercapacitors have rarely been reported. Here, we prepared TiO2 nanowire arrays on Ti-4Al-0.005B (TA5) alloy substrate by in-situ hydrothermal treatment of TA5 alloy and the subsequent ion-exchange process, as well as the final annealing. The formation process of nanowires on TA5 alloy during hydrothermal process was studied for the first time. The synthesized TiO2 nanowire arrays exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 60.2 mF cm(-2) and a capacitance retention of 97% after 3000 cycles, making it potentially attractive materials for supercapacitor applications.

AB Doping of TiO2 with element Na from NaCl and immobilization of TiO2 on raschig rings are carried out simultaneously by calcination at 500 degrees C for 5 h. XPS survey spectrum of the Na(0.1% mol)-TiO2 (500 degrees C-5 h) shows that the element Na can be penetrated into TiO2 lattice. The Na+ in the Na(0.1% mol)-TiO2 (500 degrees C-5 h) captures the photogenerated electron and Na+ is reduced to Na, the electron and the hole can be separated effectively, which causes Na(0.1% mol)-TiO2 (500 degrees C-5 h) to show stronger photocatalytic activity than pure TiO2 (500 degrees C-5 h). Repetitive photocatalytic tests show that the Na(0.1% mol)-TiO2 /RR (500 degrees C-5 h) is stable enough in water. Based on the XPS data analysis, we point out the presence of Ti3+ and Ti4+ and the conversion between them on the catalyst surface, the formation of Ti3+ is beneficial to the photocatalysis.

AB The effect of the basal spacing on CH4 diffusion in kaolinite was first studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results illustrated that the CH4 self-diffusion coefficient and transport diffusion coefficient increased exponentially with the basal spacing. Kaolinite swelling and the intensity of the interaction between CH4 and the kaolinite surface are two main parameters that can significantly determine the CH4 diffusion. The larger the basal spacing of kaolinite, the smaller the amount of CH4 adsorbed under unit volume conditions, resulting in an increase in the space for CH4 diffusion. The intensity of the interaction between CH4 and the kaolinite surface is weaker at higher basal spacing. The simulation results of our study also provide details of the correlation between adsorption and diffusion.

Trace of Ni substitutions for Al in the alloys does not change their basic structures, and the hydrogen absorption rate is improved efficiently. The La3Al11 and LaH23 phases can be formed in their hydrogenated states when the x value is greater than 0.04. The hydrogen storage capacity can reach above 0.4 wt% for the LaAl1.92Ni0.08 alloy. The dehydrogenation activity energies of the various hydrides increase with the Ni contents in the alloys.

AB The molecular form of cesium-based halide perovskite materials, Cs4PbX6, has received attention in recent years since it offers interesting optoelectronic properties that are not observed in other dimensions of the halide perovskite materials. In this manuscript, we employ first principles calculations to investigate the aggregates of the Cs4PbX6 to explore the nature of the molecular halide perovskite structures, since the aggregates are common during the synthesis of the halide perovskite materials and dictate their optoelectronic properties. We identify two types of dimeric aggregate structures of Cs4PbX6 , which originates from the formation of halogen bonds between two single units and the sharing of cation atoms, respectively. We find that the aggregates could be responsible for the variations in the UV-vis absorption spectra, and their electronic properties are strongly dependent on the halogen substitution. This study helps the fundamental understanding of the aggregation of molecular halide perovskite materials toward optoelectronic applications.

AB ZnFe2O4 spinel nanopowders are synthesized successfully by a simple solvothermal reaction. The X-ray diffraction results show that the ZnFe2O4 nanopowders with the impurity are formed at 700-1100 degrees C, whereas the temperature is up to 1200 degrees C, the pure ZnFe2O4 nanopowders are obtained. UV-Vis-NIR spectra study indicates that the optical absorbance of ZnFe2O4 nanopowders rises with the sintering temperatures increase. However, the energy bandgap of ZnFe2O4 nanopowders decreases with the sintering temperatures increase. The largest infrared emissivity is 0.970 when the test temperature is at 900 degrees C, which has great potential applications in infrared coatings, infrared insulation and heating fields.

AB Hexagonal boron nitride and cubic boron nitride were modified by polydopamine to improve dispersion in epoxy resin (EP). The average coefficient of friction (COF) of EP-HBN@PDA coating decreased under dry and seawater condition compared to EP indicating BN possessed self-lubricating effect. COF decreased with CBN content raising in seawater, because seawater removed debris including BN particles and CBN with high hardness improved rigidity of coatings. Wear rates of EP-CBN@PDA coating decreased by 68.88% and 97.95% compared to EP-HBN@PDA, and binary-filled coating performed excellently under seawater, it revealed CBN was more effective than HBN in improving load carrying capacity of coatings.

AB The lithiation process of carbon coated silicon nanoparticles is simulated using molecular dynamics simulation in order to unveil the kinetics mechanism. The simulation shows that lithium ions are activated by charged carbon coating under coulombic and Van der Waals force. The lithiation reaction is determined by the activation degree of Li ions which varies on the carbon density, not by the diffusion amount of Li ions. It can interpret well the abnormal phenomenon that bigger diffusion flux of lithium ions does not bring about faster lithiation reaction rate and reveals the shortcoming of Butler-Volmer model describing the charge-transfer/ions-diffusion-controlled electrochemical kinetics.

AB The ongoing and increasing worldwide demand for fish has caused a steady increase in aquaculture production during the last decades. This emphasizes the importance of farming systems with a low ecological footprint, like recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), which are an alternative to traditional open systems. Furthermore, implementing microalgae treatments in RAS, sustainable water management and low discharge of concentrated wastewater could be achieved, allowing its reuse in the system. The influence of three factors on microalgae treatment efficiency in RAS water were studied: i) microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris, Tetradesmus obliquus), ii) water pre-treatment (sterile filtration), and iii) sampling location within the RAS (e.g. from fish tank, after UV-disinfection, etc.). To this end, fully factorial, replicated cultivations were carried out in 100-ml flasks, and nutrient removal, microalgae growth, and density of bacteria and protozoa were measured for up to 18 days. Results show that both species are able to grow in RAS water and effectively remove nutrients in it, yet their performance depended greatly on water quality. In sterile RAS water, growth and nutrient removal efficiency of C. vulgaris surpassed that of T. obliquus. In non-sterile RAS water, the pattern reversed because of grazing protozoa. The location of sampling within the RAS had no discernible effect on microalgae growth or nutrient removal efficiency. The results confirm that a microalgae-based technology to treat and valorise RAS water is technically feasible, yet caution that inferences made can be reversed depending on the choice of the species and the pretreatment of the RAS water prior to cultivation.

AB Species richness is the simplest way to describe community and species diversity, but the number of detected species is remarkably dependent on the sampling method used. Thus, it is necessary to WA the effectiveness of traditional sampling methods in different habitat types. To compare the performance of various methods for sampling grassland species richness in semiarid areas, we present a comparison of species richness detection among three commonly used sampling methods. We used 48 sites within six main grassland types in the Inner Mongolia semiarid region (meadow grassland in low wetlands, hilly grassland, desert grassland, mountain meadow grassland, mountain grassland and steppe desert) as study sites. In summer and early autumn in 2017, the commonly used modified Whittaker method, Hankins method and line transect method were used to conduct species richness surveys by overlaying these methods at the same site. The number of species per subplot (1 m(2)), the number of species in 10 subplots (10 m(2)) and the total species richness were compared across all three sampling methods to evaluate the effects of subplot shape, subplot arrangement and sampling area on the detected species richness. The results regarding the number of species per subplot showed that more species were recorded in the 1:4 rectangle subplots because of the larger perimeter:area ratio than that in square subplots and because the width of the 1:25 strips is significantly smaller than the proportion of the sampled species, which caused the 1:25 strips to show the worst performance. The analysis of species richness at the 10 m(2) scale supports the idea that more species are likely to be detected with a dispersed arrangement of subplots in spatially heterogeneous grasslands. The results of the total species richness analysis showed that the accuracy of the line transect method was less than 50% in all grassland types but desert grassland and steppe desert, which have low species richness. Pairwise comparisons showed no significant difference between the accuracy of the modified Whittaker method and the Hankins method, but the modified Whittaker method requires less time than the Hankins method and performed better for more grassland types. Our study suggests that the modified Whittaker method is the most efficient sampling method for surveying species richness in semiarid grassland.

AB Plant diversity exerts significant effects on ecosystem functioning. However, it remains unclear that whether the ecological consequences of genotypic diversity of the dominant species is similar to that of species diversity. In this study, diversity effects on biomass of 12 companion species and 12 genotypes of the dominant species (Stipa grandis) in the Inner Mongolia Steppe of China were examined by two independent diversity experiments. In order to explain the diversity effects, seven plant functional traits for each species or each genotype of S. grandis per mixture treatment were measured and their Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) was estimated. There was significantly positive net species diversity effect on aboveground biomass, which was mainly contributed by complementarity effect; however, net diversity effects were not significant in genotypic diversity experiment. The FDQ among S. grandis genotypes was significantly lower than that among the companion species, and the relatively lower FDQ would increase niche overlap and limit complementarity effect among genotypes. Neither species diversity nor genotypic diversity of S. grandis showed significant influences on belowground biomass, suggesting the non-consistent results of diversity effect between belowground and aboveground systems. The present finding highlighted the species diversity effects on biomass, the role of FDQ on explaining complementarity effect by niche overlap or resource use efficient.

AB China's primary forest has gone through the extensive deforestation and further restoration since 1950s. However, little is known about how animal diversity responds to restoration. Here, we used camera trapping to monitor diversity of large-and-medium mammals for three years (2014-2017) in four forest habitat types in the Qinling Mountains: high-elevation primary forest, low-elevation primary forest, secondary forest, and plantation forest. The species richness did not vary between forest types (n = 17-18). But the relative abundant index (RAI) was higher in low-elevation primary (3.00%), followed by plantation forest (1.77%), secondary forest (0.89%), and high-elevation primary forest (0.74%), respectively. In term of habitat using, low-elevation primary forest was the most preferred habitat by the animals (11 species), followed by high-elevation forest (5 species), and plantation forest (4 species), while secondary forest was only preferred by 1 species. Species' preferences on forest habitat types were stable during daytime and night-time but significantly changed in different seasons. Our study indicated that both plantation forest and secondary forest in the Qinling Mountains played important roles of supporting animal species. Thus a comprehensive management is required for biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains.

AB A large number of qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses have been performed to summarize the effects of river restoration, while systematic and quantitative assessments of the literature on river restoration are still rare. To fill this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 55 peer-reviewed publications describing assessments of river restoration with indicators of biodiversity or ecosystem services (ES). The core of the study was to identify: (i) the overall ecological effects of river restoration; (ii) the restoration effects on different organism groups and types of ES, including the relationship between biodiversity and ES; and (iii) the influence of the restoration context, that is degradation types, restoration techniques and restoration age. The meta-analysis revealed that river restoration significantly enhanced ecological conditions. However, restoration effects varied among organism groups and ES, with plant abundance and regulating services showing higher responses to restoration. Moreover, a trend of a positive correlation was found between biodiversity and ES. Restoration activities showed most significant effects in the context of hydromorphological degradation or land-use changes, and channel reconfiguration and riparian buffer establishment had a particularly favourable outcomes. Only regulating services showed a positive correlation with restoration age; thus, long-time monitoring is necessary to fully understand restoration effects. Overall, our meta-analysis provides evidence-based advice for future projects and assessment of river restoration.

AB Surface coal mining severely affects natural ecosystems, though it might also result in an establishment of biologically unique anthropogenic habitats. We studied spontaneously created post-mining calcareous brooks located at the brown coal spoil heap in the Sokolov coal basin (Czechia). Despite their extreme water conditions, linked most to the ionic mixture of dissolved ions (mainly SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+), and ferric hydroxide precipitations, we recorded unexpectedly species-rich assemblages there (150 species), including several spring fen specialists (31 species) and eight threatened red-listed species. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of post-mining calcareous habitats were compared with those reported from natural brooks draining Western Carpathians calcareous spring fens. The species richness found in the post-mining calcareous brooks was significantly lower than that of the natural calcareous spring brooks. Although we found 29% of species recorded in the two study systems in common (i.e. 80 species), species composition of their assemblages was systematically distinct. This suggests a possible role of environmental filtering in the post-mining brooks and/or dispersal limitation of some species typical for natural calcareous spring brooks (e.g. Trichodrilus strandi, Bythinella austriaca). In contrast, many macroinvertebrates, particularly those of high dispersal capacities (i.e. Odonata, Coleoptera and Diptera), can recognize post-mining calcareous brooks as surrogate habitats for the natural calcareous spring brooks.

AB Landslides represent the most intense type of geological disaster in the gully region of the Loess Plateau and have caused great damage to surface vegetation. Natural restoration is considered as an effective method for revegetation, however, vegetation patterns on landslides after natural restoration and its related factors remain poorly understood. The present study investigated vegetation patterns on a landslide after 5 years of natural restoration, which located in Hezhai coal mining area, Shanxi Province, China, to understand the natural restoration of vegetation after landslides. The species composition on the bottom, middle and top of the landslide, as well as the species importance value, plant diversity and similarly were ascertained and compared with the that on undisturbed site. Furthermore, the soil seed bank in another landslide which just experienced 0.5-year natural restoration was also investigated, and a seed bank germination experiment was performed based on the collected seed samples from the landslide to test their vitalities. Results showed that 20 species of vegetation were found on all three parts of the landslide, which all belonged to herbaceous plants and shrubs. Eleusine indica was dominant in both the bottom and middle of the landslide, while the top was dominated by Potentilla si-schanensis. From the bottom to the top of landslide, the Margalef Index was 3.26, 3.91, and 2.17 respectively; the Shannon-Wiener Index was 2.56, 2.60, and 2.13 respectively; the Pielou Index was 0.55, 0.56, and 0.46, respectively. Species similarly revealed a close relationship between species compositions on restored landslide and undisturbed area. A total of 13 species of seeds were found in the soil seed bank, which were also similar to the aboveground plants on disturbed site and the landslide after 5-year natural restoration, and the seed was also proved vital in the seed bank experiment. These results indicated that vegetation on landslides could recovery naturally, and natural restoration was more effective on the bottom and middle of the landslide, which revealed that changes in topography could affect revegetation. The seed bank in the soil was considered as a main factor affecting natural restoration. This research provides useful insight into the natural restoration of vegetation after landslides, and provides a reference for the selection of ecological restoration strategies.

AB The ecological response to suspended-sediment-induced turbidity is an important consideration for large engineering projects and ecological conservation in estuarine wetlands. However, few studies have quantified the effects of increasing suspended sediment on ecosystem functioning. To explore the effects of short-term turbidity variations on the aquatic metabolism of a wetland ecosystem, we conducted a controlled experiment based on the turbidity characteristics in the Yellow River estuarine wetland. Four turbidity disturbance levels (10, 50, 150, and 250 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs)) were applied to artificially cultivated wetlands and the subsequent variations and potential causes thereof were analyzed. The results showed that increases in turbidity significantly reduced the gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates within a single day. The GPP declined more than the ER, leading to lower net ecosystem production and a more heterotrophic water column. Increased turbidity limited photosynthetic oxygen production and thus limited the GPP rate. Even a slight increase in turbidity (for example, from 10 to 50 NTU) had rapid negative effects on the GPP and ER rates, while lower solar radiation and temperature decreased the GPP and ER much further. The results of this study imply that increased exposure to suspended-sediment-induced turbidity may severely impair aquatic metabolism in wetland ecosystems with submerged plants.

AB The efficiency of active aeration (AE) of constructed wetlands expressed as the ratio between implied oxygen consumption and oxygen delivered to the system is comprehensively reviewed in this paper. The aeration efficiency appears to be rather low with a mean value of 1.73% and median value of 0.48% of oxygen used in the systems for situations with only partial aerobic degradation of the pollutants. For full aerobic degradation, the mean value of AE is 3.74% but median value is much lower 1.08%. For both cases, the standard deviation is higher than the mean value (4.95% and 10.87% respectively), so there is a lot of variability in the data. For systems with the Forced Bed Aeration the results are more uniform and are close to the literature values given for this system, which is an implication that the proposed methodology might be potentially used for rough estimate of the aeration efficiency.

AB Wetlands play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer. These field-experimental warming results suggested that in temperate P. australis wetlands without tidal impacts, climate warming might increase the soil organic C pools while exerting no effect on microbial C decomposition, whereas the N and P cycling that is mediated by soil microbes might be enhanced by moderate warming.

AB The willow (Salix spp.) is a promising candidate coping with global climate warming and environment pollution. In this study, differences in plant growth, Cd uptake and accumulation, and extractable Cd in the rhizosphere between flooded and non-flooded (well-drained) Salix genotypes were investigated using a pot experiment in the rainshelt. All Salix genotypes grew well under well-drained conditions. In contrast, the flooded Salix genotypes developed hypertrophied lenticels, adventitious roots and aerenchyma, and decreased aboveground biomass production compared with the corresponding non-flooded genotypes, varying with genotypes and Cd levels in the medium. The non-flooded Salix genotypes had high Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with high leaf Cd bioconcentration factors (BCF) and translocation factors (TFs) relative to genotypes, displaying good Cd phytoextraction potentials. The flooded Salix genotypes dramatically decreased Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with low Cd BCFs and TFs, and large amounts of Cd accumulated in roots compared to the non-flooded genotypes, showing Cd phytostabilization traits. The extractable Cd in rhizosphere changed with genotypes and treatments, and comparatively, EDTA-extractable Cd could reflect well Cd phytoavailability to the willows in the soil. It was concluded that flooding tended to shift from phytoextraction to phytostabilization for Cd by willows during whole growing season.

AB The managed realignment (MR) of flood protection on low-lying coasts, and the creation, or re-creation, of intertidal saltmarsh habitat between old and new, more landward sea defence lines is an intervention designed to help protect coastal infrastructure and communities against the impact of storm waves and surges. However, the effectiveness of such schemes has rarely been proven in the field. Environmental monitoring has generally been limited to the first few years after implementation and has focussed on sediment accretion and surface elevation change, vegetation establishment and habitat utilization, to the neglect of the study of biophysical processes, such as wave energy dissipation and High Water Level (HWL) attenuation. We address this knowledge gap by analysing HWL attenuation rates in saltmarshes from within, and in front of, the open coast MR site of Freiston Shore (Lincolnshire, UK).
   For this purpose, a suite of 16 pressure transducers was deployed along four sections (two within and two outside the MR) of identical setup to measure water level variations during the highest spring fides of the year 2017.
   Our results show that for the conditions encountered during the field monitoring period, the capacity of the Freiston Shore MR site to provide HWL attenuation was limited. HWL attenuation rates were significantly higher over the natural saltmarsh (in front of the MR), where HWL attenuation ranged between 0 and 101 cm km(-1) (mean 46 cm km(-1)). Within the MR site, rates varied between - 102 and 160 cm km(-1) (mean(-3) cm km(-1)), with even negative attenuation (i.e. amplification) for about half of the measured tides.
   We argue that the weak performance of the MR site in terms of HWL attenuation was a result of internal hydrodynamics caused by scheme design and meteorological conditions. The latter may have counteracted the HWL attenuating effect caused by the additional shallow water area provided by the restored saltmarsh.

AB As the main part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Tibet has a large range of elevations. Its complex topography and diverse vegetation types constitute various micro-habitat conditions, which may exert great influence on ecosystems. The bryophytes are higher plant with simple structure, and widely distributed, and extremely sensitive to environmental variation as well. As one of the important indicator plants, its response to environmental variation is important to explore. In this study, to better understand the response of bryophytes to environmental variation, we explored the relationship between the morphological traits of Bryum argenteum and its surrounding climate, topography, soil, and other environmental factors in the arid and semi-arid regions of Tibet. The Bryum argenteum specimens collected in the arid and semi-arid regions of Tibet from 2007 to 2015 were taken for 8 samples each specimen, and slides of plants and leaves were made. The slides were photo graphed and we measured the plant height, leaf length, leaf width, costa length, costa width and hair-point length, and measured the correlations between them and the environmental factors. Our results showed that the morphological characteristics of bryophytes are closely related to environmental variation, among which the hair-point length and plant height showed high coefficient of variation and phenotypic plasticity. The effects of environmental variation on bryophytes are largely different in different substrates. The morphological traits of terricolous Bryum argenteum are largely influenced by growing season precipitation, soil pH, and soil texture, while the morphological traits of saxicolous Bryum argenteum are largely influenced by elevation, growing season temperature, annual precipitation, and total nitrogen, available phosphorus and organic matter in soil. Our study showed the various functional traits of bryophytes are closely related and the combination of these traits collaboratively responds to environmental variation.

AB Constructed wetlands are designed to mitigate nutrient and pesticide fluxes from agricultural catchments. Nevertheless, information on their efficiency in removing non-degradable contaminants such as metals is still scarce. This study aimed to explore the metallic signature and fate of metals within the Rampillon wetland (France) receiving water from a drained 355-ha catchment under intensive agriculture. Original monitoring coupling classic, time-integrated and bioaccumulation-based tools was achieved to characterise spatiotemporal dynamics of various metals (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and Zn). To assess metal inflows and mitigation, samples of dissolved and particulate metals were collected bimonthly at the inlet and outlet of the wetland over 3 months. Simultaneously, time-integrated (sediment traps and passive samplers) and bioaccumulation-based (caged gammarids and biofilms) tools were deployed to monitor temporal changes in metal speciation and bioavailability. To gain insight into the spatial distribution of metals between abiotic and biotic matrices, sediments and indigenous invertebrates with contrasted ecologies were sampled in different cells of the wetland. The results showed time-integrated tools were more suitable than bimonthly samples to quantify metal mitigations because of temporal fluctuations and low contamination levels. Significant mitigations were thus observed in trapped sediments for all metals (ranged 11-23%, except Mn) as well as in the DGT-labile fraction for Cd, Cr, Co, Mn and Ni (ranged 13-51%). Bioaccumulation levels in biofilms also revealed a decrease in metal bioavailability at the outlet. Furthermore, the spatial survey supported the central role of sediments in metal trapping and the beneficial effect of this wetland for local biodiversity in terms of exposure. To conclude, this study provides valuable information on the ecodynamics and bioavailability of metals required for sustainable management of such artificial ecosystems and furthermore, of agricultural areas.

AB River bank stabilization is a common practise and can be observed on most rivers around the world, often using hard-engineering riprap. Increasingly, bioengineered approaches using vegetation-based constructive materials is promoted to alleviate some of the negative ecological stresses of bank stabilization. Because these stabilization projects use a variety of techniques to create a site-specific design, they can have unexpected morphological implications and variable ecological benefits which can be anticipated using numerical modelling. Bioengineered bank stabilization creates roughness elements on both micro and macro scales, where only macro-roughness can be captured by bathymetric adjustments. The definition of micro- and macro-roughness depends on the spatial resolution of the model domain, and may be considered analogous to skin and form friction when characterizing natural alluvial bed environments. The objectives of this research are to assess the hydrodynamic impact of the added micro- and macro-roughness associated with a bioengineering pilot project planned in Quebec, Canada and to use this case study to propose new techniques for integrating increased roughness due to bank stabilization into numerical models. The roughness of the stabilization project is assessed by adjusting bathymetry to simulate macro-roughness features, and roughness coefficients to simulate micro-roughness features. Results show a significant dampening interaction term that reduced the cumulative effect on resistance to flow when both roughness types were applied.

AB Bioretention modified media consists of modifier, soil, sand, and organic matter (OM), which was applied to clean rainfall runoff pollutants and control flood. These should support plant growth, cost-effectiveness, local availability besides rainwater runoff and its pollution control. A modified bioretention media design approach was developed, to determine whether the modified media could compensate the deficiency of infiltration and/or purification ability for traditional bioretention soil mixing (BSM) and undisturbed soil. Taking the soil conditions of a typical area in northwest China as an example, we defined the BSM as the mixture of river sand, soil and wood chips, and the ratio was 65:30:5 by mass, and modified media are a mixture of BSM with modifiers. The characteristics of ten modifiers were tested, and the proportions of BSM and modifiers were determined though Langmuir adsorption isotherm mainly. The infiltration capacities of modified media were over 220 mm/h, and they were more than 3.4 times that of undisturbed soil. We also got the maximum adsorption capacity and longest lifespan media which were BSM + 10% water treatment residuals (WTR) for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and BSM + 10% green zeolite (GZ) for ammonia though batch and mini-column experiments. Based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), considering infiltration, water-holding adsorption, lifespan, and cost, the comprehensive performance of modified media is as follows: BSM + 10% flyash (0.2683) > BSM + 10% GZ (0.2589) > BSM + 10% WTR (0.2443) > BSM + 10% medical (0.1553) > BSM (0.0731). The results of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of adsorption mechanism of bioretention system media, contributing to the design and evaluation of bioretention efficient media.

AB Eutrophication is the main pollution in urban water in Shanghai. In this study, three emergent aquatic plant species (Scirpus triqueter, Phragmites australis, and Zizania latifolia) were grown in monoculture, as well as a threespecies mixture, to compare their effectiveness in terms of nutrient removal in controlled indoor constructed wetland microcosms. The effect of different aeration treatments (above-aerated, sediment-water middle-aerated, below-aerated, non-aerated) and treatments combining aeration and wetland plants for total nitrate (TN) and total phosphate (TP) removal efficiency was also examined. The objective of this study was to test the following four scientific hypotheses: (1) Plant growth will be optimal in the below-aerated treatment; (2) Z. latifolia will have the highest removal efficiency of TN and TP; (3) Aeration will increase the efficiency of TN and TP removal, with below-aerated treatment having the best effect; (4) The activity of microorganisms will vary over time, and aeration and plant treatment together will be most effective. We found that P. australis was most effective at removing TN and TP from water. Below-aerated significantly promoted the growth of P. australis. Hypotheses 1, 2 and 4 were supported by our results. The combination of P. australis and sediment aeration removed TN from water most efficiently. Above-aerated also effectively reduced TP in water. Combined plant and below-aerated treatments had better removal efficiency of TP from above-aerated than below-aerated alone. These results provide new insights into the management of eutrophication.

AB The current study was carried out to test the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from olive mill wastewater (OMW) by combination of sand filter and a mixture of aquatic plants (Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia and Arundo donax). The experimental pilot was composed of two serial systems: sand filter followed by vertical flow constructed wetlands (VF-CWs). The sand filter was filled with 50 cm of sand and 10 cm of gravel in the top and the bottom of the filter. The second step of the treatment consists of a tank (1 x 1 x 1 m(3)) filled with 20 cm of gravel and 60 cm of soil, planted with a mixture of aquatic plants at a density of 8 young plants/m(2) for each plant and irrigated twice in the week by 20L of preliminary filtered OMW. During all experiment, OMW was diluted with domestic wastewater at a ration 1/1 (v/v).
   Mean diluted OMW concentrations were 2.05 g/L, 1.52 g/L, 1.94 mg/L, 1.70 mg/L, 0.22 g/L, 0.30 g/L, 26.78 g/L and 20.47 g/L for TKN-N, NH4+-N, NO2--N, NO3-N, ortho-phosphate (OP), Total phosphorus (PT) total COD and dissolved COD respectively. Despite the rather high influent concentrations, the performance of the sand filter was very effective since it achieved average removals of about 60.4%, 74.4%, 80.61%, 97.85%, 96.45%, 79.75% and 76.75% for NTK, NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, PT total COD and dissolved COD respectively. The presence of aquatic plants was more efficient in removing of nutrients and organic load. The average elimination of experimental system (sand filter + VF-CWs) in terms of flow was 62.48% for NTK, 90.43% for NH4+, 77.25% for NO3-, 98.51% for PO43-, 97.53% for PT and 99.05% for total COD.
   In general, this study shows potential application of the experimental system to achieve nutrient and COD removal from OMW. Although the percent removal of organic matter and nutrients from OMW was very high, final OMW concentrations remained high, thus preventing their use for irrigation or immediate disposal into the environment.

AB Stormwater ponds (also called detention basins or retention ponds) are a commonly employed method to control runoff flow from developed lands. They function to reduce peak discharge and provide settling of suspended particulate pollutants but do not perform well in removing fine particulates or dissolved nutrients. Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are modular floating vegetated mat systems gaining attention as potential stormwater pond retrofits to improve pollutant removal performance. This study presents data on the FTW suitability of four plant species native to the Northeast region of the United States and commonly referenced in other FTW studies: Juncus effusus L. (Common Rush), Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C. Gmel.) Palla (Softstem Bulrush), Carex comosa Boott (Longhair Sedge), and Pontederia cordata L. (Pickerel Weed). Species were evaluated for suitability of FTW in cold climates based on their survival rate, biomass development, phosphorus (P) uptake and storage in shoots, and root architectural features. S. tabernaemontani survived the winter most successfully with greater than 95% of planted plugs resprouting the following spring after the first winter. P. cordata suffered a nearly complete loss. C. comosa produced the most biomass (35.6 +/- 12.8 g/plant individual) and P. cordata produced the least (3.6 +/- 3.98 g/plant). A self-seeded species populated all of the mats at the study site (Bidens vulgata) and produced sizable biomass over the growth season but with a large range (12.4 +/- 12.0 g/plant individual) due to the variable growing time of each individual. P. cordata and B. vulgata had the highest P concentration (5.72 +/- 0.71 g/kg and 7.49 +/- 0.15 g/kg respectively). When controlled for individual plant mass, C. comosa had the greatest P content per plant individual. The longest measured root segments were associated with the C. comosa (32.6 +/- 15.8 cm) and B. vulgata (29.4 +/- 16.9 cm). P. cordata produced the shortest root segments (11.9 +/- 5.1). S. tabernaemontani and J. effusus had similar root lengths (19.6 +/- 11.1 and 18 +/- 6.8 cm, respectively). C. comosa had higher root surface area than any other species studied and had a greater than 90% survival over the winter. Overall, C. comosa was the best performing species and may be more suitable for FTW in stormwater ponds in cold climates.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition caused by human activities has been shown to have significant impacts on ecosystem structure and function, but the reported impacts have been inconsistent among studies. To test the effects of N deposition on a salinized reed wetland, we built a long-term nitrogen deposition experimental platform in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. The present study investigated soil chemical properties, soil enzyme activities and plant growth parameters after five years of N deposition. Results showed that the concentration of NH4-N and NO3-N increased significantly with the increasing level of nitrogen addition, but no significant influences were observed in total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC) and available phosphorous (AP) across N addition treatments. Higher amounts of N addition significantly increased the urease activity (Ure) and alkaline phosphatase activity (Alp), but did not enhance the activity of invertase (Inv). The activities of Ure and Alp were positively correlated with the concentration of soil NO3-N, TN and TC, respectively, but negatively correlated to soil salt content. Meanwhile, the plant height and productivity were significantly stimulated, and the surface soil salt content decreased significantly. The results suggest that atmospheric N deposition may help improve the function of salinized reed wetland ecosystems in the YRD by increasing soil nutrient content, stimulating soil enzyme activity and enhancing plant production.

AB Promotion of successful examples of biomanipulation and long-term monitoring is important for encouragement of similar activities, which are still relatively scarce. A project to improve water quality in the Velky Bolevecky pond (Plzen, Czech Republic) began in 2006. The main activities in this project were: large scale fish reduction; stocking of predatory fish; usage of phosphorus binding coagulants; and reintroduction of macrophytes. During five years the impact of a eutrophic system with massive cyanobacterial blooms with low water transparency transformed into a clear water system with high water transparency and well developed macrophyte cover. All aspects relating to the ecological status of the water body such as total phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton density improved significantly during or immediately after the project realization. For example, water transparency increased three fold. Zooplankton density also increased, however the difference was not significant. Oligotrophication of the system became evident also in the species composition of zooplankton and phytoplankton. Species adapted to nutrient reduction and macrophyte cover developed. Seven years after the project was over, the fish stock remained on the low densities naturally. A good ecological stage was achieved with low nutrient levels, high water transparency, very low densities of cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton together with a well-developed macrophyte cover. All of which has been maintained without any expensive impact. The highest expenditure is, paradoxically, due to macrophyte harvesting because their massive explosion in the pond is not in accordance with recreational and sporting utilization. It seems, that reduction of nutrient loading and switching of a formerly eutrophic system to an oligotrophic one is possible and sustainable over a relatively long time period in a shallow temperate pond. Subsequent good management of the system will, of course, be necessary.

AB As a result of decreasing water level of the Caspian Sea and excess pollutants flowing into Gorgan Bay, water quality of the bay has deteriorated significantly. This study aimed to propose effective engineering approaches which can improve the water quality of the bay. Special focus was placed on increasing the rate of water exchange between the water body and the Caspian Sea by either dredging existing inlets between the two water bodies or creating an artificial inlet on the Miankaleh Peninsula, which can help to dilute the polluted water and flush pollutants out of the bay. A coupled hydrodynamic and solute transport model was employed to investigate the effects of different measures using the concepts of residence time which is an important tool used to identify biogeochemical processes and their consequences in water bodies. Model results showed that the engineering approaches would have a profound effect on the water quality of Gorgan Bay by reducing the residence time. Opening an artificial inlet in the west of the Peninsula would reduce residence time by two times. Furthermore, in economic terms, these strategies would also improve the standard of living of most of the inhabitants who live around the bay. However, from an environmental perspective, the engineering approaches would threaten the ecosystem of the bay in various ways, such as disrupting physical, chemical and biological processes taking place in the bay. Finally, it was concluded that the most sustainable approach is to control the stressor - pollution coming from Gorgan Bay watershed and entering the bay. This study clearly shows that restoration projects require a multidisciplinary systems approach.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are useful for reducing pesticide transfer from drainage into surface water, though little was known about the influence of hydrodynamics on their mitigation. We thus assessed the influence of design parameters (aspect ratio, water depth, flow rate) on hydraulic performance simultaneously to pesticide mitigation. We performed our work on four pesticides with contrasted properties: boscalid (BSC), cyproconazole (CYP), isoproturon (IPU) and dimethachlor (DMT), under three controlled flow-rate conditions (including no-flow) by using two pilots with contrasted designs (pond and ditch) over 62 days. Hydraulic performance and pesticide mitigation were less effective in a pond than in the ditch whatever the flow. Moreover, pesticide mitigation was more significant at low than at high flow rates for both pilots. M high flow rate, water transport is mainly governed by convection, but at low flow rates both water transport and mitigation are governed by hydrodynamic dispersion, inducing a longer contact time between pesticides and substrate due to longer hydraulic retention. Finally, BSC and CYP are better mitigated than DMT and IPU, even if they are also more strongly released during low flow rates. In addition, the mitigation of pesticides and some of their metabolites produced inside the pilots was almost complete during stagnation.

AB Roads are known to be a major factor in the ongoing spread and establishment of invasive plants by modifying habitats and providing movement corridors. Controlling plant invasion or restoring highly-invaded areas along roads is a challenging task in current conservation practice. We aim to investigate the possible facilitative effects of nurse shrubs on native vs. exotic species in order to provide applications for conservation and restoration of highly invaded roadsides areas in megadiverse montane areas of Brazil. We estimated the abundance of each plant species (native and exotic) in paired roadsides with and without pioneer nurse shrubs (Baccharis spp.), and measured whether they were facilitated (i.e., growing underneath native nurse shrubs), using a Facilitation Value metric. We found that the proportion of exotic species was 27% greater in areas without the nurse shrubs. In addition, predicted probability of nurse shrubs as facilitators of native species was 61% greater than that of exotic species. Pioneer nurse shrubs that alleviate the environmental shift generated by the construction and use of roads (e.g., disturbed soils with low nutrient content) may represent an interesting alternative to mitigate exotic plant invasion along roadsides, a current global priority for biodiversity conservation. Decision-makers considering whether to build, improve, and maintain roads should take into account the potential spread of exotic plants and the use of nurse shrubs to prevent or mitigate plant invasiveness.

AB Current tidal marsh elevations and their accretion rates are important predictors of vulnerability to sea-level rise. When tidal marshes are at risk, adaptation measures, such as sediment addition to increase elevations, can be implemented to prevent degradation and loss. In 2016, wildlife managers prescribed a thin-layer sediment addition of locally sourced dredged material from Anaheim Bay to mitigate plausible future impacts of sea-level rise to Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, an urbanized, subsiding, sediment limited, and low elevation tidal marsh in southern California, USA. In this study, our objectives were to determine how suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and fluxes associated with sediment application affected an adjacent eelgrass bed and a more distant deep tidal channel at different time periods throughout the project and how sediment application affected tidal marsh elevation. Due to the sediment addition the tidal marsh elevation increased by 25.4 cm across 3.06 ha. Mean SSC levels at the eelgrass site increased from 4 mg/L during pre-augmentation to 16 mg/L during sediment application. SSC levels also increased up to 40 mg/L with the installation of sediment barriers. Winter storms during construction also had an influence on SSC, with an extreme storm event increasing SSC from 9 mg/L pre-storm levels to 16 mg/L during the storm. However, SSC at the deep site remained constant during all time periods with a mean of 7 mg/L. Our results show that little to zero sediment was exported out of Anaheim Bay during the study period, illustrating that any impacts were localized to the application area. These findings suggest that although long-range export of applied dredge material is unlikely from future thin-layer sediment application at this site, adjacent habitats could experience impacts if erosion control measures are not implemented effectively. Future projects will benefit from similar pre- and post-addition monitoring to establish the long-term efficacy of sea-level rise adaptation measures.

AB Interaction studies of haemoglobin (Hb) with p-sulfonatocalix[8]arene (p-SCX8) has been analysed through UV-visible, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The Ch-pi, pi-pi stacking, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions may involve in protein-calixarene complexes. Binding constant, quenching constant, binding sites have been calculated from fluorescence data. The binding constant estimated on the order of 10(4) M-1. The key results can obtained from circular dichroism technique shows gradual decrease in alpha (alpha) helix concentration from 47.8 to 40.23%. It may be because of p-SCX8 being able to provide surface for the Hb molecule.

AB Novel nanostructures were modeled by the binding of uracil derivatives to functionalized carbon nanotubes. The physico-chemical, electronic and nonlinear properties were calculated by density functional theory. The results show that the modeled nanostructures are stable, soluble in water and very reactive. The thermodynamic analyses suggest that their syntheses are possible. The improvement of the electrical conductivity and nonlinear properties in comparison to those of the pristine nanotube reveals that these nanostructures are promising materials for nanotechnology applications.

AB We have studied the structural, magnetic, critical behavior and electrical properties of La0.5Ag0.1Ca0.4MnO3 sample synthesized by traditional Solid State route. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that La0.5Ag0.1Ca0.4MnO3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group. Vibrational study by means of infrared spectroscopy each give a part of the vibrational reality of the material explored. Studying the magnetic and electric properties of La0.5Ag0.1Ca0.4MnO3, it has been found the compound exhibits a second-order phase transition around the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. The critical behavior of La0.5Ag0.1Ca0.4MnO3 compound is investigated based on the data of static magnetic measurements in the vicinity of its critical temperature T-C. The estimated critical exponents derived from the magnetic data were estimated using modified Arrott plot (MAP) and critical isotherm technique (CI). The critical exponents find are comparable to the values theoretical predicted for the values corresponding to the 3D-Ising model and are confirmed by scaling equations of state. The investigated compound exhibits a semiconductor-metal transition at 380 K. For the important value of TCR at zero magnetic fields, we consider our sample is a good candidate infrared sensor for night vision bolometer applications.

AB We report the infrared spectrum of H2C4-(OCS)(2) trimer in the region of the nu(1) fundamental vibration of the OCS monomer. The van der Waals complexes are generated in a supersonic slit-jet apparatus and probed using a rapid-scan tunable diode laser. Both H2C4-(OCS)(2) and D2C4-(OCS)(2) are studied. Analysis of their spectra establishes that the trimer has C-2 point group symmetry. Theoretical calculations performed to find stationary points on the potential energy surface confirm that the observed structure is the most stable form. The experimental rotational parameters are in very good agreement with those computed using double hybrid functionals.

AB Simply by elevating the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction temperature for ZnS deposition, we successfully demonstrated improved photostability of PbS-based quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) which was credited to efficient surface coverage of ZnS over PbS QDs and TiO2. Using open-circuit voltage decay and cyclic voltammetry techniques distinctly, it was affirmed that the back electron transfer at TiO2/PbS/electrolyte interface was reduced. Superior deposition of ZnS in terms of surface coverage not only exhibited increase in photocurrent density (from 20.7 mA/cm(2) to 22.3 mA/cm(2)) and power conversion efficiency (from 3.1% to 3.4%), it also stabilized the normalized current significantly.

AB Interaction energies, geometry and vibrational frequencies of the gas-phase HF-dimethyl ether complex were obtained using quantum-chemical methods. Equilibrium and vibrationally averaged geometries, harmonic and anharmonic wavenumbers of the complex were calculated using second-order perturbation theory procedures with B3LYP, B2PLYP-D and MP2 methods with 6-311++ G(2df, 2pd) basis set. Quantum-mechanical model describing anharmonic-type vibrational couplings within hydrogen bond was used to explain broadening, fine structure and temperature dependence of the F-H stretching IR absorption bands as effect of hydrogen bond formation. Simulations of the rovibrational structure of the F-H stretching bands were performed for different temperatures. The results were compared with experimental spectra.

AB Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering spectra of SF6 are modeled at room temperature in the pressure range [0.2-5] bar and compared to recent experimental measurements (Wang et al., 2017). It is shown that lineshape models that account for density-dependent corrections to the thermodynamic properties provide substantially better agreement than the models assuming an ideal gas model. For intermediate pressures, where a hydrodynamic description of the spectra fails due to kinetic effects, the Enskog-Vlasov kinetic model is shown to reproduce experimental data with good accuracy both at low and high pressure.

AB The terahertz (THz) absorbance spectra of two tartaric acid isomers (D- and DL-tartaric acid) were determined using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) in the range of 0.2-2.0 THz. Significant differences between D-and DL-tartaric acid have been found in their THz characteristic absorption peaks. To simulate their THz spectra, theoretical calculations on isolated-molecule and unit cell of these two tartaric acids were performed, and the computed THz spectra were in accordance with the experimental THz spectra. Moreover, the positions and types of intermolecular interactions in tartaric acids are visualized by using the reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis. Results show that THz absorbance spectra of the two isomers are highly sensitive to the molecular structures including the subtle difference of functional groups and chemical bonds, and the THz-TDS can be used as an effective means for molecular identification in the fields of biology, medicine, and pharmacy.

AB The molecular high-order harmonic generations (HHGs) from H-2(+) and HeH2+ are theoretically investigated by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The contributions of different recombination pathways in the high-order harmonic generation of H-2(+) and HeH2+ are discussed via the wavelet time-frequency analysis. By the analysis of the temporal structures of the different recombination pathways, the spectral minima in the molecular HHG are attributed to the destructive interferences of the recombination pathways from the two localized states. The result provides a new insight into clarifying the spectral minima in the molecular HHG.

From the electrochemical measurements, it was observed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor based on the MWCNTs/MnO2 showed a wide linear range (100 mu M - 20.5 mM) with a limit of detection of 6.97 mu M and sensitivity of 13.9 mu A/mM/cm(2). In addition, the electrode exhibited high stability, good selectivity and long shelf-life for the detection of H2O2. The high surface area of the composite and good electrocatalytic activity of MnO2, which make the electrode a promising transducer for non-enzymatic H2O2 sensing.

AB Most theoretical investigations about titanium oxide clusters focus on (TiO2)(n). However, many TinOm clusters with m not equal 2n are produced experimentally. In this work, first-principles calculations are performed to probe the evolution of TinOm clusters. Our investigations show that for n = 3-11, there exist one relatively stable specie; while for n = 12-18, there are two relatively stable species: Ti-rich and O-rich species. HOMO-LOMO calculations show that the gap can be tuned by changing the size and configurations of TinOm clusters. Our investigation provides insights into the evolution of cluster-to-bulk process in titanium oxide.

AB Continuum stress fields have become a routine analysis for molecular simulations of heterogeneous materials and processes, including crystalline defects, voids, interfaces, and shock waves. Such stress fields are often computed as a localized measure of the virial tensor. Here, we study the sources of error in the local virial relative to the Hardy stress, and show how the error is altered by the size and shape of the region over which the stress is localized. An analysis reveals two sources of error, both of which can be greatly reduced by making an informed choice of the embedding region.

AB The dissociation reactions of ethanol molecules on Fe, Co and FeCo catalysts are investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation to clarify the initial stages of carbon nanotube growth. It is found that the local arrangement of atoms determines which bond is likely to dissociate. For the dissociation of a C-C bond, the site with adjacent iron and cobalt atoms is advantageous. With regard to the dissociation of C-O bonds, if iron atoms are concentrated on the dissociated oxygen bonding site, the reaction is more likely to occur.

AB The interaction between glycine and F2CO/F2SiO occurs through the formation of a pi-tetrel bond between the C/Si atom and a carboxyl O atom. The interaction energy is some 20 kJ/mol for the C center dot center dot center dot O tetrel bond, but exceeds 300 kJ/mol for Si. O. As part of the latter complexation process, the proton engaged in the intramolecular OH center dot center dot N H-bond is transferred across to the N, forming a zwitterion. This Si center dot center dot center dot O tetrel bond is more effective in inducing this proton transfer than is placement of the glycine in an aqueous medium, complexation with an anionic BH4-, or adding an electron to the glycine.

AB Herein, carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized from cherry blossom flowers, and characterized by TEM, FTIR, XPS, ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra. They exhibited bright blue fluorescence under UV irradiation, making them applicable for fluorescent ink. They can also be quenched by several heavy metal ions, especially Fe3+ ion. The quench of CDs was linearly related to Fe3+ ion concentration, making them able to quantify Fe3+ ion. Furthermore, they were low-toxicity to RAW264. 7 macrophages, and emitted bright blue, green and red fluorescence under confocal microscopy. Hence, the CDs might be applied as fluorescent ink, metal ion sensor or cell imaging agent.

AB In this investigation TiO2, nanogranules were synthesized by simple, cost effective hydrothermal route. The stepwise study of various structural, morphological and compositional properties of TiO2 photocatalyst is done. XRD study reveals that the TiO2 thin films are polycrystalline in nature with the tetragonal crystal structure. SEM images show that the substrate surface is covered with a uniform, nanogranule like morphology. Optical band gap lies in the ultraviolet region. Hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanogranules show a good photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate for TiO2 nanogranules found to be 79.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) after each 9 h cycle.

AB The (La0.8Ca0.2)(0.9)Bi0.1FeO3 (LCBFO) compound has been synthesized by the sol-gel method and characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and electrical impedance spectrometry. XRD results revealed that (La0.8Ca0.2)(0.9)Bi0.1FeO3 crystals are orthorhombic, belonging to the Pnma space group. The SEM measurements showed that the sample presents a large distribution of nano-grains connected to each other. The relaxation process and the electrical conductivity are awarded to the same type of charge carriers characterized by similar values of the activation energy determined from loss factor tangent tg (delta), the imaginary part of the permittivity and from the Modulus spectrum. The ac-conductivity was analysed to examine the conduction mechanism, using the Jonscher's universal power-law given by: sigma(ac) (omega) = sigma(dc) + A omega(s). Based on the parameter s behavior, the conductivity was studied according to the NSPT model (non-overlapping small polaron tunneling).

AB Transition-metal-containing aromatic compounds, which contain both aromatic properties and the characteristics of organometallic compounds, have attracted great attention due to their unique structure, electronic properties and fascinating reactivities. In this work, the aromaticity of the fused five-membered ring in M-2[N(CH3)CHN(CH3)](2) containing M-M (Cr, Mo and W) quintuple bond is analyzed. The calculated results show that aromaticity of Cr-2[N(CH3)CHN(CH3)](2) is weak, the five-membered rings in M-2[N(CH3)CHN(CH3)](2) (M=Cr, Mo, W) exhibit obvious pi aromatic character. The contribution of sigma aromaticity and delta aromaticity to the five-membered rings can be neglected.

AB M2CX2 (M = Mo, W; X = O,F) MXenes and their van der Waals heterostructures are investigated by first-principle calculations. Phonon spectrum has shown that Mo2CO2/W2CO2 and Mo2CF2/W2CO2 heterostructures and corresponding monolayers are dynamically stable. W2CO2 exhibits the properties of topological insulator and Mo2CO2 is narrow band gap semiconductor, while Mo(W)(2)CF2 are metals. Mo2CO2/W2CO2 heterostructure indicates a possible topological feature similar to corresponding monolayers and reveals type-II band alignment.

AB In the present investigation, the Plane-Wave Born Approximation (PWBA) [J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. 32 (1999) 3147] has been used to calculate the total ionization cross sections by electron impact of fluorides CFx and NFx (x = 1-3) from the threshold of ionization to 2 keV. The PWBA requires the continuum generalised oscillator strength. Here, we have used continuum generalised oscillator strength given by the statistical model of Weizsacker-Williams and continuum optical oscillator strength approximated by Kim and Rudd. Khare-BEB model has also been used to calculate total ionization cross sections. The calculated cross sections are compared with the previously available theoretical as well as experimental results. The present calculations are found in satisfactory agreement with the available experimental results.

AB Mechanism and kinetics of the reactions of the hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)) with H3O+ and NH4+ cations were determined using quantum chemical computations with both density functional theory (B3LYP) and wavefunction (MP2 and CCSD(T)) methods and the 6-311 + + G(3df,2p) basis set, in conjunction with a PCM method for treating structures in solution. Although both reactions occur with a hydrogen atom transfer, their mechanisms differ from each other by kinetic results. While the reaction of e(aq)(-) and H3O+ in solution is diffusion-controlled, NH4+ reacts with e(aq)(-) via a transition structure with H-tunneling. The predicted rate constants agree well with available experimental results.

AB The beta-FeOOH nanorods and alpha-Fe2O3 hollows are successfully fabricated via hydrothermal method. The TEM and XRD analysis indicated that the morphology and size of beta-FeOOH nanorods or alpha-Fe2O3 hollow structure are tuned by multifactorial parameters in preparation process. The water bath temperature, urea concentrations and hydrothermal temperature promotes the diversity on the size of beta-FeOOH nanorods, while hydrothermal times beneficial to the different morphologies of beta-FeOOH. The calcination treatment helps the phase transformation to alpha-Fe2O3 and the construction of alpha-Fe2O3 hollow structure. However, a mature and regular alpha-Fe2O3 nano-hollow must couple the individual roles of above reaction parameters.

AB The high-quality sulfur-doped graphite (SGi) was prepared from concentrated sulfuric acid-graphite intercalation compounds (H2SO4-GICs) by solid-state microwave irradiation, where H2SO4 was the sulfur (S) source and S-doping occurred within a minute. The preparation of H2SO4-GICs was a key step for S-doping and exfoliation process. Notably, it was found that S-doping was influenced by the dosage of H2SO4, where the lower dosage of H2SO4 was beneficial for the S-doping. The exfoliation efficiency was greatly affected by the temperature and dosage of oxidant, where lower temperature and lower dosage of KMnO4 guaranteed efficient exfoliation.

AB In this study, performance of boron doped Si-48 to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic environment was examined. Results showed B-Si-48-*OOH creation was more acceptable reaction than O-2 dissociation from thermodynamic view point. In acidic environment the onset potential of oxygen reduction reaction on B-Si-48 was 0.85 V, which correspond to a minimum oxygen reduction reaction over-potential of 0.38 V. The over-potential to oxygen reduction reaction on B-doped Si-48 was lower than over-potential on platinum-based catalysts (0.45 V). Results demonstrated that the B-doped Si-48 is an accepted catalyst to oxygen reduction reaction with high performance.

Clear linear relationship can be found between compressive strength and porosity, and the lines showed a marked change with different 4A zeolite content. The results obtained from ICP indicated that M-4A has a good potential application as recyclable adsorbent materials in the field of heavy metal ion pollution treatment.

AB The transfer of the halogen atom X within (A center dot center dot X center dot center dot A)(+) systems was calculated for A = NH3, OH2, and CH3, and where X = Cl, Br, and I. These potentials are similar to those computed for equivalent proton transfers. Each contains a single symmetric well for short R(A center dot center dot A) distances. As R is stretched a second minimum appears, separated from the first by a transfer barrier E-dagger which climbs quickly as R is elongated. The central X prefers association with the N in asymmetric systems (H3NX center dot center dot OH2)(+), but a second (H3N center dot center dot XOH2)(+) minimum, albeit less stable than the first, can appear if R(N center dot center dot O) is stretched.

AB Metal particle contamination in transformer oil can cause PD. When the size of metal particles changes, it seriously affects all kinds of forces acting on metal particles. The variation of these forces will further affect the trajectory, distribution, and PD of metal particles. This study analyzes PDIV, PRPD Diagram, and Statistical Characteristic Parameters under the condition of different particle sizes. The impact of particle size on the characteristic parameters of PD is examined. The trajectories are simulated in an oil duct when the particle size varies. As the metal particle size increases, the initial discharge voltage decreases, the number and amplitude of discharge increases, the time interval between adjacent discharges shortens, the equivalent cumulative discharge increases, and the signal entropy becomes more complex, which makes PD more intense. Overall, a rise in particle size increases PD possibly because of particle oscillation within the system.

AB A new prescription is given to explore efficient thermoelectric device at molecular-scale level. The system consists of a single molecule having two loops, where each of these loops is subjected to a magnetic flux. The efficiency of a thermoelectric device, measured by the quantity figure of merit, usually referred as ZT, essentially depends on the asymmetric nature of transmission function. Selectively choosing magnetic fluxes, we can achieve highly asymmetric transmission function, which yields reasonably large ZT to satisfy the present demand. Our analysis can be implemented to any two-loop interferometric geometries and higher-loop systems as well.

AB When creating an estimation model, determining which variables are efficient is of considerable importance. To strictly select efficient variables, it is necessary to define appropriate criteria for the task and to perform an exhaustive search, which is the search method that evaluates and compares all variable combinations. In this study, we apply an exhaustive search with a Gaussian process (ES-GP) to estimate coordination energy, which is related to performance of a Li-ion battery, and show that the estimation accuracy of ES-GP is significantly better than that of other methods in previous studies, such as MLR, LASSO and ES-LiR.

AB Transient absorption spectra of 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in aromatic liquids (benzene, toluene, m-xylene, and mesitylene) were measured in sub-nanosecond time resolution. Upon photoexcitation at 355 nm, exciplexes between TCNB and the aromatic liquids formed quickly, and we observed characteristic absorption bands due to a TCNB radical anion in the visible wavelength range and charge resonance (CR) absorption bands due to aggregate radical cations of the donor molecules in the near-IR wavelength range. The peak positions of the CR bands for the exciplexes differed significantly from those of the dimer radical cations of the corresponding donor molecules, indicating that positive charge was delocalized among more than two donor molecules. The TCNB radical anion decomposed efficiently within the lifetime of the exciplexes, and the positive charge remained in the aromatic liquids after the decomposition. Thus, we could observe CR bands due to positive charge (holes) in the aromatic liquids. From the peak positions of the CR bands, we were able to draw some conclusions regarding the delocalization of positive charge in aromatic liquids.

AB The packed-acid mechanism has been recently proposed as a proton conduction mechanism in environments with a high concentration of proton donors, whereby protons are conducted via acid-acid interaction. The acid-acid interaction was originally stated to occur only when a hydrogen bond (H-bond) is formed directly between proton donors. This study clarifies that proton donors can indirectly interact with each other through several H-bonds, even when the donors are separated distantly (indirect acid-acid interactions). Ab initio calculations confirmed that indirect interaction make a non-negligible contribution to proton diffusivity.

AB We present electric field effects on the optical field-dependent dielectric function of phosphorene. We use a two-band model and the Kubo formula to obtain refractive index and absorption coefficient. From our findings, the refraction (absorption) along the armchair direction is smaller (larger) than the zigzag direction for the optical energies close to and larger than the band gap. Moreover, we find that for frequencies beneath the band gap, dynamical dielectric function decreases with the electric field independent of the orientation, whereas there is a strong anisotropic treatment above the band gap.

AB After the successful electrochemical intercalation of C-60 with sodium, we report here the preparation of novel negative electrodes for Na-ion batteries composed by commercial C-60:C-70 mixture, this being significantly less expensive than pure fullerenes. An optimized solid-state Na-poly(ethylene oxide) electrolyte was used for the battery assembly. While pure C-60 electrodes show a strong irreversible behavior after the first discharge, the peculiar disordered crystalline arrangement of C-60 and C-70 in the mixture, increased by a high-energy ball milling treatment, allows to improve the specific capacity at the first discharge up to 320 mAh/g, as well as the overall reversibility.

Experimental parameters were analysed. With an optimized medium, the peaks are gradually raised by increasing the concentration (1-10 nM). The obtained LOD (limit of detection) are 0.06 (Cd2+) and 0.04 nM (Pb2+). The sensitivity achieved for the PrGO/AuNPs/Sal-Cys/GCE was 2.2 mu A/nM for Cd2+ and 3.2 mu A/nM for Pb2+. Eventually, the PrGO/AuNPs/Sal-Cys/GCE was well comfortable for the synchronous determination of target analysts in water samples.

Three phycobiliproteins and one phycobilin were investigated via THG ratio gamma measurements, revealing phycocyanobilin has similar to 7x higher gamma than beta-carotene, a standard THG dye. Phycobiliproteins also had large. values, showing they are promising THG dyes. Stoichiometric summations of phycobilin gamma values revealed they are the dominant source of THG signal from phycobiliproteins. THG imaging was performed to demonstrate phycobiliproteins and phycobilins can be useful THG dyes.

Gas chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) was used to follow the concentrations of the reactants during experiments. The rate coefficients were computed using CVT/SCT/ISPE method. The product analysis for the title reaction was carried out using GC-MS and GC-IR as analytical tools. Based on the obtained products, the probable degradation reaction mechanism for the reaction of ethyl butyrate with Cl atom in the troposphere was proposed. Thermochemistry, branching ratios, atmospheric implications and cumulative lifetimes were also calculated.

AB The influence of O-2 molecules adsorption on 2D CoDT and RhDT surface were investigated via ab initio calculations. It turns out that upon the chemically adsorption of O-2 molecules, semiconductive CoDT and RhDT with a band gap of respectively 0.218 and 0.101 eV both become metallic, while their magnetic moment on each metal atom will respectively decrease from 1.0 to 0.2 mu(B) and increase from 0.0 to 0.1 mu(B). This may render a convenient approach of "oxygen doping/spintronics" at ambient conditions, where selective functionalizations of 2D MOFs can be realized as their specific domains are exposed to atmosphere.

AB We study the electronic and optical properties of narrow energy gap blue dyes, R6, featuring a stronger electron-donating poly-aromatic hydrocarbon, 9,19-dihydrobenzo[1', 10'] phenanthro[3', 4':4,5] thieno[3,2-b]-benzo [1,10] phenanthro[3,4-d] thiophene (BPT2), and R4, featuring 4H', 4' H-2,2'-bibenzo[1.10] phenanthro[4,3-b] thiophene (2BPT). BPT2 and 2BPT are tethered with an auxiliary diarylamine electron donor and an electron acceptor of 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,4] thiadiazol-4-yl) benzoic acid, respectively. We explore these dyes with varying acceptor moieties, along with their binding interaction, at a TiO2 anatase-101 surface. All isolated dye molecules absorbed light in 1.97-2.14 eV range, although their binding-to-anatase affinities were very similar; for all absorbed dyes, valance-band maxima and the conduction-band minima of the composites system are mainly localized on dye and the TiO2-slab, respectively.

AB We present the exact dynamics of a diffusing probability distribution in a coupled two-state system. The motion of the distribution is governed by coupled Smoluchowski equations. We propose a time-domain method which is exactly analytical and can be applied to arbitrary initial probability distribution. In this paper, the method is applied to the case of Gaussian initial condition and when the coupling function is a finite strength Dirac delta function. The two potential curves are assumed to be flat. The exact analytical expressions for probability distribution are presented which are usually evaluated numerically. We verify our results numerically.

AB In this paper, the decomposition mechanism of Thiourea dioxide (TDO) aqueous solution in 25-95 degrees C temperature range were studied in detail by electrode potential method, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), Raman spectroscopy and quantum chemistry calculations. Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) were used to reveal the effect of temperature on the reduction performance of TDO. TOF-MS and Raman spectroscopy were used to determine the chemical constituents of TDO solution at different temperatures. Quantum chemistry calculations were used to assign Raman spectra. This work provides solid theoretical and experimental evidences for the decomposition mechanism of TDO in moisture-hot condition.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the molecular target for the first-line drugs employed in treating Alzheimer's disease. A series of AChE inhibitors, designed from cardanol, a derivative of the cashew nut shell liquid, exhibits a promising inhibitory profile. By means of electronic structure calculations and principal component analysis (PCA) we pointed out the key physicochemical properties underlying the experimental data. Furthermore, by performing molecular docking into AChE's equilibrium ensemble and analyzing the distributions of energies versus root-mean-square deviation (RSMD), we noticed that the ligands assume a dual binding mode characteristic. We hope our findings contribute to the development of more potent inhibitors.

ID TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES
AB Metallic nanowire-dielectric composite has shown superior potential applications based on the excellent transport properties. However, the mechanism of heat conduction in such composite is still unclear due to the complicated percolation network. In this study, we proposed a method to equal the percolation network by a conductor with same conductance and opened nanowires under mass conservation. The contributions of the conductor and opened nanowires are estimated by Wiedemann-Franz law and effective medium approach. The results of present model are in excellent agreement with the numerical calculation of random walker algorithm.

AB The ability of density functional theory (DFT) based methods to predict the multiplet splitting arising from the core hole ionization of molecules such as NO and O-2, exhibiting an open shell grounds state, is explored. In the NO molecule, N(1s) or O(1s) ionization leads to (3)Pi and (1)Pi multiplets whereas for O-2, the presence of an O(1s) core hole leads to doublet and quartet multiplets with distinct BEs. Multiplet splittings obtained using different exchange-correlation functionals show an overall good agreement with experiment and minor variations within the functionals studied when spin contamination resulting from unrestricted DFT calculations is accounted for.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have aroused extensive attentions as an important sensing material, owing to their extraordinary properties, exploited for detecting a specific gas among a variety of ones through diverse gas responses. Boron and Nitrogen have been proved to be the best dopant in carbon materials, especially in sensing applications. In the present work, a pristine (10, 0) SWCNT and its Boron/Nitrogen functionalized counterpart have been investigated for toxic H2S gas sensing, using density functional theory based ab-inito approach. The analysis has been performed using generalized gradient approximations, parameterized with Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof type parameterization. The variation in electronic properties, discussed in terms of band structure, Mulliken population, interfrontier orbitals, adsorption energy and corresponding conductance variation has been analysed as the sensing parameters. The computed positive adsorption energy confirms a physical adsorption of H2S on modeled CNT in its pristine as well as boron and nitrogen functionalized counterparts. To understand a relative sensitivity profile of these three nanotubes towards a single H2S molecule, variation in its electronic properties at different distances of H2S molecule within optimized range, has systematically been analyzed. The sensitivity as well as recovery time of pristine CNT is found better in comparison to its Boron and Nitrogen functionalized counterparts.

AB To investigate the potential of the recently reported spinel-type Na3LiTi5O12 (NTO) phase as a battery anode, its geometric and electronic structures were clarified and compared with those of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), which is a well-known oxide anode material for Li-ion batteries. The lattice constant of NTO was calculated to be larger than that of LTO, whereas the corresponding electronic structures were similar. This result implies that similarly to LTO, NTO is well suited for use as an anode material and is expected to be a good candidate for the anodes of Naion batteries.

AB The reaction of N2O with NO3 is studied for the first time using high-level quantum chemical calculations, followed by statistical rate coefficient estimations. Two reaction pathways giving NO2 + N-2 + O-2 and NO2 + 2NO have been explored. The formation of NO2 + N-2 + O-2 is exothermic by 30 kcal mol(-1) while that of NO2 + 2NO is endothermic by 13 kcal mol(-1). Both mechanisms have significant reaction barriers, and the reaction rate constants are very low: about 6 x 10(-43) cm(3) s(-1) at 298 K. Therefore, this reaction is not expected to affect the lifetime of N2O in the atmosphere.

AB Vibrationally resolved cation spectra of p-chloroanisole were recorded by ionizing via four vibronic levels through two-color resonant two-photon mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectroscopy techniques. The results indicated that the geometry and molecular vibrations 7a, 16b, and 6a of p-chloroanisole in the cationic ground D-0 state resemble those in the electronically excited neutral S-1 state. The precisely measured adiabatic ionization energy of this molecule was less than that of p-fluoroanisole by 325 cm(-1). This can be labeled as a heavy atom effect, which is similar to that observed for para halogen-substituted phenol and aniline.

AB The functionalized gold nanoparticles (FGNPs) behaviour in biological environments is completely altered by the presence of protein corona. Avoid its formation is required to design NP surface to specific targets. In the present work we investigated, by using atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, the interfacial structural properties of a FGNP in physiological solutions. The behaviour of three zwitterionic sulfobetaine, proved to avoid protein corona formation, is compared with pegylated one. MD simulations describe a change in shape, named "chain blossom" as function of the bulkiness and hydrophobicity of sulfobetaine headgroup and its effect on the FNGP surface properties is discussed.

DT Article
DE Fisher information; Relativistic hydrogenic atoms; Radial electron
   density; Inverse participation ratio
AB We calculate Fisher information and the inverse participation ratio normalised by the electric binding energy for the relativistic hydrogenic atoms based on the radial wavefunctions in position space. Fisher information rapidly decreases as the atomic number increases, but it increases again for heavy atoms for S-1/2 and P-1/2 states due to the relativistic effect. We consider not only the ground state but also excited states by numerically evaluating the generalised Laguerre polynomials in the exact Dirac's relativistic radial wavefunctions. This study contrasts with the previous studies of the relativistic many-electron systems (i.e., ground-state neutral atoms), where numerical densities were employed.

AB We report the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and the local electronic properties of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT) using density functional theory. Our analysis shows that there is a strong size-dependence of the BDE of these SWCNTs, which is inversely proportional to the radius-squared (1/r(2)) and the length (1/l) of SWCNT. We derive quantitative relationships from which the BDE can be calculated as a function of size and radius of the SWCNT. We find that the BDE of SWCNT outside the size-dependent region is about 480 kJ mol(-1), which can be used for thermochemical calculations.

AB We investigate the spin-polarized transport through the systems with protein-like single-helical molecules. It shows that the spin polarization property and efficiency tightly depend on the geometries of the systems of single-helical molecules. When one molecule is serially coupled to two leads, the inter-lead coupling assists to magnify the spin polarization efficiency, and the polarization direction can be adjusted by the local magnetic flux. However in the other geometries, no apparent spin polarization is driven, such as the T-shaped structure with inter-lead coupling and parallel coupled structures. These results reflect the nontrivial effect of structure-dependence quantum interference on the spin polarization driven by the single-helical molecule.

At reaction time of 6 h, the carbon sphere displayed uniform diameter of 800 nm. After removal of carbon core during calcination, it obtained 600 nm of gamma-Al2O3 hollow sphere with shell thickness of 80 nm and surface area of 186 m(2)/g. For adsorption of methylene blue, material exhibited adsorption capacity of 26.5 +/- 1.2 mg/g, fitting well with Langmuir isotherm. It is demonstrated that calcining carbon template was an effective and facile approach to obtain hollow sphere material.

AB Developing a environmental and cost-effective adsorbents for removal of Cu(II) from industrial wastewater is a quite serious problem. This study prepared a novel adsorbent of chitosan-cellulose enwrapped magnetic carbon foam (CCMF) to remove Cu(II) from industrial sewage. Magnetic core-shell construction facilitated the solid-liquid separation after adsorption. Groups of adsorption experiments for the adsorbability of CCMF were systematically studied at various conditions, such as pH (3.0-6.0), adsorbent dosage (1.0-4.0 g/L), initial concentration of Cu(II) (25-600 mg/L), temperature (20-30 degrees C) and adsorption time (10-1800 min). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that the amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan were involved in the adsorption reaction and that N and O atoms were the adsorption sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed that the N atom was the main adsorption site. The adsorption isotherm of Cu(II) on the CCMF was well correlated with the Langmuir isotherm model, the adsorption processes were a monolayer reaction and controlled by homogeneous adsorption sites on the surface, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 115.65 mg/g at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C. The adsorption process of Cu(II) on the CCMF followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation within the initial 120 min. Meanwhile, the entire process fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Results have demonstrated that CCMF is a potential environmental adsorbent for the removal of Cu(II) in industry wastewater.

AB A thermodynamic study on the formation of the silicon nanoclusters Sin with n = 2-13 in a gas phase is presented. It is demonstrated that the formation of the silicon nanoclusters Si-6, Si-7, and Si-10 is the most favorable in a quite broad range of the temperature and silicon pressure. Decreasing the temperature and increasing the partial pressure of the monoatomic silicon leads to increasing the number of atoms in the silicon nanocluster as well as to sharpening the nanoclusters distribution. An approach to control the size of the silicon nanoclusters and their distribution is presented.

AB The adsorption of water molecules on mineral green pigment (MGP) was investigated by using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The lowest-energy structures of mineral green pigment and hydrated complexes are identified, and the adsorption of water molecules on MGP forms the ring fragment with two O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. These hydrated complexes are very stable against dissociation into water molecule, while the coordinations of water molecules to Cu atoms can largely enhance the structural stability of these complexes, and affect the electronic structures of hydrated complexes. The UV-vis adsorption spectra of these complexes have been simulated based on the DFT calculations.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a direct-to-patient telemedicine service that enabled people to obtain medical abortion without visiting an abortion provider in person.
   Study design: We offered the service in five states. Each participant had a videoconference with a study clinician and had pre-treatment laboratory tests and ultrasound at facilities of her choice. If the participant was eligible for medical abortion, the clinician sent a package containing mifepristone, misoprostol, and instructions to her by mail. After taking the medications, the participant obtained follow-up tests and had a follow-up consultation with the clinician by telephone or videoconference to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive.
   Results: Over 32 months, we conducted 433 study screenings and shipped 248 packages. The median interval between screening and mailing was 7 days (91st percentile 17 days), and no participant took the mifepristone at 71 days of gestation. We ascertained abortion outcomes of 190/248 package recipients (77%): 177/190 (93%) had complete abortion without a procedure. Of the 217/248 package recipients who provided meaningful follow-up data (88%), one was hospitalized for postoperative seizure and another for excessive bleeding, and 27 had other unscheduled clinical encounters, 12 of which resulted in no treatment. A total of 159/248 participants who received packages (64%) completed satisfaction questionnaires at study exit; all were satisfied with the service.
   Conclusions: This direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion service was safe, effective, efficient, and satisfactory. The model has the potential to increase abortion access by enhancing the reach of providers and by offering people a new option for obtaining care conveniently and privately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To evaluate outcomes with mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24-48 h later by misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally for medical abortion at 64-70 days of gestation.
   Study design: We reviewed electronic databases and medical records for medical abortion cases at 64-70 days' gestation at British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinics in England and Wales from May 2015 through October 2016. Women selected in-office follow-up or self-evaluation of abortion outcome using a checklist along with low-sensitivity urine pregnancy testing. We excluded cases in which we could not locate records and when women did not proceed with medical abortion, did not use misoprostol following mifepristone if abortion had not occurred and did not attend a scheduled follow-up assessment. We analyzed demographic characteristics, treatment outcomes and significant adverse events. We defined treatment success as complete abortion without surgical evacuation and without continuing pregnancy.
   Results: Of 2743 cases identified, we could not locate 40 charts and excluded 30 cases, leaving a final sample of 2673. Overall, 2538 (94.9%, 95% Cl 94.1-95.8) women had a successful medical abortion. Reasons for failure included continuing pregnancy (n=90, 3.4%, 95% CI 2.7-4.1), retained nonviable pregnancy (n=2, 0.1%, 95% CI 0-0.2) and incomplete abortion (n=43, 1.6%, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). Of those with continuing pregnancies, 81 underwent a uterine aspiration and 9 opted to continue the pregnancy. Thirty-five (1.3%, 95% CI 0.9-1.7) women had significant adverse events; 16 (0.6%, 95% CI 03-0.9) underwent an in-hospital aspiration. Pelvic infection (n=4, 0.2%) and transfusion (n=1, 0.03%) occurred rarely.
   Conclusion: Medical abortion from 64 to 70 days with mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol is effective with a low rate of serious adverse events. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To examine trends and utilization patterns of NYC abortion services by nonresidents since growing abortion restrictions across many states could drive women to seek care in less restrictive jurisdictions including NYC.
   Study design: We used data from Induced Termination of Pregnancy certificates filed with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in 2005-2015. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was fit to the monthly nonresident abortion rate time series. Pearson's chi 2 tests determined associations between women's residence and other variables.
   Results: During 2005-2015, 885,816 abortions were reported in NYC, with 76,990 (8.7%) among nonresidents; 50,211 (65.2%) nonresidents lived in other New York State counties. The NYC abortion rate declined from 49.4 per 1000 women 15-44 in 2005 to 32.7 in 2015, while the nonresident rate showed minimal change from 0.12 per 1000 US women 15-44 in 2005 to 0.10 in 2015. ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,1)1121 fit the time series indicating minimal monthly changes in nonresident rates reflecting seasonal patterns and shorter-term dependencies between successive observations. Nonresidents differed from residents in all investigated variables including terminating at 20+ weeks (9.0% vs. 2.5%, p<.001) and having procedural methods (87.2% vs. 82.2%, p<.001).
   Conclusions: Nonresidents constituted few abortion patients in NYC with minimal change in nonresident rates in 2005-2015. Nonresidents more often sought later-term abortions and more complicated procedures posing greater associated costs/risks. Monitoring nonresident abortion trends and utilization patterns is valuable for planning local service delivery particularly in jurisdictions committed to providing comprehensive women's healthcare where nonresidents may increasingly seek abortions.

AB Objective: Among family physicians who graduated from residencies with abortion training, we explore the association between intention to provide abortion at the end of residency and abortion provision 5 years postresidency.
   Study design: We invited 2009-2012 graduates from US family medicine residency programs with a required opt out abortion training rotation or elective abortion training opportunities, and who had completed a baseline end of-residency survey (N=477) to take our follow-up survey 5 years postresidency (2014-2017). We used logistic regression to examine the association between intention to provide abortion postresidency and abortion provision 5 years later.
   Results: One hundred and seventy-two of 477 (36.1%) family physicians responded to our survey. More responders compared to nonresponders had intended to provide uterine aspiration and medication abortion at baseline (p <<.01) and attended residency in states considered hostile and middle ground toward abortion rights (p=.03). Of the 155 eligible respondents for analysis, 27.1% offered some type of abortion care in their practice. Of those that provided abortion, 100% provided medication abortion and 71.4% uterine aspiration. Most respondents that provided uterine aspiration abortion did so in abortion/family planning clinics or in sites that already established routine abortion care. Those who had intended to provide any abortion care at baseline had 4.03 times the odds of providing any abortion care 5 years later (95% confidence interval: 1.72-9.47). Administrative and systems-level barriers to integrate abortion were mentioned most frequently compared to personal beliefs or safety factors to explain why respondents did not provide abortion.
   Conclusions: We found an association between intention to provide abortion after residency and providing abortion in practice 5 years later. However, only 27.1% of respondents provided some abortion care. Factors beyond intention to provide care appear to inhibit or facilitate family physicians' abilities to practice abortion in primary care. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess beliefs about the safety of oral contraceptives compared to pregnancy to determine if men and women possess accurate information to make informed choices.
   Study design: In each of six surveys conducted in Southern California from 2008 to 2017, participants were asked "Which do you think is more hazardous to a woman's health - birth control pills or pregnancy?"
   Results: A total of 28.4% of all 1839 male and female respondents and 29.1% of the 1712 female respondents answered correctly that the health risks posed by pregnancy were greater. In subgroup analyses, 64.4%-81.9% rated oral contraceptives at least as hazardous to a woman's health as pregnancy.
   Conclusion: The vast majority of respondents incorrectly believed that oral contraceptives are more hazardous than pregnancy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To compare unintended pregnancy rates at 12 months between women receiving structured contraceptive counseling plus usual contraceptive care and women receiving structured contraceptive counseling, healthcare provider education and cost support for long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods.
   Study design: Using a controlled time-trend study design, we first enrolled 502 women receiving structured contraceptive counseling in addition to usual care ("Enhanced Care") and subsequently enrolled 506 women receiving counseling plus healthcare provider education and cost support for LARC methods ("Complete CHOICE") at three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Cost support included funds to health centers for "on-the shelf" LARC methods and no-cost LARC methods for uninsured women. Participants completed in-person baseline surveys and follow-up surveys by telephone at 3, 6 and 12 months. We used Kaplan-Meier survival function to estimate 12-month unintended pregnancy rates and Cox proportional-hazards regression to compare un-intended pregnancy rates between the two groups. We imputed pregnancy outcomes for women lost to followup (9%) prior to 12 months.
   Results: "Complete CHOICE" participants were less likely to report an unintended pregnancy at 12 months compared to "Enhanced Care"; 5.3 vs. 9.8 pregnancies per 100 women-years (p=.01). After adjusting for confounders (recruitment site, race, age and federal poverty level), women in "Complete CHOICE" had a 40% lower risk of unintended pregnancy at 12 months (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60; 95% confidence interval 037-0.99).
   Conclusions: Contraceptive provision that includes cost support and healthcare provider education in addition to patient counseling reduced unintended pregnancy at 12 months compared to counseling plus usual contraceptive care. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To examine contraceptive methods used across sexual orientation groups.
   Study Design: We collected data from 118,462 female participants in two longitudinal cohorts-the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) 2 (founded in 1989, participants born 1947-1964) and NHS3 (founded in 2010, born 1965-1995). We used log-binomial models to estimate contraceptive methods ever used across sexual orientation groups and cohorts, adjusting for age and race.
   Results: Lesbians were the least likely of all sexual orientation groups to use any contraceptive method. Lesbians in NHS2 were 90% less likely than heterosexuals to use long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs; adjusted risk ratio [aRR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 [0.04, 0.26]) and results were similar for other contraceptive methods and in the NHS3 cohort. Compared to the reference group of completely heterosexual participants with no same-sex partners, those who identified as completely heterosexual with same-sex partners, mostly heterosexual, or bisexual were generally more likely to use any method of contraception. Use of LARCs was especially striking across sexual minority groups, and, with the exception of lesbians, they were more likely to use LARCs; as one illustration, NHS3 bisexuals were more than twice as likely to use LARCs (aRR [95% CI]: 2.01 [1.67, 2.42]).
   Conclusions: While certain sexual minority subgroups (e.g., bisexuals) were more likely than heterosexuals to use contraceptive methods such as LARCs, lesbians were less likely to use any method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English

   abortion; South Africa
ID 2ND; HEALTH; PREGNANCY; SERVICES; CARE; 1ST
AB Objectives: To identify key delays and associated factors in women's pathway to second-trimester abortion that could inform strategies to increase earlier presentation.
   Study design: We performed a secondary analysis using data collected from May 2012 to June 2013 as part of a randomized controlled trial among women having abortion at 13.0-20.0 weeks at a public hospital in South Africa. We used ultrasound and participant interview data to calculate 3 key intervals: (1) conception to suspicion of pregnancy, (2) suspicion to first healthcare visit for abortion, and (3) first healthcare visit to abortion procedure. We compared intervals for women at 13-15.0 weeks versus 15.1-20.0 weeks gestation at abortion using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and tested for associations between gestational age at key events using multivariable linear regression.
   Results: Median (interquartile range[IQR]) durations for the 3 intervals among women at 13-15 weeks (n=93) compared to 15.1-20 weeks (n=63) gestation were: (1) 36 days (IQR 21-53 days) versus 62 days (36-71 days), p<.001; (2) 29 days (IQR 15-46 days) versus 23 days (IQR 11-39 days), p=.64; (3) 14 days (IQR 7-21 days) versus 14 days (IQR 12-21 days), p=.32. Multivariable logistic regression showed marginal associations between gestational age at suspicion of pregnancy and no prior pregnancy (aOR=3.8, 95% CI 1.0-14.6) and living in informal housing (aOR=3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.1). Gestational age on the day of the abortion procedure was significantly associated with living in informal housing (aOR=3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.6).
   Conclusion: The only differences in delay in obtaining second trimester abortion between South African women having an earlier and later second trimester procedure is due to longer time to suspect pregnancy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method uptake has been low within the context of HIV prevention trials. Within a multinational study (MTN-020/ASPIRE), the Contraceptive Action Team improved LARC accessibility and uptake. In this secondary analysis, we determined the rate of contraceptive method continuation among the women enrolled.
   Study design: ASPIRE was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III safety and effectiveness study of the Dapivirine Vaginal Ring for HIV-1 prevention. Between 2012 and 2014, sexually active women aged 18-45 from Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe were enrolled. All participants were required to use contraception for enrollment to the study and could choose between all highly effective contraceptive methods available in their respective countries. Women were seen monthly and could change methods at any time. Continuation rates from study enrollment to 6 and 12 months were determined.
   Results: The overall contraceptive method continuation rate was 77% (1972/2551) at 6 months and 66% (1694/2551) at 12 months. The 6- and 12-month continuation rates were highest for implantable contraceptives (89%, 82%) followed by copper intrauterine device (83%, 77%). Rates of continuation for injectable contraceptives depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (80%, 69%) and norethisterone enanthate (71%, 54%) were higher than for oral contraceptives, which were continued at 47% at 6 months and 35% at 12 months. The continuation rates of all methods did not differ by users with and without previous contraceptive experience.
   Conclusions: LARC methods have the highest rates of continuation at 12 months and should be routinely offered in the context of HIV prevention trials in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate pregnancy risk following copper (CuT380A) intrauterine device (IUD) placement 6-14 days after unprotected intercourse.
   Study design: We used a combined dataset from four protocols in which participants had received a CuT380A IUD regardless of recent unprotected intercourse. At entry, participants had negative point of care urine pregnancy testing and reported all acts of unprotected intercourse in the two weeks prior to IUD placement. We identified a subset of women who had placement 6-14 days after unprotected intercourse and provided follow-up information on pregnancy status 2-4 weeks after IUD insertion. This follow-up within the four protocols included self-administered home urine pregnancy test (UPT) results 2-4 weeks after IUD placement or continued contact for up to 6 months.
   Results: We identified 134 women who had a CuT380A IUD placed 6-14 days after unprotected intercourse and provided follow-up information on pregnancy status. Ninety-five (71%) participants reported UPT results 2-4 weeks after placement and the other 39 women were followed for 6 months after IUD placement to assess pregnancy status. Zero (97.5% CI 0-2.7%) participants reported a pregnancy within four weeks of CuT380A IUD placement.
   Conclusion: In these collected data, no women with recent unprotected intercourse became pregnant within 1 month of CuT380A IUD placement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Ulipristal acetate compared to levonorgestrel emergency contraception

AB Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and levonorgestrel (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) on pregnancy prevention among combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill users with an extended pill-free interval. We accounted for the potential interaction of COCs and obesity on EC efficacy.
   Methods: We built a decision-analytic model using TreeAge software to evaluate the optimal oral EC strategy in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 twenty-five-year-old women midcycle with a prolonged "missed" pill episode (8-14 days). We used a 5-year time horizon and 3% discount rate. From a healthcare perspective, we obtained probabilities, utilities and costs inflated to 2018 dollars from the literature. We set the threshold for cost-effectiveness at a standard $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We included the following clinical outcomes: number of protected cycles, unintended pregnancies, abortions, deliveries and costs.
   Results: We found that UPA was the optimal method of oral EC, as it resulted in 720 fewer unintended pregnancies, 736 fewer abortions and 80 fewer deliveries at a total cost savings of $50,323 and 79 additional adjusted life-years. UPA continued to be the optimal strategy even in the case of obesity or COCs impacting UPA efficacy, in which a COC interaction would have to change efficacy of UPA by 160% before LNG was the dominant strategy.
   Conclusion: Our models found that UPA was the dominant choice of oral EC among COC users with a prolonged "missed" pill episode, regardless of body mass index or an adverse interaction of COCs on UPA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Our objective was to explore knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about pregnancy and contraceptive decision-making among reproductive-aged women with cystic fibrosis.
   Study design: In this qualitative study, we used purposive sampling of reproductive age women enrolled in the Adult Cystic Fibrosis program at Penn Medicine. We conducted semistructured one-on-one interviews lasting 30-60 min. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: We interviewed 24 women. Participants described shortened life span, personal health status and impact of cystic fibrosis on a potential child as three factors that were central to family planning. Future pregnancy intentions, perception of fertility including misconceptions and provider counseling influenced related contraception utilization.
   Conclusions: Women with cystic fibrosis described thoughtful considerations about desired pregnancies to be planned during times of optimal health. Gaps in knowledge may limit a woman's ability to make the most informed family planning decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study is to understand patient-, provider- and system-level factors associated with long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use among women Veterans and with receipt of LARC methods within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system.
   Study design: We analyzed data from a national telephone-based survey of 2302 women ages 18-44 receiving primary care in VA. Multivariable regression was used to examine adjusted associations of participant-reported patient-, provider- and facility-level factors with LARC use and within-VA receipt of LARC among women Veterans.
   Results: Among 987 women Veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy, 294 (30%) reported using LARC, 65% of whom had received their method within VA. Higher LARC use was observed among women who were multiparous vs. nulliparous [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.22] and did not desire future pregnancies (aOR=1.88; 95% CI=1.31-2.68). Although overall LARC uptake was not associated with any provider- or facility-level factors, receipt of these methods within VA was associated with receiving both general and gender-specific health care by a single provider (aOR=2.81; 95% CI=1.20-6.61) and with receiving care within a women's health clinic (aOR=2.54; 95% CI=1.17-5.50).
   Conclusions: While patient-level factors were more strongly correlated with use of LARC, provider- and system level factors influence whether women received these methods within VA. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: The primary aim was to investigate post-use ring weight as a potential measure of cumulative adherence to a progesterone-releasing vaginal ring.
   Study design: We weighed and quantified residual progesterone in 115 vaginal rings following 90-day use by participants in an acceptability trial conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya. The primary objective was to correlate residual progesterone content with post-use ring weight. Secondary objectives included correlating ring weight with putative duration of ring use, and, where participants used two rings consecutively in the study, correlating residual content between these paired rings.
   Results: Mean ring weight and progesterone content of used rings was 8.62 +/- 0.24 g and 1245 +/- 245 mg respectively, versus 9.37 +/- 0.02 and 2058 +/- 21 mg for control rings. Most used rings (90.4%) had residual progesterone levels less than 85% of the nominal loading. Linear regression showed a strong positive linear trend between residual progesterone content and post-use ring weight for all rings (r(2)=0.82). Duration of ring use was inversely associated (p=.00020) with ring weight.
   Conclusions: Post-use ring weight is highly correlated with residual progesterone content, a benchmark objective cumulative measure of adherence, and thus potentially useful as a surrogate objective measure of cumulative adherence to a progesterone-releasing vaginal ring.

AB With an ever-increasing number of reproductive-aged women undergoing solid organ transplant and fertility improving after transplant, knowledge of the safety and efficacy of various contraceptive methods is essential to guide patient selection. We present the case of a 22-year-old patient desiring an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception with a history of liver transplant as a child. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Society for Transplantation (AST) offer conflicting recommendations on the use of IUDs in transplant patients. We review the literature for recommendations on IUD use in this population. While the literature is limited, levonorgestrel (LNG) and copper (Cu) IUDs appear to be safe and effective in solid organ transplant patients, with no evidence of unintended pregnancies or complications compared to those without organ transplant. Ultimately, patient preference should be the primary consideration in contraceptive choice, including between LNG or Cu-IUD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These idiopathic and chronic diseases result from inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and are mainly mediated by the immune system. Genome wide association studies link genes of the IL-12 and IL-23 biology to both CD and UC susceptibility. IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines share a functional subunit, p40, and their respective receptors also share a functional subunit, IL-12R beta 1. However, clinical trials targeting p40, and thus inhibiting both IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, provided mitigated effects on IBD, suggesting context dependent effects for each cytokine. In addition to IL-12 and IL-23, genetic deficiencies in IL-10 also result in severe IBD pathology. We generated various mouse models to determine how IL-12 or IL-23 interacts with IL-10 in IBD pathology. Whereas defects in both IL-10 and IL-12R do not impact the severity of the Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, combined deficiencies in both IL-10 and IL-23R aggravate the disease. In contrast to DSS-induced colitis, defects in IL-12R and IL-23R both protect from the spontaneous colitis observed in IL10(-/-) mice. Together, these studies exemplify the complexity of genetic and environmental interactions for identifying biological pathways predictive of pathological inflammatory processes.

AB In the present work, a method for the simultaneous enantioselective separation of bupropion (BUP) and hydroxybupropion (HBUP) by capillary electrophoresis (CE) was developed. After the optimization process, the best results found were: 75 mmol L-1 phosphate BGE at pH 7.0; 4.0 mg mL(-1) for the sulfated-beta-cyclodextrin (S-beta-CD). This experimental protocol provided the best resolution values (Rs(1) = 2.06, Rs(2) = 5.62 and Rs(3) = 6.68). From the theoretical calculations, based on the energetic and structural obtained results, it was possible to point out, on the molecular level, the migration order of BUP and HBUP enantiomers.

AB In this study, an effective and low-cost one-step synthesis procedure of the metal-carbon nanocomposite based on Fe-Co bimetallic nanoparticles and IR treated chitosan as a catalyst for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was demonstrated. It was revealed that chitosan can act as a metal reducing agent and stabilizing matrix. The chemical transformations in the polymer, the structural evolution of the Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles and their phase composition depended on synthesis temperature were studied. The catalytic results showed that Fe-Co bimetallic nanoparticles supported on chitosan-based carbon were highly active in the CO conversion to hydrocarbons and selective towards gasoline and olefins fractions.

AB Herein, we have designed and studied a series of DPP based D-A type oligomers. We have joined the DPP (acceptor) and thiophene (donor) by an azomethine linkage to facilitate the charge transportation. Dihedral angles, Delta(H-L), IP, EA, lambda, k(CT), mu(hop) values and spectral properties are calculated to examine the effect of the substituents (+ I and - I groups). We have also calculated the pi-coherence length of the oligomers. Results show that both electron withdrawing and donating substituents are capable of better tuning the optoelectronic properties of the proposed oligomers. In short, our designed materials will act as potential candidates for fabrication of optoelectronic devices.

AB We perform quantum chemical calculations for the Cs+, K+, and Na+ complexes of norbadione A (NBA), a pigment molecule in mushrooms known to accumulate Cs+. A numerical two-step approach, by Ota et al., is employed to examine its alkali-metal-cation complexation selectivity in aqueous solutions. Applying it to the neutral, di- and tetra-deprotonated NBAs, we confirm that the complexation selectivity on Cs+ emerges only in high pHs, in which the di-protonated NBA dominates, in agreement with experimental results. This is the first demonstration of the approach for a biological molecule whose selectivity is known to be anomalous.

The as-obtained HPC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 235.5 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability with a capacitance retention of 58.6% at 50 A g(-1). This research may deliver a scalable avenue for the design of novel carbon-based nanoarchitecture materials and effective utilization of abundant petroleum pitch resources for energy storage.

AB The surface plasmon facilitated intermolecular hydrogen bonds enhancement of fluorobromobenzaldehyde (FBB) isomers on Ag nanoparticles have been investigated by means of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Comparing the SERS spectra and normal Raman scattering (NRS) spectra, the intensity of the O center dot center dot center dot H bending vibration peak was found to be clearly enhanced, and a new C-O peak appeared in the SERS spectrum. The C=O stretching vibration Raman spectrum reduced. We surmise that intermolecular hydrogen bonds are strengthened, due to the surface plasmon effect generated hot electrons act on the aldehyde group. Our work may promote further investigations on intra/intermolecular hydrogen-bonded chemical systems.

AB Cu2O micro-nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated at low-temperature. The experimental results show that the Cu2O has excellent decolorization rate for methyl orange (MO) under both non-light and visible conditions. Through analysis, It found that the catalysis of Cu2O is an electron-sensitization process. Under light condition, the nuclear structure tends to regenerate Cu2O, while under non-light condition, it tends to change to CuO. The reaction temperature will affect the morphology of Cu2O. The synergism between different exposed crystal planes makes the potential energy barrier between Cu2O and CuO increased, which improves the stability and catalytic activity.

AB CIS(D-infinity) method provides reasonable valence excitation energies, but fails for Rydberg states. A corrected CIS(D-infinity) method is proposed where excitation energies are calculated based on the energy expression in EOM-CCSD(2) using wavefunctions from CIS(D-infinity). Its performance on singlet and triplet valence and Rydberg excitation energies is investigated by comparing with CC3 results. Excitation energies with this method are always overcorrected. On the other hand, reasonable valence and Rydberg excitation energies will be achieved when the energy correction is halved. This method has a non-iterative N-6 scaling and can serve as an economical method in studying both valence and Rydberg excitations.

Therefore the effective minority carrier lifetime (tau(eff)) of silicon wafer increases from 259 us to 273 us. Replace it with textured c-Si, the weighted reflectance of silicon increases to 15.9% from 11.97%; and tau(eff) is also up to the highest value of 437 us at 1000 s from 221 us of as-prepared textured silicon.

AB Polyynes were synthesized by arc discharge between two copper electrodes in alkanes for the first time. The as-grown polyyne samples were separated through high-performance liquid chromatography and the size-selected polyynes C2nH2 (n = 4-6) were investigated by surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy. The formation rate of polyynes has been found to increase with rising carbon-hydrogen ratio of the alkanes, and the alkanes affect the length of polyyne chains. The reaction enthalpy from alkane to C-2 radicals decreases with increasing carbon-hydrogen ratio, which causes the energy consumption in the whole reaction to differ and leads to different formation rates.

AB We studied the sequencing of nucleobases upon passage through the silicene nanopores using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism along with density functional theory. The silicene nanosheet is segmented into three regions, where the nanopore is created, and the edges of nanopore are functionalized with hydrogen. The density of states, transmission spectrum, and current-voltage characteristics are studied, and the variation in the magnitude of current leads to identify the type of nucleobase. The results of the proposed study clearly indicate silicene sheets with nanopore can be used to sequence the DNA or RNA passing through it.

AB Using TDDFT method, modulating mechanism of NeH-based excited-state intramolecular proton transfer by electron-withdrawing substituent cyano at the aromatic para-position of four 2-(2'-aminophenyl) benzothiazole compounds have been demonstrated at B3LYP/6-311+ G(d, p)/IEFPCM theory level. The scanned potential energy curves reveal that introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group tosyl at the amino nitrogen can remarkably facilitate the occurrence of the ESIPT reaction, whereas introduction of a weak electron-withdrawing group acetyl at the amino nitrogen or introduction of an electron-withdrawing cyano group on the benzene ring at the para-position with respect to the amino group can contribute to the ESIPT process in certain degree.

AB The electrostatic interaction of metal nanoparticles with viruses is attracting great interest due to their antiviral activity and their role in enhancing the detection of viruses at ultra-low concentrations. We model the MS2 virus devoid of its single strand RNA core using a core-shell model. The dependence of the inner and outer surface charge density on the pH is taken into account in our model of the interaction. Varying the pH causes a change in the sign of the outer surface charge leading to the attractive-repulsive transition in the electrostatic interaction between the MS2 virus and metal nanoparticle at pH = 4.

AB The protein-protein interactions induced by cation specific effects were characterized by the rotational diffusion analysis. The rotational diffusion coefficient, Drot, estimated by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescent- labeled lysozyme was reduced responding to monovalent cation chlorides and was able to be approximated by quadratic functions of lysozyme concentration. The resultant first and second terms of lysozyme concentration were observed to be negative and positive according to the species and concentrations of monovalent cations, respectively. These two hydrodynamic interaction parameters demonstrated that the attractive and also repulsive interactions were induced between lysozymes in the order of inverse Hofmeister effect.

AB Herein, we compared the catalyst formation process of three Pt/TiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation (PtTi-I), deposition precipitation (PtTi-D) and photo-deposition (PtTi-P) to investigate its effect on oxgyen activation and toluene oxidation activity. The encapsulation of TiO2 on Pt particles induced by high temperature strengthened the metal-support interaction (MSI) but inhibited the activation of oxygen over PtTi-I catalyst, thus it showed the poorest activity in toluene oxidation. Since the selective deposition of Pt on certain face of TiO2 during photo-deposition process, PtTi-P exhibited stronger MSI and higher activity although it possessed much larger Pt particles than PtTi-D.

In either of the two systems, a stable hydrogen bonds network is formed near the DH-PH interface, contributing to maintaining the autoinhibited conformation of TrioC.

AB CCl4-solvated C-60 crystals with hexagonal shape were grown by the liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation method with CCl4 and toluene as poor and good solvents, respectively. Interestingly, the morphology of the hexagonal crystals with the growth liquid are drastically changed with drying in air. A lot of fine rod crystals appear over the original crystals with air-drying, whereas the hexagonal outline of the original crystals is kept even after the transformation. Such change in the morphology is explained by the solvent-mediated phase transformation due to the dissolution of the original crystals by toluene and then re-precipitation of the rod crystals.

AB The correlation energy in LiH and LiH+ molecules is studied as a function of bond distance, from the united atom limit to the complete bond dissociation, using customized basis sets and Full Configuration Interaction. The analysis reveals an unusual complexity of the correlation energy dependence on the bond distance. The obtained accurate correlation energy profiles are used to study the performance of the established correlation models. The density functional models are found to be reasonably accurate in the description of LiH molecule, and are deficient in LiH+.

AB Perovskite solutions that were doped with potassium (K) salts (CH3NH3)(0.8)(HC(NH2)(2))(0.1)K0.1PbI3 (MA(0.8)FA(0.1)K(0.1)PbI(3)(Cl)) were used to fabricate perovskite solar cells. The addition of the K salts resulted in fine grained perovskite crystals that were separated by very small gaps. These materials were used to fabricate solar cells that improved short circuit current densities, which resulted in an enhanced conversion efficiency, compared with standard materials. The K occupied the (CH3NH3)/(HC(NH2) defects within the perovskite crystals, which caused the lattice constant to increase. Additionally, the presence of K in the perovskite solutions promoted the growth of grains within the perovskite crystals.

AB N-doped carbon hollow microspheres (NCMs) have been prepared by a facile water-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process using melamine as both the carbon precursor and N-dopant and ferrocene as both the catalyst and carbon precursor. It is shown that the size of the NCMs can be tuned just by changing the annealing temperature of the CVD furnace. The atomic percentage of nitrogen doping in NCMs could be achieved to 7.85% without sacrificing the hollow spherical structure. Probable growth mechanism of NCMs was proposed in this paper. The work reported here may pave a way for designing novel various atom-doped carbon microspheres.

AB We report for the first time the use of the singlet oxygen sensor green for the evaluation of the generation of singlet oxygen from fullerenes and gold hybrids. The ratiometric response of the sensor with a series of fullerene derivatives was investigated. Mono adducts of C-60 and C-70 decorated with various functional groups and a terminal thiol group were coupled with gold nanoparticles. The forbidden singlet-to-triplet transition that manifest in a singlet oxygen generation was investigated before and after the addition of gold nanoparticles. We also studied the Lu3N@C-80, functionalized with a pyrene group albeit without a terminal thiol.

AB We observed plastic deformation of diamond by mechanical twinning at temperatures substantially below the Debye temperature. Twinning occurred during the processing in a planetary mill of nano-diamond with an average grain size of 10 nm mixed with silicon. Under the experimental conditions, the maximum stresses in diamond are limited by the hardness of steel balls (7 GPa), which is much lower than the critical shear stresses for diamond (55 GPa), when plastic deformation of diamond is observed under static loads and temperatures below Debye temperature.

The HOMO-LUMO gaps (E-g) for the PPys before and after the formation of beta-CD based-MWs were calculated. As the main result, after the encapsulation process, there is a maintenance of the PPys semiconductivity, i.e., the process of complexation does not affect the E-g.

AB M06-2X/6-31G(d) level calculations were performed to examine the interactions of two alpha-amino acids (histidine and proline) individually with two finite-sized graphene sheets (C62H20 and C186H36). The conformers and orientations of histidine and proline on the surface of graphene play an important role in determining the stabilities of complexes. The number and type of non-bonding interactions such as pi-pi, C-H center dot center dot center dot p, N-H center dot center dot center dot p and O-H center dot center dot center dot p account for the stabilization of the complexes. The binding energy in aqueous phase generally decreases compared to gas phase. HOMO-LUMO energy gap of graphene is not altered by binding of either proline or histidine.

AB We apply and compare two potential expansion schemes that are developing in the field of NMR, namely, the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansions. We use these expansion schemes for the calculation of effective Hamiltonians and propagators. We present an important iterative approach for the Floquet-Magnus expansion. While both approaches are powerful methods, there are subtle differences among them. To understand these differences, we performed explicit calculations for the multiple-pulse spin-locking experiment. Our work unifies and generalizes existing results of Floquet-Magnus and Fer approaches and delivers illustrations of novel springs that boost previous applications that are based on the classical information.

AB The atmospheric ozonolysis mechanism of (E)-2-formylcinnamaldehyde is investigated at the CCSD(T)//M06-2X/6-311++ G(d,p) level of theory. The reaction starts with the formation of primary ozonides (POZs), which decompose to four primary products as phthaldialdehyde+CIs (Criegee intermediates, syn- and anti-FC-CI-1) and glyoxal+CIs (syn- and anti-FC-CI-2). The calculated rate coefficients are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. In the atmosphere, for stabilized FC-CIs, syn-/anti-FC-CI-1 and anti-FC-CI-2 tend to react with water, forming alpha-hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxides, while syn-FC-CI-2 would most likely cyclize to a bicyclic compound. The produced multifunctional products might contribute substantially to the formation of secondary organic aerosols.

AB Water adsorption on the V2O5(001) surface has been studied using density functional theory including van der Waals interactions (London dispersion interactions). Results reveal that molecular adsorption takes place via the oxygen atom bound to a naked vanadium atom. Water dimer and tetramer formed are stable adsorption configurations. The energy gap between the valence and conduction bands is not strongly correlated with the amount of adsorbed water. Such results are of great importance to test the potential use of the V2O5(001) surface as sensor for hazardous molecules in atmospheric conditions and in catalysis.

AB The state-averaged multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) method was implemented to the reference interaction site model and three-dimensional reference interaction site model (RISM and 3D-RISM) SCF schemes, where the electronic structures of multiple states and solvation structure are determined simultaneously by the state-averaged MCSCF method and state-specific RISM-SCF/3D-RISM-SCF scheme, respectively, in a single calculation. The method was applied to the potential energy curves of the low-lying states of NaCl in aqueous solution and solvation shifts of the excitation energy of formaldehyde and p-nitroaniline. The results showed good agreement with those of the state-specific MCSCF and/or experiments.

AB I(+1) formed by reacting iodine with KIO3 in 96% sulfuric acid is partly in the form of I2O that can be extracted in dichloromethane (DCM). The extraction process is an interesting coupling between phase transfer and chemical reactions allowing to obtain solutions containing nearly no iodine. I2O solutions can also be obtained in other chlorinated solvents and forms probably an ionic complex in acetonitrile. UV-vis spectra are presented (epsilon (I2O, 442 nm) = 259 in DCM). Distillations of I2O solutions and gas phase diffusion at laboratory temperature show that I2O is a volatile compound that should be considered in atmospheric chemistry.

AB We have systematically studied the z-strain effect on electronic properties of monolayer MoS2, MoSe2 and MoSSe through the first-principles calculations. It is found the band-gap linearly decrease with the increase of both tensile and compressive for the monolayers. Due to the energy shift of CBM and VMB in band-structure, the band-gap experiences a semiconductor-metal transition under z-axial strains. And, the modulation of the interaction between the atoms is the main reason for the shift of VBM or CBM. The results have demonstrated that the MoS2, MoSe2 and MoSSe monolayers are promising materials for electronic and optoelectronic devices.

AB The structure fracture of silicon electrodes due to the volume change during Si-Li alloying reactions greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein a layered Si material (LSM) was prepared by a simple one-step topological reaction and used as an effective LIBs anode. The layered structure has abundant gaps and pores to accelerate ion transportation. Microstructure measurements demonstrate the formation of an amorphous lithiation product but not Si-Li alloys. As a result, the LSM anode shows higher specific capacity and a much better cycling performance than common bulk Si anode. Thus, the LSM could be alternative high-performance Si anode in LIBs.

AB Next generation QTAIM was used to explain the structural preferences and differences of a series phenolic esters and nitrogen analogues. The planarity of the nitrogen analogue structures was explained by a resistance to torsion of the N-linking bond. Conversely, a resistance to planarity of the O-linking bond in the phenolic esters explained the twisted geometries. Hydrogen bonding that linked the aromatic ring with the rest of the molecule was only found to be present for the nitrogen analogues. Confirmation of the findings was provided by a stress tensor analysis.

AB Reactions of fuel derived radicals, R, and oxygen, are of interest for low temperature combustion and autoignition. A method for measuring R + O-2 rate coefficients based on the real time regeneration of OH radicals following initiation of the reaction via OH + RH is presented; values for k(R+O2) can be extracted from the resulting biexponential OH profiles. The rate coefficient for the reaction of CH3OCH2, with O-2, at 29-483 K, in 4.1-32.6 Torr of nitrogen are reported. At room temperature, k(CH3OCH2+O2) = (0.94 +/- 0.04) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), where the error represents statistical uncertainty at the 2 sigma level.

AB The present study evaluates the vibrational energy propagation from an O=C stretching through the double or single bonds of two small carboxamide molecules. The results show that double bonding facilitates vibrational energy flow while single bonding blockades energy protrusion. Similarly, the direct injection of vibrational energy at a single bond precludes the dissipation of vibrational energy to the rest of the molecular structure generating a vibrational trapping effect. Correlation between bond oscillations and molecular orbital energy fluctuation are analyzed. The presence or absence of those correlations seems to be determinant for vibrational energy flow at the molecular scale.

AB Rate coefficients of a class of prototypical insertion reactions, namely X + H-2 -> XH + H, where X = C(D-1), N (D-1), O(D-1) or S(D-1), are systematically investigated with ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). Besides giving accurate rate coefficients by correctly including quantum and recrossing effects as in previous work, we have tested the effect on the results of the choice of the dividing surfaces. Our results explicitly confirm a key property of the RPMD rate theory that the choice of the dividing surface along the reaction path has no impact on the results.

AB Here, the complex formation among anionic surface active ionic liquid (SAIL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dodecylbenzenesulfonate [C(4)mim][DBS] and non-ionic polymer polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP) in aqueous solution has been studied. An attempt has been made to study the interactions in bulk and at interface via different techniques such as tensiometry, conductivity, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nephelometric turbidity. From tensiometric measurements, some important surface parameters have been derived. From conductometric measurements, different thermodynamic parameters have been calculated and interpreted in terms of physicochemical interactions prevailing into the system. The aggregate formation has been tracked with DLS and nephelometric turbidity to understand the complexation dynamics.

AB A tunable mechanism has been investigated to control the photo-release behavior of phototrigger compound (KP-OAc) by Multi-configurational ab initio calculations. The photo-transformations of KP-OAc in the basic and acidic forms are triggered by the photoexcitation at 323 and 252 nm, respectively. The former one can produce the carbanion intermediate followed by the release of AcO- group induced by the efficient charge delocalization of carbanion moiety. While the photorelease channel is switched off in the latter case, for only the triplet biradical intermediate could be yielded when the decarboxylation is driven by the water aided excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2)-hematite composites are synthesized by the hydrothermal method and modified further by using air plasma for photocatalytic applications. High photocurrent response of the composite, 5.6 times better than TiO2, is observed, and high efficient degradation of methyl blue (MB) within 80 min is shown when TiO2 degraded MB in 180 min. It is found that the plasma treatment introduces electrochemical active surface area with formation of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies and effectively reduces energy bandgap from 3.15 to 2.8 eV, electron-transfer resistance from 16 to 11 Omega, and particle size from 25 to 20 nm, compared to TiO2.

AB The charge-transfer (CT) state induced by donors (D) - acceptors (A) interface interactions can dramatically influence the electron transition and charge separation in organic photovoltaic devices. In this work, two D-A interfaces were introduced, which were constructed by {0 1 1} and {1 0 0} crystal surfaces of 2,3,5,6-Bis (ethylenedithio)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (ZIXLIB) and fullerene (C-60) molecules, named {0 1 1}/C-60 and {1 0 0}/C-60 interface, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) results show that face-on and edge-on interactions are favorite at {0 1 1}/C-60 interface, while only edge-on interactions at {1 0 0}/C60 interface. The geometry, interaction energy, Mulliken charge distribution, visualization of the interactions and charge density difference analysis indicate that the interactions between the D-A interfaces are both non-covalent interactions, but strong CT state was induced by the {0 1 1}/C-60 interface interactions, only weak CT state appear at the {1 0 0}/C-60 interface. The strong CT state at {0 1 1}/C-60 interface results in a remarkable CT absorption peak around 700 nm, while weak CT state at {1 0 0}/C-60 surface results in a common absorption peak around 570 nm. Furthermore, the band structure results indicate that a more balanced charge transport presented at {0 1 1}/C-60 interface (with strong CT state) than {1 0 0}/C-60 interface (with weak CT state). This balanced charge transport are helpful for the charge separation at the D-A interface.

AB Here, we report a facile molecular engineering approach with alkylthio and fluorine atom modified the conjugated side chain of quinoxaline-based polymer, namely DTFFQx-TS, which afforded lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level and enhanced interchain interactions. The conventional devices based on DTFFQx-TS: ITIC exhibited the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.26% with a remarkably high open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.99 V. This work not only provides a newly efficient candidate of quinoxaline acceptor block modified with fluorinated conjugated side chain, but also achieves high V-oc copolymers for polymer solar cells via the synergistic effect of fluorination and side chain engineering strategies.

AB We design novel graphyne/blue phosphorene van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures (G/BP) under the external electric fields (E-field) and strains. It is demonstrated that the G/BP is a type-I semiconductor with a direct band gap of approximately 0.378 eV. The external E-field and strains not only have important effects on the band structure which undergoes a fascinating direct-indirect and semiconductor-metal transitions, but also influence the band alignment which experiences transition from type-I to type-II. In brief, the features of tunable bandgap and controllable band alignment endow G/BP with potential for application in future optoelectronic devices.

AB A laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) model has been employed to characterize the shock tube/pulsed laser-induced fluorescence imaging method. The LIF model was first validated using experimental data for the reactions of H-abstraction by OH on benzene and toluene. The model was then employed to establish optical regime diagrams. Three regimes were distinguished: (i) the optically-thin regime, in which the rate constant obtained is not much affected by laser light absorption; (ii) the optically-thick regime, in which the laser absorption induces a significant error on the rate constant; and (iii) the so-called "non-physical" regime, in which the rate constant is negative.

AB Spin-polarized Fukui functions in the density functional theory were applied to a set of molecular structures of oligolignols, considering only their closed shell configurations without open-shell models to avoid chemical perturbations. The results describe how the specific atoms from a set of monolignols and some oligolignols, drive the lignin polymerization in its initial stages because of their redistribution of electronic density and simultaneously where their spin-orbit coupling effects are at work. Also indicate that some atoms are activated after the formation of specific dilignols or trilignols, discerning between the continuity of lignification or when its end-wise occurs.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy results exhibit the morphology evolves from the sheet-like to rod-like structures with increasing Cr doping. X-ray diffraction results demonstrate the variation in preferred orientation and the lattice distortion induced by copper vacancies (V-Cu). The analyses of Raman and PL spectra also prove the structure defects exist in the synthesized samples. The room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) was discovered in this system. This literature firstly studies the magnetic property in Cr-doped CuO system and reasonably reveals the desired FM originating from the V-Cu defects.

AB Carbon nanotube-thermally reduced graphite oxide (CNT-TRGO) was modified by ambient plasma. beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) was then functionalized over the composite surface and used for electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid. The ambient plasma increased the electrochemical surface area, adsorption capacity, and electric conductivity, so that more functionalization of beta CD was found on the surface of CNT-TRGO. Final sensitivity of 2.5 mu AmM-1 was obtained in the range from 0.05 to 30 mM of ascorbic acid. The ambient plasma method for the modification of the surface showed very efficient, easy, and economic.

AB We selectively prepared a metastable phase of perylene crystals (beta-phase) by a physical vapor transport method under atmospheric pressure. The fluorescence lifetime (tau(F)) was determined to be 12.3 ns and the annihilation rate constant (gamma(ss)) of singlet exciton was estimated to be 3 x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) from fluorescence decay profile at high excitation density. The fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)) was determined to be 0.6 and Phi(F) decreased dramatically with decreasing wavelength below 300 nm, suggesting that fission from a highly excited singlet state into two triplet states occurred. The radiative lifetime tau(R) (=tau(F)/Phi(F)) was 20 ns, which indicates that the fluorescence originated from the excimer with nonparallel configuration in the crystals.

AB The adsorption of CO molecules on Fe-doped single-vacancy-defected carbon nanotubes (Fe-SV-CNTs) was computationally investigated. Results show that the interaction of Fe-SV-CNTs with CO, although is slightly weaker than that of Fe-doped intrinsic CNTs, is much stronger than that of intrinsic CNTs and single-vacancy-defected CNTs (SV-CNTs). After CO adsorption, the electrical conductivity of Fe-SV-CNTs has a much more significant change than that of other types of CNTs. Considering that doping transition metals on the defects of SV-CNTs could be achieved much more easily than on the lattices of intrinsic CNTs, Fe-SV-CNTs would be more practical as CO gas sensing material.

AB Gas-phase sodium atom collisions with liquid glycerol were investigated by atomic beam scattering from normal and deuterated surfaces. The scattering signal of the recoiling effusive Na atom beam was monitored by a mass spectrometer. Because all thermally equilibrated Na atoms ionize into the liquid surface, this system was uniquely suited to interrogate the subtle kinematic effect of glycerol deuteration on the collisional energy transfer process within the impulsive scattering regime. An interplay of kinematic and vibrational effects explains the Na scattering behavior from variously deuterated glycerol surfaces, extending our fundamental understanding of collisional energy transfer, and ultimately, chemical reaction dynamics.

AB It has been known for a long time that graphene flakes of certain geometries can develop spontaneous spin polarization. Here, it is studied what happens when two triangular graphene nanoflakes, possibly different sizes, are placed in close proximity with AB (Bernal) stacking. The results of first-principles calculations show that the magnetic ground state of the bilayer system depends on the different sizes of the two nanoflakes, and spinrelated energy gap can be controlled with external electric fields. Under certain circumstances, the system even can be tuned into half-metallic nature, which might potentially be exploited in future spintronics applications.

AB In this work, decomposition mechanism of the phenylaminyl radical C6H5N center dot H was investigated by means of M062X, G4 and CBS-QB3 methods. It is found that the energy barrier for conversion of most stable N-centered radical to less stable C-centered radicals is greater than the decomposition reaction. Two resonantly stabilized radicals propargyl and cyclopentadienyl were found on the potential energy surface of reaction. It is estimated that activation energy for sigmatropic H transfer rearrangement of cyclopentadienyl radical is 59.50 and 56.26 kcal/mol at G4 and M06-2X/6-311++ G(d, p) levels, respectively. The Delta H degrees(f, g) and Delta G degrees(f, g) values of all the radicals were calculated.

AB Two samples of one-dimensional ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRDs) with different lengths and diameters were produced by a simple and green method. One sample synthesized via coprecipitation method at room temperature without any stabilizer or surfactant. In the other sample a linear-denderic copolymer were used to the synthesis of ZnO NRDs. Poly citric acid-grafted poly ethylene glycol (PCA-PEG-PCA) copolymer is a good candidate for using as capping and stabilizing agent for metal oxide nanostructures due to its water solubility and biocompatibility. ZnO NRDs were trapped to the polymer branches and covalently bonded to it. conjugation of copolymer with nanorods proved by FT-IR spectroscopy. The effect of capping agent on the structure, morphology and the size distribution of nanorods were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hexagonal structure of both samples of nanorods was proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the average diameters of nanorods were 50 nm and 25 nm and their average lengths were 100 nm and 1 mu m for raw and polymer capped nanorods, respectively. Therefore, using PCA-PEG-PCA as a capping agent causes higher length to width ratio NRDs with a hyperbranched array. Because the two ending citric acid parts are big enough to interact with two or more nanocrystals and make NRDs with dendritic structures. Optical properties of samples were identified by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL).
   Both polymer capped nanorods and raw ones were used as photocatalyst for degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) dyes. Results showed that that the degradation efficiency of both dyes at the presence of both nanorods were significantly high. Using water soluble polymer capped ZnO NRDs leads to enhance in degradation effectiveness and rate of dye removal, compared to the case of using raw nanorods.

Various calcination temperatures are also compared to obtain the material with better properties. By optimizing the precipitant and calcination temperature, the material prepared by oxalic acid at 900 degrees C has good layered structure, small particle size (200-300 nm), and uniform distribution of particles. A high first discharge specific capacity of 298.4 mAh g(-1) and a high first Coulombic efficiency of 77.2% at 0.1 C are obtained. After 50 cycles, the reversible discharge specific capacity is 272.2 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 91.2%.

AB Tunable nanostructure self-assembled from diblock copolymers under nanoscale confinement are investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. In this study, a serial of nanostructures with controllable size or shape are fabricated from self-assembly of hydrophobic or amphiphilic diblock copolymers. The influences of plate surface property, confinement degree, block length ratio of copolymer and solvent property on self-assembled morphologies are systematically examined. The mean-square end-to-end distance and the orientation of polymer chains are calculated, and nanostructure phase diagrams for amphiphilic diblock copolymers are also constructed. This study provides guidance to fabricate tunable nanostructures by solution self-assembly under confinement or in channel.

AB An explicitly-correlated method to obtain ionized and electron-attached states with spin-orbit couplings effects included is formulated and implemented. This formulation uses both the left and the right eigenvectors of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method, derived from the linearly approximated explicitly correlated ground state coupled-cluster singles and doubles [CCSD(F12)] wavefunction. The Briet-Pauli Hamiltonian within the spin-orbit mean field (SOMF) approximation is used to describe the spin-orbit interactions. Basis set dependence of the spin-orbit splittings is analyzed with the canonical and explicitly-correlated approaches. Numerical tests for several systems show fast convergence of the explicitly-correlated results to the corresponding complete basis set limit (CBS).

The isotopic substitution decreases the reactivity remarkably in both Na(3S)+ HF and Na (3P)+ HF. The calculation also shows that effects of the initial rotational excitations for Na(3S) + HF are different between the process with threshold (v= 2) and those without thresholds (v = 3-4).

AB D-2(+) molecular ion in a semiconductor quantum well under laser-field radiation by using finite elements method within the effective mass approximation is theoretically studied. The effects of the laser radiation, donor-donor separation, and quantum well width on the D-2(+) total energy and the D-2(+) binding energy corresponding to the second ionization process D-2(+) -> D+ + D+ + e(-) are analyzed. We show that the laser-field radiation modifies significantly the equilibrium length and the dissociation energy of a D-2(+)-complex in a quantum well. Our results in the limit cases are in good agreement with those previously reported for a single donor impurity D-0.

AB Carbon quantum dots/TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalytic composite was prepared through multi-step hydrothermal method. The CQDs/TiO2/Fe2O3 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for methylene blue dye photodegration when compared with TiO2/Fe2O3 and pure TiO2 under the visible light irradiation. The mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity over CQDs/TiO2/Fe2O3 were also investigated. The CQDs can better capture and transfer photogenerated electrons through the Ti-O-C and Fe-O-C bonds. What's more, CQDs can improve the utilization of photogenerated electrons and the electrons in CQDs are captured by O-2 to produce O-center dot(2)- radicals and the role of O-center dot(2)- radicals in the photocatalytic process is significantly improved.

AB Plasma-assisted combustion is the frontier research in the field of energy and power. In order to reveal the mechanism of plasma-assisted combustion, the mechanism of plasma excitation on CH4/Air combustion reaction is studied. Using the CHEMKIN, a CH4/Air discharge model and a zero-dimensional dynamic calculation model of plasma-assisted CH4/Air combustion are established. Through the simulation calculation, the ignition delay time, the evolution law of the active particle concentration, the chemical reaction path and the consumption of OH, and the sensitivity of the elementary reactions are obtained. The results show that during the CH4/Air mixed gas discharge breakdown, a large number of excited-state particles are generated, in which N-2(ap) reacts most strongly with CH4 to promote the reaction. The dissociation effect of N-2(C-3) on CH4 is most prominent in the combustion reaction. In addition, it is found that adding plasma, increasing ignition temperature and increasing reaction pressure can shorten the ignition delay time and increase the upper limit of temperature rise. In the combustion reaction, H + O-2 = O + OH play a major role in promoting the reaction.

AB Porphyrin dyes are susceptible to aggregation which may cause lower short-circuit current density affecting its photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) in dye-sensitized solar cells. In this paper, we harness the inherent property of metallated porphyrins that it can axially coordinate with compounds containing lone-pair of electrons, such as pyridines, through the back pi-bonding. The use of pyridine or bipyridine spacers to suppress aggregation in beta-functionalized Zn-tetraphenylporphyrin-based dyes showed improvement of PCEs by 28% and 44% for 4-methylpyridine and 4,4'-bipyridine ligands, respectively. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of the simple but effective method in suppressing dye aggregation thereby increasing its efficiency.

AB Quantum mechanical calculations have been carried out to reinvestigate the possibility of formation of true triple bond between s-block metals (Be, Mg, Ca) supported by different s(1) type donors (Li, Na, Cu). The existence of true triple bonds has been confirmed by various bonding analyses such as charge decomposition analysis, atoms in molecules, electron localization function and source function analysis. All these molecules were found to have large spontaneity of their formation. The intrinsic strength of these triple bonds has been analyzed by using compliance matrix which suggests their ultra-weak nature.

AB In this work, the values of pk(12) and pk(22) microdissociation constants of three aromatic amino acids (anthranilic (AA), N-methylanthranilic (MeAA) and N-phenylanthranilic (PhAA)) were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Aqueous-phase energies and solvation energies were calculated using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) of solvation.
   The results indicated that absolute differences between experimental and calculated pk values depend on combination of the polarization and diffuse functions and are quite different for pk(12) and pk(22) constants computated in the same level of theory. They demonstrate that some of the tested functionals and basis sets can accurately predict microdissociation constant (pk).

AB Facile and simple sulfur and nitrogen co-doped graphene Quantum Dots (S, N-GQDs) were fabricated via. calcination. UV-vis. spectrum reveals two peaks originates due to the transition from n and pi to pi* of the luminescent material. The photoluminescence emission of S, N-GQDs has been quenched upon addition of Hg and Ag ions. The higher affinity of sulfur for Hg and Ag ions assigned selectivity to the sensing protocol which was confirmed from the absence of any interference of the competitive ions. The S, N-GQDs could sense Hg and Ag ions as low as 9.14 mu M and 12.90 mu M respectively.

AB We reported a unique and sensitive probe (fluorescein) for determination the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of ionic surfactants based on both fluorescence and absorbance properties of probe in micellar solution. We found that the spectral properties (fluorescence and absorbance) of fluorescein are affected by different types of surfactants. For this purpose spectrophotometric technique using fluorescein as probe to determine the critical micelle concentration of cationic, anionic and zwitterionic surfactants. The critical micelle concentrations of surfactants were determined from the sigmoidal shaped plots or inflection points. The obtained CMC values were in good agreement with the values obtained with conductivity measurements or with literature values.

AB Bulky vicinal groups around a single bond usually prefer to be in the opposite (anti) conformation but when extra interactions come into play, more stable could be the gauche conformer, where the neighboring groups embrace a dihedral angle around 60 degrees. This is called the gauche effect. The gamma-gauche effect historically features the upfield shift of C-13 NMR spectra when a carbon atom and its nonprotonic gamma-substituent are in a gauche arrangement. In this work, using sulfoxides as illustrative examples, we show that the nature of the gamma-gauche effect is the same as that of the gauche effect, i.e., the gauche conformation is more stable than the anti conformation. To unveil the origin of this effect, we employ two total energy partition schemes in density functional theory and four quantities from the information-theoretic approach. Our results unambiguously show that the gamma-gauche effect is of the stereoelectronic origin with a multifaceted nature. Its origin can be understood from a few different perspectives including energetic contributions, dipole moment, charge distribution, hyperconjugation, and information theory. Substantially different from other stereoelectronic effects such as anomeric and generalized anomeric effects, this effect has its unique features as demonstrated from our results in the present work. Having successfully established the link of the gamma-gauche with other gauche effects and unveiled its multi-faceted origin, this study should shed new light towards the comprehensive understanding about this important effect of conformational stability in sulfoxides and other systems alike.

AB Micro-sized ZnO superstructures self-assembled by hexagonal prisms were achieved by direct thermal decomposition of Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O. The results showed that the as-prepared ZnO superstructures had superb catalytic effect on the AP pyrolysis. When ZnO superstructures with a 2% mass ratio were added, the pyrolysis temperature was decreased by 154.3 degrees C and the activation energy of AP pyrolysis was reduced by 61.7%. Additionally, introduction of ZnO superstructures led to a 2.87-fold increase in the exothermic heat during AP pyrolysis. The excellent catalytic activity of ZnO superstructure could be attributed to its small band gap width, existence of oxygen vacancies and good dispersion.

AB The ion energy distribution and average energy of Ar/O-2 mixed gas discharge have been studied using quadrupole mass spectrometer. The results show that the potential increases in the sheath, the ions obtain higher energy through the sheath, high energy peak moves to high energy area and the energy width increases as low-frequency power increases, which is consistent with the theoretical model calculation results. When pressure rises, collisions of Ar+ ions are more frequent in the process of crossing the sheath, the bimodal structure becomes vaguely, and under the same condition the number of low energy ions increases gradually.

AB Nickel phosphide nanostructures are synthesized by hydrothermal method. The effect of different nickel phosphide phases on structural, morphological, and optical properties as well as photocatalytic performance are investigated. XRD results show that initially, the Ni12P5 phase is formed, then by increasing the P/Ni molar ratio in the starting solution, product phase gradually transforms to the Ni2P phase. The results showed that crystalline phase and morphology of the nanostructures affects the catalytic performance of the samples. The best result for methylene blue dye removal was achieved for the sample with 35/1 phosphorus to nickel molar ratio which had pure Ni2P phase.

AB We perform a theoretical investigation about the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reaction for a novel 2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-phenyl)-benzooxazole-5-carboxylicacid (HDPBC) system. The ultrafast excited state process is due to the low potential barrier, which should be the reason why only one fluorescence peak can be observed in previous experiment. Comparing the potential energy barriers in different aprotic solvents, we present nonpolar solvents play roles in facilitating ESIPT process for HDPBC molecule. This work not only clarifies the detailed ESIPT mechanism for the novel HDPBC system and explains experimental phenomenon, but also present that solvent effects could control the ESIPT process.

ID RAMAN; DIAMOND; GRAPHENE
AB We report the high stability and reversibility of disordered graphitic nanocarbon (DGN) under high pressure. No bonding change can be observed in DGN even up to 52.0 GPa and it fully recovers upon decompression. The high stability and reversibility should be related to its unique highly disordered structure which consists of nanosized wavy graphene layers, making the DGN elastic upon compression. Combined with high temperature, DGN is transformed into polycrystalline nanodiamonds with average grain size smaller than the pristine nanoparticles.

AB In this work we report very accurate variational calculations of the twelve lowest S-2 Rydberg states of the lithium atom performed with the finite-nuclear-mass (FNM) approach and with all-electron explicitly correlated Gaussian functions. The FNM non-relativistic variational energies of the states are augmented with the leading relativistic and QED corrections. The calculated transition energies are compared with the previous works (only eight states of the series were calculated before) and with the available experimental results. Density distributions of the electrons and the nucleus in the center-of-mass frame are also shown.

AB We investigated the [1.1.1]propellane molecule using the 3-D bond-path framework set B and the stress tensor B-sigma within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). The controversial axial bond was determined to be a charge-shift bond comprising significant bond metallicity that correlated with values of the bond stiffness S < 1. The influence of the axial bond on the neighboring bonding is quantified in terms of unexpectedly low bond stiffness S values and a new measure of charge-shift bonding, the polarizability P. Consistency of these results was found at the MP2, CCSD and B3LYP theory levels.

AB In this paper, the adsorption of Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules on metal-doped boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) is studied by using density functional theory (DFT) method. Our calculations indicate that the adsorption energy corresponding to this structure increases greatly. In addition, metal doping changes the charge distribution of the BNNT, which results in various hybrid orbitals. The frontier orbital function distribution of this configuration also changes from being uniformly distributed in the tube to being substantially concentrated around the metal atoms and HCN molecules. The results of this series of studies provide new possibilities for HCN sensor research.

Along with these systems defect-free Cu and a Cu crystal with layered void is also studied. We analyse crystallinity in these systems using Q(6) bond-orientational order parameter, Lindemann index, radial distribution functions and coordination numbers. At 1 atm, all crystals melt between 1700 and 1800 K and melting temperature decreases with increase in void fraction. It is also found that at 900 K voids disintegrate and become a part of the crystal and between 900 and 1700 K crystals amorphize losing long-range order.

AB Dissociative electron attachment to 2-chlorotoluene has been studied experimentally. The formed Cl- fragment appears in the energy range from 0 to 2 eV. Increasing the temperature of the target molecule results in a decrease of the height of the threshold peak (similar to 0 eV) but in a considerable increase of the height of the second peak at 0.78 eV. Such behaviour was observed only rarely and does not occur in similar molecules. We have analysed the out-of-plane vibrations and calculated approximate potential energy curves for the neutral and anionic states. Possible explanations of the observed temperature dependence are discussed.

AB The Sequential Monte Carlo/Quantum Mechanics approach was used for investigate the solvent effect on the solute-solvent structure and spectroscopic properties of Damascone derivatives, Carvone, Perillaldehyde and Menthadiene in water solution. Our in-water results have shown that the dipole moment increase of the compounds are between 36% and 84% when compared with the gas phase values and a solvatochromic shift between -20 and 14 nm whereas the magnetic properties studied have indicated an NMR shift close to 10 ppm for some carbon atoms and greater than 140 ppm for oxygen atoms.

AB We report a theoretical study of unimolecular dissociation of the ethyl formate radical cation (C2H5OCHO+center dot). The potential energy surface (PES) of its 14 dissociation reactions, including the formation of CH2CHC(OH)(2)(+), CH2CH2CO+center dot, CH3CHCO+center dot, CH2OCHO+, HOCHOH+, HOCO+, CH3CHOH+, HCO2+, CH2OH+, C2H6+center dot, C2H5+, HCO+, and C2H4+center dot, was determined using G4 calculation. A kinetic analysis using RRKM calculations based on the PES obtained adequately explained the results of previous experiments, suggesting that the dissociation occurred statistically from the electronic ground state.

AB 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped ZnSe:Mn semiconductor nanocrystals (ZnSe:Mn@MPA NCs) were prepared in aqueous solution. It was found that the NCs appear as macroscopic precipitates after stored for 10 d. The change law of the NCs in three distinguished stages was studied. The results displayed that the optical stability of as-prepared NCs capped with MPA stabilizer is correlated with the depletion of MPA, which leads to the decomposition of ZnSe:Mn NCs under the existence of photo-induced holes. ZnS protective layer was formed on the surface of ZnSe:Mn@MPA NCs by epitaxial growth method to inhibit the photodegradation of MPA.

These electronic states have been studied using state averaged MCSF calculations followed by multi-reference configuration-interaction (MRCI) techniques. The computed values for the state energy, bond length, vibrational frequency, and dipole moment of states which were characterized experimentally by previous authors are in excellent agreement. Physical insights of nature of bonding and electronic charge distributions on individual atoms are discussed.

AB Layered luminescence semiconductors SnI2 and Sn4SI6 have been employed in electronic discharge lamps, photo-recording medium, and other applications, owing to their high color rendering index and high photosensitivity. The crystalline, electronic and optical properties of these two compounds were investigated by the density functional theory. The results indicate that the sulfur dopant atoms have a small effect on the profiles of the electronic band structure and optical curves. However, sulfur doping changes the electronic band gap, the positions of the absorption edge, and the dielectric and absorption peaks. These results support the further study and application of these two compounds.

AB Aggregation behaviors of three different sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonates (SDBSs) were studied theoretically and experimentally in this work. The dynamic oil/water interface tension measurements reveal that 6C12 Phi S is most efficient surfactant in reducing interfacial tension. The addition of inorganic salts (NaCl, CaCl2) to SDBS aqueous solutions was found to further decrease the dynamic interface tension. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to study aggregation behaviors of SDBSs at oil/water interface. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) results indicate that Ca2+ can improve the aggregation of SDBSs due to strong electrostatic attraction with headgroups of SDBSs. Meanwhile, the electrostatic repulsion among SDBS headgroups was shield by Ca2+. The orientation of SDBSs was changed and the angle between SDBSs and normal of oil/water interface increased with adding Ca2+. Finally, oil recovery measurement shows that alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) system with higher-symmetry and branched alkylbenzene is more effective in enhanced oil recovery.

AB Para-alkyl thiophenol (p-AlTP) molecules with normal and branched alkyl groups are selectively oxidized into p-mercaptobenzoic acid under the gap mode resonance, whereas o-and m-methyl TP (o-, m-MeTP) do not show such reactions [1]. We investigated here detailed properties of the photocatalytic reaction specific to p-AlTP in terms of the following contrasting observations. (1) The oxidation of p-MeTP was not induced by thermal heating of the samples up to 373 K. Subtle temperature increase during the oxidation was also corroborated by the measurements of the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering intensity. (2) The oxidation of p-MeTPs was accelerated by oxygen atmosphere at room temperature, whereas nitrogen atmosphere yielded an intermediate species. (3) Ortho-, m-, and p-mercaptobenzyl alcohol molecules were oxidized to corresponding o-, m- and p-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) with no definite site selectivity.

AB Various types of fuel cells as clean and portable power sources show a great attraction, especially direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) having high energy density and convenient fuel storage. In this paper, PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the electrochemically reduced porous graphene oxide (ERPGO) was fabricated by one-step electrochemical reduction of the mixture of H2PtCl6, NiSO4 and porous graphene oxide (PGO). The obtained hybrid of PtNi/ERPGO was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was evaluated by electrochemical method. The experimental results have demonstrated that PtNi/ERPGO enhanced electrocatalytic activity, which might be attributed to the bifunctional mechanism and the existence of unique pore structure on the surface of graphene sheets.

AB We have defined a dimensionless parameter called shape quality factor to describe shapes of UV-vis absorbance spectra during aggregation process of conjugated polymer solutions quantitatively. Time-lapse UV-vis absorbance spectra of poly(3-hexylselenophene) (P3HS) solutions are obtained. Shape quality factors of UV-vis absorbance spectra during the aggregation process of P3HS solutions are calculated. Shape quality factors usually decrease during aggregation process when amount of aggregate is small, and increase when amount of aggregate is large. Relationship between shape quality factor and aggregation time can be fitted by double Gaussian functions. This work provides a simple way to describe shapes of UV-vis absorbance spectra of conjugated polymer solutions quantitatively.

AB In this paper, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations are applied to study the ionic structure and electronic properties of KF-NaF-AlF3 system. The results show that the main forms of complex ion groups are [AlF4](-), [AlF5](2-) and [AlF6](3-). With KF concentration increasing, the covalent interaction between Al-F ions first increases and then decreases, resulting in the increase of Al-F coordination number and then decreases. The calculation results of Raman spectra on [AlF4](-), [AlF5](2-) and [AlF6](3-) are close to the experimental values, which indicates FPMD is applicable to similar molten salt systems.

AB A universal method is proposed to produce superhydrophobic silica coating on the surfaces of either soft or hard substrates. The well-defined hierarchical structures can be formed by spraying, dipping and dropping the suspension of perfluorosilane-coated silica particles. Further adhesive-layer technique and the corresponding robustness mechanism have been investigated, and the created superhydrophobic surface shows high robustness and performance maintenance after various types of damages, including finger wiping, knife scratching and even 60 of abrasion cycles with sandpaper. Such a surface superhydrophobicity can also fit for the requirements of self-cleaning and oil separation/adsorption.

AB In this presents article we studied the catalytic efficiency of three different metal oxide nanoparticles (CuZnO, CoZnO, and NiZnO) on thermal behaviour of powder AN and CSPs samples. A co-precipitation method was used for synthesized CuZnO, CoZnO, and NiZnO nanoparticles and they characterized by XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The MONs have a catalytic impact on thermal behaviour AN and CSPs for TG-DSC technique. The KAS, FWO, and Starink methods were used to determine activation energies of all AN and CSPs samples. The CuZnO showed good catalytic efficiency on AN and CSPs that reduced the decomposition temperature and activation energy of AN and CSPs, also increased the burning rate of CSPs.

DE Molybdenum sulfide; Hydrothermal synthesis; Surface affinity; Interface

AB This paper reported a simple hydrothermal method to prepare MoS2 with different surface affinity. By adjusting the reaction time and Mo/S proportion of hydrothermal synthesis, MoS2 powder with a face-to-edge ratio of 1.19 can be obtained on the surface. Interestingly, for the first time, MoS2 with such ratio can function as an intermediary similar to surfactant. It tends to distribute on the interface between water and n-hexane, and further adsorb methylene blue from water to the interface. By this route, it has a great implication for the interaction of incompatible molecules and the interfacial process in future applications.

AB We present the synthesis, structural characterization and physical properties measurements of a new compound, La15MoxGe9 in Mn5Si3-type derived structure with interstitial Mo. The sample was synthesized by arc-melting method. La15MoxGe9 crystallizes in non-centrosymmetric hexagonal structure P6(3)mc (#186) with lattice parameters a = b = 15.495(5) angstrom and c = 6.917(2) angstrom. The refinement on single X-ray diffraction data show that interstitial atom Mo occupies two different Wyckoff positions (2a, 2b) with 0.19(2) Mo/per f.u. The specific heat properties were well studied. The obtained Sommerfeld coefficient and Debye temperature are: gamma = 89.2(9) mJ/(mol K-2) and Theta(D) = 190(5) K, respectively. La15MoxGe9 is the first compound in the ternary system La-Mo-Ge.

AB Spectroscopic trace-level detections (as low as 1 x 10(-11) M) of procaine using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique and utilizing silver nanoparticle (Ag-Np) substrates were successfully accomplished. Significant intensity enhancements of the Raman bands associated with -C=O stretching, -C-N stretching and -NH2 bending vibrations were observed. Possible modes of SERS interaction between the procaine molecule and Ag-Np were investigated theoretically, and the results were found consistent with experimental data. The intensities of SERS band at 1607 cm(-1) were successfully correlated with the concentrations of procaine solutions. The present approach exhibits a high sensitivity and low limit of detection.

Blending with superior theoretical capacities anode materials is the most effective way to increase its capacity. In this work, LTO/SiO blends with several ratios are prepared. Electrodes with moderate SiO contents (7LTO3SiO) can improve the stable capacity and rate performance of LIBs. 7LTO3SiO exhibits a discharging capacity of 191.0 mAh g(-1) at 2 A.g(-1), which is 81% higher than pure LTO. Moreover, 7LTO3SiO electrode retain 228.7 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A.g(-1), which is only 188.1 mAh.g(-1) of pure LTO.

AB Chemical dynamics simulations are performed to study the dissociation of excited benzene-hexafluorobenzene (Bz-HFB) complex in N-2 bath and the results are compared with the gas phase dynamics. Two N-2 bath densities 20 and 750 kg/m(3) are considered. Bz-HFB is excited with respect to the temperatures of 1000, 1500, and 2000 K at each bath density. The nature of the Bz-HFB* dissociation dynamics at the bath density of 20 kg/m(3) is quite similar to gas phase one, but the same is drastically different at high bath density where energy transfer pathway dominates over dissociation and negligible direct dissociation of Bz-HFB* is reported.

Their experimentally-measured, composite vertical detachment energy (VDE) of 1.21 +/- 0.05 eV compares well with their theoretically-determined VDE values of 1.15 eV and 1.20 eV, supporting our conclusion that intermolecular electron-induced proton transfer (EIPT) has taken place in these dimer anions.

The investigated molecules demonstrated large off-resonant second hyperpolarizability (gamma) and nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) values compared to similar molecular moieties with potential application in optical devices.

Among the porphyrins, MOPP(CN)(4) show enhanced solvent dependent optical absorption spectral features relative to other porphyrins, MOPPX4 (X = Br and CH3) and MTPPs. Although, MOPP(CN)(4) (M = Ni(II) and Cu(II)) have higher electron deficiency due to electron withdrawing beta-cyano groups, comparable solvent dependent absorption spectral features and opposite trend in their shift of bands relative to the corresponding MTPPBr8 were observed. The large red-shift of the absorption bands of Cu(II) and Ni(II)-mixed substituted porphyrins in polar solvents or nitrogenous bases has been suggested to the destabilization of the HOMO (b(2)) relative to b(1) (HOMO) level due to axial ligation of the polar solvents or nitrogenous bases with the core metal ions. The greater affinity of the core metal ions towards coordinating solvents or nitrogenous bases has been attributed to the electron deficient nature of the porphyrin pi-system and follow the order: MOPP(CN)(4) > MOPPBr4 > MOPP(CH3)(4) due to inductive/resonance effect of beta-substituents rather than the nonplanarity of the porphyrin ring.

AB Prolactin (PRL) is a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland and negatively controlled by dopamine. Some researchers have associated the immune regulatory functions of PRL with some infectious diseases like Toxoplasma gondii and T. cruzi. This work aimed to analyze the possible immuno-modulatory effects of this hormone through the subcutaneous administration of PRL during the experimental Chagas disease. On the 14th day post-infection (dpi), PRL triggered increased percentages of NK cells in treated infected animals as compared to the infected and untreated ones. For early and late apoptosis, our results showed that in chronically infected groups, PRL counteracted splenocyte apoptosis as revealed by the reduced percentages of both, early and late apoptosis. Reduced percentages of spleen CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were detected in infected PRL treated rats (60 days post-infection). Concerning to B cells, a significant increased percentage of these cells was found for all PRL treated infected animals (14th dpi), but no statistically significant alteration was observed on the 60th days post-infection. Furthermore, PRL treatment triggered a significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) T lymphocytes IFN-gamma producers, while on the 60th dpi, a reduced percentage of IFN-gamma in these cells was observed in prolactin-treated rats compared to infected and untreated ones. Enhanced serum IL-12 levels were detected in infected and PRL treated subjects (60th dpi). Only on 7th day post-infection, the flow cytometric analysis of CFSE-stained CD3(+) T cells showed an enhanced proliferation of polyclonal stimulated T cells in PRL-treated and infected animals. In this study, we demonstrated that PRL can influence many aspects of the immune response during the experimental Chagas' disease, and this substance could be used as a supporting trial along with the conventional drug treatment.

AB Background: Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and active mineralization are key processes involved in cardiovascular burden in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Serum (soluble) thrombomodulin (sTM) is an established marker of endothelial injury.
   Patients: 80 patients in ESRD were recruited consecutively. Baseline distribution of sex, age, main comorbidities and Framingham score was similar. A biochemical panel including sTM, intact PTH (iPTH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), osteonectin (ON), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (TNFR2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (sVEGFR2) and stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF1 alpha) was investigated in each patient. Samples obtained while establishing haemodialysis (HD) access were stained for radial artery calcifications (RACs) with Alizarin red and examined histologically.
   Results: After adjustment for HD status, sTM showed a significant positive correlation with serum creatinine, TNFR2, OPN, HGF, SDF1 alpha, sVEGFR2, Pi, iPTH, FGF-23, OPG, OC and ON. In forward stepwise multiple regression, serum creatinine, TNFR2, and OPN were identified as significant, independent predictors of sTM. Grades 1-3 of RACs correlated with sTM (R = 0.50, p = 0.017), while grade 3 RACs were significantly associated with higher sTM (p = 0.02) than less advanced lesions.
   Conclusion: Among novel renal and cardiovascular biomarkers, OPN and TNFR2 are closely related to sTM. This may link endothelial damage, vascular remodeling and inflammation. Progression of RAC parallels a presumed compensatory rise in sTM, reflecting endothelial injury. sTM has an intricate role in endothelial function and potential clinical and prognostic applications.

AB Metabolic syndrome poses a major threat on human health affecting the quality of life. Adipose tissue is an important organ which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Adipocytokines secreted by the adipose tissue plays a critical role in storage, food intake, energy expenditure, lipid and glucose metabolism. Leptin is primarily involved in regulating food intake, body weight and energy homeostasis through neuroendocrine functions. Contemporary research suggests that leptin also influences insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. High leptin concentrations are directly associated with the obesity subsequent development of metabolic disease sequelae such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Elucidation of the mechanism of action of leptin would help to develop novel therapeutic approaches for there metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes. This review provides an updated 'state-of-the-art' about the leptin and its role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome at the molecular level.

AB The extraordinary capacity of the liver to regenerate following injury is dependent on coordinated and regulated actions of cytokines and growth factors. Whereas hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are direct mitogens to hepatocytes, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL-6 also play essential roles in the liver regeneration process. These cytokines and growth factors activate different signaling pathways in a sequential manner to elicit hepatocyte proliferation. The kinetics and magnitude of these hepatocyte-activating stimuli are tightly regulated to ensure restoration of a functional liver mass without causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Hepatocyte proliferation can become deregulated under conditions of chronic inflammation, leading to accumulation of genetic aberrations and eventual neoplastic transformation. Among the control mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte proliferation, negative feedback inhibition by the 'suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)' family proteins SOCS1 and SOCS3 play crucial roles in attenuating cytokine and growth factor signaling. Loss of SOCS1 or SOCS3 in the mouse liver increases the rate of liver regeneration and renders hepatocytes susceptible to neoplastic transformation. The frequent epigenetic repression of the SOCSI and SOCS3 genes in hepatocellular carcinoma has stimulated research in understanding the growth regulatory mechanisms of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in hepatocytes. Whereas SOCS3 is implicated in regulating JAK-STAT signaling induced by IL-6 and attenuating EGFR signaling, SOCS1 is crucial for the regulation of HGF signaling. These two proteins also module the functions of certain key proteins that control the cell cycle. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the functions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in controlling hepatocyte proliferation, and its implications to liver health and disease.

AB Background: The inflammatory response of the host to Shiga toxin and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is included in (HUS). The TLR4-LPS complex is internalized and TLR4 induced inflammatory signaling is stopped by targeting the complex for degradation. Rab7b, a small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) expressed in monocytes, regulates the later stages of the endocytic pathway. Objective: we studied the Rab7b participation on the TLR4 endocytic pathway and its effect on monocyte cytokine production along the acute course of pediatric Shiga toxin-associated HUS.
   Methods and results: Monocytes were identified according to their positivity in CD14 expression. Surface TLR4 expression in monocytes from 18 HUS patients significantly increased by day 1 to 6, showing the highest increase on day 4 compared to monocytes of 10 healthy children. Significant higher surface TLR4 expression was accompanied by increased proinflammatory intracellular cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). In contrast, after these time points, surface TLR4 expression and intracellular TNF-alpha levels, returned to near control levels after 10 days. Furthermore, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy proved colocalization of increased intracellular TLR4/Rab7b determined by Pearson's coefficient in monocytes from HUS patients from day 1 on the highest colocalization of both proteins by day 4. Decreased TLR4/Rab7b co-localization was shown 10 days after HUS onset.
   Conclusion: The colocalization of TLR4 and Rab7b allows us to suggest Rab7b participation in the control of the TLR4 endocytic pathway in HUS patient monocytes. A consequential fall in cytokine production throughout the early follow up of HUS is demonstrated.

AB We evaluated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) on ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction. Male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or TNFR1-deficient mice (TNFR1(-/-)) were treated with ethanol (20% v/v) for 10 weeks. Increased protein expression of TNFR1 and NF kappa B p65 was detected in the left ventricle (LV) of WT mice chronically treated with ethanol. Echocardiographic analysis showed that ethanol consumption increased left ventricular posterior wall end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular posterior wall end-systolic diameter in WT, but not TNFR1(-/-) mice. Increased levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as well as increased nitrotyrosine immunostaining were detected in the LV from WT, but not TNFR1(-/-) mice. Conversely, treatment with ethanol decreased nitrate/nitrite (NOx) concentration in the LV. Histopathological analysis showed that ethanol did not induce inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis or edema in the LV. No differences in the ventricular expression of iNOS, Nox2 or COX-2 as well as in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were found after treatment with ethanol. Our study provided novel evidence that ethanol consumption augmented the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the synthesis of pro inflammatory proteins in the LV through TNFR1-dependent mechanisms. These findings provided novel mechanistic insights about the contribution of TNFR1 in the initial steps of the cardiac damage induced by ethanol.

AB A single layer of epithelial cells creates an interface between the host and microorganisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. In a healthy intestine, commensal bacteria and their metabolites can interact with epithelial cells as they are identified by Toll-like receptors (TLRs); This interaction results in homeostasis and immune responses. The present study aimed at evaluating Faecalibacterium prausnitzii- and extracellular vesicles (EVs)-induced expression of involved genes in TLRs signaling pathway and cytokines production in Caco-2 cell line. In this study, Caco-2 cell line was treated with F. prausitzii and its EVs. Using the protein levels of 12 cytokines were also evaluated by ELISA assay. F. prausnitzii induced upregulation in FOS, JUN, TNF-alpha, NFKB1, TLR3, IKBKB and CD86 genes. Furthermore, stimulation of Caco-2 cells with EVs derived from F. prausnitzii induced upregulation of CXCL8, CCL2, FOS, MAP2K4, TLR7, TLR3, IRF1, NFKBIA and TNF-alpha genes. Based on ELISA assay, Caco-2 cells treated with F. prausnitzii and its EVs showed a significant increase in TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-8, and IL-10 expression and significant decreased in IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17a, IFN-gamma compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, EVs derived from F. prausnitzii showed greater efficacy in decreasing the inflammatory cytokines and increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines, compared to F. prausnitzii. Our findings can be used as a theoretical model for EVs application in the potential treatment of inflammation.

ID INFLAMMATION; INFECTION
AB Ureaplasma species (spp.) are considered commensals of the adult urogenital tract, but may cause chorioamnionitis and preterm birth as well as sepsis and meningitis in neonates. Pathomechanisms in Ureaplasma-driven neuroinflammation are largely unknown. This study addressed mRNA and protein expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in native or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) exposed to Ureaplasma (U.) urealyticum or U. parvum. Ureaplasma spp. reduced G-CSF mRNA (p < 0.05) and protein expression (p < 0.01) and increased VEGF mRNA levels (p < 0.01) in native HBMEC. Upon co-stimulation, Ureaplasma isolates enhanced LPS-evoked VEGF and ICAM-1 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), but mitigated G-CSF and VCAM-1 mRNA responses (p < 0.05). In line with previous findings, our results indicate an ability of Ureaplasma spp. to compromise blood-brain barrier integrity, mitigate immune defense, and subdue neuroprotective mechanisms. This may facilitate intracerebral inflammation, allow chronic infections, and promote brain injury. More pronounced effects in co-stimulated cells may indicate an immunomodulatory capacity of Ureaplasma spp.

AB In this study we describe a case study to evaluate the floristic diversity and the soil conditions of post mined area, currently under 14-years of restoration. The study area is located in the municipality of Descoberto, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and has one hectare in the process of restoration through the planting of seedlings. The forest inventory of all individuals with Circumference at Breast Height (CBH) >= 15 cm was carried out and the phytosociological parameters were evaluated. The study area shows a high floristic diversity H' = 3.258 as well as equability (J' = 0.783), evidencing that the study area is floristically heterogeneous and has low ecological dominance. In addition, this area presented floristic similarity to other restored areas that were already in a more advanced restoration process. Considering soil quality, the restored study area shows higher levels of cation exchange capacity (t), approximate sum base values (SB) and base saturation (V) than those verified in nearby areas. Evaluating the successional characteristics (greater presence of individuals of secondary succession) and the domain of species with dispersion by animals, we can infer that the area is in an advanced stage of restoration, as well as performing its environmental and social functions. Thus, we can conclude that the restoration of mined areas is feasible when the restoration techniques are applied correctly. Furthermore, we can say that these successful restoration measures are improving the environmental sustainability and helping considerably the recovery of losses caused by mining.

AB Afforestation is one of the high-efficiency practices for the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems and has been increasingly used worldwide. It is crucial to determine the restoration status of wildlife in afforested forests to effectively monitor biodiversity conservation and the self-sustainability of forest ecosystems, as well as to effectively guide the implementation of afforestation projects in the future. China has the largest area of manmade forests around the world, but the effects of the restoration efforts on the faunal diversity in artificial woodlands are unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of afforestation practices on small mammals in two types of planted forests: Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, an introduced species) and China Armand pine (Pinus armandii, a native species) plantations, and two reference forests: young- and old-growth forests, at the community, population, and individual levels. The diversity of small mammals did not differ significantly among the four forest types and the population densities of small mammals in two plantations were between the young- and old-growth forests. Collectively, our findings indicated that small mammal assemblages had reestablished in afforested forests. Four body condition indices were measured in the Chinese while-bellied rat (Niviventer confucianus), a predominant species, and differences were found between afforested and reference forests. Chinese while-bellied rats had the lowest body masses and highest endoparasite loads in the Japanese larch planted forest, while body length or carcass mass did not differ among the four forest types. In comparison, study rats had slightly lower body masses and lower endoparasite loads in the China Armand pine planted forest than reference forests. These findings indicated that small mammals inhabiting both types of afforested forests had poor body conditions but these trends were worse in the Japanese larch planted forest, i.e., the introduced species. Given that afforestation is a widespread practice for global forest landscape restoration, we propose two suggestions to guide afforestation efforts and the subsequent management thereof: (1) native species rather than exotic species are preferable for use in afforestation projects, and (2) wildlife diversity in afforested forests should be considered when monitoring the restoration and management of degraded forest ecosystems.

AB The Sloping Land Conversion Program is also known as the 'Returning Farmland to Forest Program' intent to gradually recreate farmlands back to the original forested state. Providing cognition on the effects of the policy on the distribution of dominant species is important to better understand plant community structures, development dynamics, regeneration conditions, and possible underlying ecological mechanisms. The purport of this study is to inspect the population structure of Pinus yunnanensis in a 2500 m( )(2)area of abandoned farmland where restituted to forest in 2004. The results showed that the population structure of P. yunnanensis settled on tree age formed an inverted J-distribution (20.1% seedlings, 34.2% young trees, 38.5% middle-aged trees, and 7.1% adult trees) since 2009, whereas seedlings, young trees, and middle-aged trees showed clustered distribution. Seedlings showed the highest aggregation degree (g(r) = 6.4), followed by young trees (g(r) = 2.3) and middle-aged trees (g(r) = 1.7), but a random distribution showed in adults throughout the research area. The spatial relationships among seedlings, young trees, middle-aged trees, and adults indicated that the aggregation consequences increased with the decreasing difference in the diameter at breast height. Furthermore, the correlation of canopy height and diameter at breast height decreased with the increasing competition among the individuals signified that seedlings and young trees growing in the same area might use fewer resources than needed. Generally, the study illustrated that infra-specific competition due to environmental resources is a rarely occurring event.

AB Tropical forests are recognized worldwide for providing ecosystem services that contribute greatly to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we hypothesize that tree species abundance distribution is determined by the commonness-rarity balance of species during tropical forest recovery through natural regeneration. We sampled 45 20 m x 50 m plots across three sites in secondary forests with different stand ages (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) after shifting cultivation, and an old-growth forest (> 100 years old) located in the Northern Amazon forest, Venezuela. We explored the variations in woody species abundance distribution and compositional similarity using a chronosequence approach. There was a clear pattern of increasing species abundance in forest successions, from second-growth to old-growth forests. Species abundance in the old-growth forest was much higher than in the second-growth forest. The niche-preemption model showed a high goodnessof-fit to the 5-year old second-growth forest, while 10- and 15-year old second-growth forests and the old-growth forest showed a significant fit to the lognormal model. Along the species-rank axis, the most common species accounted for 54% of the total proportional abundance at the earliest successional stage (5-year old), whereas the relative proportion of the most common species remained relatively stable at 22%-25% in the following successional stages (i.e., old-growth forest). Species dominance was lower in old-growth forest than those in second-growth forest, where there were seven species with the highest importance values within the community. There were obvious differences in relation to the old-growth forest, where rare species were present. The results we present here are crucial for designing and implementing proper, goal-oriented forest restoration strategies, and should aid future research.

AB Mining pit in a channel bed causes disturbance to the flow characteristics. To interpret the phenomenon of change in flow characteristics in a mining pit, experimental study was performed in a filling laboratory flume. This research focuses on the impact of mining pit on different turbulent parameters, such as flow velocity, Reynolds shear stress distribution, turbulent kinetic energy fluxes, and higher order moment distribution. We have observed dropped in flow velocity in the pit and also significant reversal velocity layer at the pit bottom. The analysis of Reynolds shear stress and higher order moment distribution shows higher values of velocity fluctuations in the pit than the upstream section. The response of bursting events, which is identified by the third order moment, shows influence of sweep events near the bed in all four sections. Third order moment analysis also shows a rise in dominance of sweep events along the flow depth in the pit and it's downstream, compared to the upstream section. The kurtosis distribution shows highly intermittent nature of turbulence close to the channel bed. The longitudinal turbulent kinetic energy fluxes and vertical turbulent kinetic energy fluxes are in downstream and downward directions for both inner and outer layer in the pit region, which shows an increase in bed particle mobility in that region, whereas it is present only in the inner layer at the upstream section. Additionally, improved bed load transport equation by incorporating pit geometry has been proposed for alluvial channel subjected to sand mining.

AB Four horizontal subsurface flow pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) named as S1, S2, M1 and M2 were constructed to treat aquaculture wastewater. And two different plant species (Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) were cultivated in single and mixed planting patterns in these four CWs. The removal rate of conventional pollutants (nutrient and organic compounds), antibiotics including enrofloxacin (ENR), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated among those CWs. The total nitrogen and NH4+-N removal rates of all CWs were 73.24%-91.46% and 61.20%-92.27%, respectively. CWs with mixed planting patterns, such as M1 (planted with Iris pseudacorus at the forepart and Phragmites australis at the back) and M2 (alternate cultivation with Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) showed better performances than CWs planted with single plant species, such as S1 (Iris pseudacorus) and S2 (Phragmites australis). However, S1 and S2 exhibited higher removal efficiencies for emerging contaminants: S1 had removal efficiencies of 77.64%, 68.70%, and 58.21% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively, and S2 had removal efficiencies of 81.11%, 64.94%, and 56.26% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively. Compared with single planting, the dominant genera in mixed planting exhibited lower relative abundance in anaerobes and higher percent of bacteria associated with nitrogen metabolism, indicating that different plant physiological characteristics affected the microbial community structures of the CWs.

AB Biological crusts (BCs) are reported to be soil ecological engineers critical in restoration of degraded ecosystems and rehabilitation of anthropogenic substrates, yet their occurrence and influence on such substrates is not well understood. We studied physical and chemical properties of biological crusts and layers immediately beneath them, compared with non-BC covered patches on two gold mine tailings dumps in tropical Zimbabwe. The aim was to determine the influence of biological crusts on fertility and texture of the substrate. We hypothesized that BCs alter tailings' chemical and physical properties, yielding improved fertility and finer texture and that the fertility and finer particle content would decrease with depth. Physicochemical properties of tailings were studied within 36 quadrats, each 30 cm x 30 cm, across two gold tailings dumps from three patches, namely; (1) patches consisting of BCs only, (2) patches with both BCs and vegetation, and (3) non-BCs patches without vegetation. In each patch, we sampled the crust along with two layers immediately below (0-1 cm and 1-5 cm). Patch type had a significant effect on mineral and total N, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg, organic carbon (OC), available and total Zn and Mn, and available Ni. The interactive effect of patch type and layer was significant for all parameters except OC and electrical conductivity (EC). Total N, OC, exchangeable Ca, K and Mg and silt content were signficantly higher on the BC patches than the bare patches. Overall, a PCA based on soil properties showed that sites in the three patches were distinct. Our results concurred with our hypothesis and point to the existence of significant effect of BCs on underlying substrate fertility. Results revealed a potential role for BCs in the early development of tailings, notably in enriching the soil N, OC, and basic cations. We recommend close monitoring of the evolution of BC on gold tailings to develop approaches to effectively remediate such environments using BCs.

AB In 1992, damming was performed in Punarbhaba river (India and Bangladesh), disturbing water flow and riparian wetland ecology. We measured the eco-hydrological failure rate, degree of flooding alteration and degree of eco-hydro deficit in relation to indicators of hydrological alteration in riparian wetlands. Normalized Differences Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) images derived from Landsat satellite images were studied. A greater intensity of NDWI and MNDWI score were associated with the higher amount of water availability and therefore, monthly NDWI and MNDWI values were used. We showed that due to the attenuation of water availability (52% in pre-monsoon season, 34% in monsoon, and 32% in post-monsoon seasons), most months had a considerable decrease of NDWI/MNDWI scores, often below acceptable ecological thresholds. The registered failure rates for attaining the eco-hydrological threshold exceeded 100%. The estimated degree of flooding alteration in the larger parts of wetlands reached 100%, indicating a high degree of impact. Up to 54% of wetlands were eco-hydrologically deficit and 36% of wetlands were critically affected. Sustenance of ecological flow is necessary to reduce the growing hydrological crisis of the wetland habitat and ecosystem.

AB New York City (NYC)'s drinking water reservoirs supply over four billion liters each day to over nine million consumers in NYC and upstate communities. In the last 25 years, the City has invested nearly $2 billion in watershed protection programs (WPPs) to maintain high source water quality, allowing NYC to avoid filtration for 90% of the supply. This study involves the use of a model to evaluate the impact of WPPs on phosphorus (P) loading in the Cannonsville Reservoir watershed, one of the unfiltered water supply sources. The model is SWAT-Hillslope (SWAT-HS), a modified version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) that can realistically predict variable source runoff processes. We applied the SWAT-HS model to this watershed to test its ability to simulate conditions observed after the implementation of watershed protection and evaluate the impact of point and non-point source WPPs on watershed export of P. When applied to a 12-year period of WPP implementation, SWAT-HS predicted streamflow very well with a daily Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.85 at the calibrated outlet and values ranging from 0.56 to 0.78 at six other locations within the watershed. Moreover, the monthly predictions of soluble P (total dissolved P), particulate P, and sediment (total suspended solids) were good with NSE of over 0.73. Model simulations indicated that the dominant source of soluble P was pastures while particulate P originated from both from croplands and pastures. A significant quantity of P was derived from near-stream areas, particularly from pastures where cattle spent time grazing and had access to streams. SWAT-HS was also used to estimate what the P export would have been over this 12-year period without WPP implementation. Point and non-point source programs were found to be important for P control, with non-point source controls most effective during high streamflow, and point source controls more beneficial at low flow.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds have been introduced into aquatic ecosystems by diverse sources and routes, which could lead to potential negative consequences for the environment and human health. The main incorporation route of these compounds is the Wastewater Treatment Plants effluents, due to its low removal efficiency to treat these types of pollutants. Coupled systems between biological treatments and Advance Oxidation Processes emerge as an alternative to reduce costs and obtain high removal efficiencies of these types of substances. In this study, the removal efficiency of micropollutants such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen using a coupled system between a Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland planted with Cyperus ligularis and an Ozonation reactor was evaluated. Three Ozone doses (10, 15 and 21 mg/L) were assessed as explanatory variable and the experiment was performed in six set of samples. In addition, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Total Nitrogen (TN) and in situ variables such as pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, Redox Potential, Electric Conductivity and Temperature were monitored as Covariates. The main results revealed that overall removal efficiency averaged 97.2% and >= 97.3% for Ibuprofen and Naproxen respectively, using the medium Ozone dose (15 mg.L-1) were obtained. Results indicated that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the ozone doses used, whereas significant statistical differences were found between coupling performance and individual technologies. Likewise, the coupled system demonstrated versatility regarding organic matter and nitrogen removal, with performances above to 70% and 50% in terms of DOC and TN, respectively.

AB Excess nutrient export from lowland artificial watersheds (polders) led to severe eutrophication and harmful algal blooms of their surrounding rivers and lakes. Taking River Zhong in Lake Taihu basin as the study area, this study attempted to quantify the impacts of polders' land use changes on river nutrient conditions. A Nitrogen (N) Dynamic Polder model and a Phosphorus (P) Dynamic Polder model was used to estimate N and P export from lowland polders in the context of land use change. The investigation results showed that N and P contribution to River Zhong increased by 7-30% in case that 30% of agricultural lands (paddy lands or dry lands) were changed into residential areas. In case that 30% agricultural lands were changed into water areas, N and P contribution can be decreased by 6% and 35%, respectively. Fertilization period especially during rainy season (from June to August) were the hot moments of nutrient loss, accounted for above 50%. Infiltration was the main pathway of N and P export from polders, accounting for more than 60%. Therefore, from management perspective, we argued controlling urban areas, maintaining water areas and controlling fertilization for polders could be potential strategies for reducing river nutrient concentration in River Zhong.

AB Aristolochia contorta is a perennial vine with a narrow distribution range; it is also the only host plant for Sericinus montela (the dragon swallowtail), a vulnerable species in Korea. To better understand the optimal habitat characteristics of A. contorta, a field survey and a mesocosm experiment were conducted. A total of 86 quadrates in 10 sites were surveyed in Korea. Host types were classified into four categories: herb, shrub, tree, and artificial host. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that the host type had the greatest influence on the growth characteristics of A. contorta. The highest coverage (44.4%) and highest number of leaves (526.7 m(-2)) were observed on artificial support quadrats, whereas the longest stems (162.8 cm) and biggest leaves (46.6 cm(2)) were observed on tree host quadrats. Optimal growth of A. contorta seemed to need appropriate shade and physical support, such as a tree host. To establish the effects of shade and support on morphological and reproductive traits of A. contorta, we applied factorial treatments of two light conditions, 100% and 50% relative light intensity (100%RLI and 50%RLI, respectively) and two support conditions (with and without support) in the mesocosm experiment. The group with 50%RLI and support had the largest single leaf area with the longest stem, internode and petiole. Also, inflorescences developed only in the 50%RLI with support group. In order to improve the growth of A. contorta in artificial habitats established for conservation, it is necessary to provide proper shade (about 50%RLI) and install physical supports.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 20% of the similar to 3000 Pg of global soil organic carbon. Carbon-rich peatlands cover upwards of 65% of the landscape in northern Canada where resource extraction activities disturb both the carbon pools and the future carbon sequestration capacity of the landscape. Previous estimates of the carbon losses from this disturbance predict a complete loss of the region's peatland carbon pool. Mining industries operating in these sensitive environments have recently begun constructing closure landscapes which are intended to develop carbon cycle processes similar to undisturbed northern peatlands. This study investigates eddy covariance fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) at one of Canada's first fully constructed boreal plains watersheds, the Sandhill Fen Watershed. During the first three years since inception, only the lowland region had an annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) indicative of increasing CO2 sink potential. The lowland region was characterized by saturated salvaged peat soils, standing water, thriving communities of Typha and Carex spp. and was a net CO2 sink of 77 g C m(-2) in the third year. At the same time the upland and the midland regions characterized by moist salvaged peat soils and a mix of herbaceous, shrub and planted Picea glauca and Pinus banksiana remained net sources of CO2. Despite similar rates of gross primary production, ecosystem and plot-level respiration rates in the lowland were significantly lower than in the midland region, likely due to very low reduction potentials within the lowland's saturated soils. With no other significant outflows of carbon, the lowland of the Sandhill Fen Watershed may be in the early stages of organic matter accumulation. Due to limited oxidation of the salvaged peat substrate in the lowland region, wetland reclamation employing these techniques may reduce the disturbance loss of the carbon pool in the boreal plains.

AB Biosorption is an efficient technology for the decontamination of metals from industrial wastewater. In present study, cadmium resistant fungal strain Aspergillus niger was isolated from the effluent of electroplating industry. The effect of five independent variables i.e. pH (2-8), initial Cd(II) ion concentration (20-180 mg/L), biomass dosage (0.5-2.5 g/mL), temperature (10-60 degrees C) and contact time (10-80 min) was studied on Cd(II) biosorption by employing Aspergillus niger using batch mode. Optimum conditions were selected for maximum biosorption. The experimental design i.e. Box- Behnken design (BBD) was aimed at distinguishing the optimum levels of the above selected process variables. Maximum biosorption was achieved at pH 5.0, initial Cd(II) concentration (100 mg/L), biomass dosage (1.5 g/mL), temperature (35 degrees C) and contact time (45 min). At optimum conditions, 93% removal of cadmium ions was achieved. The Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to spot the correlation between the various parameters.

AB Explicit biodiversity level at large spatial scale is often indicated by species richness. The spatial variability of species richness has been postulated to be related with influencing factors such as climate, habitat and human activities using many geostastical methods. Understanding the relationship between species richness and its influencing factors is of critical importance for its conservation. As tree cover data with high resolution can reflect the terrestrial habitat with environment, its efficiency for modelling spatial pattern of biodiversity was investigated in this study. The spatial distribution of tree cover and its influencing factors in Yunnan province, and the relationship between tree cover and species richness of mammals and birds were analyzed by linear regression method and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. The results showed that tree cover in this study region exhibited a substantially spatial heterogeneity, which was affected by human activities, topography and climate. Linear regression analysis showed that tree cover was significantly correlated with the species richness of mammals and birds. The explanatory power (local R-2) of GWR model between tree cover and species richness of mammals and birds showed great spatial variability. The predicted spatial distribution of species richness of mammals and birds was consistent with the actual observed values. Our study revealed that the GWR model provides local details of spatial variation in species richness of mammals and birds. These results will be helpful to understand the impact of tree cover on variation of species richness of mammals and birds under global change and will be of theoretical significance for better conservation and management of biodiversity.

AB Fire disturbance is an intrinsic component of the Mediterranean biome playing an important role in ecosystem dynamics and processes. However, frequent and severe anthropogenic wildfires can be detrimental to natural ecosystems, particularly in small natural protected areas, where they may hamper the flow of ecosystem services (ES). While post-fire dynamics of individual ES are heavily context-dependent, the primary productivity of the ecosystem can be regarded as a generic driver of several provisioning and regulating ES, as it represents the amount of energy available to plants for storage, growth, and reproduction, which drives future ecosystem structure and functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic wildfire on the primary productivity of a rare wetland ecosystem in the Natura 2000 site "Torre Guaceto" in Southern Europe. Productivity was estimated by calculating a 15-year time series of vegetation indices (EVI and NDWI) from remotely sensed MODIS imagery. Our results in terms of PP trends may be relevant to assess the change in ecosystems services provided by wetlands. Interactions between wildfire, ecosystem productivity and climate were then analyzed. During the selected period, climate did not play a significant effect on primary productivity, which was mainly driven by post-fire vegetation recovery. Findings of the present study demonstrate that the wildfire affecting the Natural Protected Area of Torre Guaceto in summer 2007 had a major effect on primary productivity, inducing the regeneration of Phragmites australis and the replacement of old individuals by structurally and functionally better ones.

AB Soil Freeze-Thaw Cycles (FTCs) can provide large amounts of labile C and N to microorganisms to stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission in the soil. To explore the effects of FTCs on N2O fluxes in the pristine riparian marsh, we used the static chamber-GC techniques to investigate N2O fluxes in the marsh meadow Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland (MMCW), Ecotone wetland (EW) and Carex Schmidtii Meinsh. marsh (CSMM) in Sanjiang Plain from March to April 2016. The results showed that the three marshes were potential sources of N2O during FTCS. The variations of N2O fluxes in the three marshes were significantly different (P < 0.001) during FTCS. Principal component analysis and regression analysis indicated that soil NH4+-N and NO3--N content were the main driving factors of N2O fluxes in MMCW. Though significant correlations were observed between N2O fluxes and soil NH4+-N content in 0 to10 cm soil depth in EW (r=0.98, P < 0.01) and in CSMM (r= 0.93, P < 0.05) respectively, the driving factors of N2O fluxes during FTCS in EW and CSMM were uncertain. In conclusion, soil FTCS might contribute to the emissions of N2O in the pristine riparian marshes.

AB Agricultural production on wetland soils can be significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disinfection byproduct precursors, mercury and nutrients to downstream water bodies and accelerate land subsidence. Presented as a potential solution for in-situ water quality improvement and land subsidence mitigation, chemically enhanced treatment wetlands (CETWs) were used to leverage both coagulation and wetland processes. In this study, we evaluated the performance of coagulants ferric sulfate (Fe dosing) and polyaluminum chloride (Al dosing) to remove pollutants from agricultural drain water using the coagulation system designed for CETWs. Both coagulation treatments removed over 70% DOC from source waters, resulting in removal efficiencies (mg-DOC removed per mg-metal dosed) of 1 under Al dosing and 0.5 under Fe dosing. Coagulation by both treatments preferentially removed UV254 active compounds compared to the bulk DOC concentration, suggesting coagulation targeted aromatics more effectively. Phosphates and haloacetic acids were also removed more readily, whereas trihalomethanes, dissolved organic nitrogen and filtered mercury species were removed at similar or lower rates than DOC. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen was not amenable to coagulation and removal was not observed. Freundlich, Langmuir and Monod models explained 33% of the variance in DOC removal for Al dosing and 78-89% of the variance for Fe dosing. All three models indicated Al dosing had higher removal efficiency and affinity for DOC than Fe dosing under study conditions, but when used to predict maximum removal efficiency there was no cohesiveness between the three models due to different model assumptions.

AB Trees supply numerous ecosystem services to the urban environment, including mitigating the urban heat island, improving air quality, and providing habitat for wildlife. However, due to the structural stability requirements of infrastructure such as sidewalks, roadways, and parking areas, urban soils are commonly characterized by high compaction levels, low porosity, and nutrient deficiency, often to the detriment of urban tree health. By transmitting surface loads to a compacted subbase, suspended pavement systems create a matrix of uncompacted soil that promotes tree health through increased root access to oxygen, water, and nutrients. Recently, interest has grown in making suspended pavement systems multi-functional by designing them to act as subsurface bioretention practices in ultra-urban areas where space may be limited due to concentrated development and high land costs. Despite this interest, only one study has tested suspended pavement systems in this application. Further, the study utilized lined installations to allow a controlled water quality assessment; however, this negated the ability to fully quantify runoff reduction. Two unlined suspended pavement systems designed to function as subsurface bioretention practices were installed in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA, in 2015 and monitored over 27-months. During that period, over 99% of runoff volumes were reduced by the free-drained north system, which completely captured runoff from 79% of storms. The underdrained south system reduced influent runoff by over 88% and captured all runoff from 83% of events during the study. Influent TSS concentrations were significantly reduced by the south suspended pavement system, though no other significant differences between influent and effluent pollutant concentrations were observed, presumably due to low influent concentrations. This study demonstrates the viability of field-scale suspended pavement systems in a stormwater management application and illustrates the hydrologic and pollutant removal capabilities of these systems to manage urban stormwater runoff.

AB Clipping is a common management option in semiarid grasslands, but whether topography mediates the effects of clipping on plant and soil nutrients is poorly studied. We examined the interacting effects of clipping and topography (slope aspect and slope position) on the aboveground biomass and carbon (C) and nutrient concentration of graminoid and forb, as well as on soil organic carbon (OC) and nutrient content in a restored grassland under long-term grazing exclusion. Clipping increased the aboveground biomass of forb and total community, and decreased most C and nutrient concentration in aboveground biomass, but did not influence the aboveground biomass of graminoid or the content of soil OC and nutrient. Slope aspect did not change the effects of clipping on most plant aboveground biomass, or soil OC and nutrients. However, slope position altered the effects of clipping on soil inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available potassium, with lower nutrient levels on the upper slope but higher nutrient levels on the middle and lower slopes. The results demonstrate that slope position should be considered in predicting the response of soil biogeochemical processes to clipping in hilly semiarid restored grasslands.

AB The riparian zones that were surround bodies of fresh water have been extensively degraded by human influence. Their restoration strength and management are an issue of urgent. Particularly, the knowledge based for the restoration of riparian zone has expanded in recent years. However, progress on a global scale has been limited, because little is known about its complex and diverse functions and structures. A national ecological restoration project of Taihu Lake (China) provided a case study for classifying and restoring the riparian zone. In this work, we quantified the classification of riparian zone, vegetation-zone in the ecotones and a recommended suite of introduced riparian vegetation communities. Taking the structures of the ecotones, soil conditions, vegetation configurations, and anthropogenic disturbances into account, six types of vegetation-zone were used to classify riparian zone, which are as follow: reefs, islands, dokdo-island, island-shore, dike-shore, and shoreland. Then a multi-dimensional habitat vegetation restoration mode for each type based on six vegetation-zones were also recommended. The water ecological quality was developed to a healthy state under this implement. Therefore, results suggest that profound division of habitat-vegetation is important in the modern ecological engineering theories for riparian zone. In order to provide a key parameter for Taihu Lake and other worldwide lakes with similar characteristics, an eco-restoration model and a reconstruction scheme for the vegetation community have been presented. In a conclusion, these recommendations could largely assist further development for lake management.

AB Globally, small agricultural waterways fed by springs, tile drains, and seeps can disproportionately contribute to downstream nutrient loading, which is associated with declines in water quality and ecosystem functions. Treating nitrate using a multiple tool, multiple-scale approach in small waterways could offer improved management of these sources. We used a before-after-control-impact design to test the suitability of three small (< 30 m(3)) edge-of-field denitrifying woodchip bioreactors and stream bank re-shaping and riparian planting. Over three-and-a-half-years, riparian rehabilitation enhanced nitrate flux attenuation compared to pre-rehabilitation, but only under relatively low flow conditions. In comparison, there were no significant changes in nitrate flux in a control waterway under any flow condition. N fluxes always increased in both the control and treatment waterways when reaches gained water downstream. Nitrate removal efficiencies for all three bioreactors ranged from < 10 to > 99%, with performance variations due to short residence times and fluctuations in source water chemistry. A single tile drain bioreactor removed 0.41 kg NO3-N d(-1), equivalent to similar to 10% of the mean daily tile drain nitrate load. Greenhouse gas fluxes from the tile drain bioreactor were similar to the surrounding pasture (CO2-C mean: 185-286 mg Cm-2 h(-1); N2O-N mean: 49-90 mu gNm(2) h(-1)), suggesting no negative impacts from the bioreactor. Overall, our results suggest a multiple-tool, multiple-scale application of rehabilitation tools can reduce downstream N fluxes, but only under certain flow conditions. Thus, local rehabilitation tools, like those trialed here, will need to be scaled appropriately if they are to significantly attenuate nutrient losses from small agricultural waterways. Moreover, these will not replace catchment-scale nutrient plans to address losses from land and legacy groundwater N pollution.

AB Spur dikes have been utilized as channel regulation structures worldwide, especially in the upstream tidal reach of river estuary, where is a superexcellent habitat for resident fish or migratory fish during different life history stages. However, local hydraulic characters will be altered upon spur dikes establishment, resulting in several influence on fish habitat. The purpose of this paper was to reveal the impacts mechanism of spur dikes on fish habitat in a tidal reach through a comprehensive analysis based on some previous neglected aspects, such as fish physiological characters, hydraulic variations and essential factors alterations of the aquatic ecosystem. Hydraulic information around spur dikes was acquired through a 3D hydrodynamic model, and validations of tidal level, velocity and diversion ratio yielded a high accuracy. Turbulent rapid around spur dikes head and mild nearshore environment behind structures have some potentialities to become new spawning grounds, for fish spawning semi-pelagic eggs and fish laying adhesive eggs respectively. Benefitted from effective mixture of water during a tidal cycle, plenty of planktons and organic matters will be brought in and gradually enriched behind structures, thus a favorable feeding ground will appear there. Meanwhile, deflecting flow induced by spur dikes may cause some hazards for survival probability of migratory larval fish. It is drifted off the nearshore into the river middle, where is a higher turbulent intensity and less phytoplankton concentration. In summary, spur dikes possess tremendous ecological effects, i.e. enriching the eco-hydraulic diversity, not only as a velocity shelter. In addition, research result could afford a sufficient basis for environment conservations to restore aquatic ecosystem with spur dikes.

AB We present a rare long-term management project of annual cutting, hay removal and plant species survey on a small Danish freshwater meadow (0.6 ha) for an extended period of 21 years. We evaluate whether disturbance by hay-cutting could reduce the dominance of tall grasses, increase species richness and change the representation of growth strategies and Ellenberg indicator values among species. We also evaluate whether hay removal could reduce soil fertility and increase the proportion of oligotrophic species. We found that species richness increased 3-fold over time accompanying a marked decline of vegetation height and proportion of tall, clonal grasses. Comparison with an adjacent un-cut area confirmed that species richness and evenness increased extensively in the plant community by hay-cutting. During the first ten years of the restoration period, species richness increased for both oligotrophic and eutrophic species, while during the latter 11 years only small oligotrophic species continued to increase. The proportion of Grime's competitive C-strategies and Ellenberg's N indices in the community declined over time in accordance with the 50% decrease of organic matter, total and exchangeable phosphorus in the soils. We conclude that long-term hay-cutting by disturbance and nutrient removal can markedly increase plant biodiversity as well as the representation of orchids and small species by breaking the dominance of tall grasses. Focused effort over decades can ensure a remarkable high biodiversity even in a small area, which will go unnoticed in common short-term experiments.

AB The pond-ditch circulation system (PDCS) is a promising solution for the restoration of rural wastewater. However, the underlying nitrogen removal mechanisms and roles of functional genes in nitrogen transformation processes have not yet been quantified at the molecular level. In this study, PDCSs have been found to have high removal efficiencies when the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) was high (> 70%; 62.7-93.9%, respectively). Meanwhile, the presence of simultaneous nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and denitrification processes were the primary nitrogen removal mechanisms in the PDCSs. According to the stepwise regression analysis and path analysis, two key functional gene groups, nosZ/(nirS + nirK) and (nxrA/amoA), were driving these major processes for TN and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), respectively. Moreover, the key functional gene group narG/nxrA was affecting processes related to nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) and nitrite-nitrogen (NO2--N) conversion. Furthermore, results from the N-15 isotope pairing technique suggested that for PDCSs, anammox was mainly responsible for nitrogen removal due to its high contribution to total N-2 production (50.3%) in the ditch; denitrification, on the other hand, was primarily attributed to nitrogen removal, rather than the anammox process, in two ponds (41.3-43.1%).

AB The aim of this research was to evaluate the role of constructed wetland (CW) horizontal sub-surface flow pilot-plant beds vegetation, comparing four perennial herbaceous plant species with an unvegetated bed, on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, and CO2(eq) budgets. The research was conducted from April 1st to November 30th in 2012 and 2013 in a pilot plant located in San Michele di Ganzaria (Sicily, Italy) that treated urban wastewaters, studying Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reed), Arundo donax L. (giant reed), Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty (vetiver) and Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deu. (miscanthus). Results showed a greater aboveground biomass yield in the second experimental year than the first one for all species except vetiver, which showed a 10.5% reduction. Considering CWs gases emission, a significantly higher CO2 emission (+52.5%) was monitored in 2013 than 2012 whereas CH4 had the opposite trend (-97.0%). Seasons and plant species influenced gases emission. The lower CO2 emission (median value 5.2 gm(-2) d(-1)) was monitored during the spring seasons when instead was monitored the highest CH4 emission (median value 0.232 gm(-2) d(-1)). Opposite CO2 and CH4 emissions were found in fall. A. donax, M. giganteus and P. australis determined significantly higher (2.9 times) CO2 emission than C. zizanioides and unvegetated bed. Vegetated beds showed a positive CO2(eq) total balance with the best results calculated for A. donax whereas, as expected, it was negative for the unvegetated bed, with a cumulative CO2(eq) emission of 6.68 kgm(-2). Obtained results confirm the active and key role of plant species used in the CW systems and indicate A. donax as the most environmentally friendly species to use under Mediterranean climate conditions, followed by P. australis.

AB The precise understanding of the exciton dynamics of technologically relevant organic systems is important for a plethora of applications, including solar energy conversion. Using state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations based on time dependent density functional theory, we investigate the exciton dynamics of both the pristine and zinc (Zn) intercalated pentacene dimers as a function of the inter-molecular distances. We elucidate that the key difference in the exciton dynamics of pristine (Zn intercalated) pentacene dimers is that in the former (latter) the exciton size increases (decreases) with the increasing inter-molecule distances. Importantly, Zn intercalation causes increasing overlap between the electron and hole states and enhances the generation of low-energy charge-transfer excitons. We believe that our theoretical results are important for the emerging field of organic materials for solar-based applications.

AB Lithium chloride LiCl is widely used as a prototype system to study the strongly dissociated 1-1 electrolyte solution. Here, we combined experimental measurements and classical molecular dynamics simulations to study the ion conduction in this system. Ionic conductivities were reported at both 20 degrees C and 50 degrees C from experiments and compared to results from molecular dynamics simulations. The main finding of this work is that transference numbers of Li+ and Cl- become comparable at high concentration. This phenomenon is independent of the force fields employed in the simulation and may be resulted from the ion-specific concentration dependence of mobility.

AB We investigate the Half-metallic ferromagnetism and optical behaviors of XBeO3 (X = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) using full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. The structural and thermodynamic stabilities are elucidated in terms of the calculated tolerance factor and enthalpy of formation, respectively. The room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism is shown by computing the Curie temperature and spin polarization. The strong hybridization between p-states of alkaline earth metals and 2p-states of oxygen near the Fermi level results total magnetic moment of 2 mu(B). The ferromagnetism occurs due to holes those result in the exchange interactions between the p-states of alkaline earth metals and oxygen. The potential optical applications are also suggested by computing the dielectric constant and refraction.

AB We report the toxic gas sensing ability of ZnO Nanowire performed by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first principle approach. The ZnO Nanowire with rectangular morphology has been modeled and investigated for its energetic stability, analysed in terms of binding energy. The adsorption of a single molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas on the fully relaxed rectangular ZnO Nanowire has been analysed through its dynamic response discussed in terms of conductance. The sensing ability has been evaluated further through adsorption energy, electronic band structure, density of states, Mullikan population and current-voltage analysis of the Nanowire. It has been observed that CO2 is physisorbed on the rectangular ZnO Nanowire via van-der-Waals interaction and relatively shows higher sensitivity of this morphology over other reports, defends this as a good candidate for CO2 sensing using ZnO structures.
