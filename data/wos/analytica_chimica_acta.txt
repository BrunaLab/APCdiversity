AB Over the past few years, loss of patent protection for blockbuster monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs has caused a significant shift in the pharmaceutical industry towards the development of biosimilar products. As a result, multiple biosimilar mAbs are becoming available for a single originator drug. As opposed to small-molecular drugs, protein biopharmaceuticals do not have fully defined and reproducible structures, making it impossible to create identical copies. Therefore, regulators demand biosimilar sponsors to demonstrate similarity with the reference product to prevent safety and efficacy issues with the proposed product. Protein glycosylation is considered a crucially important quality attribute, because of its major role in immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of therapeutic proteins. However, the intrinsic biological variability of glycan structures creates a significant challenge for the current analytical platforms.
   In this review, we discuss the importance of glycan characterization on therapeutic proteins, with a particular focus on the analytical techniques applied for glycan profiling of biosimilar mAb products. In addition, we present a case study on infliximab biosimilars to illustrate the potential clinical implications of differences in glycan profile between originator and biosimilar mAb products.

AB The processes of planetary accretion or formation of the Earth and other celestial objects can be studied by using the Hf-182-W-182 chronometer which requires precise measurements of tungsten isotope ratios. Many comparative measurements for the isotopic composition of tungsten have been performed using either thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Yet, calibrated measurements of tungsten isotope ratios, and, in turn, isotopic abundances and atomic weight, are still lacking. In this study, we report the first independent measurements of all tungsten isotope ratios in five commercial tungsten reagents, including the new NRC candidate isotopic reference material WOLF-1 by MC-ICP-MS with use of the-state-of-the-art optimized regression mass bias correction model and NIST SRM 989 isotopic rhenium as calibrator.

AB Material science requires advanced analytical methods which allow size-fractionated and chemical quantification of powdered nanomaterials. Nanopowders can be introduced to a helium plasma by pneumatic nebulization based on fluidized bed approach and measure with a time resolution of 4-20 ms. This new analytical technique is accessible by an microwave plasma optical emission spectrometry (MWP-OES) operated in single-particle mode, providing information about their elemental composition, size, dispersity and agglomeration of nanoparticles (NPs). Next, NPs can be characterized by the corresponding element-to-element molar ratios and compared to the theoretically expected values. For a series of nanooxides, size detection limits between 5 and 250 nm are achieved at an integration time of 10 ms. For mixed nanooxides sample, satisfactory temporal resolution is obtained with particle coincidence events below 5%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder that affects predominately dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which mainly control movement. Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a major constituent of Lewy bodies that are reported to be the most important toxic species in the brain of PD patients. In this critical review, we highlight novel electrochemical biosensors that have been recently developed utilizing aptamers and antibodies in connection with various nanomaterials to study biomarkers related to PD such as alpha-syn. We also review several research articles that have utilized electrochemical biosensors to study the interaction of alpha-syn with biometals as well as small molecules such as clioquinol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and baicalein. Due to the significant advances in nanomaterials in the past decade, electrochemical biosensors capable of detecting multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples in real-time have been achieved. This may facilitate the path towards commercialization of electrochemical biosensors for clinical applications and high-throughput screening of small molecules for structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.

   MECHANISMS
AB Chromium is a toxic element naturally present in natural waters whose chemical speciation regulates its cycling, mobility and bioavailability. We present here: 1- an improved analytical method for chromium speciation (Cr(VI) vs Cr(III)) in estuarine samples by catalytic adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetric (cat-AdCSV) and 2- a study highlighting a significant change of redox speciation during summer and winter. Initial measurements first revealed that surface-active substances (SAS) present in estuarine samples strongly influenced the analytical determination of Cr by partially masking the Cr peak through an increase of the background current. We found that the application of a low negative accumulation potential (-1.65 V) resulted in much better voltammograms compared to those obtained using the usual accumulation potential of -1.0 V. Using humic acid (HA) as a model SAS of natural origin, we show that this negative potential clearly prevents adsorption of SAS on the Hg-electrode surface, which in turns benefits the adsorption of the in-situ formed Cr(III)-DTPA complex and the resulting signal. The optimised method was applied to determine chromium redox speciation and distribution along the 23 km long salinity gradient, well oxygenated, Krka River estuary (Croatia). Cr(VI) was found to be the dominant redox species in both summer and winter, with Cr(III) contribution being lower in summer (up to similar to 30%, average of similar to 5%) than in winter (up to similar to 50%, average of similar to 30%). In summer, lower concentrations of Cr(VI) were found in the freshwater end-member (2.5 nM) than in the seawater end-member (4-5 nM), while the opposite trend was found in winter. Hexavalent chromium exhibited a non-conservative behaviour along the salinity gradient for both seasons. Chromium predominantly exists in dissolved phase, and contribution of particles reactive Cr(III) was minor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Combining of amperometric and square wave voltammetric methods (SWV), the dual-signal sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for quantitative determination of amyloid beta-protein (A beta). Cu was doped into Al2O3 lattice (Cu-Al2O3) and reacts with graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to generate Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4 with internal dual-reaction center structure, which has good catalytic properties of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Subsequently, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was introduced into Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4 (Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4-Pd) that not only synergistically catalyzed H2O2 but also immobilized anti-A beta (Ab(1)) via Pd-NH2. The Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4 was used as matrix material to modify the electrode, which can produce obviously electrochemical signals through Amperometry i-t curve. Meanwhile, the Zr6O4(OH)(4)(CO2)(12) (UiO-66) modified with polyaniline (PANI) has the large specific surface, good conductivity and adsorption capacity, which can support methylene blue (MB) as signal label of anti-A beta (Ab(2)). Therefore, the UiO-66@PANI-MB can provide an obviously electrochemical signal about MB through SWV. Under optimal conditions, the dual-signal sandwich electrochemical immunosensor has salient analytical performance and both signal platforms provide more accurate results. The linear range of detection obtained by the immunosensor was 10 fg/mL-100 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 3.3 fg/mL. This method not only provided a reliable guarantee for the experimental detection but also provided an effective strategy for the detection of other biological. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel all-in-one paper-based sampling concept for mass spectrometric bottom-up protein analysis is here demonstrated in a chip format integrating instant immunocapture, protein reduction, - alkylation and tryptic digestion all in-device. Conventional laboratory grade filter paper was coated with the polymer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-vinyl-4,4-dimethyl azlactone (pHEMA-VDM) with a subsequent covalent immobilization of the monoclonal antibody E27 targeting the biomarker human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In-device protein reduction and alkylation was optimized with regards to reagent concentration and reaction pH. The sampling concept showed a high degree of performance between 10 and 1000 ng/mL (R-2 > 0.99) by a five-point calibration curve sampled with hCG spiked to human serum samples and freshly collected whole blood samples, respectively. LOD (experimentally obtained at 100 pg/mL (2.64 pM/0.9 IU/L)) was demonstrated to be up to ten times lower with more than six times faster sample preparation than what has previously been reported for on-paper analysis of hCG in human serum samples.

AB The dehydration reaction of tetraamino porphyrin and 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde was performed for the synthesis of a novel covalent organic framework (COF), which was decorated on magnetic Fe3O4 to obtain core-shell structured Fe3O4@COFs nanospheres for the first time, for effective extraction and enrichment of sulfonamides (SAs). The morphology and structure of the synthesized nanospheres were characterized through various methods. The extraction conditions for six SAs including sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine were systematically optimized. Fe3O4@COFs nanospheres were evaluated for magnetic solid-phase extraction. By coupling with high-performance liquid chromatography, a facile and sensitive method was established for the quantitation analysis of six SAs. The method showed good linearity ranging from 1 to 500 ng mL(-1) with R-2 > 0.99, high sensitivity with LODs in the range of 0.2-1 ng mL(-1), and high precision with RSDs <= 6.3%. This method was further applied into determination of SAs in environmental water and food samples, with recoveries in the range of 65.3%-107.3% and RSDs <= 6.7%. These successful applications suggest that the core-shell structured Fe3O4@COFs nanospheres could be used as a potential adsorbent for efficient extraction and analysis of trace SAs.

AB Novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for metformin was synthesized on the surface of magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs) as the support. Metformin was used as the template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker and 2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. The synthesized composite was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The surface molecularly imprinted composite was used for magnetic solid phase microextraction (MSPME) of metformin before its chemiluminescence (CL) determination and its capability was compared with non-imprinted polymer (NIP). The central composite design was used for optimization as well as consideration of possible interaction of effective variables on extraction. Under the optimized conditions, the developed method exhibited the linear dynamic range of 0.5-50.0 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 0.13 mu g L-1 and enhancement factor of 195.3 for the preconcentration of 100 mL of the sample and 500 mu L of an eluent. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSD%) at 5.0 mu g L-1 level of metformin (n = 6) were 3.7 and 4.9%, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of the sorbent was found to be 80.0 mg g(-1), the adsorption of metformin was endothermic and spontaneous and followed the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetic was also found to be best fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. The designed method was successfully applied to the extraction and determination of metformin in bio- logical fluids and water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB N-glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes and associated with many diseases. However, the sensitive and specific detection of glycans via mass spectrometry (MS) remains challenging due to their relatively low abundance and low ionization efficiency. In this work, a new method termed glycan reductive amino acid coded affinity tagging (GRACAT) is developed to address these problems. Through labeling the reducing ends of glycan with a biotinylated arginine, the ionization efficiency of glycan was increased nearly 50-fold and glycan isomers were discriminated by improved signals of fragments in tandem spectra. Moreover, the strong affinity interaction between streptavidin and biotin enabled highly specific enrichment of the biotin-tagged glycans from the mixture of proteins and peptides. We successfully applied GRACAT in the profiling of N-glycome in human serum and bovine milk, in which a total of 55 and 67 N-glycans were detected respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Steroid hormones, structural derivatives of cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, play important roles in modulation of many physiological processes. Comprehensive characterization of steroid hormones is valuable for understanding the process of human life activities and even disease diagnosis. Hitherto systematical characterization of steroid hormones has been rarely investigated. Here, we presented an integrated method for human urine analysis based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry in data-dependent acquisition mode with the following parallel reaction monitoring mode. To process the data acquired by two scan modes, a comparative study of standards' fragmentation behaviors and diagnostic product ions (DPIs) were firstly conducted to facilitate the characterization of steroid hormones. The fragmentation behaviors, DPIs, elemental composition and double-bond equivalent were then simultaneously utilized for systematical characterization of steroid hormones in human urine. Consequently, fragmentation pathways and DPIs for all types of steroid hormones were comprehensively interpreted. It is interesting to find that dehydration is not restricted in the form of hydroxyl groups loss, elimination of the carbonyl oxygen could also generate dehydrated ions. Ultimately, a total of 80 and 107 steroidal hormones were characterized or tentatively identified in human urine of male and female, respectively. The proposed method is expected to provide valuable insights for chemical characterization in complex matrixes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Droplet microfluidics has the ability to greatly increase the throughput of screening and sorting of enzymes by carrying reagents in picoliter droplets flowing in inert oils. It was found with the use of a specific surfactant, the interfacial tension of droplets can be very sensitive to droplet pH. This enables the sorting of droplets of different pH when confined droplets encounter a microfabricated trench. The device can be extended to sort enzymes, as a large number of enzymatic reactions lead to the production of an acidic or basic product and a concurrent change in solution pH. The progress of an enzymatic reaction is tracked from the position of a flowing train of droplets. We demonstrate the sorting of esterase isoenzymes based on their enzymatic activity. This label-free technology, that we dub droplet sorting by interfacial tension (SIFT), requires no active components and would have applications for enzyme sorting in high-throughput applications that include enzyme screening and directed evolution of enzymes.

AB Cholesterol is related to many health diseases and is considered as a metabolic disorder biomarker. This compound, present in all food products of animal origin, can also be used as food authentication biomarker. In this work and for the first time, positional C-13 isotope contents were determined for such a high molecular weight compound. This was possible by means of NMR using adiabatic refocused INEPT. In order to test the potential of this approach for discrimination, hen eggs from different origins were collected. Quantitative extraction of egg yolk cholesterol was optimized, and partial reduced molar fractions of its different C-13 isotopomers were used as predictors in discriminant analysis. Compared with the global C-13 isotopic composition determined using isotope ratio monitoring by Mass Spectrometry, the relative content of cholesterol C-13 isotopomers added valuable power to sample classifications according to their origins. This study paves the way to isotopomics of other steroids and similar molecular weight compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel and sensitive ratiometric fluorescence strategy for the detection of epinephrine (EP) and ascorbic acid (AA) was established based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the molybdenum disulfide quantum dots (MQDs) and the fluorescent oxidative polymerization product (PEP-PEI) of EP in polyethyleneimine (PEI) aqueous solution. The continuous formation of PEP-PEI can lead to the fluorescence quenching of MQDs at 414 nm while the fluorescence of PEP-PEI at 522 nm gradually increased. The introduction of AA can inhibit the oxidative polymerization process of EP due to the strong reducibility of AA, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of MQDs at 414 nm and the fluorescence decreasing of PEP-PEI at 522 nm. Therefore, EP and AA can be monitored by measuring the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 522 nm and 414 nm. A good linear calibration of I-522/I-414 versus EP and AA concentrations were obtained within 0.2-40 mu M and 0.5-40 mu M, respectively. And the detection limit was 0.05 mu M for EP and 0.2 mu M for AA. Furthermore, the developed ratiometric fluorescence method with high sensitivity and selectivity was applied for EP in human urine samples and AA in human serum samples determination with satisfactory results obtained.

AB In this work, the as-prepared V2O5 nanobelts can sensitively quench the fluorescence of nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) based on the inner filter effect (IFE). In the presence of ascorbic acid (AA), the fluorescence of N-CDs can recover through the redox reaction between V2O5 nanobelts and AA. Meanwhile, in the presence of both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and ascorbyl-2-phosphate (AAP), the fluorescence of N-CDs can also restore since AAP can be hydrolyzed into AA by ALP. Under optimum conditions, the linear range for AA is from 0.01 to 2.5 mu M with a detection limit of 3 nM and that for ALP is from 0.1 to 30 U/L with a detection limit of 0.04 U/L (S/N = 3). Particularly, the proposed probe could be successfully used to detect AA and ALP in human serum samples. Furthermore, N-CDs can be applied in fluorescence imaging of Human breast cancer cells with satisfactory results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is of great importance to detect chlorotetracycline (CTC) in a highly sensitive and specific way because of its wide distribution in aquaculture and animal husbandry. Herein, we propose a novel ratiometric fluorescence strategy to assay CTC by using bovine serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs). The BSA-AuNCs consisting of 25 gold atoms (Au25NCs) display a red emission at 640 nm (lambda(ex )= 370 nm). In the presence of CTC, a new blue emission at 425 nm is emerged and its intensity dramatically increases with the addition of more the analyte; meanwhile the red emission at 640 nm shows a linear decrease reversely. However, at identical conditions neither the analogues of CTC as tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC) or doxycycline (DC) induces similar response of BSA-AuNCs. Such interesting phenomenon is proven related to the conversion from large Au25NCs to smaller nanoclusters composing 8 gold atoms (Au8NCs), which intrinsically originate from the interaction between CTC and the ligand BSA. Therefore, a ratiometric probe is established to sensitively detect CTC in the wide range (0.2-10 mu M) with a low limit of detection (LOD) at 65 nM. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to assay CTC in human serum, showing great promise for practical applications in future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel, highly selective and sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) biosensor for insulin (INS) detection was proposed based on aptamer and oligonucleotide-gold nanoparticles functionalized nanosilica @ graphene oxide aerogel. Initially, nanosilica functionalized graphene oxide aerogel (SiO2@GOAG) was successfully prepared and the composite showed rich pore distribution, large specific surface area and good biocompatibility. Insulin aptamer (IGA3) was used as a biorecognition element and oligonucleotide functionalized gold nanoparticles (ssDNA-AuNPs) was used as CL signal amplification materials, which were functionalized on the surface of SiO2@GOAG. The multi-functionalized composite - ssDNA-AuNPs/IGA3/SiO2@ GOAG was obtained and used to construct the CL biosensor for insulin detection. When insulin is present in a sample, the insulin will bind to the IGA3, which will result in the release of ssDNA-AuNPs. The released ssDNA-AuNPs would catalyze the luminescence of luminol and H2O2. The linear range of the CL biosensor for insulin detection was 7.5 x 10(-12) to 5.0 x 10(-9) moL/L and the detection limit was 1.6 x 10(-12) moL/L (S/N = 3). The selectivity and stability of the CL biosensor were also studied and the results showed that the biosensor exhibited high selectivity and good stability due to the introduction of ssDNA-AuNPs/IGA3/SiO2@GOAG. The CL biosensor was finally used for recombinant human insulin detection in recombinant human insulin injection and the results were satisfactory. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NiFe2O4 was synthesized using sol-gel method for sensing electrode material of YSZ based ammonia sensor. NiFe2O4-SEs sintered at 1100 degrees C, 1150 degrees C and 1200 degrees C were characterized by XRD, the BET method and ESEM. By testing the NH3 response of different sensors at 650 degrees C, it was observed that the 1150 degrees C sintered sensor had the largest response value (-104.3 mV for 320 ppm NH3) and the highest sensitivity (-77.56 mV/decade), which were related to the most TPB sites and the moderate gas phase catalytic reaction. The response values of the sensor varied almost linearly with the logarithm of 20-320 ppm NH3 at 600-750 degrees C, which was consistent with mixed-potential mechanism testified by polarization and EIS tests. When the oxygen concentration was at 7-10 vol %, its effect on the response value was within 3%. When the water vapor concentration was 3, 6 and 9 vol %, the ammonia response value was 95.1%, 92.9% and 88.7% of the values when there was no water vapor, respectively. The sensor showed very weak cross sensitivities to NOx, but non-negligible SO2 cross sensitivity. It also displayed slight signal drifts in weekly tests in eight weeks, which showed that the sensor attached with NiFe2O4-SE has a good long-term stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Application of the impedance spectroscopy technique to detection of bacteria has advanced considerably over the last decade. This is reflected by the large amount of publications focused on basic research and applications of impedance biosensors. Employment of modern technologies to significantly reduce dimension of impedimetric devices enable on-chip integration of interdigitated electrode arrays for low-cost and easy-to-use sensors. This review is focused on publications dealing with interdigitated electrodes as a transducer unit and different bacteria detection systems using these devices. The first part of the review deals with the impedance technique principles, paying special attention to the use of interdigitated electrodes, while the main part of this work is focused on applications ranging from bacterial growth monitoring to label-free specific bacteria detection.

AB This review critically discusses the developments on open-tubular liquid chromatography (OT-LC) and open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) during 2014-2018. An appropriate Scopus search revealed 5 reviews, 4 theoretical papers on open-tubular format chromatography, 29 OT-LC articles, 68 OT-CEC articles and 4 OT-LC/OT-CEC articles, indicating a sustained interest in these areas. The open-tubular format typically uses a capillary column with inner walls that are coated with an ample layer or coating of solid stationary phase material. The ratio between the capillary internal diameter and coating thickness (CID/CT) is ideally <= 100 for appropriate chromatographic retention. We, therefore, approximated the CID/CT ratios and found that 22 OT-LC papers have CID/CT ratios <= 100. The other 7 OT-LC papers have CID/CT ratio >100 but have clearly demonstrated chromatographic retention. These 29 papers utilised reversed phase or ion exchange mechanisms using known or innovative solid stationary phase materials (e.g. metal organic frameworks), stationary pseudophases from ionic surfactants or porous supports. On the other hand, we found that 68 OT-CEC papers, 7 OT-LC papers and 4 OT-LC & OT-CEC papers have CID/CT ratios >100. Notably, 44 papers (42 OT-CEC and 2 OT-LC & OT-CEC) did not report the retention factor and/or effective electrophoretic mobility of analytes. Considering all covered papers, the most popular activity was on the development of new chromatographic materials as coatings. However, we encourage OT-CEC researchers to not only characterise changes in the electroosmotic flow but also verify the interaction of the analytes with the coating. In addition, the articles reported were largely driven by stationary phase or support development and not by practical applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A polyaminosaccharide (chitosan, CS) and an aminosaccharide (D-galactosamine, GaIN) were integrated together via hydrothermal assembly to obtain a bis-aminosaccharides composite (CS-GaIN), and a novel and facile chiral sensing platform based on CS-GaIN modified glassy carbon electrode (CS-GaIN/GCE) was fabricated and used for electrochemical recognition of tyrosine (Tyr) enantiomers. CS-GaIN composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and contact angle goniometry. It was observed that CS-GaIN composite exhibited different binding ability for Tyr enantiomers. Under optimized experimental conditions, the oxidation peak current ratio of L-Tyr to D-Tyr (I-L/I-D) and the difference between their peak potentials (Delta Ep = E-D-E-L) were 1.70 and 28 mV at CS-GaIN/GCE by square wave voltammetry (SWV). In addition, the peak currents increase linearly with the concentration of Tyr enantiomers in the concentration range 0.01-1.00 mM with detection limits of 0.65 mu M and 0.86 mu M for L-Tyr and D-Tyr (S/N= 3), respectively. CS-GaIN/GCE also exhibited the ability to determine the percentage of D-Tyr in the racemic mixture. In addition, CS-GaIN/GCE possessed remarkable sensitivity, great stability as well as fine reproducibility. It could be concluded that the chiral interface of CS-GaIN/GCE can provide an ideal platform for electrochemical recognition and determination of Tyr enantiomers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB To explore suitable sensing materials for sensitive and selective detection of phenolic pollutants, CeO2 nanocubes, nanopolyhedras, and nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. These CeO2 nanomaterials were further loaded on the support of graphene nanoplatelets. As-synthesized nanomaterials and nanocomposites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy as well as electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and differential pulse voltammetry. The nanocomposite of graphene nanoplatelets with CeO2 nanorods shows the highest electrochemical activity towards soluble species. Highly sensitive and selective determination of tetrabromobisphenol A, catechol, diethylstilbestrol, and nonylphenol was thus achieved at this nanocomposite based electrode. Their limits of detection were as low as 1.8, 42, 1.5 and 2.7 nM, respectively. Such an electrochemical sensor is thus promising for simple, fast and sensitive electrochemical determining of trace-leveled phenolic pollutants in water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Effective treatment of cancer depends on early detection of tumor markers. In this paper, an effective template-free method was used to prepare CoS2@C three-dimensional hollow sheet nanotubes as the matrix of the immunosensor. The unique three-dimensional hybrid hollow tubular nanostructure provides greater contact area and enhanced detection limit. The CoS2@C-NH2 -HRP nanomaterial was synthesized as a marker and had a high specific surface area, which can effectively improve the electrocatalytic ability of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction while increasing the amount of capture-fixed carcinoembryonic antigen antibody (anti-CEA). In addition, the co-bonded horseradish peroxidase (HRP) can further promote the redox of H2O2 and amplify the electrical signal. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was quantified by immediate current response (i-t), and the prepared immunosensor had good analytical performance under optimized conditions. The current signal and the concentration of CEA were linear in the range of 0.001-80 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 0.33 pg/mL (S/N = 3).

AB Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been widely explored in enrichment of low-abundance glycoproteins/glycopeptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis in glycoproteomics. Currently, most functional groups for recognizing glycoproteins/glycopeptides are usually immobilized on the nanomaterial surface based on covalent modification, which suffers from multistep treatment, surface-dependence, and harsh conditions. In this work, we first report a facile and rapid method for surface functionalization and subsequent glycopeptides enrichment via one-step assembly of maltose-modified oligopeptides with a sequence of Ala-Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala-Lys-Ala-Lys (AEK8-maltose). In physiological conditions, AEK8-maltose readily self-organized into a complete coating layer dominated by beta-sheets on the surface of SiO2@Fe3O4 and C@Fe3O4 MNPs, which remain intact to repeat washing with acidic organic and aqueous solutions extensively used in the sample enrichment treatments. Thus, the resulting AEK8-maltose functionalized MNPs show excellent performance in enrichment of glycopeptides in standard glycoprotein digests (24 glycopeptides from horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 31 glycopeptides from immunoglobulin (IgG)) and human serum digests (282 glycopeptides), including rapid enrichment speed (5 min), high detection sensitivity (0.001 ng/mu L HRP), high selectivity (mass ratios of HRP and bovine serum albumin (BSA) digests up to 1:150), good enrichment recovery (over 86.3%), remarkable stability (repeatable for more than 8 times), and excellent renewability, which are better than or comparable with the literature results reported to date. The current work based on self-assembling oligopeptides provides a mild, economic and nontoxic procedure for one-step surface functionalization of various nanomaterials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The selective adsorption towards glycoproteins from complex biosamples is of vital importance in life science studies. A new zwitterionic hydrophilic material, i.e., a functionalized titanate nanosheet, is prepared by assembling well-dispersed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the surface of ultrathin titanate nanosheets via an ion-exchange approach, followed through immobilizing L-cysteine (L-Cys) by Au-S bonding. This 2D-titanate-based zwitterionic hydrophilic material is shortly termed as L-Cys/Au/TiNSs and it exhibits transverse several hundred nanometers with an ultrathin nanosheet structure. The zwitterionic hydrophilic titanate nanosheets have strong adsorption affinity to glycoproteins, offering a large binding capacity towards immunoglobulin G (1098.9 mg g(-1)), which could be readily stripped into an ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution (0.5%, m/v) with a recovery of 82.4%. The practical applications of L-Cys/Au/TiNSs are further proved by successful specific adsorption of IgG from human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In response to the Canadian federal government's Cannabis Tracking and Licensing System compliance standards, a quantitative method was created for cannabis analysis, and validated using Eurachem V.2 (2014) guidelines. Cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiolic acid, cannabigerolic acid, Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A were all analysed by scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) via LC-MS/MS and isotope dilution. In addition, aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 were also analysed by scheduled MRM via LC-MS/MS and matrix matched calibration curves in order to achieve the reporting limits (<= 2 mu g kg(-1)) set out by the European Pharmacopoeia. The LODs/LOQs were 0.50/1.7, 2.0/6.7, 0.59/2.0, and 0.53/1.8 mu g kg(-1), for B1, B2, G1, and G2 respectively. Thirty one terpenes were analysed by selected reaction monitoring via GC-MS/MS and isotope dilution using beta-myrcene d(6) as a surrogate. All quantitative analyses can be accomplished using less than 1 g of material, with minimal solvent and consumable use, on low resolution instruments in less than 30 min of instrument time. Of important note is this method's power of selectivity, working ranges, and lack of need for extraction consumables such as SPE or QuEChERS, thereby minimising analytical costs and time.

AB The principle of chromatographic fingerprint is that certain diagnostic metabolites should be always distributed in a given plant and currently, it has been widely accepted as a promising means for medicinal plant authentication. Moreover, the chemical profile is the only evidence to clarify the ingredients of those consumable plant products, e.g. traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions. Herein, efforts were made to describe the diagnostic metabolome of medicinal plant or TCM prescription using a binary code sequence. Forty-five well-known medicinal plants along with six relevant prescriptions were employed for concept illustration and proof. Each plant was subjected to chemical characterization, and diagnostic metabolites of all plants were gathered into a chemical pool containing 595 compounds. A robust method enabling the detection of all 595 constituents was then developed using LC coupled to scheduled multiple reaction monitoring. Analyst (TM) software was responsible for automatically judging the presence (defined as "1") or absence (defined as "0") of each analyte with a defined signal-to-noise threshold (S/N > 100). After converting each medicinal plant to a binary sequence consisting of 595 codes, an in-house database was built by involving all sequences. The potentials of sequence library retrieval towards plant authentication, preliminary chemical characterization, and deformulation of TCM prescriptions were demonstrated after that the diagnostic metabolome of each test sample was translated to a binary code sequence. Above all, binary code is a flexible tool for diagnostic metabolite sequencing of medicinal plants, and it should be an alternative tool of DNA barcoding towards plant authentication.

AB Mass spectrometry-based stable isotope labeling provides the advantages of multiplexing capability and accurate quantification but requires tailored bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Despite the rapid advancements in analytical methodology, it is often challenging to analyze stable isotope labeling-based metabolomics data, particularly for isobaric labeling using MS/MS reporter ions for quantification. We report Metandem, a novel online software tool for isobaric labeling-based metabolomics, freely available at http://metandem.com/web/. Metandem provides a comprehensive data analysis pipeline integrating feature extraction, metabolite quantification, metabolite identification, batch processing of multiple data files, online parameter optimization for custom datasets, data normalization, and statistical analysis. Systematic evaluation of the Metandem tool was demonstrated on UPLC-MS/MS, nanoLC-MS/MS, CE-MS/MS and MALDI-MS platforms, via duplex, 4-plex, 10-plex, and 12-plex isobaric labeling experiments and the application to various biological samples.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) were prepared by a solvent-involved molecular fusion strategy using o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as the carbon source and formamide as the reaction solvent. The CDs possessed not only the functional groups inherited from the carbon source and the reaction solvent, but also numerous C=N groups in the structure, resulting from the Schiff base reaction between -NH2 of OPD and C=O of formamide. These functional groups endowed the final CDs with a favorable soft-base property, leading to the high tolerance level toward hard-acid type metal ions and prominent detection selectivity toward Ag+. Moreover, the obtained CDs displayed outstanding biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, and demonstrated potential as an effective photoluminescence probe for intercellular Ag(+)and Cys imaging, preventing the interference of autofluorescence from living tissues. This study focused on the solventinvolved molecular fusion strategy could provide new insights into the design of novel carbon-based nanostructures and optimization of the structure-property relationship of CDs.

AB Although numerous sensors have been successfully fabricated for the detection of various heavy metal ions by employing fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) as nanoprobes, serious cross-interference often occurs when these ions coexist in samples, which results in glaring errors in quantification. In this study, glutathione-protected AuNCs (GSH-AuNCs) were synthesized and found to respond to both Cu2+ and Hg2+ via fluorescence suppression. Intriguingly, addition of Ag+ to GSH-AuNCs could completely inhibit the quenching effect of Hg2+ while not affecting the Cu2+-mediated quenching process. Ag+ can combine with Au+ on the surface of AuNCs to form a strong Ag+-Au+ metallic bond, which disrupts the interaction between Hg2+ and Au+ and thus eliminates the corresponding quenching effect. Based on this phenomenon, a simple sensing approach for highly selective and sensitive detection of Cu2+ in aqueous solution was developed using the GSH-AuNC/Ag+ complex as a fluorescent turn-off nanoprobe. The proposed method exhibited good linearity in the concentration range 0.02-10 mu M with a limit of detection of 12 nM. This assay was demonstrated to be suitable for determination of Cu2+ in real water samples even in the presence of Hg2+, showing great promise as a tool for assessment of environmental security and drinking water quality.

AB The present report introduces the smartphone as a simple, low-cost detector/imager for chemiluminometric hybridization assays and quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (QCPCR). In QCPCR the amplification products from the target and the competitor DNA have identical sizes but differ in a short sequence flanked by the primers. The products are hybridized with their cognate oligonucleotide probes, captured on microtiter wells and detected via an enzyme-catalyzed chemiluminogenic reaction using the smartphone as a detector/imager. We provide, for the first time, data on: (a) the detectability, analytical range and reproducibility of smartphone-based chemiluminometric hybridization assays of double stranded amplification products, (b) the comparison of smartphone-based detection with a conventional digital camera and a luminometer, and (c) the detectability, analytical range and repro ducibility of smartphone-based QCPCR in terms of the number of copies of input target sequences in the sample prior to amplification. The limits of detection of the DNA hybridization assay based on the smartphone, digital camera and luminometer were 1.6, 2.4 and 1 pmol L-1. Smartphone-based QCPCR showed an analytical range from 137 to 9 x 10(5) copies of target DNA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are particularly promising sensors to examine biochemical processes in a complex cellular context. RNA mimics of GFP are RNA-fluorophore complexes that emit green fluorescence comparable in brightness to fluorescent proteins. The fluorophore is non-fluorescent until it binds with specific RNA. We designed and developed a dual activated fluorescent probe based on RNA mimics of GFP for the detection of an intracellular nitroreductase. Our probe only fluoresces in the presence of both the specific RNA and nitroreductase. Since we used RNA to tag cells, our probe only fluoresces when nitroreductase exists in such cells. Our detection system should benefit the study of cell biomarkers in heterogeneous cell populations. More importantly, the strategy of quenching the RNA/DFHBI complex by alkylation of the hydroxyl group in DFHBI opens new possibilities for developing various genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors based on RNA/DFHBI complexes.

AB Here, we report a novel fluorescence method for the highly selective and sensitive detection of RNase H by combining the use of a dual-pyrene-labeled DNA/RNA duplex with supramolecular inclusion-enhanced fluorescence. Initially, the probe is in the "off" state due to the rigidness of the double-stranded duplex, which separates the two pyrene units. In the presence of RNase H, the RNA strand of the DNA/RNA duplex will be hydrolyzed, and the DNA strand transforms into a hairpin structure, bringing close the two pyrene units which in turn enter the hydrophobic cavity of a gamma-cyclodextrin. As a result, the pyrene excimer emission is greatly enhanced, thereby realizing the detection of RNase H activity. Under optimal conditions, RNase H detection can be achieved in the range from 0.08 to 4 U/mL, with a detection limit of 0.02 U/mL. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitive detection of DNA is conducive to enhance the accuracy of diseases diagnosis and risk prediction. In this work, we report the use of activators generated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) as a novel on-chip amplification strategy for the fluorescence detection of DNA. More specifically, the target DNA was captured by the on-chip immobilized hairpin DNA probes. Upon hybridization, exposed 3'-N-3 of the hairpin was used to attach AGET ATRP initiators onto the silicon surface by click chemistry. Then, numerous fluorescent labeling linked to the end of the probes via the formation of long chain polymers of fluorescein o-acrylate, which in turn amplified the fluorescence signal for DNA detection. Under optimal conditions, it showed a good linear range from 100 fM to 1 mu M in DNA detection, with the limit of detection as low as 4.3 fM. Moreover, this strategy showed good detection performance in complex real serum samples, the fluorescence intensity of 0.1 nM tDNA in 1% fetal bovine serum samples was 97.6% of that in Tris-EDTA buffer. Based on its high sensitivity, reduced cost and simplicity, the proposed signal amplification strategy displays translational potential in clinical application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we report a methodology based on reversed phase LC (RP-LC) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) separations coupled to ion mobility (IM) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) for the detailed analysis of hydrolysable tannins. The application of this approach to the analysis of an industrial chestnut (Castanea sativa, wood chips) tannin extract is demonstrated. A total of 38 molecular species, including a large number or isomers, were identified in this sample based on HR-MS (E) and UV absorption spectral information as well as retention behaviour in both separation modes. In total, 128 and 90 isomeric species were resolved by RP- and HILIC-LC-IM-TOF-MS, respectively. The combination of low- and high collision energy mass spectral data with complementary chromatographic separations allowed tentative and putative identification of twenty molecular species, comprising 78 isomers, in chestnut for the first time. Ion mobility resolved six new dimeric and trimeric vescalagin conformers with unique arrival (drift) times, including new conformers of roburin A-D which were not separated using either RP-LC or HILIC. HILIC was found to be the preferred separation mode for the analysis of vescalagin derivatives, while RP-LC is preferred for the analysis of ellagitannins with a cyclic glucose core. For the complete separation of the galloyl glucose species, comprehensive HILIC x RP-LC separation would be required. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flat membrane was fabricated by electrospinning technique and modified using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles and low-energy materials, dimethyldichlorosilane (MeSiCl2)/methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3), to obtain a hydrophobic surface. The new membrane was utilized for the electromembrane extraction (EME) of model molecules including dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis [2-ethylhexyl] phthalate (DEHP). The parameters affecting proposed EME were optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD). The optimized values were 200 V of voltage, 20 min of extraction time, 1100 rpm of agitation rate, 10 mL of donor phase volume and 1 mL of acceptor phase volume. From the results, the performance of EME with the new (modified) membrane remained almost constant after ten extraction cycles while the extraction performance of unmodified EME steeply fell after six extraction cycles. The limits of detection (LODs) for DBP and DEHP were 7.40 and 0.08 ng mL(-1) , respectively. The linear dynamic range (LDR) was in the range of 100-4000 ng mL(-1) for DBP and 1-2000 ng mL(-1) for DEHP. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were below 10%, and the relative recoveries were over 86%. The overall energy consumption for the extraction of the model molecules by new EME was 13.4 kWh m(-3). The approach is time-efficient and cost-effective, as the fabricated membrane has better reusability than the previous membranes used for EME. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports for the first time the use of laminar cork as a sorptive phase in a microextraction technique, rotating-disk sorptive extraction (RDSE). Typical hormones (estrone, estradiol, estriol and ethinyl estradiol) were selected as analyte models and extracted from wastewater samples on laminar cork with statistically equivalent extraction efficiency to that provided by Oasis HLB. The cork characterization was performed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (CLSM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), allowing the identification of lignin, suberin and polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) as the main components of the cork. The best conditions for extraction were as follows: rotation velocity of the disk, 2000 rpm; extraction time, 45 min; and sample volume, 20 mL. The analytical features of the developed method show that calibration curves for all analytes have R-2 values higher than 0.99. The absolute recoveries were higher than 63%, and the precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, ranged from 2 to 16%. The LOD and LOQ ranges were 3-19 and 10-62 ng L-1, respectively. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of wastewater, and the concentrations of hormones in a wastewater treatment plant in Santiago, Chile, ranged from<LOQ to 48 ng L-1.

AB We demonstrate a recognition and feature visualization method that uses a deep convolutional neural network for Raman spectrum analysis. The visualization is achieved by calculating important regions in the spectra from weights in pooling and fully-connected layers. The method is first examined for simple Lorentzian spectra, then applied to the spectra of pharmaceutical compounds and numerically mixed amino acids. We investigate the effects of the size and number of convolution filters on the extracted regions for Raman-peak signals using the Lorentzian spectra. It is confirmed that the Raman peak contributes to the recognition by visualizing the extracted features. A near-zero weight value is obtained at the background level region, which appears to be used for baseline correction. Common component extraction is confirmed by an evaluation of numerically mixed amino acid spectra. High weight values at the common peaks and negative values at the distinctive peaks appear, even though the model is given one-hot vectors as the training labels (without a mix ratio). This proposed method is potentially suitable for applications such as the validation of trained models, ensuring the reliability of common component extraction from compound samples for spectral analysis.

AB Physical properties such as particle size distribution and compactness have significant confounding effects on the spectral signals of complex mixtures, which multivariate linear calibration methods such as partial least-squares (PLS) cannot effectively model or correct. Therefore, these effects significantly deteriorate calibration models' predictive abilities for spectral quantitative analysis of complex mixtures. Here, new scattering correction methods were proposed to estimate the additive and multiplicative parameters considering light scattering effects in each spectrum and hence mitigate the detrimental influence of additive and multiplicative effects on quantitative spectroscopic analysis of complex mixtures. Three different correction methods were proposed to estimate the addition coefficient based on two different underlying assumptions, namely, whether this coefficient is related to the wavelength. After addition coefficient elimination, the multiplicative parameter can be eliminated by a simple but very efficient spectral ratio method. Furthermore, linear models are built with key variables, and the predictive performance of these models is verified using the root-mean-square error of prediction datasets. The proposed methods were tested on one apple data set and two publicly available benchmark datasets (i.e., near-infrared spectral data of meat and powder mixture samples) and compared with some existing correction methods. The results showed that (1) additive effects of different types of samples can be eliminated by different methods and (2) these methods can appreciable improve quantitative spectroscopic analysis of complex mixture samples. This study indicates that accurate quantitative spectroscopic analysis of complex mixtures can be achieved through the combination of additive effect elimination and the spectral ratio method.

AB A label-free electrochemical aptasensor was developed for the sensitive detection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). To do this, a diblock dual-aptamer allosteric hairpin (DDAH) was designed, followed by conjugation with gold nanoparticles (DDAH&AuNP). The presence of target destroyed the stable hairpin structure, and then the catalytic cleavage of DNAzymes removed the IFN-gamma-binding molecules, triggering the allosteric switching from inactive hairpin to active streptavidin aptamer (A-DDAH&AuNP) in homogeneous system. Moreover, streptavidin-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers decorated with graphene composites (SFG) were synthesized and used as substrates to modify glassy carbon electrodes (SFG/GCE). SFG specifically bind to the A-DDAH&AuNP to realize high-efficient readout of signals. Under the optimal conditions and by using differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV), the response peak currents increases linearly with the logarithm of the IFN-gamma concentration in the range between 0.1 pg mL(-1) and 500 ng/mL. The detection limit is as low as 19 fg mL(-1). The aptasensor also has excellent electrochemical performances, which exhibits broad application prospects in biometric analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Scanning Bipolar Electrochemical Microscope (SBECM) allows precise positioning of an electrochemical micro-probe serving as bipolar electrode that can be wirelessly interrogated by coupling the electrochemical detection reaction with an electrochemiluminescent reporting process. As a result, the spatially heterogeneous concentrations of an analyte of interest can be converted in real time into a map of sample reactivity. However, this can only be achieved upon optimization of the analytical performance ensuring adequate sensitivity. Here, we present the evaluation and optimized operation of the SBECM for the detection of small changes in local O-2 concentrations. Parameters for achieving an improved sensitivity as well as possibilities for improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the optical signal readout are evaluated. The capability of the SBECM for O-2 detection is shown at controlled conditions by recording the topography of a patterned sample and monitoring O-2 evolution from a photoelectrocatalyst material.

AB A new method for the simultaneous determination of two tumour biomarkers, homovanillic (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), using flow injection analysis (FIA) with amperometric detection (AD) at a commercially available boron doped diamond electrode (BDDE) was developed. It was found that this method is suitable for the determination of HVA (in the presence of VMA) and VMA (in the presence of HVA) in optimum medium of Britton-Robinson buffer (0.04 mol L-1, pH 3.0). Calibration dependences consist of two linear parts for both biomarkers, the first one being in the concentration range from 1 to 10 mu mol L-1 and the second one from 10 to 100 mu mol L-1 (with obtained LODs 0.44 mu mol L-1 for HVA and 0.34 mu mol L-1 for VMA, respectively). To minimize any negative effects related to the passivation of the working electrode, suitable cleaning pulses (+2.4 V for 30 s) were imposed on the working electrode after each measurement. An attempt to use FIA with multiple pulse amperometric detection to determine both analytes in one run was not successful. Changing potentials in short intervals in multiple pulse detection probably results in mutual interaction of analytes and/or products of their electrochemical oxidation, thus preventing the application of this approach.

AB Sample preparation has remained a bottleneck in analysis of biological and environmental samples. Thus, microextraction techniques to reduce time, cost, labor, and environmental impacts as compared to traditional solid phase or liquid-liquid extractions are appealing. In this work, a high throughput extraction method coupled with a novel desorption technique has been developed for the analysis of eight regulated PAHs in water. The targeted analytes were extracted by thin film microextraction (TFME) using single-use sorbents. The enriched analytes on thin films were directly introduced into a gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) through solvothermal headspace desorption (ST-HD). The desorption of analytes was accelerated by adding a small volume of solvent into the headspace vial. The parameters that influence desorption, such as type and volume of solvent, oven temperature, and desorption time, were studied. As well, the key parameters (stirring rate, extraction time, and salt content) for TFME of PAHs from water were assessed and optimized. Reusability and durability of the film and background noise due to polymer decomposition were also assessed. The method was validated using standards in 3.5% aqueous NaCl. The limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.2 and 2.0 ng mL(-1), with linear ranges of 0.4-200.0 ng mL(-1) with R-2 > 0.99, and satisfactory accuracy and repeatability at three concentrations (low, mid, and high) within the linear range of the calibration curves. The calibration curves were also assessed for suitability as a matched matrix in the analysis of PAHs in a seawater sample. The technique was also applied for determination of PAHs in a produced water sample without the need for pretreatment and filtration of the sample. Although the complexity of produced water required the use of standard addition, we demonstrated that this approach is a useful tool for the analysis of complicated environmental samples.

AB In this study, a reversed-phase chromatomembrane extraction (RP-CME) method as a novel approach for automated sample pretreatment was suggested for the first time. The RP-CME was applied to automated separation of anions (formate, chloride, nitrate, phosphate and sulfate) from biodiesel samples as a proof-of-concept example. The novel design of chromatomembrane cell was developed for on-line RPCME. The RP-CME procedure assumed mass-transfer of water-soluble analytes from organic sample phase (biodiesel sample) to aqueous phase supported in a porous composite mass-transfer block. The composite mass-transfer block based on microporous hydrophobic poly (tetrafluoroethylene) and hydrophilic glass fiber was developed for the RP-CME implementation. The block provided the effective retention of aqueous phase into the cell and simultaneous penetration of organic phase. The hydrophilic membrane-based sheet was used for the on-line separation of hydrophilic emulsion (biodiesel in water) containing target analytes obtained during analytes elution by aqueous phase from the mass-transfer block. The RP-CME was successfully coupled with an ion chromatography with conductivity detection. The limits of detection, calculated from a blank test based on 3 sigma, were 5 mu g kg(-1) for sulfate, 6 mu g kg(-1) for nitrate, 3 mu g kg(-1) for chloride, 5 mu g kg(-1) for phosphate and 1 mu g kg(-1) for formate.

AB Human serum is a huge bioinformatics database of human physiological and pathological state, many proteins/peptides among which can serve as biomarkers for monitoring human's health condition, thereby being worth exploring. The simple and fast capture of biomarkers from human serum is the first key step to realize their accurate detection. In this work, we developed the aptamer functionalized magnetic metal organic framework nanoprobe, and furtherly combined with mass spectrometry technology to establish an efficient method of identifying biomarkers. Taking insulin as example of biomarker in human serum, we developed sulfhydryl human insulin aptamer functionalized magnetic metal organic framework (denoted as Mag MOF@Au@HIA) through the post-synthetic modification of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 for testing the applicability of the established method. Depending on the strong magnetic responsiveness and high specific area as well as high-loaded human insulin aptamers, the limit of detection of insulin was down to 1 ng/mL and 2 ng/mL in the standard insulin solution and human serum, respectively. Moreover, a good linear relationship (R-2 = 0.998) was obtained by using standard insulin solution with concentration range from 100 ng/mL to 5 ng/mL, based on which the capture recovery of insulin with Mag MOF@Au@HIA from human serum was demonstrated to be excellent. All of the results indicate that the aptamer-functionalized magnetic metal organic framework is a promising nanoprobe for biomarkers capture in human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aluminum is a very important analyte, and developing biosensors for aluminum is an important analytical task. In this work, we report a novel mechanism to design colorimetric sensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs were prepared by reducing HAuCl4 using catechols, and the resulting AuNPs can be directly adapted for Al3+ detection without any post-modifications, showing high sensitivity and selectivity against other metal ions. Interestingly, our mechanistic studies revealed that Al(3+)induced AuNPs aggregation was not due to the formation of interparticle crosslinks that refers to the design principle of most AuNPs-based colorimetric sensors reported before. But rather, Al3+ competitively coordinated with the capping ligands on AuNPs surface through the formation of stable Al-O bond, which dissociated these ligands from AuNPs surface. As a result, the AuNPs aggregated due to the loss of surface stabilizers. Based on this mechanism, several catechols, including pyrocatechol (PC), 3(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (DHCA), levodopa (LDA) and dopamine (DA), were used as reductant to prepare AuNPs for Al3+ sensing, and the AuNPs prepared by DA (AuNPs/DA) displayed the highest sensitivity, with detection limit of 0.81 mu M. The sensor was then tested for Al content analysis in river water and food samples, and the results supported its practical applications. Importantly, this work expands the design principles for colorimetric sensors by using AuNPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For early detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer, a novel, highly sensitive detection of microRNA-378 was developed through rolling circle amplification and DNA-templated silver nanoclusters as a lable-free fluorescent probe. DNA-templated fluorescent silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) to make target signal cascade amplification were prepared and identified through their fluorescent spectrum. MiRNA-378 trigged rolling circle amplification to obtain the complementary sequence (cDNA) to combine with two DNA/AgNCs in the middle of a sandwich structure to induce the new fluorescent signal at a new wavelength. In the presence of microRNA-378, a large amount of RCA product cDNAs were hybridized with DNA/AgNCs as the fluorescence nanocluster beacon, resulting in fluorescence enhanced "turn-on" phenomenon. This study indicated that amplified fluorescence detection of microRNA-378 is a stable, low-cost, highly specific, and ultra-low as 1.07 fM detectability. The proposed approach of signal synergetic amplification facilitating the fluorescence detection microRNA shows great potential for potentially clinically diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study reports the preparation of a novel voltammetric platform based on the modification of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) nanoparticles. The electrode material was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction method (XRD). The novel platform (Dy2O3 NPs/MWCNTs/GCE) was applied for the voltammetric determination of sunset yellow (SY) in the presence of tartrazine (TAR). SY was first adsorbed at the surface of Dy2O3 NPs/MWCNTs/GCE by keeping it into a solution of SY for 200 s. Afterwards, the proposed platform was washed with ultrapure water and transferred with the adsorbed species in a voltammetric cell containing only 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Then, the novel platform (Dy2O3 NPs/MWCNTs/GCE) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and presented improved voltammetric responses when compared to other electrodes. The novel platform produced an improved anodic peak at 0.705 V and a corresponding cathodic peak at 0.690 V for SY and an irreversible anodic peak at 0.957 V for TAR. When compared to the electrode modified with only MWCNTs, a remarkable increase in current response and a electrocatalytic activity of the proposed platform were observed for SY and TAR at a GCE modified with both MWCNTs and Dy(2)O(3)NPs. A linear relationship was obtained between the current response and the concentration of SY over range of 1.0 x 10(-9) M - 1.4 x 10(-7) M with an LOD of 3.5 x 10(-10) M using square wave voltammetry (SWV). The proposed procedure provided an accurate and a precise quantification to the analysis of food and pharmaceutical samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current work describes the development of a "nanopaper-based analytical device (NAD)", through the embedding of curcumin in transparent bacterial cellulose (BC) nanopaper, as a colorimetric assay kit for monitoring of iron and deferoxamine (DFO) as iron-chelating drug in biological fluids such as serum blood, urine and saliva. The iron sensing strategy using the developed assay kit is based on the decrease of the absorbance/color intensity of curcumin-embedded in BC nanopaper (CEBC) in the presence of Fe(III), due to the formation of Fe(III)-curcumin complex. On the other hand, releasing of Fe(III) from Fe(III)-CEBC upon addition of DFO as an iron-chelating drug, due to the high affinity of this drug to Fe(III) in competition with curcumin, which leads to recovery of the decreased absorption/color intensity of Fe(III)-CEBC, is utilized for selective colorimetric monitoring of this drug. The absorption/color changes of the fabricated assay kit as output signal can be monitored by smartphone camera or by using a spectrophotometer. The results of our developed sensor agreed well with the results from a clinical reference method for determination of Fe(III) concentration in human serum blood samples, which revealed the clinical applicability of our developed assay kit. Taken together, regarding the advantageous features of the developed sensor as an easy-to-use, non-toxic, disposable, cost-effective and portable assay kit, along with those of smartphone-based sensing, it is anticipated that this sensing bioplatform, which we name lab-on-nanopaper, will find utility for sensitive, selective and easy diagnosis of iron-related diseases (iron deficiency and iron overload) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of iron-chelating drugs in clinical analysis as well.

AB A highly sensitive fluorescence turn-off biosensor for the detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed based on graphene oxide (GO) and an aptamer-induced detachable nanoladders. In this assay, two types of ssDNA (H1 and H2) were involved in the assembly of the DNA nanoladders, in which H1 was labeled with fluorophore, and H2 was the OTA binding aptamer. Self-assembly of the DNA nanoladders with the addition of GO weakened its adsorption and the fluorescence intensity remained strong. In the presence of OTA, the aptamer was specifically recognized and an aptamer-OTA complex was formed, leading to the detached of DNA nanoladders. With the addition of GO, the released H1 was adsorbed on the GO surface, thus efficiently quenching the fluorescence signal (turning off). The detection limit of OTA in this assay was 4.59 nM. To improve the sensitivity of this strategy, we creatively developed an alternative strategy to replace the sturdy nanoladders with frail nanoladders. More precisely, the sequences of H1 had mismatched bases, which, when hybridized with H2 could be used to create long non-perfect complementary nanoladders. For the mismatched bases-based frail nanoladders, it was easier for OTA to bind its aptamer sequence, thus enabling a more thorough and faster detachment of the nanoladders, along with a greater degree of fluorescence quenching. The detection limit for OTA was estimated to be 0.1 nM. The biosensors we developed were sensitive, specific, enzyme-free, cost-effective and can be applied in red wine samples spiked with known concentration of OTA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Protein misfolding and aggregation are the common mechanisms in a variety of aggregation-dependent diseases. The compromised proteins often assemble into toxic, accumulating amyloid-like structures of various lengths and their toxicity can also be transferred both in vivo and in vitro a prion-like behavior.
   The characterization of protein interactions, degradation and conformational dynamics in biological systems still represents an analytical challenge in the prion-like protein comprehension.
   In our work, we investigated the nature of a transferable cytotoxic agent, presumably a misfolded protein, through the coupling of a multi-detector, non-destructive separation platform based on hollowfiber flow field-flow fractionation with imaging and downstream in vitro tests.
   After purification with ion exchange chromatography, the transferable cytotoxic agentwas analyzed with Atomic Force Microscopy and statistical analysis, showing that the concentration of protein dimers and low n-oligomer forms was higher in the cytotoxic sample than in the control preparation. To assess whether the presence of these species was the actual toxic and/or self-propagating factor, we employed HF5 fractionation, with UV and Multi-Angle Light Scattering detection, to define proteins molar mass distribution and abundance, and fractionate the sample into size-homogeneous fractions. These fractions were then tested individually in vitro to investigate the direct correlation with cytotoxicity. Only the later-eluted fraction, which contains high-molar mass aggregates, proved to be toxic onto cell cultures. Moreover, it was observed that the selective transfer of toxicity also occurs for one lower-mass fraction, suggesting that two different mechanisms, acute and later induced toxicity, are in place. These results strongly encourage the efficacy of this platform to enable the identification of protein toxicants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combined with H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has only been demonstrated over a small spectral range so far. The self-printing of chromatographic plates with a modified 3D slurry printer allowed the operator to influence the composition of the adsorbent slurry and thus the purity of the adsorbent layer. The combination of such self-printed, binder-free HPTLC plates with inkjet-driven sample application made possible submicromole-scaled analytical H-1 NMR spectroscopy. This was proven using pure HPTLC adsorbents. For comparison, commercial silica gel HPTLC plates were purified by pre-development with solvents for spectroscopy, whereas commercial silica gel HPTLC particles were self-printed on the glass plate after purification under solvent pressure in a recycled HPLC cartridge. Evaluating the signals from different treatments, seven background signals disappeared in the proton spectra and three were reduced to a minimum by use of pre-developed commercial HPTLC plates. In the case of the self-printed, binder-free HPTLC plates made of purified adsorbent, most of the spectral background signals were reduced to a minimum, thus these spectra showed the highest cleanness and most pure analyte proton spectra. For the first time, the full H-1 NMR spectroscopy range was made available after an HPTLC separation. This proof of principle opens the avenue for submicromole-scaled analytical H-1 NMR spectroscopy.

AB Micro pillar arrays columns (mu PAC) are recent nanoflow liquid chromatographic (LC) systems featuring highly ordered pillars containing an outer porous shell grafted with C-18 groups. This format limits backpressure and allows the use of extremely long separation channel (up to 2 m). In this study, we evaluated the use of mu PAC in combination with ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS). In IM-MS, ions are separated in gas-phase based on their size and charge. mu PAC was compared to two other nanoflow systems and a state-of-the-art ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph (UHPLC). Performances in the four dimensions of information (LC, IM, MS and intensity) were calculated to assess the multidimensional efficiency of each tested system. mu PAC proved to be superior to other nanoflow systems by producing more efficient peaks regardless of the gradient time employed which resulted in higher peak capacities (386 after 240 min gradient). In combination with IM, 3 times more peaks could be separated without loss of analysis time. Although UHPLC-ESI was superior from a chromatographic point of view, its sensitivity was rather limited compared to nanoflow LCs. On average, peaks in mu PAC were 45-times more intense. Finally, mu PAC combined to IM prove to enhance the proteome coverage by identifying two times more peptides than nanoflow LCs and ten times more than UHPLC. As a conclusion, mu PAC combined to IM seems to be a suitable platform for discovery proteomics due to its high separation capacities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water solubility is one of the most important and frequently used physical-chemical properties of chemicals. It is crucial within several industrial sectors, in research and in the regulatory sector e.g. for the risk and hazard assessment of chemicals. The most recent OECD guideline (Test No. 105) for measuring solubility is from 1995 and limited to mono-constituent, stable and non-volatile substances. This OECD guideline and the described methods are not suited for several groups of difficult-to-test substances, such as highly hydrophobic chemicals, volatile chemicals, surfactants and mixtures. The aim of this paper is to review solubility measurement methods for difficult-to-test substances on a technical, analytical and scientific level. Methods to handle highly hydrophobic chemicals and volatile chemicals, and methods to rapidly saturate water with fast degrading chemicals are reviewed. A decision tree is presented outlining the preferred choice of method for each chemical group. This review also includes measurement methods for critical micelle concentrations that set the upper concentration limit for freely dissolved surfactants. Finally, concepts and strategies to measure solubility parameters for mixtures, including multi-constituent substances and chemical substances of unknown or variable composition, are discussed.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a natural enzyme that is able to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphate esters. It participates in a great number of biological processes ranging from various metabolisms to signal transduction and cellular regulation. Since the abnormality of ALP activity in body is closely associated with many diseases, it has become an important biomarker for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Besides, it is often utilized in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Given these demands, in the last few years considerable interest has been focused on exploring new materials and methods for ALP activity detection. In this review, we first made a clear classification on the principles that could be used for ALP activity determination. After that, emerging colorimetric and fluorescent strategies designed on the basis of these principles were systematically summarized. Finally, some perspectives on ALP activity analysis were discussed, hoping to inspire future efforts in the field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fusion of spectral and spatial information has been proved to be an effective approach to improve model performance in near-infrared hyperspectral data analysis. Regardless, most of the existing spectral-spatial classification methods require fairly complex pipelines and exact selection of parameters, which mainly depend on the investigator's experience and the object under test. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a powerful tool for representing complicated data and usually works with few "handengineering", making it an appropriate candidate for developing a general and automatic approach. In this paper, a two-branch convolutional neural network (2B-CNN) was developed for spectral-spatial classification and effective wavelengths (EWs) selection. The proposed network was evaluated by three classification data sets, including herbal medicine, coffee bean and strawberry. The results showed that the 2B-CNN obtained the best classification accuracies (96.72% in average) when compared with support vector machine (92.60% in average), one dimensional CNN (92.58% in average), and grey level co-occurrence matrix based support vector machine (93.83% in average). Furthermore, the learned weights of the two-dimensional branch in 2B-CNN were adopted as the indicator of EWs and compared with the successive projections algorithm. The 2B-CNN models built with wavelengths selected by the weight indicator achieved the best accuracies (96.02% in average) among all the examined EWs models. Different from the conventional EWs selection method, the proposed algorithm works without any additional retraining and has the ability to comprehensively consider the discriminative power in spectral domain and spatial domain.

AB Benefiting from the rich redox chemistry, high electrical conductivity and synergistic effect from two metal ions, the binary metal sulphides received tremendous attention in various applications. As a result, the MoS2-RuS2 nanomaterial was synthesized through the simple one-pot hydrothermal technique. The electrocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized nanomaterial was exploited towards the electrochemical detection of antibiotic drug sulphadiazine (SDZ). The electrocatalytic oxidation of the SDZ exhibited lowest anodic peak potential and ehanced anodic peak current rather than other modified electrodes. Notably, an excellent electrochemical performance with very lowest limit of detection (LOD) of 0.004 mu M, appreciable linear range from 0.01 mu M to 598.7 mu M and high sensitivity (2.333 nA mu M-1 cm(-2)) was obtained at MoS2-RuS2 modified electrode. Moreover, well anti-interfering property, good operational stability, repeatability and reproducibility was achieved. Facinatingly, the practicability of the modified electrode demonstrated in milk and human serum samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel lanthanum ion-doped cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS:La QDs) were synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL). Based on CdS:La QDs as the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores, a distance-dependent ECL intensity enhanced or quenched system between CdS:La QDs and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was designed. Firstly, ssDNA 1 was linked to the CdS:La QDs modified glassy carbon electrode via amide bond. Then the prepared Au NP - ssDNA 2 conjugates were used to hybridize with ssDNA 1, the surface plasmon resonances (SPR) of Au NPs enhanced ECL intensity (signal on) while Au NPs and CdS:La QDs were separated at a certain distance. Secondly, In the presence of Hg2+, the oligonucleotide conformation changed from linear chain to hairpin due to the thymine-Hg2+-thymine (T-Hg2+-T) base pairs. ECL quenching (signal off) achieved lie in resonance energy transfer (RET) between the CdS:La QDs and the proximal Au NPs at a close distance. Finally, after being incubated with TB, a strong and stable TB-aptamer complex was generated, which led to the release of Au NP-ssDNA 2 conjugates. The ECL signal of the CdS:La QDs was ultimately recovered (signal on again). The "on-off-on" approach was used to detect Hg2+ and TB, sensitively and respectively. The line ranges were 1.00 x 10(-12)-1.00 x 10(-5) mol L-1 and 1.00 x 10(-16) - 1.00 x 10(-6) mol L-1 respectively. The low limits of detection (S/N = 3) were at 3.00 x 10(-13) mol L-1 and 3.00 x 10(-17) mol L-1. Moreover, the ECL sensor exhibited high selectivity and good stability, and was successfully applied to the detection of TB in real sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of some sensitive methods for MUC1 is critical for preclinical diagnosis of tumors. In this experiment, we built a triple-amplified electrochemical aptasensor to achieve sensitive detection of MUC1, which was based on exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted with strand displacement reaction and enzyme catalytic strategy. Firstly, with the help of Exo III, MUC1 and apamer could be recycled during the cycle I, the single stranded DNA-1 (S-1) was produced during the process and was introduced to the hybride reaction on the electrode. Secondly, during the cycle II, strand displacement reaction was triggered on the electrode with the adding of hairpin DNA-2 (H-2). Thirdly, after the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-DNA-enzyme conjugates hybrided with the H-2 on the electrode, the AuNPs-DNA-enzyme conjugates could act as signal probe to produce electrochemical catalytic signal. We used the fabricated triple-amplified electrochemical aptasensor that could detect MUC1 from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.04 pg mL(-1) under the optimized experimental conditions. The constructed triple-amplified electrochemical aptasensor could be applied in real samples determination. Besides, the strategy can be applied to detect other proteins for health monitoring.

AB The location of double bond in unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) plays a critical role in their physiological properties. However, structural identification and quantification of unsaturated FAs by mass spectrometry are still challenging. In this work, we reported the coupling of epoxidation reaction of the C=C in unsaturated FAs and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for accurate identification and quantification of C=C isomers of FAs. Epoxidation of the C=C in unsaturated FAs was induced by a dioxide of ketone, tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one 1,1-dioxide, as a catalyst and Oxone as an oxidant in less than 5 min with nearly 100% yield. All the C=C bonds were epoxidized to obtain a single product, simplifying the chromatographic separation of epoxidation products to enable more accurate quantification analysis. The epoxidation products were stable at room temperature and can produce highly abundant diagnostic ions indicative of C=C locations by tandem mass spectrometry using collision-induced association (CID). The application of this approach for the analysis of FAs isomers in human plasma demonstrated the potential of our method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of unsaturated FAs in complex biological samples, which is valuable in biological and medical analysis.

AB Lipidomics has gained rising attention in recent years. Several strategies for lipidomic profiling have been developed, with targeted analysis of selected lipid species, typically utilized for lipid quantification by low-resolution triple quadrupole MS/MS, and untargeted analysis by high-resolution MS instruments, focusing on hypothesis generation for prognostic, diagnostic and/or disease-relevant biomarker discovery. The latter methodologies generally yield relative quantification data with limited inter-assay comparability. In this work we aimed to combine untargeted analysis and absolute quantification to enhance data quality and to obtain independent results for optimum comparability to previous studies or database entries. For the lipidomic analysis of mouse plasma, RP-UHPLC hyphenated to a high-resolution quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer in comprehensive data-independent SWATH acquisition mode was employed. This way, quantifiable data on the MS and the MS/MS level were recorded, which increases assay specificity and quantitative performance. Due to the lack of an appropriate blank matrix for untargeted lipidomics, we herein established a sophisticated strategy for lipid class-specific calibration with stable isotope labeled standards (surrogate calibrants). LLOQs were in the range between 10 and 50 ng mL(-1) for LPC, LPE, PI, PS, PG, SM, PC, PE, DAG) or 100-700 ng mL(-1) (MAG, TAG), except for cholesterol and CE (1-20 mu g mL(-1)). Acceptable values for accuracy and precision well below +/- 15% bias were reached for the majority of surrogate calibrants. However, to achieve sufficient accuracy for target lipids, response factors to corresponding surrogate calibrants are required. An approach to estimate response factors via a standard reference material (KIST SRM 1950) was therefore conducted. Furthermore, a useful workflow for post-acquisition re-calibration, involving response factor determination and iteratively built libraries, is suggested. In comparison to single-point calibration, the presented surrogate calibrant method was shown to yield results with improved accuracy that are largely in accordance with standard addition. Quantitative results of real samples (high-fat diet vs control diet) were then compared to two previously published dietary mouse plasma studies that provided absolute lipid levels and showed similar trends.

AB Ratiometric signal transducing strategies can improve the precision of immunoassay, which possess the unique merits of spatial-resolved signal readout and self-correcting towards possible false positive results. In this work, a new ratiometric electrochemical immunosensor has been developed for reliable detection of Nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22). Bioinspired synthetic melanin nanospheres (SMNPs) were elaborately chosen for the following considerations: 1) SMNPs can supply good biocompatible biorecognition interface for antibody anchoring; 2) SMNPs can chelate a large amount of lead ions (Pb2+) and copper ions (Cu2+) to fabricate two spatial-resolved electrochemical signals with different response manners towards NMP22. SMNPs chelated with Pb2+ were used for the immobilization of captured primary anti-NMP22. And SMNPs chelated Cu2+ were employed to prepare signal labels after anchored with anti-NMP22 antibody. After sandwich-type immunoreaction, with the increasing concentration of NMP22, the stripping peak current of Pb2+ decreases while the stripping peak current of Cu2+ increases. Thus, ratiometric electrochemical signals could be provided for NMP22 detection. The immunosensor presented a linear concentration range from 0.013 U mL(-1) to 6.7 U mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 0.005 U mL(-1) towards NMP22. Meanwhile, satisfactory reproducibility, stability and selectivity of the immunosensor were demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estrogen receptors (ERs) play a major role in the signaling pathways and participate in regulating and maintaining the basic activities of life. The abnormal expression of ERs has a significant effect on tumorigenesis. Herein, we propose an electrochemical method for detecting ERs based on the formation of DNA Y-Junction with a 3'-blunt end. The DNA Y-junction was designed to have one of its arms bound to an ER. When an ER was bound to the junction, which was immobilized on the electrode surface, it protected the DNA Y-junction from Exo III-catalyzed digestion. DNA Y-Junction also contained G-quad-ruplex rich duplex, which generated electrochemical signals when hemin was added to the electrode, resulting in the quantitative detection of ERs. The detection range of the ER using this method was 0.1-200 nM with a detection limit of 0.034 nM. Since this assay can be employed to detect ERs in tumor cells, it may be useful in tumor diagnosis in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of methods that can detect telomerase with high selectivity and sensitivity is critical for early diagnosis and treatment of telomerase-related cancers. In this regard, we describe in this work the establishment of a telomerase-initiated and nicking endonuclease-assisted cascade recycling signal amplification approach for non-label and highly sensitive fluorescent detection of telomerase from cancer cells. The target telomerase triggers the elongation of one strand in a partial dsDNA duplex with a pre-designed sequence to induce the release of a ssDNA, which can initiate three cascaded recycling cycles for the generation of many G-quadruplex sequences by cleaving two hairpin signal probes with the assistance of the Nt.AlwI endonuclease. The thioflavin dye further binds these G-quadruplex sequences to exhibit substantial fluorescence enhancement for sensitive detection of telomerase at 8.93 x 10(-11) IU. Moreover, this developed method is capable of differentiating telomerase activity among different cancer cells and screening telomerase inhibitors for anticancer drugs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel multifunctional core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention due to their easy-to-modify surface properties and abundant functional groups. This study introduces a facile approach to synthesize Ag@ iron oxide (Fe3O4) @C NPs, and modify with amino-poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-carboxyl and folate (FA) on the exposed carbon surface to produce high contrast for excellent stability, good biocompatibility, cancer cell targeting, and synergistic treatment. The multi-armed PEG at the edge of Ag@Fe3O4@C NPs provides the materials an excellent capacity for doxorubicin (DOX) loading. The carbon layer could be used as a photothermal reagent due to its excellent near-infrared (NIR) absorbance capacity, and Fe3O4 was used as a reagent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In vivo combination therapy with this agent was administered in a mouse tumor model, and a remarkable synergistic antitumor effect that is superior to that obtained by monotherapy was achieved. Concerning these features together, these unique multifunctional Ag@Fe3O4@C-PEG-FA/DOX NPs could be regarded as an attractive nanoplatforms for chemo-photothermal synergistic tumor therapy with dual-modal fluorescence and MR imaging-guided targeting.

AB Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) provides enhanced separation power over its one-dimensional counterpart - gas chromatography (GC). This enhancement is achieved by the inclusion of a secondary column, the choice of which is a major determinant on the quality of the ultimate separation. When developing and optimizing a new GC x GC method, the choices of stationary phase chemistries, geometries and configurations (which phase serves in which dimension) are of fundamental importance, and must often be addressed even before the manipulation of instrumental conditions. These choices are often made using educated guesses, literature searches, or trial and error. Thermodynamic models of GC separations; however, provide a fast and easy means of acquiring information for guiding these choices. By using characteristic thermodynamic parameters (characteristic temperatures, T-char, and characteristic thermal constants, theta(char)), we demonstrate the generation of maps that can inform the choices of column chemistries, phase ratios and configurations for GC x GC separations.

AB The development of methacrylate-based monolithic columns was studied for the separation of pharmaceutical hydrophilic compounds in nano-liquid chromatography. The selected polymerisation mixture consisted of 7.5% hexyl methacrylate, 4.5% methacrylic acid and 18.0% ethylene dimethacrylate (w/w), in a binary porogenic solvent (35:35 w/w 1-propanol/1,4-butanediol). The polymer synthesised with this mixture has a good permeability, not excessive back-pressure, and reasonable retention times for polar and non-polar solutes. Monolithic columns (12 cm total capillary length, 100 mu m i.d.), prepared with this mixture, were able to produce hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, giving rise to promising separations. To evaluate the chromatographic system, alkylbenzenes (neutral and hydrophobic compounds) and sulphonamides (hydrophilic drugs) were assayed. To optimise the chromatographic mobile phase in isocratic elution and characterise the retention mechanism for a mixture of eight sulphonamides, the performance of several mathematic models was checked in the description of retention. The behaviour of the monolithic capillary column was compared, in terms of selectivity and peak shape, to that obtained with a C18 column (9 cm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mu m particle size) using a conventional HPLC equipment. The results revealed substantial differences in the interactions established for sulphonamides between the monolithic and C18 columns. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Beer is an incredibly complex beverage containing more than 3000 different compounds, including carbohydrates, proteins, ions, microbes, organic acids, and polyphenols, among others. Beer becomes even more complex during storage, for over time it may undergo chemical changes that negatively affect the flavor, aroma, and appearance. Thus, it can be expected that maintaining the quality of beer throughout its lifetime is a difficult task. Since it is such a popular drink throughout the world, being familiar with proper analytical techniques for beer evaluation is useful for researchers and brewers. These techniques include, but are not limited to, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization, capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and flame ionization detection. This review aims to summarize the various ingredients and components of beer, discuss how they affect the finished product, and present some of the analytical methods used for quality control and understanding the formation of chemicals in beer during the brewing process.

AB In this work, the effectiveness of a mathematical approach to solve the spectral interferences involved in the optical emission of two chemical species (neodymium and praseodymium) when using monochromators with low-resolution in atomic spectrometry is evaluated. Although recent technological advances have promoted spectrometers equipped with high-resolution monochromators, which have a great instrumental capability in the separation of nearby lines and consequently avoid spectral interferences, many laboratories still have old spectrometers installed with insufficient resolution to overcome such interferences. In order to evaluate a mathematical approach based on Lambert-Beer's Law, the optical emissions of neodymium and praseodymium were monitored on a low-resolution (200 pm) flame atomic emission spectrometry (F-AES). These two elements were strategically chosen as an application model because they exhibit similar physicochemical properties, joint occurrence in nature and because they are increasingly used in the manufacture of super-magnets, a material increasingly required by the high technology industry. The effectiveness of the mathematical approach was evaluated in three different ways: (i) by recovery of the analytes in synthetic mixtures containing known quantities of the species; (ii) by spike and recovery trials on a representative blend of dissolved samples and (iii) by comparing the results obtained with another analytical method: Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) with a higher spectral resolution. The results indicate the effectiveness of this simple mathematical approach, allow the "survival" of instruments equipped with low-resolution monochromators and demonstrate the applicability of this approach to spectral correction. In addition, this work contributes an analytical method for the quantification of neodymium and praseodymium in metallic alloy samples involved in the production of super-magnets, aiding in the strict quality control of these materials.

AB The ability of the selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) to capture mercury (Hg) is a subject of interest as this concept can be applied to reduce mercury poisoning cases to certain extent. In this work, SeNPs were fabricated on a paper and used as sorbent for capturing mercury vapor. The formation of the stable HgSe on the paper sorbent after the sequestration was visible to the naked eye for mercury concentration of higher than 200 mu g L-1, corresponding with the discoloration of the paper sorbent from dark orange to gray color. The gray color was more intense with increasing Hg concentrations from 200 to 300, 500, and 1000 mu g L-1. Therefore, color analysis software was used as a semi-quantitative technique for mercury analysis. The mercury captured was also analyzed with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). After confirming that SeNPs helps capture mercury, it was further applied as a chemical modifier in graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) for mercury determination. The SeNPs (410 mg L-1) allowed the use of pyrolysis temperature up to 300 degrees C with adequate sensitivity. Calibration curve was constructed from 100 to 500 mu g C-1 with good linearity (R-2 = 0.9968). With the use of SeNPs, 15 times sensitivity improvement was obtained compared to that without the use of any chemical modifier. The detection limit (N = 10 at 3 sigma) was calculated at 2 mu g L-1 for the Hg standard. The proposed modifier was used for analyzing mercury in the saliva sample. Apart from minimizing extensive sample pretreatment process, the recovery percentage of Hg from the spiked sample was found to be approximately 90% (RSD 0-2%) with the help of the SeNPs modifier. This work exhibits multi-dimensional applications of SeNPs towards mercury analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to the high information content about the biochemical composition of the sample, the implementation of Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) in the clinic is currently under investigation by many researchers. Cancer biology with the use of histopathological models is one of the most explored application areas. Most of the publications show sensitivity of the method to be above 90%, however, it is still often not enough for clinical standards. Robust denoising techniques with an optimized classification model allow to shorten the experimental acquisition times which still are a bottleneck for FT-IR translation into the clinic. The main premise of this work is to evaluate denoising impact on classification results using spectral techniques: Savitzky Golay (SG), Wavelets (WV), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF); and spatial techniques: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Median Filter. Using denoising methods, especially MNF and PCA, gave significant improvement of the classification and prediction results. Moreover, the increase in pixel level accuracy for High Definition data (1.1 mu m projected pixel size) was found to be dependent on the complexity of the histopathological class and reached even 43-44% level, while core level increase reached around 28%. Moreover, we investigated the impact of denoising methods on the spectral input to better understand the mechanism of such large improvement. The results presented here highlight the benefits and the importance of proper denoising for classification purposes of FT-IR imaging data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work a novel application of data fusion to an environmental monitoring study is proposed. This paper involves the joint analysis of zeroth-, first- and second-order data measured on a particular environmental system. The main advantage of this methodology is the possibility of analyzing the relationships of the different order data provided by several analytical techniques. This approach enables to achieve new knowledge, in a way that would be not accessible if considering the information individually.
   Environmental monitoring databases usually generate large amount of data. Multivariate statistical techniques are necessary to process all this information and obtain a correct interpretation. The Ludueria Stream located in Argentina was chosen as the study system. Samples from different sites of the basin were taken periodically. Conductivity and pH (zeroth-order data) were fused with near-infrared (NIR) spectra of suspended particulate material (first-order data) and with fluorescence emission-excitation matrices of dissolved organic matter (second-order data). Different chemometric algorithms made it possible to extract and merge all the information in a new database, enabling its later analysis as a whole.
   This methodology allowed to successfully studying the behavior of dissolved organic matter together with suspended particulate material and other specific variables, showing links between them. Their distributions along the basin and their evolutions over time were possible to obtain. Therefore, a simpler interpretation to evaluate the system status was achieved. This model allowed differentiating the variables affected by anthropic activities from those with a natural origin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a new and easy methodology to determine uric acid in relevant samples using Raman spectroelectrochemistry is presented. The spectroelectrochemistry experiment is based on the in-situ formation of a suitable substrate that enables the enhancement of the Raman signal of an analyte during the oxidation stage of a silver electrode. This phenomenon is known as electrochemical surface oxidation enhanced Raman scattering (EC-SOERS) and has proved to be useful in quantitative analysis using disposable screen printed electrodes. The successful combination of EC-SOERS with PARAFAC analysis allows the determination of uric acid in a relevant complex sample avoiding the use of standard addition method and without using a baseline correction, which simplifies the application of such methodology in routine analysis.

AB The simultaneous determination of xanthine (XA) and hypoxanthine (HXA) has been proved to be a feasible approach for the assessment of fish freshness. In this study, copper(II) nitrate and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) were used as precursors to prepare various Cu-BTC frameworks with the addition of various amounts of triethylamine at room temperature. The characterization of X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy testified that the obtained materials are Cu-BTC frameworks. However, the amount of triethylamine had significant effects on the morphology, active response area and electron transfer ability of Cu-BTC frameworks. The oxidation behavior of XA and HXA demonstrated that the prepared Cu-BTC frameworks exhibited higher sensing activity, with greatly-enhanced oxidation signals. More importantly, the amount of triethylamine obviously affected the accumulation capacity and signal enhancement ability of Cu-BTCs toward XA and HXA, as confirmed from double potential step chronocoulometry. Based on the triethylamine-tuned signal amplification strategy of Cu-BTC frameworks, a highly-sensitive and simple electrochemical sensing system was developed for the assessment of fish freshness by simultaneous detection of XA and HXA. The developed sensing method was used in practical samples, and the results were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the electrochemical behavior of four fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FAs) [Ciprofloxacin (Cip), Enrofloxacin (Enr), Marbofloxacin (Mar) and Ofloxacin (Ofl)] at a polarized interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) has been studied using ion-transfer voltammetry (ITV). The measurements were conducted in the traditional macroscopic (macro-ITIES) and a recently developed miniaturized (micro-ITIES) platform. The latter was obtained from fused silica micro-capillaries having an internal diameter of 25 mu m. We used macroITIES to obtain a number of analytical parameters such as: standard Galvani potential of ion transfer (Delta Phi(0)), diffusion coefficients (D), free Gibbs energy of ion transfer (Delta G(0)) and partition coefficients (logP(DCE)). The latter were compared with the available literature values of logP(octanol). The effect of concentration of the studied antibiotics on the electrochemical response was investigated with the microITIES platform, setting statistical parameters such as: linear dynamic ranges (LDRs - studied from 1 mu M up to 50 mu M), lower limit of detections (LODs - around 1 mu M) and sensitivity (found in the range from 2.6.10(-2) to 6.8.10(-2) nA.mu M-). MicroITIES were further used to study the effect of pH on the analytical signal and the results are plotted in a form of ion partition diagrams. Working with microITIES supported with the fused silica capillaries significantly reduced the volumes of consumed chemicals and expedite all analytical experiments. The provided results can be successfully applied in pharmacology and electroanalysis for testing and determination of the chosen fluoroquinolone antibiotics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Phosphorylation of DNA is a critical event for normal cell processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair and DNA recombination. It is important to develop accurate and convenient approach for the detection of kinase and inhibition. In this work, we have described a novel sensing strategy for T4 polynucleotide kinase. A single-stranded DNA probe is firstly immobilized on the surface of the electrode. After phosphorylated by target kinase, it could be ligated with amino group labeled DNA probe by certain hybridization. Denaturation process is then proceeded to release unligated DNA probes, which may help reduce the background signal. The remained amino groups could be used to adsorb silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as electrochemical species for the quantification of T4 polynucleotide kinase. This biosensor shows high sensitivity and selectivity. It may also be used for the screening kinase inhibitors. Therefore, it shows great potential utility in biological process investigation, drug discovery and clinical diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an efficient biocatalyst known to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, could be inactivated in the presence of insecticides, nerve agents or other drug inhibitors to thus result in disrupted neurotransmission. Improvement in the peripheral cholinergic function, as well as overall cognition and neuronal functions of an exposed system could be achieved if the mechanisms of inhibitions are deactivated in a controlled fashion and with rapid response time. Herein, we proposed to develop a simple AChE biosensor capable to realize the rapid detection of neurotoxins. Our approach uses a nanoporous gold film (NPGF) and reduced graphene oxide-tin dioxide nanoparticle (RGO-SnO2) nanocomposite to define the highly active electrode interface where the electrochemical monitoring of the interaction between AChE and its target molecule, fasciculin, could take place. Our results demonstrate that the established biosensor had the ability to monitor fasciculin concentrations at the ultra-low limit of detection of 8 pM, an inhibition rate of 8% and within only 30min of electrochemical exposure. Our study provides a convenient technology for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of neurotoxins and has the potential for large applicability to other drugs or toxins screening.

AB In this study, we developed and compared three different methods for chromium speciation in water samples using microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs). In all methods, detection was based on the complexation reaction of Cr(VI) with diphenylcarbazide on the mu PADs. Cr(III) ions were oxidized to Cr(VI) by Ce(IV) prior to colorimetric detection on the RADs. In the first method, oxidization of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the solution containing both trivalent and hexavalent chromium was performed using a batch procedure to obtain total chromium. A dual electromembrane extraction (DEME) technique for simultaneous preconcentration and extraction of chromium species and a single electromembrane extraction (SEME) for preconcentration and extraction of Cr(VI)/total chromium [quantified as Cr(VI) content after oxidation of Cr(III) ions to Cr(VI)] were used in the second and third methods, respectively. The electromembrane extraction was based on the electrokinetic migration of cationic Cr(III) and anionic Cr(VI) toward the cathode and anode, respectively, into the two different hollow fibres. Octanol-1 and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (DEHP) in octanol-1 (0.7% v/v) were the most suitable supported liquid membranes for extraction of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively. Among these methods, SEME showed the lowest limits of detection for both analytes.
   Under optimized conditions, linear calibrations were obtained for Cr(III) from 3 to 30 mu g L-1 and for Cr(VI) from 3 to 70 mu g L-1. The detection limits were 1.0 mu g L-1 and 0.7 mu g L-1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. Our developed method was applied to analyse water samples spiked with different concentrations of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level. The statistical evaluation showed that the proposed method agreed well with the validation method, i.e., inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic actuation provides a low-cost, simple method for droplet manipulation on a digital microfluidic platform. The impetus to move the droplets on a low friction surface can come from internal superparamagnetic particles or paramagnetic salts. Recently, the use of microbes for bio-actuation has been established, where the thrust produced by the microbes can be exploited to exert the force required for droplet movement. This study presents biologically-driven magnetic actuation of droplets on a superhydrophobic surface using magnetotactic bacteria (MTB). MTB-droplets were impelled along various trajectories such as rectangular and figure-of-eight-shaped paths. Droplets were reproducibly actuated with speeds up of to 30 mm s(-1). We demonstrated the ability to sequentially merge and mix multiple droplets by merging a 10 mu L MTB droplet with two 4 mu L colored droplets. The reorientation of MTB in the droplet enhanced mixing rate of the merged fluids by similar to 40% compared with the control experiment where no actuation was used. Biologically-driven magnetic actuation was compared with actuation by superparamagnetic particles and paramagnetic salts, in terms of controllability and speed. MTB droplet was moved with the same average speed as other two methods and showed higher response time as the magnet acceleration increased. Lastly, MTB were used to perform a phosphatase assay using endogenous enzyme. The relative absorbance at 405 nm, indicating the production of the yellow product, increased over time and levels off after 75 min. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Capillary electrophoresis (CE) with dual UV and conductivity detection was used for the first time to monitor the functionalization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a process catalyzed by an enzyme, myrosinase (Myr). A thiol glucosinolate (GL-SH) designed by our group was used as substrate.
   Hydrolysis of free and immobilized GL-SH was characterized using off-line and on-line CE-based enzymatic assays. The developed approaches were validated using sinigrin, a well-referenced substrate of Myr. Michaelis-Menten constant of the synthetized GL-SH was comparable to sinigrin, showing that they both have similar affinity towards Myr. It was demonstrated that transverse diffusion of laminar flow profiles was well adapted for in-capillary Mixing of nanoparticles (AuNPs) with proteins (Myr) provided that the incubation time is inferior to 20 min. Only low reaction volume (nL to few mu L) and short analysis time (<5 min) were required. The electrophoretic conditions were optimized in order to evaluate and to confirm the AuNPs stability before and after functionalization by CE/UV based on surface plasmon resonance band red-shifting. The hydrolysis of the functionalized AuNPs was subsequently evaluated using the developed CE-(CD)-D-4/UV approach. Repeatabilities of enzymatic assays, of electrophoretic analyses and of batch-to-batch functionalized AuNPs were excellent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within the frame of the dynamic pH junction preconcentration technique in capillary electrophoresis, we introduce a novel approach based on the use of the pH boundary of a system zone for the preconcentration of general, multivalent, weak analytes in a system of binary, uni-univalent, background electrolytes (BGE). For such purpose, in addition to presenting a comprehensive flowchart for the development of a method for BGE preconcentration, we showed several model cases using acidic, basic and ampholytic analytes. Furthermore, we combined the flowchart with calculations in electrophoretic software PeakMaster to determine all necessary information such as analyte mobility, system zones and the amplitude of the pH boundary of a system zone as a function of the sample matrix. For an even more detailed understanding of the process, we also investigated changes in the pH boundary through computer simulations with Simul 5, providing an in-depth characterization of all model analytes according to the steps of the flowchart and to PeakMaster calculations for experimental verification of the final BGE preconcentration.

AB This article reviews the research contributions along the past five years concerning to monolithic materials for the development of affinity-based sorbents in the field of microextraction techniques. The first part of this paper includes an introduction regarding monolithic affinity media and information of different binding agents (such as immunoglobulin-binding proteins, enzymes, lectins, antibodies, aptamers, dyes and immobilized metal ions and nanoparticles, among others) that can act as affinity ligands. Then, the preparation of monoliths and ligand immobilization strategies as well as the different available formats (syringes, pipette tips, spin columns, capillaries, disks and microfluidic devices) for their use in micro-solid phase extraction are mentioned. On the basis of the binding agents used to prepare affinity monolithic-based sorbents, the last part of manuscript includes several analytical and preparative applications of these monoliths for sample preparation covering different fields (analytical chemistry, biotechnology, proteomics, etc.). Current trends and possible future directions of these affinity-based sorbents in sample preparation are also given. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized via a facile approach at room temperature by using 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde as two building blocks for the first time. And the COFs were applied as dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) adsorbents for the extraction of six nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) from diverse water samples. The COFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and Zeta potentiometric analysis. The results indicated that the COFs possessed high specific surface area, good thermal and chemical stability. Moreover, some parameters (including adsorbent dosage, extraction time, pH, ion strength, desorption solvent, desorption time and desorption frequency) which influenced the extraction efficiencies of NACs were investigated in details. By combining COFs-based dSPE with HPLC-DAD analysis, a simple, fast and effective method was developed for the extraction and determination of six NACs. The method demonstrated good linearity in the range of 0.01-50 mu g mL(-1) (R> 0.9973) with low limits of quantification (0.1-0.25 mu g mL(-1), S/N = 10) and low limits of detection (0.03-0.09 mu g mL(-1), SIN = 3). Good precision with relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 3.56% for intra-day and 4.78% for inter-day were also obtained. Finally, COFs-based dSPE was applied to the effective extraction of six NACs from three kinds of actual water samples, and good recoveries (ranged from 84.00 to 112.29%) were observed. These results demonstrated that the COFs had promising potential to be adsorbents for dSPE of NACs in complex samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study a novel analytical procedure for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in dust samples was developed.
   The main aim of the research was the selection of the optimum conditions of the matrix solid-phase dispersion before the final determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in dust samples. In order to assess the best usefulness of this technique, a favourable ratio of sample amount to the mass of dispersing sorbent, as well as the type of this sorbent used has been tested. The type of sorbent responsible for additional purification (clean-up sorbent) of the extract during matrix solid-phase dispersion was also selected. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry will be used at the final determination step.
   Preliminary results indicate that the use of matrix solid-phase dispersion can be a promising alternative to other time-consuming and multi-stage analytical procedures. The proposed method provided satisfactory recoveries (76-119%) and limits of detection: 2.1-4.4 pg mu L-1 for tri-heptaBDE in linear range of 5-100 pg mu L-1; 480 pg mu L-1 for decaBDE in linear range of 500-2000 pg mu L-1 from only 0.05 g of a dust sample. Finally, the method was applied to study the content of selected polybrominated diphenyl ethers in real dust samples. Some polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners reached up to (16.3 +/- 3.0). 10(2) ng g(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, oxygenated carbon nitride nanosheets (OCNNSs) were first introduced to the field of analytic chemistry for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The rich hydroxyl and carboxyl contents of OCNNSs provided abundant adsorption sites. The coated stainless steel fibers, synthesized by the layerby-layer chemical bonding method, had good chemical stability (in organic solvents), long life (durability >= 150 cycles), and good reproducibility (RSDs <= 9.2%). This novel OCNNSs-coated fiber was used for SPME with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) in three types of food products (seafood, samshu, and instant noodles). Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) for the PAEs ranged from 0.1 to 10.0 pg mL(-1), and recovery was in the range of 80.0-118.1%. These novel coated SPME fibers displayed excellent separation and enrichment properties, which suggest a pretreatment application for analysis of PAEs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Single cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) allows for molecular analysis of individual cells while avoiding the inevitable drawbacks of using cell lysate prepared from populations of cells. Based on our previous design of the T-probe, a microscale sampling and ionization device for SCMS analysis, we further developed the device to perform online, and real time lysis of non-adherent live single cells for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis at ambient conditions. This redesigned T-probe includes three parts: a sampling probe with a small tip to withdraw a whole cell, a solvent-providing capillary to deliver lysis solution (i.e., acetonitrile), and a nano-ESI emitter in which rapid cell lysis and ionization occur followed by MS analysis. These three components are embedded between two polycarbonate slides and are jointed through a T-junction to form an integrated device. Colon cancer cells (HCT-116) under control and treatment (using anticancer drug irinotecan) conditions were analyzed. We detected a variety of intracellular species, and structural identification of selected ions was conducted using tandem MS (MS2). We further conducted statistical analysis (e.g., PLS-DA and t-test) to gain biological insights of cellular metabolism. Our results indicate that the influence of anticancer drugs on cellular metabolism of live non-adherent cells can be obtained using the SCMS experiments combined with statistical data analysis.

AB Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are structural isomeric phospholipids with very different properties and biological functions. Due to their isomeric nature, it has thus far been challenging to simultaneously quantify BMP and PG lipids in tissue samples by mass spectrometry. Therefore, we have developed a sensitive LC-MS/MS based approach with prior methylation derivatization that is able to handle large batches of samples. Using this high throughput platform, a simulated MS/MS database was established for confident lipid assignment. In this work, we have simultaneously identified and quantified BMP and PG lipid molecules in different body tissues of rats and mice. We report for the first time a quantitative molecular atlas of BMP and PG lipids for 14 different tissues and organs in Wistar rats, NMRI and CD1 mice. Organ- and species-specificity was analyzed and compared for both lipid molecule classes. A total of 34 BMP and 10 PG molecules were quantified, with PG concentrations being generally much higher across tissues than BMP, but BMP lipids showing a much higher molecular diversity between animal organs. The large diversity of the BMP lipids with regard to their abundance and molecular composition suggests distinct biological function(s) of the individual BMP molecules in different tissues and organs of body. Particularly high tissue levels of BMP were seen in spleen, lung, liver, kidney and small intestines, i.e. tissues that are known for their high abundance and/ or activity level of lysosomes late and endosomes. Elevated BMP levels in brain tissue of APP/PSEN transgenic compared to age matched wild-type mice were also observed using this platform. This analytical methodology presented a high throughput LC-based approach incorporating simulated MS/MS database to identify and quantify BMP lipids as well as PG molecules. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biosensors presenting high sensitivity for the detection of biomolecules are very promising for diseases diagnosis. Nowadays, there is a need for the development of biosensors with fast, trustworthy diagnosis and mostly with low cost, mainly for applications in developing countries. Label-free plasmonic biosensors are good candidates to reach out all these characteristics due to the possibility of spectral tunability, fast sensor response, real-time detection, strong enhancement of the local electric field and excellent adaptability to assemble different nanobiotechnology architectures. In this paper, two different configurations for LSPR based biosensor were developed by using solution-phase gold nanorods (S-P-AuNRs) and AuNRs-chip. The LSPR sensitivities were evaluated by monitoring shifts in the longitudinal plasmon band with changes in the refractive index of the medium surrounding the nanoparticles. AuNRs-chip presented higher sensitivity of 297 nm RIU-1 (refractive index unit) against 196 nm RIU-1 for S-P-AuNRs. Figure of merit (FOM) for AuNRs-chip and S-P-AuNRs were 3.0 and 2.2 RIU-1, respectively. This result was assigned to the coupling of the lower energy longitudinal LSPR mode of propagation for AuNRs-chip among nearby nanoparticles in the film. In addition, an improvement of at least 18% in sensitivity was obtained comparing to others AuNRs based assay with similar aspect ratio. FOM is more appropriate to compare different approaches, in this case, the proposed biosensor reached improvements of at least 114%, presenting higher values even when compared to AuNRs of higher aspect ratio. As a proof of concept, AuNRs surface was chemically modified using mercaptoundecanoic acid followed activation with ethylcarbodiimide and N-hidroxysuccinimide to allow the interaction between Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) antibody and correspondent antigen. Both configurations studied resulted in efficient plasmonic biosensors, presenting high sensitivity for changes in the refractive index and for surface binding with anti-BSA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, a dual-signal ratiometric fluorescence-based p53 gene sensing strategy was developed for the first time. Nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) were firstly bound with a single-stranded DNA (P1 DNA), which contains berberine aptamer sequence and p53 gene complementary sequence (C-p53 DNA). With the addition of berberine, berberine will bind to berberine aptamer in P1 DNA, and a dual-signal ratiometric fluorescence probe NGQDs/P1 DNA/berberine was established, which displays two fluorescence peaks at 440 nm and 537 nm corresponding to NGQDs and berberine, respectively. P1 DNA can be hydrolyzed by Exonuclease I (Exo I) when target p53 gene was absent, resulting in the release of berberine and the decrease of fluorescence intensity at 537 nm. When target p53 gene was present, C-p53 DNA sequence in P1 DNA can specifically bind to p53 gene and form double-stranded DNA, so the hydrolysis of P1 DNA by Exo I was blocked, and the fluorescence intensity at 537 nm was recovered. The fluorescence of NGQDs at 440 nm does not affected from Exo I and target p53 gene, and was employed as reference. The sensing strategy showed a good linear response to p53 gene in the range of 0.2-30.0 nM with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.06 nM, and it performed well in human serum samples.

AB Whole cell biosensors offer high potential for the detection of heavy metals in a manner that is simple, rapid and low-cost. However, previous researchers have paid little attention to the impacts of construction models on the performance of these biosensors, thereby limiting the achievement of rational design and the optimization of detection characteristics. Herein, for the first time, three basic models of lead and mercury detection circuits, namely feedback coupled, uncoupled and semi-coupled models, have been constructed and compared to explore the effects of uncoupling the topology of sensing circuits on the reporter signals. The results demonstrated that the uncoupled model had better sensitivity for both lead (50 nM) and mercury (1 nM), while the feedback coupled circuits had a wider detection range for mercury (10 nM - 7.5 mu M). Introducing the semi-coupled model into the comparison revealed that both the type and location of promoters for regulatory protein genes were key factors for sensitivity. Moreover, the detection characteristics of the uncoupled biosensors were robust, as conditions such as induction time, the concentration of microbial cells, and the concentration of antibiotics had little interference on the performance of the microbial biosensors. This study also established a novel and simple pre-treatment method for sample detection by biosensors. When the uncoupled microbial biosensor was put into practice, the concentration levels of mercury in milk and lead in sewage were determined quickly and accurately. Our study, therefore, provides a strategy for the rational design of whole cell heavy metal biosensors and has developed the potential of their application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel method of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) induced dual signal enhancement is developed for rapid detection of miRNA based on fluorescence light-up silver nanocluster (Ag NC). By the hybridization of a hairpin DNA and a single-stranded DNA, a unique probe is firstly designed. In the terminals of this probe, DNA-Ag NCs can be formed and display very weak fluorescence. In the presence of the target miRNA, the reaction of CHA can be triggered, forming two kinds of double-stranded complexes, in which the terminal DNA-Ag NCs are in close proximity to G-rich overhangs and the fluorescent signal can be dramatically enhanced. Compared with many other enzyme-based amplification strategies, this one exhibits distinct advantages of simplicity in experimental operation and a rapid detection process (within 1 h). Moreover, this assay exhibits an excellent selectivity and is successfully applied in the detection of miRNAs in complex biological media, which confirms the reliability and practicality of this protocol.

AB Conjugated polymers for bioimaging and sensing chemical/biological reagents have received much attention owing to their outstanding photophysical properties. However, most conventional synthetic strategies result in aggregates of conjugated polymers with limited solubility in most common organic and aqueous solvents. Therefore, advancement in molecular design and synthetic pathways is required to tune the optical and solubility properties of the resulting conjugated polymers. Herein, a simple, general, and effective approach for the synthesis of water-soluble polypyrrole (PPy) is reported based on the chemical polymerization in the presence of a homologue series of dicarboxylic acids with different chain lengths as multifunctional dopant molecules, possessing two carboxylic acid groups which serve as both dopants and stabilizing agents. The role of dopant chain length on the emission properties of resulting water-soluble polymers has been investigated. Among the synthesized water-soluble polymers, succinic acid-stabilized polymer (PPy-Suc) showed the highest emission wavelength (lambda(em)=453 nm), high quantum yield (12.87), very good photostability and low cytotoxicity, suggesting its applicability in bioimaging and sensing applications. As a proof of concept, the PPy-Suc polymer was successfully utilized in cellular imaging. Moreover, a novel fluorescence iodide sensor with two linear ranges of 0.012-0.200 and 0.200-8.825 mu M and a low detection limit of 9 nM was developed based on the prepared PPy-Suc polymer. The superior properties of the synthesized water-soluble polymers confirm the potential applicability of developed method as a general, facile and effective synthesis approach in preparation of water-soluble conjugated polymers with several potential applications.

AB In this paper, we report the synthesis and application of enzyme-like DNA-copper oxide/platinum nanoparticles for the separate quantification of inorganic and organomercury species in various real samples. We synthesized a series of poly(thymine) (T-60)-copper oxide/metal nanocomposites (T-60-CuxO/M NCs; M =Au, Ag or Pt) that exhibited enzyme-like activities [oxidase (OX), peroxidase (POX), and catalase (CAT)]. The enzyme-like activities are tunable due to the incorporation of various metals into the NCs. Among a series of synthesized CuxO/M NCs, T-60-copper oxide-platinum nanocomposites (T-60-CuxO/Pt NCs) exhibited the highest OX-like activity via the O-2-mediated oxidation of substrates, such as Amplex Red (AR), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), to form fluorescent or colored products. Interestingly, inorganic mercury ions (Hg2+) and organomercury species, such as methylmercury (MeHg+), ethylmercury (EtHg+), and phenylmercury (PhHg+), significantly inhibited the OX-like activity of T-60-CuxO/Pt NCs. For the selective detection of mercury species, we used ABTS in the T-60-CuxO/Pt NCs system, and the ABTS/T-60-CuxO/Pt NCs-based assay allowed for the detection of mercury ions at nanomolar concentrations based on the decrease in the catalytic activity caused by the mercury ions. To separately quantify the inorganic and organomercury species in a sample, we employed selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) as a masking agent, as they preferentially bind with inorganic mercury species. The ABTS/T-60-CuxO/Pt NCs-based assay with the masking agent of Se NPs further provided specificity for the detection of organomercury species in environmental water samples (tap water, river water, and seawater) and fish muscle samples (dogfish muscle DORM-II).

AB The viral capsid protein p24 of human immunodeficiency virus is expressed at different level during viral invasion. Detection of p24 is of great importance in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome monitoring and therapy. A ratiometric probe that is easily-synthesized was constructed based on self-assembled fluorescent Ce(III) and fluorescein. Fluorescein was used as reference. Hydrogen peroxide quenches the fluorescence of the Ce(III) easily but does not quench the fluorescence of fluorescein. The mechanism of reaction was discussed. Benefiting from the sensitive response to hydrogen peroxide, this probe was applied for p24 detection in enzyme linked immunoassay. The fluorescence ratio was in a good linear relationship with the concentration of p24, and the detection limit was 1.1 pg mL(-1). This proposed method has shown potential in virus detection with easy operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern food analysis is directed to the characterization of as many components as possible in food and food-related materials. The use of -omits technologies within a Foodomics approach requires the use of high throughput analytical techniques able to offer increased resolving power and capability to separate a high number of compounds. From this perspective, two-dimensional liquid chromatography has the potential to unravel very complex food matrices, providing with high resolving power and enhanced identification potential, particularly when coupled to mass spectrometry. This review presents an overview including the most notable two-dimensional liquid chromatography applications developed in the last ten years to study food safety, food quality and the relationship between health and food as well as for the characterization of particular groups of food components within a Foodomics perspective. Moreover, the latest developments and advances, limitations, future evolution and needs related to the use of this technique are critically discussed and commented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several analytical approaches have been developed for the determination of emerging pollutants (EPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in environmental matrices. This paper reviews the sample preparation and instrumental methods proposed in the last few years (2012-2018) to assess PPCPs in sewage sludge. Three main steps are examined: extraction, clean-up and analysis. Sample preparation is critical as target compounds are normally found at low concentrations in complex matrices. Most procedures include sewage sludge pretreatment mostly through ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) although other novel techniques such as QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) or MSPD (matrix solid-phase dispersion) have been also employed. In one report, no differences in extraction efficiency were detected among the most commonly used extraction techniques such as ultrasound, microwave and pressurized liquid. Clean-up usually involves a conventional method such as solid phase extraction (SPE). This step is needed to appreciably reduce matrix suppression, and is followed by an instrumental analysis using techniques of preference such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), mostly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). A fully automated on-line system that includes extraction, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry in one-stage is here presented as a novel way of determining PPCPs in sewage sludge. This review also discusses the advantages and limitations of the different techniques used. Miniaturizing analytical techniques and the use of novel solid and liquid phase materials are emerging as efficient options that fulfill the principles of so-called "green chemistry".

AB The latest advances in both theory and experimental procedures on third-order/four-way and fourth-order/five-way calibration methods are discussed. This report is focused on excitation-emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence) matrices generation, employing different variables as the third data mode (time retention in chromatography, pH gradient, fluorescence/phosphorescence lifetime, kinetics, or other chemical treatments). Fully capitalizing on the second-order advantage, it has been possible to develop appealing analytical applications in spite of the complexity of the data. Extraction of the significant chemical information about the system under study as well as the individual abundance of the contributing constituents after proper higher-order data decomposition has allowed to analytical researchers performing quantitative analysis of complex samples. The experimental works reported up to the present are introduced and discussed in order to illustrate concepts. Throughout this work, the analytical benefits achieved by modeling third- and fourth-order data are exposed, attempting to contribute to the ongoing debate in the chemometric community regarding the existence and the true nature of the third-order advantage.

AB Historical and archaeological textiles are among the most crucial and vulnerable records of our social and cultural history. Analysis of organic colorants found in these materials is unquestionably one of the most powerful tools to understand historical developments, cultural exchanges, and progress in science and technology. Natural anthraquinones represent the most commonly used natural colorants for textile dyeing until the late 19th century. The identification of anthraquinones in cultural heritage objects is a challenging task due to the small size of historical samples, diversity of potential dye sources, variable extraction procedures and dyeing methods, complex chemical constitution, structurally analogous chromophores, and possible presence of degradation products and contaminants. Developments in dye analysis of historical interest have originated and expanded along with the general advances in analytical science. In the last few decades, a close cooperation between science and cultural heritage disciplines contributed enormously to this field. The topic of historical dyes and their analysis in textiles, artworks, archaeological objects and cultural heritage materials has been reviewed several times in the last fifteen years. However, no review has been published to-date exclusively on the analysis of anthraquinone colorants in historical and archaeological textiles. Overall, liquid chromatography (LC)-based techniques have been the most widely used method for anthraquinone dye analysis. Owing to increasing demand of minimally invasive/non-invasive techniques, recent developments of novel techniques have resulted in the availability of many alternative/complementary methods to LC-based analysis. This review begins with a short overview of sources, chemistry and importance of natural anthraquinone dyes found in historical textiles before turning to a detailed discussion on developments involving established and emerging analytical techniques of anthraquinone dye analysis for textile cultural heritage materials. To illustrate the state-of-the-art, representative examples of analytical techniques highlighting their ad- vantages, limitations and applicability are also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We demonstrate the different types of synthesis processes (hydrothermal, microwave and simple chemical synthesis) to prepare the Fe doped molybdenum diselenides (H-FeMoSe2, M-FeMoSe2, and C-FeMoSe2) and investigate their relevant electrocatalytic activities. The Fe doped MoSe2 exhibited an enhanced charge transfer conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. Especially, the H-FeMoSe2 with vertically aligned structures facilitate the abundant exposed active edge sites. Thus, H-FeMoSe2 modified screen-printed carbon electrode (H-FeMoSe2/SPCE) exhibited the lower R-ct and better active surface area than that of M-FeMoSe2/SPCE and C-FeMoSe2/SPCE. As well as, the electrochemical sensing of mesalamine (MES) at H-FeMoSe2/SPCE is comparatively 0.46 and 1.28 fold higher than that obtained at M-FeMoSe2/SPCE and C-FeMoSe2/SPCE respectively. Thus, H-FeMoSe2/SPCE was concluded as an excellent electrocatalyst for sensing of MES and performed DPV technique. As the results, very low detection limit (0.8 nM) of MES was achieved at H-FeMoSe2/SPCE. Hence, the selected H-FeMoSe2/SPCE was successfully subjected to the real-time detection of MES by using a paramedical tablet and reported the excellent recovery range. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a facile ratiometric electrochemical aptasensor was developed towards sensitive and selective detection of vanillin, based on Ketjen black/ferrocene dual-doped zeolite-like MOFs (Fc-KB/ZIF-8) and electrodeposited gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coupling with DNA aptamer. Fc-KB/ZIF-8 composites were prepared via one-pot solvothermal reaction and drop-coated on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface to form Fc-KB/ZIF-8@GCE. AuNPs were in-situ electro-deposited on the modified GCE. 5'-SH terminated aptamer of vanillin was combined with AuNPs via Au-S coupling to form aptamer-AuNPs/Fc-KB/ZIF-8@GCE as a new sensing platform. Under optimal conditions, electrochemical (square wave voltammetry) curves of this sensing platform were measured in electrolyte solutions containing vanillin. With increase of vanillin concentration (C<INF>van</INF>), vanillin had an increased peak current intensity (I<INF>van</INF>, as response signal). Fc doped into ZIF-8 had slight changes in its peak current intensity (I<INF>Fc</INF>, as reference signal). There is a well plotting linear relationship between I<INF>van</INF>/I<INF><INF>Fc</INF> </INF>and the logarithm of C<INF>van</INF> ranging from 10 nM to 0.2 mM, with a low limit of detection of 3 nM. The aptamer-AuNPs/Fc-KB/ZIF-8@GCE was applied as a ratiometric electrochemical aptasensor of vanillin. This aptasensor had sensitive and selective electrochemical signal responses on vanillin, over potential interferents. This aptasensor enabled vanillin detection in real food samples, showing high detection performance. Experimental results testified that this aptasensor had high reliability and practicability for vanillin determination in real samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A paper-based analytical device (PAD) with an integrated composite electrode for non-enzymatic creatinine sensing was developed. The electrode was produced and optimization was efficiently accomplished using a rapid digital dispensing approach. The electrochemical sensor was fabricated using an HP D300 digital dispenser to deliver a copper oxide and ionic liquid composite onto an electrochemically reduced graphene modified screen-printed carbon electrode (CuO/IL/ERGO/SPCE) on a PAD. The modified electrode was characterized using electrochemical and microscopic techniques. Electrochemical detection of creatinine was performed on the SPCE using amperometry at a constant potential. Under optimized conditions, the paper-based sensor exhibited a linear range of 0.01-2.0 mM (R-2 = 0.99) and the limit of detection was 0.22 mu M (S/N = 3, IUPAC definition) for creatinine. The simple fabrication process, low cost, and clinically appropriate creatinine sensitivity make this device applicable for pointof-care use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyaniline silica (Silica/PANI) organic-inorganic nanocomposite was synthesized by combining electrospinning and in-situ polymerization processes. This strategy prevented the aggregation of PANI during the polymerization and led to higher synthesis's yield and more uniformity of the produced composite. The structure and morphology of the nanocomposite was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The prepared nanocomposite was then packed inside a stain-steel needle and evaluated as a needle trap device (NTD), for simultaneous headspace extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) in polluted soil samples, before GC-FID analysis, as a low-cost and robust detector. Response surface methodology (RSM) involving Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented to evaluate the effective experimental variables and subsequent introduction of a multiple function to describe the experimental conditions for the extraction of the analytes. Wide calibration plots (1-2000 ng g(-1) for BTEX and 0.2-2000 ng g(-1) for PAHs) with acceptable linearity (R-2 > 0.99) were obtained under the optimal conditions. The limits of detection were found to be 0.02-0.1 ng ( )g(-1) for BTEX and 0.001-0.01 ng g(-1) for PAHs. The calculated standard deviations were 7.3-13.2% (n = 6). The developed NTD-GC-FID method was successfully applied for the extraction and determination of PAHs and BTEX in contaminated soil samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, a rapid, efficient, simple, and inexpensive approach for solid phase microextraction on a screw (MES) was developed. MES is a miniaturized form of solid-phase extraction without any backpressure. In this system, analytes were adsorbed on the surface of micro channels of a screw that was coated by polypyrrole (PPy). Based on this procedure, the analytes are adsorbed on the solid phase and then eluted by a desorption solvent. The MES method followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MES-GC-MS) was applied for the rapid extraction and determination of six polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (as model analytes) in well water samples. Several parameters affecting the extraction procedure, including the sampling flow rate, the number of the loading/desorption cycles of the sample, and the volume of the desorption solvent, were evaluated and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the detection limits for the PAHs varied between 0.5 and 1 mu g L-1 and linear ranges varied between 2 and 600 mu g L-1. The results showed good correlation coefficients (R> 0.99) for all of the analytes in the studied calibration range. The relative recovery (RR%) of the desired MES-GC-MS method for the studied PAHs was between 83.0 and 104.0% and the interday and intraday precision (n=5 days), expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD %), were between 3.9-6.2% and 6.2-8.9%, respectively. To evaluate the matrix effect, the developed method was also applied for preconcentration and determination of the selected PAHs in real water samples, and good results were obtained.

AB Inertial microfluidics is utilized as a powerful passive method for particle and cell manipulation, which uses the hydrodynamic forces of the fluid in the channel to focus particles in specific equilibrium positions in the cross section of the channel. To achieve high performance manipulation, knowledge of focusing pattern of particles in the cross section of channel is essential. In this paper, we propose a method to address this important issue. To this end, firstly inertial microfluidics is analyzed in rectangular cross section channels. The results indicate that fluid flow velocity and channel's cross-sectional profiles have great impacts on the forces exerted on particles. Next, these results are utilized to propose a method to predict equilibrium positions in non-rectangular cross section channels through some simple calculations. This method is based on approximating the velocity profile of a non-rectangular cross section channel by utilizing portions of velocity profiles of different rectangular cross section channels. To analyze the method's performance, results obtained from the proposed method are compared with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and experimental studies of seven non-rectangular channels. It is observed that the proposed approach accurately predicts particles trajectories and their equilibrium positions in the cross section of channels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most of the on-site approaches for inferring of the post-mortem interval are still based on observative data from the direct body inspection, whereas, objective and quantitative analyses, such as potassium in the vitreous humor, are require laboratory instrumentation and skilled personnel. The present paper presents a simple and low cost analytical method suitable for use at the crime scene for inferring the time since death. The method uses a microfluidic paper-based device (RAD) for the determination of ammonium in the vitreous humor (VH) based on the selective interaction between the ammonium and the Nessler's reagent. The color change was measured in terms of "RGB distance" by using a simple and free smartphone application. The optimized device showed a limit of detection of 0.4 mmol L-1, with between days precision less than 9.3% expressed as relative standard deviation, and accuracy between days from 94.5% to 104.5%. The selectivity of the Nessler's reaction was tested towards the main vitreous humor compounds, and no significant interferences were found. This paper-based analytical device was successfully used for the determination of ammonium ion in VH samples from forensic autopsies. The results obtained with the proposed method, although for a limited number of cases (n = 25), showed a close correlation with the data obtained with an instrumental analysis based on capillary electrophoresis. Moreover, in order to make the evaluation of results as simple as possible, a direct correlation between the color intensity, expressed as RGB distance, and the post-mortem interval was studied and a significant correlation was found (R-2 > 0.78). In conclusion, the present preliminary study showes that the proposed device could be an additional tool to the traditional methods for a more accurate, although still presumptive, estimation of the time of death directly at the crime scene.

AB With growing environmental and health concerns over persistent organic compounds such as organophosphates, regulatory bodies have imposed strict regulations for their use and monitoring in water bodies. Although conventional analytical tools exist for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides, new strategies need to be developed to fulfil the ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, equipment-free and deliverable to end users) criteria of the World Health Organisation. One such strategy is to employ the ability of certain nanoparticles to mimic the enzymatic activity of natural enzymes to develop optical sensors. We show that the intrinsic peroxidase-mimic NanoZyme activity of tyrosine-capped silver nanoparticles (Ag-NanoZyme) can be exploited for highly specific and rapid detection of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphorus pesticide. The underlying working principle of the proposed aptasensor is based on the dynamic non-covalent interaction of the chlorpyrifos specific aptamer (Chl) with the NanoZyme (sensor probe) vs. the pesticide target (analyte). The incorporation of the Chl aptamer ensures high specificity leading to a colorimetric response specifically in the presence of chlorpyrifos, while the sensor remains unresponsive to other pesticides from organophosphate and non-organophosphate groups. The robustness of the sensor to work directly in environmental samples was established by evaluating its ability to detect chlorpyrifos in river water samples. The excellent recovery rates demonstrate the sensor robustness, while the simplicity, and rapid sensor response (2 min) to detect the presence of chlorpyrifos highlights the capabilities of the proposed colorimetric sensing system.

AB A series of iridium(III) dimers were synthesized and their ability to interact with diethyldithiocarbamate for CS2 sensing was evaluated. Upon the addition of CS2, diethylamine can capture CS2 to form diethyldithiocarbamate, which could chelate with the iridium(III) dimer to form a diethyldithiocarbamate iridium(III) complex, resulting in a yellow luminescence. Dimer 8 exhibited a maximum 18-fold of luminescence enhancement upon the addition of CS2. The luminescence signal of the detection system could be readily distinguished from the highly fluorescent media using time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES). The capability of the system to determine CS2 level in water samples was also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Circulating tumor cells, a type of viable cancer cell circulating from primary or metastatic tumors in the blood stream, can lead to the parallel development of primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Highly selective and sensitive detection of tumor cells has become a hot research topic and can provide a basis for early diagnosis of cancers and anticancer drug evaluation to develop the best treatment plan. Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides that can bind to target tumor cells in unique three-dimensional structures with high specificity and affinity. Aptamer-based methods or signal amplification methods using aptamers show great potential in improving the selectivity and sensitivity of electrochemical (EC) cytosensors for tumor cell detection. This review covers the remarkable developments in aptamer-based EC cytosensors for the identification of cell type, cell counting and detection of crucial proteins on the cell surface. Various EC techniques have been developed for cancer cell detection, including common voltammetry or impedance, electrochemiluminescence and photoelectrochemistry in a direct approach (aptamer-target cell), sandwich approach (capture probe-target cell-signaling probe) or other approach. The current challenges and promising opportunities in the establishment of EC aptamer cytosensors for tumor cell detection are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Information on the risk of exposure to cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (NPs) is limited. To assess risk, we must know where and how such NPs are distributed to the body after exposure, both short- and long-term. In this work, an integrated approach of quantitative LA-ICP-MS bioimaging and fractionation was employed to study the translocation and transformation of CeO2 and Ce3+ in mouse spleen and liver. The complementary information retrieved by the two techniques above on the accumulation of Ce and dissolution/aggregation were found consistent. In brief, a detailed fine scanning of a region of interest in the organ was performed after fast-screening at low spatial resolution. In the spleen, after short-term high-dose exposure, CeO2 NPs was found mainly in the marginal zone and caused an up-regulation of Zn in the white pulp. After long-term low-dose exposure, CeO2 was found in the marginal zone and white pulp. In the liver, CeO2 NPs were mainly distributed in the Kupffer cells and lobule periphery. The high spatial resolution LA maps of H&E-stained liver sections allowed imaging close to cell level; this enabled an estimation of Ce content in Kupffer cells. Furthermore, fractionation by ultrafiltration was also employed to differentiate the ionic and NP species in the organs. This fractionation showed aggregation of Ce ions in spleen, supporting the LA-ICP-MS results. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that long-term CeO2 exposure triggered an immune response to infection in the spleen and confirmed the differential deposition of Ce in the marginal zone. The integrated analyses based on ICP-MS together with histology and TEM investigation suggests that long-term low doses of CeO2 NPs may cause toxicity in the liver and impair functions of the immune system.

AB The determination accuracy of alloying elements in high alloy steel is generally poor in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) due to their matrix effect. To solve this problem, an image quantitative analysis (IQA) method was proposed and verified by determining nickel (Ni) in 17 stainless steel samples in this work. The results showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) was increased from 0.9833 of a conventional spectrum quantitative analysis (SQA) method to 0.9996 of the IQA method, and the average relative error of cross-validation (ARECV) and root mean squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV) were decreased from 56.80% and 1.0818 wt% to 15.93% and 0.9866 wt%, respectively. Besides, the determinations of chromium (Cr) and silicon (Si) demonstrated the generalization ability of the IQA. This study provides an effective approach to improving the quantitative performance of LIBS through the combination of image processing and computer vision technology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles decorated with D-galactose and galactitol (Fe3O4@SiN-galactose and Fe3O4@SiN-galactitol) were synthesized and employed as sorbent in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) procedure prior the analysis of aminoglycosides (AGs) in honey samples by LC-MS/MS. AGs are broad spectrum antibiotics, characterized by aminosugars, widespread used in therapeutic and veterinary applications. AGs can be found in the environment and food of animal origin. Fe3O4@SiN-galactose and Fe3O4@SiN-galactitol were synthesized via copper catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition and the synthesis was efficiently followed by infrared spectroscopy. They were characterized by electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and magnetization curves. The nature of the loading (acetonitrile:water, 50:50 v/v) and elution solution (formic acid 190 mM) were studied in order to optimize the MSPE. Quantitative difference between MSPE with Fe3O4@SiN-galactose and MSPE with Fe3O4@SiN-galactitol in terms of recovery was found. The final optimized method using Fe3O4@SiN-galactose and Fe3O4@SiN-galactitol was applied in the determination of AGs in honey. The MSPE performance of Fe3O4@SiN-galactitol was found to be superior to that of MSPE with Fe3O4@SiN-galactose. The limits of quantification were between 2 and 19 mu g kg(-1) for amikacin, dihydrostreptomycin, tobramicyn and gentamycin. A good correlation between predicted and nominal values of AGs in honey was found (trueness from 84% to 109%). This MSPE procedure not only requires a minimum amount of sorbent (1 mg) and sample (0.2 g), but it can also be accomplish in a rather short time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new determination method for total bromine in electronic devices was developed by using ultrasound assisted extraction, copper-catalyzed reductive debromination and ion chromatography (UAE-RD-IC). It was found that all the added brominated flame retardants (polybrominateddiphenyl ethers, polybrominated biphenyls, tetrabromobisphenol A, and hexabromocyclododecane) could be completely debrominated by using copper-based catalysts and reducing agent N2H4 center dot H2O. The complete debromination of brominated flame retardants released all of their bromine in the form of bromide ions, which could be determined by ion chromatography. After the extraction parameters were optimized by achieving the maximum IC signal in the certified reference material GBW(E) 082725, the UAE-RD-IC method was established for the determination of total bromine in solid samples. By analyzing the certified reference material, the Br content was obtained as 695.3 +/- 16.0 mg kg(-1), being well consistent with its standard value (694.54 +/- 30.63 mg kg(-1)). The relative standard deviation (RSD) of five parallel determinations was 1.7%, indicating the good repeatability of the developed method. The proposed method was further applied to analyze the samples of cables and computer mouse shells. For all these practical samples, the Br contents obtained by the UAE-RD-IC method were in good agreement with that obtained by the standard oxygen bomb combustion-IC method. It was noted that the new method has a detection limit of Br of about 20 mg kg(-1), being much lower than that (75 mg kg(-1)) of the traditional oxygen bomb combustion-IC method for total bromine detection. Therefore, the proposed method was qualified as a practical method to measure total bromine content in actual electronic devices with good analytical performances of accuracy, precision and sensitivity.

AB An on-line lab-on-valve system for renewable micro-solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection was developed for the determination of hesperidin and diosmin in natural and commercial citrus samples. The method is based on the automatic loading of 8 mL of sample into the C-18 resin, followed by matrix clean-up and elution of the analytes with 0.27 mL of acetonitrile. Next, 0.02 mL of the extract were injected into the chromatographic system. Separation was performed by using a Symmetry (R) C-18 column (250 x 3.0 mm x 5.0 mu m) with a mobile phase consisting in a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and acidic water (pH = 2.5) in gradient mode at 0.58 mL min (-1). The detection wavelength was chosen as 285 nm. Limits of detection, quantification and relative standard deviations were lower than 0.1 mu g mL(-1), 0.3 mu g mL(-1) and 4.1%, respectively.

AB This work reports the first use of cis-1,4-polyisoprene obtained from rubber latex (RL) waste as the hydrophobic reagent for the fabrication of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD), providing a user-friendly means for magnesium detection. The mu PAD was fabricated using a screen printing technique and the barcode-like paper sensor was then used for the detection of Mg(II) ions in RL and water samples. Using different types of paper media (paper towel, Whatman No.1 and Whatman No.4), the results indicate that the key factors in optimizing the quality of the fabricated mu PAD include the viscosity of cis-1,4-polyisoprene solution which could be adjusted using different solvents and heating temperatures, the mesh screen size, the pore size of the paper substrates, and the dimension of the sample zone. The fabricated mu PAD, which showed high chemical resistance, durability and design flexibility, was tested for the detection of Mg(II) ions using the reaction based on complexometric titration with EDTA where Eriochrome Black T was used as an indicator. An Android application "UBU OMg Sensor" was also developed to provide a simple, fast, and accurate means for end-users to interpret sensor results generated by our developed mu PAD.

AB 3D printing technology is increasingly used in flow analysis, to develop low cost and tailor-made devices. The possibility of grafting specific molecules onto 3D printed parts offers new perspectives for the development of flow systems. In this study, a MPFS system including a dicarboxylate 1,5-diphenyl-3-thiocarbazone grafted 3D-printed device has been developed for mercury determination. For this purpose, the surface of 3D-printed cuboids was first modified with amine functional groups and then grafted with dicarboxylate 1,5-diphenyl-3-thiocarbazone. This new grafted device resulted in selective mercury preconcentration with extraction and elution yields higher than 90% even at high sampling flow rates. The detection can then be carried out in two ways: a direct detection of mercury extracted onto 3D-printed grafted cuboids by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after amalgam on gold or a detection of mercury in solution after elution with L-cysteine by spectrophotometry or cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry.

AB Phospholipid fatty acids play the crucial role in biophysical properties and the function of cellular membranes. In the present study, an accurate and sensitive method was developed to quantify phospholipid fatty acids in biological samples by using chemical isotope labeling coupled with atmospheric pressure gas chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (APGC/Q-TOF MS). APGC, a soft ionization source, was operated under proton-transfer condition by introducing methanol into the ionization source as a modifier, which provided high quantifiable molecular ion peaks to substantially enhance the sensitivity. Fatty acid standards were methylated with methanol-d(4) to yield FAMEs-d(3) that were used as one-to-one internal standards to ensure accurate quantification. Thirty fatty acids in phospholipids were accurately quantified in wide linear range with limit of quantification ranging from 84.6 to 113.2 pg/mL. The newly developed method was successfully applied to quantify phospholipid fatty acids in brain and liver tissues from both fat-1 and WT mice. This method might be expanded to quantify free fatty acids or other conjugated fatty acids in biological samples or other matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Storage and quantitative analysis of small volumes of biofluids are challenging, especially when low concentrations of analytes are to be detected in the presence of complex matrices. In this study, we describe an integrated thread-based approach for stabilizing small blood volumes in the dry-state at room temperature, while also offering direct analysis capabilities via thread spray mass spectrometry. The analytical merits of this novel microsampling platform was demonstrated via the direct analysis of diazepam and cocaine in dried blood samples stored for 42 days. In-situ in-capillary blood processing from hydrophobic threads enabled limits of detection as low as parts-per-quadrillion to be reached. We validated this ultra-sensitivity by analyzing small tissue-like residues collected after pushing a thread through the sample once. The implications of this sample collection, storage, and analysis platform can be extensive with direct applications in forensics and clinical studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sphingoid bases (SBs) are one of important components of cell membranes, playing important roles in cellular biology. Meanwhile, SBs are associated with various metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, simultaneous quantitation of multiple SBs in biological samples could provide crucial information for uncovering underlying mechanisms of SBs related functions and diseases. However, existing methods are difficult to achieve simultaneous quantitation for multiple SBs due to the lack of isotope internal standards (ISs) of corresponding SBs. In the current study, we developed a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of 26 SBs in biological samples by stable isotope labeling coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SIL-UHPLCMS/MS) analysis. In this respect, a pair of isotope labeling reagents, 3-(N, N-dimethylamino)propyl isothiocyanate (DMPI) and d(4)-3-(N, N-dimethylamino)propyl isothiocyanate (d(4) -DMPI), were synthesized and utilized to label SBs in biological samples and SB standards, respectively. The d(4)-DMPI labeled SB standards were used as ISs to calibrate quantitation deviation in MS analysis from the biological matrix. Using the developed method, we successfully quantitated 19 SBs in cells, 20 SBs in mice feces and 18 SBs in human serum samples. Three C17-SBs used as ISs in many reported works were even found in all prepared samples. In summary, the developed SIL-UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was demonstrated to be a promising method for the simultaneous determination of multiple SBs, which could facilitate the investigation of cellular function of SBs and pathogenesis of related diseases.

AB A novel six-membered rhodamine-based fluorescent probe (6G-ClO) was developed from 2-formyl rhodamine (6G-CHO) and used for hypochlorite detection in water and HUVEC cells. Different from planar penta cycle of rhodamine spirolactam, there was a twist six-membered spirocyclic hydrazone in 6G-ClO optimized by Gaussian software at DET/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The high selectivity, high sensitivity and fast response of 6G-ClO towards ClO- would be attributed to the twist six-membered spirocycle. Test-strip prepared with 6G-ClO was successfully used to semi-quantitatively indicate the concentration of ClO- in water. 6G-ClO can also quantitatively detect the concentration of ClO- in tap water and swimming pool water. The detection limit of 6G-ClO was as low as 12 nM. The co-localization staining of HUVEC cells further verified that 6G-ClO could specifically accumulate in lysosomes and capture exogenous/endogenous ClO- in living lysosomes. 6G-ClO would be a practical probe for real-time monitoring of ClO- in the biological and real water samples.

AB Considering the high incidence level and mortality rate of ovarian cancer, particularly among the European female population, the carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) was selected as the protein target for this study for the development of a MIP-based biosensor.
   This work presents the development of molecular imprinting polymers (MIPs) on gold electrode surface for CA-125 biomarker recognition. The preparation of the CA-125 imprinting was obtained by electropolymerization of pyrrole (Py) monomer in a gold electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in order to obtain highly selective materials with great molecular recognition capability. The quantification of CA-125 biomarker was made through the comparison of two methods: electrochemical (square wave voltammetry -SWV) and optical transduction (surface plasmon resonance -SPR). SWV has been widely used in biological molecules analysis since it is a fast and sensitive technique. In turn, SPR is a non-destructive optical technique that provides high-quality analytical data of CA-125 biomarker interactions with MIP.
   Several analytical parameters, such as sensitivity, linear response interval, and detection limit were determined to proceed to the performance evaluation of the electrochemical and optical transduction used in the development of the CA-125 biosensor.
   The biosensor based in the electrochemical transduction was the one that presented the best analytical parameters, yielding a good selectivity and a detection limit (LOD) of 0.01 U/mL, providing a linear concentration range between 0.01 and 500 U/mL. This electrochemical biosensor was selected for the study and it was successfully applied in the CA-125 analysis in artificial serum samples with recovery rates ranging from 91 to 105% with an average relative error of 5.8%.

AB Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are expected to serve as a blood-based biomarker in the diagnosis of cancers at an early stage, providing an opportunity to increase the survival of cancer patients. Current techniques for CTC detection were designed for some particular types of cancer with confirmed primary tumor origin. In this work, a platform for the detection of two cancer types and the identification of the primary tumor origin of CTCs was established to meet the requirement of cancer diagnosis and clinical application. A combined strategy based on in vivo capture method using antibody cocktail and multicolor fluorescence imaging using aptamer was designed to achieve the high-efficiency capture of CTCs and the accurate location of the primary tumor. An antibody cocktail of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was applied to capture breast cancer CTCs and hepatocellular CTCs in vivo. The capture efficiency of hepatocellular CTCs was significantly increased from 3.17% to 26.67% and the capture efficiency of breast cancer CTCs slightly increased from 27.00% to 29.84% compared with EpCAM-based capture of CTCs. Meanwhile, the primary tumor origins of breast cancer CTCs and hepatocellular CTCs were simultaneously distinguished by specific aptamer-based fluorescence probes without any signal crosstalk. The results of in vivo experiments using the dual tumor-bearing mouse model confirmed the feasibility of this method to capture CTCs and identify primary tumor origins. This simple and efficient approach has potential for future applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxygen and free radical scavenger in the organism. Level of GSH in vivo is associated with many diseases and specific recognition for GSH is very important. Here, a pyrene chalcone derivative 11-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(1-pyrenyl)-2-propen-1-one as specific probe for GSH was developed. The probe can give rise to rapid blue fluorescence enhancement for GSH based on Michael addition reaction in pure PBS solution with high sensitivity, fast response rate and high specificity. The compound also can be applied for GSH detection in HeLa cell. Simultaneously, the compound exhibits blue fluorescence emission enhancement in methanol-water (1:1, v/v) solution with fluorescence quantum yield being 0.45 due to the competition of water molecules for hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl and carbonyl and the formation of structurally regular rodlike crystals, which allows regulating fluorescence emission by different solvent condition.

AB Development of simultaneous bacteria detection and eradication with simple, rapid, and reusable material is important in addressing bacterial contamination issues. In this study, we utilized the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from bacteria to design fluorescence ON/OFF system for bacteria detection, also using metal oxide nanoparticle for obtaining antibacterial activity and recyclability. The fluorescent-based biosensor with antibacterial activity was prepared by intercalating ALP-sensitive polymer dot (PD) containing beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) onto montmorillonite (MMT) as loading matrix via ionic exchange reaction, followed by immobilization of magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) and NIR-responsive cesium tungsten oxide (CsWO3). The PD-beta CD-MMT/Fe3O4-CsWO3 nanocomposite exhibited strong fluorescence intensity, which was quenched in the presence of bacterial ALP (0-1000 U/L) due to hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) into p-nitrophenol (NP) in the hydrophobic site of beta-CD. Furthermore, the nanocomposite could detect both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus in the range of 10(1)-10(7) CFU/mL (LOD 5.09 and 4.62 CFU/mL, respectively), and showed high antibacterial activity against bacteria by generating photothermal heat under 5 min NIR irradiation, causing damage to bacterial cells. This material also demonstrated recyclability via magnetic field exposure due to the presence of Fe3O4. In addition, the fluorescence can be recovered following pH shock and re-conjugation of beta-CD molecules. After 4 cycles, nanocomposite still showed stable photothermal effects and fluorescence-based bacteria detection. Thus, this reusable material offers promising approach for simultaneous bacteria detection and killing, which is simple, rapid, and effective. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Functional laser scribing carbon paper (LSCP) decorated with highly uniform Ni nanoparticles were constructed through a facile electroless plating. The nanocomposites were characterized by high resolution scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results showed high electron transferring kinetics of this sensor, which can be ascribed to their excellent properties such as rich pore channels, excellent structural durability, and large surface area. These properties facilitated mass transfer and electron conductions. Notably, a systematical response surface methodology simulating-modelingpredicting-optimizing design was employed to simulate, model and optimize processing parameters to gain the optimal conductivity of 8.52 x 10(6) S m(-1). The obtained sensor owned high electrochemical activity and wide linear responses (0.80 mu M-2.50 mM and 4.50 mM-15.20 mM), low detection limit of 20 nM (S/N = 3) to the glucose detection. The glucose determination in human serum and perspiration samples are also successful. Therefore, LSCP/NN provides an excellent sensing platform towards flexible biosensors in monitoring physical conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report herein a novel multiple electrochemical aptasensor based on covalent-organic framework (COF) for sensitive and simultaneous detection of miRNA 155 and miRNA 122, by using shell-encoded gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as signal labels (AgNCs@AuNPs and Cu2O@AuNPs, respectively, NCs = nanoclusters). A new COF nanowire was synthesized via condensation polymerization of 1,3,6,8-tetra(4-carboxylphenyl)pyrene and melamine (represented by TBAPy-MA-COF-COOH) for multiple aptasensor fabrication. The nanowire was then used as a platform for anchoring single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which was hybridized with the complementary aptamer (cApt) probes of miRNA 155 and miRNA 122. AgNCs@AuNPs and Cu2O@AuNPs modified with cApts show separated differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peaks at 0.08 and -0.1 V, respectively. The signal labels immobilized with cApts were released from the hybridized DNA complex and bound to their corresponding targets when contacting miRNAs. This phenomenon results in the substantial decline of the DPV peak current density of the signal labels. The developed TBAPy-MA-COF-COOH-based aptasensor has superior performance for sensing miRNA 155 and miRNA 122 simultaneously, with ultrasensitive low detection limits of 6.7 and 1.5 fM (S/N = 3), respectively, a wide linear range of 0.01-1000 pM, and high selectivity and applicability for serum samples. The proposed TBAPy-MA-based aptasensor demonstrates potential for simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers by replacing other ssDNA and aptamer strands. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Exosomes are one class of extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm diameter) that are secreted by cells. These small vesicles hold a great deal of promise in disease diagnostics, as they display the same protein biomarkers as their originating cell. On a cellular level, exosomes are attributed to playing a key role in intercellular communication, and may eventually be exploited for targeted drug delivery. In order for exosomes to become useful in disease diagnostics, and as burgeoning drug delivery platforms, they must be isolated efficiently and effectively without compromising their structure. Plasma from peripheral blood is an excellent source of exosomes, as it is easily collected and the process does not normally cause undue discomfort to the patient. Unfortunately, blood plasma content is complex, containing abundant amounts of soluble proteins and aggregates, making exosomes extremely difficult to isolate in high purity from plasma. Most current exosome isolation methods have practical challenges including being too time-consuming and labor intensive, destructive to the exosomes, or too costly for use in clinical settings. To this end, this study examines the use of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers in a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) protocol to isolate exosomes from a human plasma sample. Initial results demonstrate the ability to isolate exosomes with comparable yields and size distributions and on a much faster time scale when compared to traditional isolation methods, while also alleviating concomitant proteins and other impurities. As a demonstration of the potential quantitative utility of the approach, a linear response (particles injected on-column vs peak area) using a commercial exosome standard was established using a standard UV absorbance detector. Based on the calibration function, the concentration of the original human plasma sample was determined and subsequently confirmed by NTA measurement. The potential for scalable separations covering sub-milliliter spin-down solid phase extraction tips to the preparative scale is anticipated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyethermethylsiloxanes (PEMSs) are silicone based polymers formed by attaching one or more ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) chains to a siloxane chain. As the siloxane chain is lengthened, the polarity of the PEMSs are reduced. Little research has been conducted on the use of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze PEMS oligomers with more than 4 siloxane groups because of their low polarity and poor solubility in water and acetonitrile (ACN). In this study, we developed a high chromatographic resolution method for PEMS and polyether oligomers using the water-ACN-isopropanol (IPA) tertiary solvents gradient. PEMSs oligomers containing one EO pendant chain and 3-13 silicone groups were analyzed. More than 102 PEMS oligomers and 21 polyether oligomers were separated within 45 min and identified by accurate molecular masses. During this gradient elution process, different chromatographic modes were used: both precipitation-redissolution and adsorption mode for PEMSs, adsorption mode for EO chains in poly-ethers, and exclusion mode for EO chains in PEMSs. This efficient separation method for PEMSs would broaden the characterization of silicone surfactants. Also, it is beneficial to establish the relationship between surfactant structure, synthetic route and performance optimization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern bioanalysis, which involves the quantitative and qualitative determination of small-molecule endogenous and exogenous substances in biological samples, is a powerful and useful tool that can generate valuable information related to many areas connected with human health and quality of life. Although LC-MS and GC-MS are widely viewed as the gold standards for many bioanalytical tasks, the scientific community has not abandoned its search for newer, more efficient, and more inexpensive methods of performing extraction as a sample preparation step before final analysis. Recent research showing the immense potential of 3D printing compelled our group to explore how this technology could be applied to techniques used in analytical chemistry. In particular, 3D printing offers three promising advantages: availability, low cost of materials and equipment, and the ability to fabricate objects of nearly any shape to suit the needs of a given application. Previously, we demonstrated that a commercial 3D material (LAY-FOMM) can function as a chemically active object that enables the reversible sorption of the antidiabetic drug, glimepiride, and endogenous steroids. In this report, we use a 3D printer to fabricate sorbents with a scabbard-like shape for use with a 96-blade system, which, along with the use of a 96-well plate, allows multiple extractions to be performed simultaneously. In order to assess the relative benefits of this 3D printed approach, we compare the performance of the proposed LAY-FOMM-based sorbent to that of the widely used C18 sorbent. Although the LAY-FOMM sorbent showed lower extraction recovery rates than the C18 sorbent, all of the other validation parameters suggest that it is suitable for use in high-throughput analysis of steroids in human plasma.

AB The development of chemometrics aims to provide an effective analysis approach for data generated by advanced analytical instruments. The success of existing analytical approaches in spectral analysis still relies on preprocessing and feature selection techniques to remove signal artifacts based on prior experiences. Data-driven deep learning analysis has been developed and successfully applied in many domains in the last few years. How to integrate deep learning with spectral analysis received increased attention for chemometrics. Approximately 20 recently published studies demonstrate that deep neural networks can learn critical patterns from raw spectra, which significantly reduces the demand for feature engineering. The composition of multiple processing layers improves the fitting and feature extraction capability and makes them applicable to various analytical tasks. This advance offers a new solution for chemometrics toward resolving challenges related to spectral data with rapidly increased sample numbers from various sources. We further provide a practical guide to the development of a deep convolutional neural network-based analytical workflow. The design of the network structure, tuning the hyperparameters in the training process, and repeatability of results is mainly discussed. Future studies are needed on interpretability and repeatability of the deep learning approach in spectral analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and precise marine CO2 system measurements are important for marine carbon cycle research and investigations of ocean acidification. Seawater pH is important because it can be used to characterize a wide range of chemical and biogeochemical processes. Saturation states of calcium carbonate minerals, which are directly proportional to carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]), influence biogenic calcification and rates of carbonate dissolution. Spectrophotometric pH and carbonate ion measurements can both benefit greatly from the high sensitivity, stability, consistency and processing speed made possible through automation. Spectrophotometric methods are well-suited for shipboard, underway and in situ deployments under harsh conditions. Spectrophotometric pH measurements typically have a reproducibility of 0.0004-0.001 for shipboard and laboratory measurements and 0.0014-0.004 for in situ measurements. Shipboard spectrophotometric measurements of [CO32-] are becoming common on research expeditions. This review highlights the development of methods and instrumentation for spectrophotometric pH and [CO32-] measurements, and discusses the pros and cons of current technology. A comprehensive summary of the analytical merits of different flow analysis instruments is given. Aspects of measurement protocols that bear on the quality of pH and [CO32-] measurements, such as indicator purification, sample pretreatment, etc., are also described. Based on three decades of experience with seawater analysis, this review includes method recommendations and perspectives directly applicable or potentially applicable to pH and [CO32-] analysis of seawater.

AB Non-covalent molecular interactions are crucial for the formation of supramolecular systems whose applications in the transport and release of drugs, the development of nanoreactors or the design of molecular sensors, among others, make them very hot topic of investigation. The use of mass spectrometry (MS) and soft ionization methods as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) has allowed the characterization of supramolecular systems. This comprises the characterization of non-covalent complexes formed by synthetic molecules and biomolecules and the study of these host-guest systems with different molecular interactions and thermodynamic aspects. Mass spectrometry is capable of answering many questions regarding analytical characterization of these systems including composition, stoichiometry, and structural aspects as e.g., connectivities and building blocks in the supramolecular complex. These soft ionization techniques together with MS have become the technique of choice for characterizing molecular interactions allowing the design of new molecules capable of self-assembly in supramolecular systems. In this review, the synthetic macromolecules cucurbiturils, calixarenes, crown ethers, catenanes, rotaxanes and cyclodextrins are reviewed due to the wide range of non-covalent interactions that they are able to form in their supramolecular assemblies. Both the non-covalent interactions and the supramolecular structures of these synthetic molecules have been studied by mass spectrometry to characterize their structures, thus showing the power of the technique as a tool for supramolecular analysis.

AB Mercury ions can significantly affect the organism and environment even at a very low concentration. Thus, great efforts have been devoted to developing high sensitive electrochemical sensors, especially the one that not only detect the mercury ions but also effective sensitive to thymine-Hg2+-thymine in aqueous solution. Metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) possess hollow nature and are easy for grafting functional groups, however, there is still no attempts for working as electrochemical sensors in detecting mercury ions. Herein, we report a novel type sensor of Zr(IV)-based MOFs with specifically attached thioether side groups allowing mercury ions to be easily adsorbed and detected. The Zr(IV)-involved MOFs show strong binding to mercury ions compared with the bare MOFs, as confirmed by both experiment measurements and theoretical calculations. The as-prepared senor is sensitive ranging from 0.01 nM to 3 mu M with detection limitation of 7.3 fM, which is better than most of T-Hg2+-T- and enzyme-based sensors reported so far. The high sensitivity could be due to the straightforward adsorption pathway and the biomolecule exclusion nature of the Zr(IV)-involved MOFs sensor. We anticipate that our findings could pave the way for MOFs-based sensor exploration towards its commercial applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, a signal-on electrochemical aptasensor for highly sensitive detection of thrombin (TB) was constructed based on the DNAzyme-driven DNA walker strategy. We developed a new dual functional hairpin DNA (HP) containing a substrate sequence of the Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme (in the loop region) and the G-quadruplex forming segment (in the stem region). The DNA walker (TBA(2)-DWs), containing a TB aptamer and an enzymatic sequence, was introduced onto gold electrode (GE) by aptamers-target specific recognition, and thus initiated the enzymatic sequences to hybridize with the substrate sequence. Then, the DNA walker could repeatedly bind and cleave HP in the assistance of Mg2+, unlocking many active G-quadruplex forming sequences. Finally, hemin can further bind the G-quadruplex to form G-quadruplex/hemin complexes and generate enhanced current output. The aptasensor for TB assay showed a linear detection range from 1 pM to 60000 pM with a lower detection limit of 0.58 pM. And more, the proposed detection strategy was enzyme-free and label-free.

AB In this work, we found that polyethyleneimine (PEI), a widely applied organic high-molecular polymer, could act as a new co-reactant to obviously improve the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of S2O82--O-2 system. And owing to its abundant amine groups in the polymeric structure, PEI was further used to covalently crosslink with massive L-cysteine (L-Cys), an effective co-reactant of S2O82--O-2 ECL system, to obtain a new co-reactive high-molecular polymer (PEI-L-Cys) with higher co-reaction efficiency. As loading platform, hierarchically branched Au/Pd dendrimers (Au/Pd DRs G(2)) were prepared to immoblize the obtained PEI-L-Cys, detection antibody, and bolocking reagent glucose oxidase (GOD). With the existence of target carcinoembryonicantigen (CEA), an ECL immunosensor was constructed through the sandwiched immunoreaction between the capture antibody on the electrode and the bioconjugate based on Au/Pd DRs G(2). Besides the high enhancement of PEI-L-Cys, the ECL signal was also greatly increased by the dual catalysis to generate O-2 in situ around the electrode induced by the synergistic effect of GOD and Au/Pd DRs G(2) in presence with D-glucose. Especially, due to the special hierarchically branched bimetallic structure, the Au/Pd DRs G(2) had more excellent catalytic effect to H2O2 decomposition in this process. As a result, the proposed ECL immunosensor realized the ultrasensitive detection of CEA, which could provide meaningful reference to the prevention and treatment of related disease.

AB A new calibration method based on the use of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and in-fiber internal standardization, combined with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed for quantifying Se volatile organic species released by plants exposed to chitosan-modified selenium nanoparticles (Cs-SeNPs). The effect of several parameters affecting extraction and separation of the selected organic species of selenium (dimethylselenium (DMSe), diethylselenium (DESe) and dimethyldiselenium (DMDSe)) and deuterated dimethyl sulphide (d(6)-DMS) employed as internal standard were studied and optimized using an experimental design. The developed methodology was applied for quantifying the volatile selenium compounds produced over time by the plant species Raphanus sativus and Brassica juncea grown in hydroponic solution containing 5 mg Se L-1 in the form Cs-SeNPs. The procedure employed consisted in two steps. Volatile selenium species released from the plants were first extracted in the SPME fiber located at the headspace of a box with a fixed volume. Subsequently, the internal standard placed in a vial subjected to the same conditions as plants was extracted on the same fiber than the one previously used for extracting selenium compounds. Finally the extracted compounds were separated and analyzed by GC/MS. Results evidenced Cs-SeNPs biotransformation into DMSe and DMDSe by both plants species during growing stage, in amounts of the order of ng. Additionally, the resulting data were submitted to multifactorial ANOVA to evaluate the influence of plant type and time of exposure to Cs-SeNPs on the production of volatile selenium compounds.

AB The novel ionic liquids skeleton typed magnetic core-shell molecularly imprinted polymers (Fe3O4-COOH@IL-MIP) were firstly constructed with 1-vinyl-3-aminoformylmethyl imidazolium chloride ionic liquid ([VAFMIM]Cl-IL) modified magnetic particles as the substrate materials, [VAFMIM]Cl-IL as functional monomer, 1,6-hexanediyl-3,3'-bis-1-vinylimidazolium dichloride ionic liquid as cross-linker and Lysozyme (Lys) as template protein via surface-imprinting technique. The structure of Fe3O4-COOH@ILMIP were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, thermo-gravimetric analysis, fourier transform infrared spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. The adsorption mechanism was discussed from the perspective of amino acid residues of Lys. The maximum adsorption capacity of MIPs was 166.36 mg g(-1) and imprinting factor was 2.67. The competitive adsorption experiments demonstrated the favorable recognition ability of MIPs toward Lys. Reusability studies indicated MIPs can be reused ten times without obvious loss of rebinding ability. The Lys conformation maintained intact after elution and the elution rate was as high as 74%. The adsorption experiment of egg white manifested that MIPs can effectively separate Lys in practical samples. Only ILs and Fe3O4 were utilized to fabricate MIPs, this strategy realized the goal of energy and cost saving while achieving simple synthesis of imprinted materials, and is expected to provide a new feasible idea to exploit synthetic methods for protein-MIPs.

AB Metabolomics analysis of biofluids is a feasible tool for disease characterization and monitoring due to its minimally invasive nature. To reduce unwanted variation in biobanks and clinical studies, it is important to determine the effect of external factors on metabolic profiles of biofluids. In this study we examined the effect of sample collection and sample processing procedures on NMR measured serum lipoproteins and small-molecule metabolites in serum and urine, using a cohort of men diagnosed with either prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. We determined day-to-day reliability of metabolites by systematic sample collection at two different days, in both fasting and non-fasting conditions. Study participants received prostate massage the first day to assess the differences between urine with and without prostate secretions. Further, metabolic differences between first-void and mid-stream urine samples, and the effect of centrifugation of urine samples before storage were assessed. Our results show that day-to-day reliability is highly variable between metabolites in both serum and urine, while lipoprotein subfractions possess high reliability. Further, fasting status clearly influenced the metabolite concentrations, demonstrating the importance of keeping this condition constant within a study cohort. Day-to-day reliabilities were however comparable in fasting and non-fasting samples. Urine sampling procedures such as sampling of first-void or mid-stream urine, and centrifugation or not before sample storage, were shown to only have minimal effect on the overall metabolic profile, and is thus unlikely to constitute a confounder in clinical studies utilizing NMR derived metabolomics.

AB Both DNA cytosine methylation (5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, m(5)dC) and RNA cytosine methylation (5-methylcytidine, m(5)rC) are important epigenetic marks that play regulatory roles in diverse biological processes. m(5)dC and m(5)rC can be further oxidized by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins to form 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (hm(5)dC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm(5)rC), respectively. 2'-O-methyl-5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm(5)rCm) was recently also identified as a second oxidative metabolite of m(5)rC in RNA. Previous studies showed that the dysregulation of cytidine modifications in both DNA and RNA are closely related to a variety of human diseases. These cytidine modifications are generally excreted from cell into urine. If these cytidine modifications exhibit specific features related to certain diseases, determination of the cytidine modifications in urine could be utilized as non-invasive diagnostic of diseases. Here, we established a solid-phase extraction in combination with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for simultaneous detection of these cytidine modifications in human urine samples. The developed method enabled the distinct detection of these cytidine modifications. We reported, for the first time, the presence of hm(5)rCm in human urine. Furthermore, we found that compared to the healthy controls, the contents of hm(5)dC, hm(5)rC, and hm(5)rCm showed significant increases in urine samples of cancer patients, including lymphoma patients, gastric cancer patients, and esophageal cancer patients.

AB Accurate, simple and economical methods for quantifying N-glycans are continuously required for discovering disease biomarkers and quality control of biopharmaceuticals. Quantitative N-glycomics based on MS using exogenous isotopic labeling internal standards is promising as it is simple and accurate. However, it is largely hampered by the lack of available glycan internal standard libraries with good coverage of the natural glycan structural heterogeneity as well as broad dynamic mass and ion abundance range. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel method, providing 'Bionic Glycome' as internal standards for glycan quantitation by MALDI-MS. Bionic Glycome was produced using N-glycome from pooled samples to be analyzed as substrate by one step of glycan reducing and isotope labeling (Glycan-RAIL). Each bionic glycan has 3 Da mass increment over its corresponding glycan analyte based on hemiacetals/alditols and H/D mass difference. In addition, Bionic Glycome has the same glycome composition and similar glycome profile in abundance with N-glycome to be analyzed from biological sample. Through the investigation of single glycan standard and complex glycans released from model glycoprotein and serum, the results demonstrate that the method has good quantitative accuracy and high reproducibility. Lastly, this method was successfully used for discovery of lung cancer specific glycan markers by comparing the serum glycans from each sample in lung cancer group (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 16), indicating its potential in clinical applications.

AB Mass spectrometry-based approaches enable us to capture changes in the metabolome in biological systems with high sensitivity and resolution. But global MS-based profiling of the bile acids (BAs) submetabolome is still a challenging task. Particularly for unconjugated BAs, the collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragment ions showed low ion intensities which were insufficient for analysis. This study is aimed at the development of an anion attachment MS-based approach for pseudotargeted profiling of the BAs submetabolome. We demonstrated that anion attachment MS with the combination use of ammonia fluoride (NH4F) and formate could provide stable anionic adduct ([M + HCOO](-)) with good MS responses for unconjugated BAs. A mechanistic study revealed that the underlying rationale is due to the NH4F-induced approximate matching of attractions between BAs and anion for the 24-carboxyl hydrogen. This 24-carboxyl hydrogen regioselectivity is useful to screen for potential unconjugated BAs from the biological matrix. The stability and regioselectivity of anion attachment allowed the establishment of SRM transitions for unconjugated BAs for the first time. To profile conjugated BAs that come from the conjugation of glycine or taurine at 24-carboxyl hydrogen, specific precursor/fragment ion transitions were used for the detection. Finally, SRM-based UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the pseudotargeted profiling of the BAs submetabolome with good linearity (r(2) > 0.995) and high sensitivity (0.20-1.37 ng mL(-1) for LLOQ). With this method, a total of 83 BAs, covering 45 unconjugated BAs and 38 conjugated BAs, were successfully determined in different biosamples from experimental colitis mice. The BAs metabolism homeostasis was disrupted by colitis, characterized by the decreased BAs levels in serum and excessive BAs accumuation in the gall bladder and colon. Overall, the present anion attachment MS-based approach is sufficiently sensitive and robust to comprehensively measure various BAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the absence of adequate reference material, a problem often encountered in natural product chemistry, we investigated the use of surrogate standards in two-dimensional qNMR for the quantification of anthraquinones in the bark of alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus). Using the integrals of cross signals in the HSQC spectrum obtained from commercial standards rutin and duroquinone and adapting the delays for the (1)JCH coupling, we quantified the total amount of anthraquinones and anthraquinone glucosides, as well as the content of the value-determining glucofrangulins and frangulins. Thereby, duroquinone was used as an external standard to establish the calibration curve for the methylated anthraquinone scaffold, whereas calibration curves for the glycosides were obtained using the anomeric proton signals of the rutinose disaccharide. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, specificity, linearity and limit of quantitation and shows clear advantages over the method of the European Pharmacopeia, especially in terms of specificity and meaningfulness of the results. Apart from being a useful alternative in the quality control of alder buckthorn, the presented approach demonstrates, moreover, the versatility of sophisticated 2D measurements in quantitative NMR.

AB Lot release and stability testing of biologics are essential parts of the quality control strategy for ensuring therapeutic material dosed to patients is safe and efficacious, and consistent with previous clinical and toxicological experience. Characterization of protein aggregation is of particular significance, as aggregates may lose the intrinsic pharmaceutical properties as well as engage with the immune system instigating undesirable downstream immunogenicity. While important, real-time identification and quantification of subvisible particles in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug products remains inaccessible with existing techniques due to limitations in measurement time, sensitivity or experimental conditions. Here, owing to its exquisite molecular specificity, non-perturbative nature and lack of sample preparation requirements, we propose label-free Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with multivariate analysis as a solution to this unmet need. By leveraging subtle, but consistent, differences in vibrational modes of the biologics, we have developed a support vector machine-based regression model that provides fast, accurate prediction for a wide range of protein aggregations. Moreover, in blinded experiments, the model shows the ability to precisely differentiate between aggregation levels in mAb like product samples pre- and post-isothermal incubation, where an increase in aggregate levels was experimentally determined. In addition to offering fresh insights into mAb like product-specific aggregation mechanisms that can improve engineering of new protein therapeutics, our results highlight the potential of Raman spectroscopy as an in-line analytical tool for monitoring protein particle formation.

AB Infectious outbreaks caused by foodborne pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 are still imposing a heavy burden for global food safety, causing acute illnesses and significant industrial impact worldwide. Despite the growth of biosensors as a research field, continuous innovation on detection strategies, novel materials and enhanced limits of detection, most of the platforms developed at the laboratory scale never will get to meet the market.
   The use of aptamers as capture biomolecules has been proposed as a promising alternative to overcome the harsh environmental conditions of industrial manufacturing processes, and to enhance the performance under real, complex, conditions. In this work, we present the feasibility of using aptameric DNA sequences, covalently conjugated to 4-aminothiophenol-gold nanoparticle complexes for the sensitive and highly specific detection of E. coli O157:H7 via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis. Low concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 were detected and quantified within 20 min in both pure culture (similar to 10(-1) CFU mL(-1)) and ground beef samples (similar to 10(2) CFU mL(-1)). The SERS intensity response showed a strong negative linear correlation (r(2) = 0.995) with increasing concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 (ranging from 10(2) to 10(6) CFU mL(-1)). High specificity was achieved at genus (L. monocytogenes, S. aureus S. typhimurium) species (E. coli B1201) and serotype (E. coli O55:H7) level, demonstrating with 95% of confidence that the interferent microorganisms tested generated a Raman signal response not significantly different from the background (p = 0.786).
   This work evaluates the incorporation of aptameric DNA sequences as bio capture molecules exclusively. The successful performance presented using non-modified citrate reduced GNPs, is promising for potential low-cost, high-throughput applications. The findings might be applied simultaneously to the detection of a wide variety of foodborne pathogens in a multiplexed fashion employing unique Raman probes and strain-specific aptamer sequences.

AB Underestimation of egg allergen from processed foods prompted the evaluation of critical Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) parameters: (1) extraction of egg proteins from a processed matrix; (2) use of anti-heat processed egg antibodies (Abs) on detectability of modified proteins, and (3) utilization of incurred material as standards. The relative affinity of two combinations of raw (R), boiled (B) and fried (F) Abs to unprocessed/processed egg proteins with or without matrix was determined from antibody (Ab) binding curves. In ELISAs using RBF-Abs and BF-Abs, denaturing buffer, and incurred standards, the Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) were 0.47 and 0.25; and 1.58 and 0.85, respectively, and the linear range was 0-24 mu g g(-1) egg protein. The recoveries of egg protein from cookies, cereal bar, and muffin (incurred levels 4.8-48 mu g g(-1)) with the developed ELISAs were in an acceptable range (50-130%). These ELISAs consistently detected more declared/undeclared egg proteins in market samples compared to assays using PBS for extraction. Overall, better assay performance was observed using BF-Abs. An ELISA combining anti-processed egg Abs, denaturing buffer, and incurred standards promises improved quantitation of egg proteins in processed foods. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Spermine contamination ranks as one of the food safety issues, it will cause some adverse reactions if the intake of spermine is excessive in human body. So it is of great significance to establish fast and efficient analysis method to detect spermine in foods. In this study, the spermine aptamers with high affinity and specificity were obtained by the capture systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (Capture-SELEX) technique. Forty-one aptamer sequences were obtained by cloning and sequencing, and were divided into eight families based on homology and secondary structure analysis. The affinity and specificity of candidate aptamers was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence assay. The aptamers named APJ-6 was picked out as the optimal aptamer that recognizes spermine specifically with the Kd value of 9.648 +/- 0.896 nM. In order to verify the practicability of the selected aptamers, the sensitive aptamer-based fluorescene assay was designed. Under optimized conditions, this aptasensor exhibited a low detection limit of 0.052 nM, as well as a linear within the range of 0.1-20 nM. Besides, it has been further applied for the determination of spermine in pork samples and the recoveries ranged from 86.45% to 98.15%, showing its great potential for sensitive analysis in food safety control.

AB Precise description of temperature at the microscale level is essential in many biological applications. In this study, we prepared a DNA-based thermometer that reports low and high temperatures by providing two distinct optical signals. The system is a molecular beacon that carries a loop and a stem, whose conformation is subject to change from a hairpin to a random coil when the temperature changes from low to high. A fluorophore, Cy5, and a quencher, BHQ3, are terminally labeled at the stem ends. Moreover, perylene is included in the middle of the 3'-end stem. The signaling state of Cy5 relies on the relative distance to BHQ3. However, the perylene emission is regulated by its microenvironment (i.e., the oligonucleotide or duplex state). With a temperature variation, the designed thermometer undergoes a change in conformation that leads to two signal patterns with Cy5/off and perylene/on at low temperature and Cy5/on and perylene/off at high temperature. The reversibility and biocompatibility of the thermometer design were examined for potential applications in biological systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hypochlorite (ClO-), one of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is closely related with many physiological and pathological processes. Especially as one of cellular reactive oxygen species in mitochondria, ClO- can induce mitochondrial permeability, which leads to apoptosis. Thus, developing an effective method which is able to sense ClO- in mitochondria is important. Although fluorescent probe has become a powerful tool for imaging ClO- in mitochondria, most of them suffered from phototoxicity to biosamples, autofluorescence, and photobleaching phenomenon due to their short-wavelength excitations and emissions. Based on advantages of two-photon fluorescent probe and far-red to NIR fluorescent probe, a mitochondria-targetable two-photon fluorescent probe with a turn-on signal in far-red to NIR region, Mito-TP-ClO-, was developed for ClO- in this paper. Mito-TP-ClO(- )is consisted of a triphenylphosphonium cations as a mitochondria-targetable unit and a structure of dibenzoylhydrazine as a response unit to ClO-. Mito-TP-ClO(- )exhibited a high sensitivity and a high selectivity to ClO-, with a linear range from 6.0 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-5) M and a detection limit of 2.5 x 10(-8) M. Due to its large two-photon cross section (267 GM) and far-red to NIR emission, Mito-TP-ClO(- )exhibits excellent performances including low autofluorescence, photostable fluorescence signal, and deep tissue penetration (230 mu M). Moreover, Mito-TP-CIO was successfully used to detect endogenous ClO- in bacteria-infected cells and inflammatory mouse model, which confirmed that Mito-TP-ClO(- )is a powerful tool to monitor ClO(- )in mitochondria and study on effects of hypochlorite on mitochondria.

AB Isothermal DNA amplification only using a Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification typically entails multiple target sites for primer design and is thereby not suited for the amplification of short gene sequences, for example, the sequences with size below 200 nucleotides (nt). Here we present SLIMP, a novel single enzyme-based isothermal amplification of short gene sequence mediated by both stem-loop and linear primers. In SLIMP, a pair of stem-loop primers and a pair of linear primers are specifically designed to recognize only two target sites. Linear primers in SLIMP are similar as conventional PCR primers, but stem-loop primers are the modified linear primers through attaching a stem-loop structure at their 5'-ends. Attributed to this unique primer design, three basic reaction modes including linear-priming, single stem-loop-priming, and double stemloop-priming amplifications co-mediate the SLIMP process under the function of Bst DNA polymerase. As a proof-of-concept assay, a synthetic 80 nt sequence from hepatitis B virus S gene was used as the template to develop SLIMP. On performance, SLIMP detection possesses high sensitivity and specificity, good selectivity, and the potential for analysing real sample. Therefore, SLIMP is expected as a novel alternative to amplify short gene sequences using a single enzyme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study develops analytical approaches using comprehensive heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography (H/C MDGC) to experimentally investigate effects of concentration and temperature on peak shapes and on kinetic analysis of E/Z isomerisation of oximes which undergo various extents of interconversion on D-1 and D-2 separation columns. Different stationary phase combinations were investigated. An SLB-1L76 D-1 column results in good separation of the isomers but with negligible interconversion (D-1(sep)). Precise targeted heart-cuts (H/C; 3-15 s windows) and cryogenic trapping of selected sections eluting from this D-1 column allows well controlled E/Z isomer ratios to be delivered to a D-2 poly(-ethyleneglycol) (PEG) phase column. This phase catalyses oxime interconversion, with separation; this is termed D-2(inter). This column set describes a D-1(sep) X D-2(inter) arrangement. The interconversion forward rate constant (k(1)(UE), calculated by using DCXplorer) was found to be independent of the %E isomer (i.e. first order kinetics); k(1)(UE) increased at higher temperature (increased Gibbs activation energies, Delta G(app)). In addition, a long D-1 SLB-IL111 column gave oxime separation with interconversion (D-1(inter)). Comprehensive multiple H/C of the zone performed on the D-2 PEG (D-2(inter)) at 40, 60 and 80 degrees C resulted in a 2D presentation (D-1(inter) X D-2(inter)) with a unique rectangular display of interconversion from each H/C pulse with varied isomer concentration ratios. Data for K-1(UE) from 1DGC analysis suggests underestimation of k(1)(UE)on D-1(inter) SLB-IL111 from the 2D result. The k(1)(UE) value on D-2(inter) PEG column is more reliably evaluated by summation of all the D-2(inter) profiles rather than that obtained from the average value for the individual H/C pulses.

AB A survey of existing stationary phases classified by the United States Pharmacopeia reveals that 120 groups of chromatographic supports mostly utilize silica-silane chemistry, polymeric materials along with some niche metal oxides. In this work, the synthesis and characterization of transition-metal free geopolymers as a new class of stationary phases for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and normal phase separations is reported. The geopolymers were synthesized by reaction of synthetic aluminosilicate with potassium silicate (fumed silica dissolved in KOH) in a water-in-oil emulsion. For comparative purposes of peak shapes, a geopolymer from natural metakaolin was also synthesized. The geopolymers were examined by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, laser diffraction, and N-2-adsorption isotherms. This two-step approach gives spherical microparticles with surface area and pore size comparable to silica phases (150 m(2)/g and 120 angstrom respectively). Both synthetic aluminosilicates based and natural metakaolin based geopolymers occupy a unique "spot" in the HILIC selectivity chart when compared to 35 HILIC phases. An additional promising feature of geopolymers is high pH and temperature stability which are used to tune selectivity for small polar analytes. High pH separations are shown with carboxylic acids. Geopolymers also show mixed mode behavior in retention with ion-exchange properties in purely aqueous mobile phases. The separation of derivatized sugars is demonstrated and compared with porous graphitic carbon (Hypercarb (TM)) as another pH-stable stationary phase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of classic in vitro bioassays with high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) is a promising technique to directly link chemical analysis of contaminants to their potential adverse biological effects. With respect to endocrine disruption, much work is focused on estrogenicity. While a direct combination of HPTLC and the yeast estrogen screen is already developed, it is well accepted that further endocrine effects are relevant for monitoring environmental wellbeing. Here we show that non-estrogenic specific biological endpoints, (partly) related to the endocrine system, can also be addressed by combining respective yeast reporter gene assays with HPTLC to support effect-directed analysis (EDA). These are: androgenicity (YAS), thyroidogenicity (YTS), dioxin-like effects (YDS), effects on the vitamin D (YVS) and the retinoic acid receptor (YRaS). A proof of principle is demonstrated within this study by the characterization of dose-dependent responses to different model compounds for the respective receptors with and without chromatographic development of the HPTLC-plate. Limits of quantification (LOQ) for several model compounds were determined, e.g. 37 pg for testosterone (p-YAS), 0.476 ng for beta-naphthoflavone (p-YDS) and 1.02 ng for calcipotriol hydrate (p-YVS) with chromatographic development. The LOQ for p-YTS and p-YRaS were 10.16 pg for 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (p-YTS) and 0.41 pg for tamibarotene (p-YRaS), without chromatographic separation. Furthermore, we challenged the developed methodology using environmental samples, demonstrating an elimination efficiency of androgenic activity from municipal wastewater by a wastewater treatment plant between 99.4 and 100%. We anticipate our methodology to substantially broaden the spectrum of specific endpoints combined with HPTLC for an efficient and robust screening of environmental samples to guide a subsequent in-depth EDA.

AB This work investigated the application of partial least-squares regression of complex numbers on multivariate data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The use of complex numbers-PLS was evaluated in the individual determination of two well-known redox probes: ferrocyanide and hydroquinone. The predictive ability of complex numbers-PLS was evaluated for EIS spectra obtained at different applied potentials and perturbation amplitudes, and was also compared to that obtained with PLS applied to EIS data presented as real numbers - only the real or imaginary part of the complex impedance, or the absolute impedance or the phase angle. It is shown that complex numbers-PLS is more efficient (better prediction models) when more complex electrochemical systems (hydroquinone) are probed. Excellent predictions were obtained for the determination of hydroquinone and catechol in the direct analysis of spiked tap water samples with EIS and complex numbers-PLS.

AB This tutorial discusses how to integrate different microextraction procedures into millifluidic platforms and the applicability of such systems for the determination of acidic and basic drugs. Sample preparation techniques have been downscaled into a millifluidic format and the replacement of conventional analytical systems by miniaturized alternatives has increased during recent years due to the small volume consumption of toxic solvents and sample required, shorter extraction times, simple-handling and low cost, among others. This review comprehensively summarizes the development of liquid-liquid extraction into a millifluidic device in a three-phase configuration, with focus on (a) historical development, (b) extraction mechanisms and performance, (c) operation modes and automatization, (d) operational parameters, (e) applications, and (f) future directions and perspectives.

AB The promising pipeline of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) demands robust bioanalytical methods with swift development times for pharmacokinetic studies. Over the past decades ligand binding assays were the methods of choice for absolute quantification. However, the production of the required anti-idiotypic antibodies and ligands limits high-throughput method development for sensitive, accurate, and reproducible quantification of therapeutic mAbs. In recent years, high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) systems have enabled absolute quantification of therapeutic mAbs with short method development times. These systems have additional benefits, such as a large linear dynamic range, a high specificity and the option of multiplexing. Here, we briefly discuss the current strategies for the quantification of therapeutic mAbs in biological matrices using LC-MS analysis based on top-down and middle-down quantitative proteomics. Then, we present the widely used bottom-up method in a six-step workflow, which can be used as guidance for quantitative LC-MS/MS method development of mAbs. Finally, strengths and weaknesses of the bottom-up method, which currently provides the most benefits, are discussed in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been recognized as a significant tool for quantitative analysis of elements with its unique advantages, especially in combination with multivariate calibration methods. However, LIBS spectra typically include large amounts of high-dimensional data that affect the predictive accuracy of multivariate calibration based on LIBS. Feature selection, as an important preprocessing step in data mining, can improve the performance of the multivariate calibration model by eliminating the redundant and irrelevant features. In this study, a hybrid feature selection method based on V-WSP-PSO was proposed to improve the accuracy of LIBS analysis. The proposed method combines the advantages of V-WSP based filter method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based wrapper method. The uncorrelated and redundant features were first eliminated by V-WSP method to form a simplified input subset, and then the retained features were further refined by PSO method to find a small set of features with high predictive accuracy. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed method, LIBS experiments were performed using 28 coal samples, and a nonlinear multivariate calibration method based on kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) was selected to implement the proposed hybrid feature selection method for calorific value determination of coal. Comparing the proposed method with several other feature selection methods shows that the V-WSP-PSO method is best in terms of number of selected features and predictive accuracy. Finally, 114 features were selected from full spectrum (27620 features) by V-WSP-PSO method and the best root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and determination coefficient of cross validation (R-CV(2)) were 0.4013 MJ/kg and 0.9908, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and determination coefficient of prediction (R-P(2)) were 0.3534 MJ/kg and 0.9894. The overall results demonstrate that the V-WSP-PSO method is more efficient to reduce the redundant features, calculation time and improve the model performance, and it is a good alternative for feature selection in multivariate calibration.

AB Feature selection can greatly enhance the performance of a learning algorithm when dealing with a high dimensional data set. The filter method and the wrapper method are the two most commonly approaches. However, these approaches have limitations. The filter method uses independent evaluation to evaluate and select features, which is computationally efficient but less accurate than the wrapper method. The wrapper method uses a predetermined classifier to compute the evaluation, which can afford high accuracy for particular classifiers, but is computationally expensive. In this study, we introduce a new feature selection method that we refer to as the large margin hybrid algorithm for feature selection (LMFS). In this method, we first utilize a new distance-based evaluation function, in which ideally samples from the same class are close together, whereas samples from other classes are far apart, and a weighted bootstrapping search strategy to find a set of candidate feature subsets. Then, we use a specific classifier and cross-validation to select the final feature subset from the candidate feature subsets. Six vibrational spectroscopic data sets and three different classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors, partial least squares discriminant analysis and least squares support vector machine were used to validate the performance of the LMFS method. The results revealed that LMFS can effectively overcome the over-fitting between the optimal feature subset and a given classifier. Compared with the filter and wrapper methods, the features selected by the LMFS method have better classification performance and model interpretation. Furthermore, LMFS can effectively overcomes the impact of classifier complexity on computational time, and distance-based classifiers were found to be more suitable for selecting the final subset in LMFS.

AB Due to its capability for high-throughput screening H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used for metabolite research. The key problem in H-1 NMR spectroscopy of multicomponent mixtures is overlapping of component signals and that is increasing with the number of components, their complexity and structural similarity. It makes metabolic profiling, that is carried out through matching acquired spectra with metabolites from the library, a hard problem. Here, we propose a method for nonlinear blind separation of highly correlated components spectra from a single H-1 NMR mixture spectra. The method transforms a single nonlinear mixture into multiple high-dimensional reproducible kernel Hilbert Spaces (mRKHSs). Therein, highly correlated components are separated by sparseness constrained nonnegative matrix factorization in each induced RKHS. Afterwards, metabolites are identified through comparison of separated components with the library comprised of 160 pure components. Thereby, a significant number of them are expected to be related with diabetes type 2. Conceptually similar methodology for nonlinear blind separation of correlated components from two or more mixtures is presented in the Supplementary material. Single-mixture blind source separation is exemplified on: (i) annotation of five components spectra separated from one H-1 NMR model mixture spectra; (ii) annotation of fifty five metabolites separated from one H-1 NMR mixture spectra of urine of subjects with and without diabetes type 2. Arguably, it is for the first time a method for blind separation of a large number of components from a single nonlinear mixture has been proposed. Moreover, the proposed method pinpoints urinary creatine, glutamic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid as the most prominent metabolites in samples from subjects with diabetes type 2, when compared to healthy controls.

AB The application of nanopores for DNA sequencing faces some challenges. The main challenge is controlling the electrophoretic translocation velocity of DNA and one remedy is covering the inner wall of the nanopore with a polyelectrolyte layer (PEL). In this study, a more realistic analytical model is presented for DNA translocation in PEL-grafted nanopores that improves the available models by considering different values for permittivity and viscosity inside and outside the PEL, taking the wall charge effects into account, and relaxing the assumption of a linear hydrodynamic drag profile inside the PEL. It is shown that ignoring the ion partitioning, arisen due to the PEL-electrolyte permittivity difference, can lead to the overestimation of the electrophoretic velocity of DNA, whereas the opposite is true when the increase in the liquid viscosity within the PEL is not accounted for. Accordingly, polyelectrolyte monomers of lower permittivities may be utilized to reduce the DNA velocity, thereby increasing the resolution of DNA sequencing. This goal may also be achieved through correctly adjusting the wall charge and the charge density of the PEL fixed ions. The details regarding the control of the DNA translocation velocity are all discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains the top fatal infection continuing to threat public health, and the present detection method for MTB is facing great challenges with the global TB burden. In response to this issue, a novel electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed for detecting the IS6110 fragment within MTB. For the first time, the nanohybrid of gold nanoparticles decorated fullerene nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet (Au-nano-C-60/NGS) directly served as a new signal tag to generate signal response without additional redox molecules and subsequently labeled with signal probes (SPs) to form tracer label to achieve signal amplification. Additionally, a biotin-avidin system was introduced to immobilize abundant capture probes (CPs), further improving the sensitivity of the proposed biosensor. After a typical sandwich hybridization, the proposed electrochemical DNA biosensor was incubated with tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), which was used as a booster to induce the intrinsic redox activity of the tracer label, resulting in a discriminating current response. The proposed electrochemical DNA biosensor shows a broad linear range for MTB determination from 10 fM to 10 nM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 3 fM. In addition, this proposed biosensor not only distinguishes mismatched DNA sequence, but also differentiates MTB from other pathogenic agents. More importantly, it has been preliminarily applied in clinical detection and displayed excellent ability to identify the PCR products of clinical samples. There is great potential for this developed method to be used in early diagnosis and monitor of TB. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We developed a new electrochemical sensor based on TiO2 and polypyrrole (PPy) molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanocomposites for the high selective detection of p-nonylphenol in food samples, which is considered as a kind of endocrine disrupting chemical and harmful to human health. With p-nonylphenol as template molecules, the molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized by the chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole and deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles to form partially encapsulated PPy@TiO2 nanocomposites, denoted as NP-PPy@TiO2 MIP. p-Nonylphenol was bound in the PPy matrix through hydrogen bond and pi-pi interaction between p-nonylphenol and PPy skeleton. NPPPy@TiO2 MIP nanocomposites were modified onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and p-nonylphenol molecules were excluded from PPy layers by potentiostatic sweeping at the potential of 1.3 V. The as-prepared electrochemical sensor obtained a large amount of micro cavities in PPy layer which could specially recognize and combine target molecules p-nonylphenol. After special adsorption of p-nonylphenol from samples, p-nonylphenol embedded in the PPy layer exhibited a strong differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) response at 0.56 V, which can be used for the detection of p-nonylphenol with a linearly proportional concentration range of 1.0 x 10(-8) to 8 x 10(-5) mol/L and a detection limit of 3.91 x 10(-9) mol/L. The good stability, reproducibility and specificity of the resulting MIP electrochemical sensor are demonstrated. It might open a new window for investigation of selectively electrochemical sensing of small organic molecules from their analogues with the molecular imprinting technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Structural analysis of biomolecules is essential to natural product discovery, especially for precious biomaterials such as agarwood. However, one of the greatest challenges to the characterization of natural products is the profound cost in time and manpower to the structural elucidation of these highly diverse compounds. Here, we demonstrate a multi-modal mass spectrometric strategy, integrating matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and mass spectral molecular networking, to uncover agarwood natural products of Aquilaria sinensis trees. A simple workflow for preparing wood sections for MALDI-MSI analysis was demonstrated. Notably, tens of natural products in the agarwood region in wood stem section of A. sinensis were spatially revealed by MALDI-MSI. For the first time, such a great number of plant specialized metabolites is obtained by a single wood section MSI. Guided by the spatially resolved features, mass spectral molecular networking was subsequently applied for structural analysis of the agarwood natural products, in which three major classes of 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones and their analogues were putatively characterized. These results suggest an efficient strategy to the dereplication of plant natural products. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have implemented a linear ion trap (LIT)-based SIM-stitching method for ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) that increases the S/N over a wide m/z range compared to non-segmented wide full-scan (WFS) spectra. Here we described an improved segmented spectral scan stitching method that was based on quadrupole mass filter (QMF)-SIM, which overcame previous limitations of ion signal loss in LIT. This allowed for accurate representation of isotopologue distributions, both at natural abundance and in stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM)-based experiments. We also introduced a new spectral binning method that provided more precise and resolution-independent bins for irreversibly noise-suppressed FTMS spectra. We demonstrated a substantial improvement in S/N and sensitivity (typically > 10-fold) for C-13 labeled lipid extracts of human macrophages grown as three-dimensional (3D) cell culture, with detection of an increased number of C-13 isotopologue ions. The method also enabled analysis of extracts from very limited biological samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Histones participate in epigenetic regulation via dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone variants. Comprehensive characterization of histone markers, especially those for the histone variants, could help to decipher the mechanism of epigenetic regulation. However, correctly profiling histone PTMs and its variants using mass spectrometry remains a challenge. Here, we developed an improved, specific and sensitive LC separation in conjunction with a high throughput multiple reaction monitoring combined with stable isotope-labeled internal standards (MRM-SIS) based quantitative method for histone H3 variants in the study of epigenetic regulation in the cell cycle. PTM patterns and the overall abundance of the three main histone H3 variants from Karpas 422 cells were analyzed and quantified simultaneously during different cell stages. The methylation pattern varied between different sites and modification states during the cell cycle. The canonical H3.1 presented regular patterns on K27 and K36, similar to H3.2, albeit differing from variant H3.3. H3.3 K36me2 increased from G1, S to G2 phase, whereas the same marker decreased in both H3.1 and H3.2. This novel discovery inspires more focus and research on the histone variants behavior and function during cell cycle. Moreover, this improved method could be applied to unveil PTMs dynamics of histone variants in several biological processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glutathione is an essential intra- and extracellular antioxidant. The level of glutathione in the body is highly related to different disease states and is a useful indicator of disease risk and oxidative stress status. We have developed a sensitive, selective, and comprehensive LC-MS/MS method for the absolute quantification and C-13-tracer analysis of total glutathione using dithiothreitol for the reduction of glutathione disulfide. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 mu M, while the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.78 mu M, with the linear (R = 0.9997) range extending up to 100 mu M. The intra-run and inter-run coefficients of variation of 2.49% and 2.04%, respectively, attest to high repeatability. Mean (+/- SD) recoveries of three different concentrations (low, medium, high) of GSH spiked into aliquots of HCT116 cells prior to cell extraction were 108.9% (+/- 2.1), 100.8% (+/- 8.3), and 99.9% (+/- 7.1), respectively. Finally, using a 20 Da wide Q1 window in MRM mode, we were able to detect and relatively quantify all isotopic labeling states of GSH extracted from HCT116 cells fed with either C-13-labeled glucose or glutamine.

AB The test of sweat chloride is routinely performed as a worldwide newborn screening (NBS) to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in infants. However, the available methods for measurement of chloride in sweat suffer from such limitations as either low selectivity and/or requiring relatively large sample size. In this work, we have designed an analytical ruler that can measure chloride ion in sweat and hence can be used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. This micro-pad (mu-PAD) device is fabricated by making hydrophilic micro-channel on a filter paper impregnated with silver dichromate. After addition of chloride ion-containing sweat sample, it moves through the channel, leading to the formation of an AgCl sediment, which deposits as a white color stain, the length of which in the channel being proportional to the amount of chloride ion in sweat. A well-defined linear relation was observed between the length of white color stain and the concentration of chloride ion in the sample solutions with a relative standard deviation of 3.6% (n = 3) for an artificial sweat sample containing 100 mM chloride ion. The possible interfering effects of several different cations and anions on the detection of chloride ion were investigated and the results well-confirmed the selectivity of the proposed method. With the use of only 2.0 mu L of the sample solution, the mu PAD was able to measure the chloride content of sweat over a concentration range of 20.0-100.0 mM, which covers both the healthy range ((<) 40 mM) and the risky range ((>)60 mM) of chloride ion. Analysis of chloride content of sweat samples by the mu PAD agreed well with those obtained by a standard electrochemical method (with relative errors of lower than 10%). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Field-amplified stacking (FAS) is a commonly used method for enhancing the sensitivity of charged species from low conductive media in capillary electrophoresis. FAS also showed significant sensitivity enhancement effect on a uniform paper fluidic channel by proper design of the electrolyte. In this paper, a novel method of introducing electric field gradient is proposed by geometry design of a 2D paper fluidic channel, and field amplification effect was successfully demonstrated with reduced requirement on the sample's conductivity. Sensitive colorimetric detection of microalbuminuria (MAU) from urine samples was demonstrated by mobile phone camera. Experimental results showed that, with active electric field motivation, up to 93.5% of the loaded protein probe could be effectively transferred and stacked into a narrow band on the newly designed paper fluidic channel. A limit of detection (LOD) of 6.5 mg.L-1 HSA was achieved with a dynamic range of 10-300 mg.L-1 (linear in the range of 10-100 mg.L-1, R-2 = 0.991). Combined with selective staining of albumin with bromophenol blue (BPB), the established method was applied to the detection of MAU from clinical urine samples, and consistent results with that of the clinical method were obtained. With this paper-based analytical device (PAD), MAU from highly conductive urine samples can be directly loaded and detected without any pretreatment. This method provides a way to develop highly sensitive point-of-care test (POCT) for rapid screening of some diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A red-emitting and ratiometric fluorescence probe 1 for detecting H2O2, based on a styrylnaphthalimide-boronate ester was developed. Upon a H2O2-mediated hydrolysis of boronate ester, probe 1 was transformed to 2 with a ratiometric fluorescence change, decrease at 535 and increase at 640 nm. It was also found that the fluorescent reaction of 1 with H2O2 in solution could be completed within 10 min and the detection limit was estimated to be 0.30 mu M. Moreover, this ratiometric change was highly selective for H2O2 over other redox species, metal ions, and anions. Also, this system was found to be capable of detecting H2O2 in the pH range of 6-9. Furthermore, probe 1 was preferentially accumulated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the live HeLa cells, and an increased H2O2 level in the presence of an ER stress inducer, thapsigargin was revealed.

AB Driven by a bright prospect for rapid, portable and cost-effective point-of-care testing, an assembled Pasteur pipette device to integrate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection was developed to detect B. cereus in a sample-to-answer format. Denaturation Bubble-mediated Strand Exchange Amplification (SEA) was chosen to perform isothermal amplification because it requires only a pair of primers and one Bst DNA polymerase. The established SEA can detect as low as 1.0 x 10(-13) M genomic DNA of B. cereus, which was comparable with the previously reported method for B. cereus detection. The assembled Pasteur pipette allows sample-to-answer diagnostic in a simple, low-cost, portable, and disposable format. The inherent function of Pasteur pipette enables direct liquid handling without the need of extra pipettes, syringes or pumps. Visual readout was achieved by using a pH sensitive dye, further simplifying result judgment process. The detection limit for B. cereus is 1.0 x 10(4) CFU/mL in pure cultures, while the detection limit in artificially contaminated milk is 1.0 x 10(5) CFU/mL without enrichment and 1.0 x 10(0) CFU/mL following 12 h enrichment. Considering that typical cell counts in food samples associated to food poisoning are 1.0 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(8) CFU per gram/milliliter B. cereus, our Pasteur pipette is enough sensitive for answer-to-sample diagnosis of B. cereus even directly from foods without enrichment. The whole diagnostic procedure could be completed within 50 min, dramatically decreasing the detection time. In a word, the assembled Pasteur pipette device, combined with a homemade metal bath, possesses great potential for sample-to-answer application in resource-limited settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A sensitive nanocomplex probe prepared from fluorescent polydopamine nanoparticles (F-PDA) and cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets was established for the determination of alpha-glucosidase activity. In this detection system, the fluorescence of F-PDA was firstly quenched by CoOOH nanosheets based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Subsequently, ascorbic acid was produced from 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid which was selectively hydrolyzed by alpha-glucosidase. CoOOH was reduced to Co2+ by the released ascorbic acid, which resulted in the recovery of F-PDA nanoparticles fluorescence. In consequence, alpha-glucosidase activity was determined by the fluorescence recovery degree of the F-PDA nanoparticle. This fluorescent method showed a good linear relationship with the activity of alpha-glucosidase from 2 to 80 U L-1 and low detection limit of 1.65 U L-1 (S/N = 3). This fluorescence probe with high selectivity and sensitivity demonstrated a remarkable applicability in human serum samples and provided an alternative for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors screening in the discovery of anti-diabetes drugs.

AB In this paper, a novel graphene oxide (GO)/polyaniline (PANI) sandwich-like nanocomposite has been synthesized by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. The GO/PANI is then fabricated onto the interdigitated transducers as sensor for humidity detection. The electrical properties of the thin films are investigated in various relative humidity (RH), including conduction mechanism, sensitivity, reproducibility and humidity hysteresis. The conduction mechanism of the GO/PANI for humidity response is discussed in detail, and the total resistance of GO/PANI is mainly depending on the bulk resistance of PANI. At the lower (60%) RH, the proton hopping transfer plays a very important role for the proton exchange mechanism of GO/PANI thin film. At the higher RH, ionic conduction is not only main conduction process, but also with the proton hopping partially exists for the proton exchange mechanism. Besides, the humidity sensitivity of the thin films enhances with increasing the mass ratio of GO (0, 5, and 50 mg) to PANI due to its larger surface area, hydrophilic functional groups and synergistic effect of pi-pi* conjugation system, which is also supported by adsorption of QCM humidity response. Mean-while, the morphology and structure of the thin films are analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively.

AB Direct and absolute analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in complex media (e.g., human serum) is still a big challenge due to the issues with off-analyte absorption, low sensitivity and specificity. In this work, we have fabricated the erythrocyte membrane-biointerfaced spherical nucleic acids (EMSNAs) for miRNA assay, which not only enables tailor-engineered signal amplification but also exhibits anti-interference property. As a consequence, it is possible to achieve a single-step quantification of miRNAs in complex media without the process of enzymatic amplification, which can vastly simplify the detection procedure. Experimental results reveal that the assay permits ultrasensitive quantification of miR-141, with a limit of detection down to 33.9 aM, and show a high selectivity for discriminating miR-200 family members. More importantly, the assay enables robust miRNA analysis in human serum and can accurately differentiate lung cancer patients and prostate cancer patients from healthy donors. Its performance may satisfy the requirements for direct, rapid, sensitive and specific early diagnosis of cancer, signifying its great potential in clinical diagnostics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Since inorganic phosphate ion (PO43-) plays very important roles in environment or living organisms, developing a selective and sensitive detection method for PO43- is highly desired. Owing to the superior optical properties, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been developed as a promising emitting material in fluorescence analysis. Herein, we reported the first example of negatively charged molybdate-mediated nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (Mo7O246--mediated N-GQDs) as a fluorescence "off-on" probe for PO43- via "anion ion-mediated" strategy. The N-GQDs was firstly modified with Mo7O246- through a complex bonding system containing ionic and hydrogen bonds. The formation of N-GQDs/Mo7O246- complex leaded to photoluminescence (PL) quenching of N-GQDs. In the presence of PO43-, strong affinity between PO43- and Mo7O246- produced ammonium phosphomolybdate, which destroyed the pre-formed N-GQDs/Mo7O246- structure and detached Mo7O246- from N-GQDs surface. Thus, the PL of N-GQDS was in turn switched on. Under optimal conditions, this probe exhibited a good linear relationship between PL response and PO43- concentration in the range from 7.0 to 30.0 mu M with a limit of detection of 50 nM. Also this probe with high selectivity and sensitivity has been successfully used to sense PO43- in natural water, biological fluid, and living cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the great success of fluorescence sensing array application in bioanalysis, the photo-quenching problem accompanied with high surface fluorophore density has become the bottleneck for its further sensitivity improvement. Herein, a fluorescence polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel array was developed for highly sensitive microRNA detection based on interfacial cation exchange amplification coupled with DNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The carboxylate PEG hydrogel array was fabricated on glass slide via photo polymerization and modified with miRNA capture probe, target miRNA binding triggered HCR in hydrogel with biotin labelled DNA probes to generate numerous DNA polymer chains where biotinylated CdS QDs were subsequently conjugated with a streptavidin bridge. Interfacial cation exchange amplification was triggered in hydrogel upon the introduction of Ag+ and Rhod-5N, and abundant Cd2+ was released from CdS to bind with Rhod-5N for substantial fluorescence enhancement. The aqueous like environment of hydrogel eliminated the fluorescence quenching and simplified experiment process by performing cation exchange reaction at interface with direct result. The linear range for model target miRNA-21 was 1 fM to 500 pM with a detection limit of 0.835 fM. Taking advantage of the non-fouling property of PEG hydrogel, direct quantification of miRNA-21 was achieved from crude cancer cell lysates with a detection limit down to 10 equivalent cells. The expressions of circulating miRNA-21 in clinical serum samples were also assessed with comparable results from RT-PCR. The developed hydrogel array provides a universal platform for highly sensitive fluorescence sensing, and would benefit clinical non-invasive disease diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several strategies have been developed to decrease the concentration limits of detection (LODs) in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Nowadays, chromatographic-based preconcentration using a micro-cartridge integrated in the separation capillary for in-line solid-phase extraction capillary electrophoresis (SPE-CE) is one of the best alternatives for high throughput and reproducible sample clean-up and analyte preconcentration. This review covers different designs (geometrical configurations, with frits or fritless, capillary types, compatibility with commercial instrumentation, etc.) and materials (sorbents, supports, affinity ligands, etc.) applied for almost 30 years to prepare in-line SPE-CE microcartridges (i.e. analyte concentrators), with emphasis on the conventional unidirectional configuration in capillary format. Advantages, disadvantages and future perspectives are analyzed in detail to provide the reader a wide overview about the great potential of this technique to enhance sensitivity and address trace analysis.

AB This review covers analytical methods applied to the determination of none volatile sulphur-containing biological compounds. The classes of S-compounds include amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and sulphur-containing metabolites. Techniques covered include element specific detectors as well as molecular specific detectors from X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) to elemental and molecular mass spectrometers. The major techniques used are inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in their various forms. Both techniques either individually or combined require the sample to be present in liquid form and therefore involve sample preparation usually extraction and depending on sample and molecular class studied potentially also derivatisation in addition to generally requiring chromatographic separation. Over recent years, detection limits achieved by elemental methods and computational methods to extract signals of sulphur-containing compounds out of the mass of data produced by molecular high-resolution mass spectrometers made significant gains. Still the determination of sulphur-containing compounds is challenging, but nowadays the methods have been developed well enough to allow application to real samples for absolute quantification of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids.

AB Signal generation techniques for visual detection of analytes have received a great deal of attention in various sensing fields. These approaches are considered to be advantageous when instrumentation cannot be employed, such as for on-site assays, point-of-care tests, and he althcare diagnostics in resource-constrained areas. Amongst various visual detection approaches explored for non-invasive quantitative measurements, ratiometric fluorescence sensing has received particular attention as a potential method to overcome the limitations of intensity-based probes. This technique relies on changes in the intensity of two or more emission bands (induced by an analyte), resulting in an effective internal referencing which improves the sensitivity of the detection. The self-calibration, together with the unique optophysical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have made the ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobes more sensitive and reliable, which in turn, can result in more precise visual detection of the analytes. Over the past few years, a vast number of ratiometric sensing probes using nanostructured fluorophores have been designed and reported for a wide variety of sensing, imaging, and biomedical applications. In this work, a review on the NP-based ratiometric fluorescent sensors has been presented to meticulously elucidate their development, advances and challenges. With a special emphasis on visual detection, the most important steps in the design of fluorescent ratiometric nanoprobes have been given and based on different classes of analytes, recent applications of fluorescent ratiometric nanoprobes have been summarized. The challenges for the future use of the technique investigated in this review have been also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review summarizes the current regulatory status of tattoos in all their versions in the European Union framework, as well as the analytical approaches developed so far to control the safety of this type of products. Publications from the last two decades (2000-2019) have been reviewed in which body-decorating products have become more and more popular. Tattoo inks, permanent make-up, sticker tattoos, and henna-based products are covered. The report highlights that there is no unique regulation for body art products, conforming a complex legislative framework even within the European community. The labelling of tattoo related products is generally non-existent or incorrect. It is therefore very difficult to know their chemical composition in detail. Pigments are ingredients common to all types of tattoos, so they are the most covered compounds in this review, along with their impurities and degradation products, including aromatic amines, metals or PAH. Other types of undesirable compounds are also included, such as plasticizers or para-phenylenediamine. Although the development of methods of analysis has increased in recent times, there is still margin for improvement in the analytical coverage of this topic. The challenge is, indeed, a systematic analytical approach to control body-decorating products, but ideally within a clear and common harmonised regulatory framework. Finally, tattoo-based sensors for biomonitoring have also been included in this review, since although its purpose is not decorative; its clinical importance is very relevant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we developed a novel bioelectronic taste sensor for the detection of specific bitter substances. A human bitter taste receptor, hT2R4, was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which was used as the primary recognition element. A simple and low-cost electrochemical device based on ITO-based electrolyte-semiconductor (ES) structure was innovatively employed as the transducer to assess bacterial metabolic consequences of receptor activation in real time. An apparent increase in extracellular acidification rate was observed, which was resulted from the triggering of hT2R4 receptors by their target ligand of denatonium. The sensor showed dose-dependent responses to denatonuim ranging from 50 nM to 500 nM, while non-bioengineered bacteria without hT2R4 receptors exhibited negligible responses to the same stimulus. In addition, the specificity of the proposed taste biosensor was verified using other typical bitter substances such as quinine and alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU). This research provides a simple and inexpensive approach for the construction of bioelectronic taste sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We proposed a new method for regulating the electrochemical signal by using Schottky barrier. The results show that the height of Schottky barrier can be altered by adsorbing charged substance to control the enhancement and attenuation of electrochemical signal. The Schottky interface formed by MoS2 and CQDs (carbon quantum dots) can achieve the selective detection of dopamine and overcome the distraction of ascorbic acid and uric acid with similar redox signal. The combination of Schottky barrier and electrochemical detection enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of electrochemical sensor significantly. It is a new strategy for improving electrochemical detection by introducing Schottky barrier into electrochemical process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The as-prepared SWNTs are always a mixture of metallic (m-) and semiconducting (s-) tubes with quite different electrochemical properties which is a major barrier for their application in many fields. Based on the noncovalent interactions between planar aromatic molecules and SWNTs, the pyrene derivatives 1-docosyloxylmethylpyrene (DomP) was synthesized to separate the m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs via its significant selectivity toward s-SWNTs, i.e. electronic modulation. Before and after doping with electron, the electrochemical properties of s-SWNTs were studied and compared with that of m-SWNTs by electronic absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammogram. As demonstrated, the electrocatalytic activity of electron modulated s-SWNTs was significantly improved and even better than m-SWNTs. Thus a novel sensor was constructed with the electron modulated s-SWNTs modified electrode and successfully applied for simultaneous determination of guanine and adenine. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A shrimp tropomyosin (TPM) immunosensor has been developed and optimized to detect trace amounts of shrimp (in the ppm range), based on a combination of an amperometric transduction, magnetic particles and disposable screen-printed electrodes. The approach is based on the implementation of a sandwich immunoassay format on the surface of magnetic beads and their coupling onto disposable screen-printed electrodes to finally register the amperometric response at -200 mV vs. Ag pseudo-reference electrode, using H2O2 as enzymatic substrate and hydroquinone as redox mediator. The use of carboxyl-functionalized magnetic microbeads (MBs) and in-house made magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as solid supports have been evaluated and compared. Our experimental results confirm that the use of MBs, in addition to simplifying the test protocol, improves the resulting sensitivity, so they were selected for the implementation of the immunosensor. In the optimized experimental conditions, the developed immunosensor offered a LOD of 47 pg mL(-1) for amperometric determination of shrimp TPM standards and great selectivity against TPM from other sources, thus allowing differentiation between crustaceans (shrimp) and mollusks (squid). Applicability studies demonstrated successful determination both in crude and cooked samples using very simple protocols. Additionally, processed foods based on fish and mollusks that could potentially include crustaceans in their composition have been analyzed using the sensor and compared to the declared ingredients.
   The sensitivity and specificity showed by the sensor in the analysis of heterogeneous food samples without a previous purification or enrichment stage, also outperforms existing solutions in terms of time and cost effectiveness and permits its direct and smooth implementation in the food industry for routine allergen analyses.

AB Characterization of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) exposure is a key step and of great importance towards a better understanding of their toxicity and underlying mechanisms. However, it has been bottlenecked for lack of valid methods capable of quantifying cell-associated CNMs. Here, we developed a new economical and convenient method based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) that could accumulate graphene oxide (GO) at the interface between the loading well and the gel. The sharp black band formed there can be digitalized and the intensity quantified, which was proportional to the amount of GO loaded onto the gel. The method has a detection limit of 84.1 ng. We showed that the amount of GO in three different cell models, mouse macrophage cells (Raw264.7), human epithelial cells (A549) and mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), could be accurately quantified by this assay, with the uptake rates decreasing in the order of MSC > Raw264.7 > A549. The results were consistent with the fluorescent imaging on cells exposed to fluorescence-labeled GO and TEM examination on ultrathin cell sections. The surprisingly highest uptake rate of MSC might be due to their abundant intracellular vesicles, which deserves further investigation. The novel method provides a complementary quantitative tool to the use of radioactive markers and fluorescent labeling of carbon nanomaterials and may facilitate the toxicological studies on carbon nanomaterials.

AB Developing an effective strategy for endogenous phosphopeptides enrichment and separation is necessary in phosphopeptidomics analysis due to the serious inference caused by chaotic biological In this work, a size-exclusive magnetic binary metal mesoporous nanocomposites were to capture phosphorylated peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. The novel Fe3O4@ TiO2 mSiO(2) nanocomposites possessed the merits of ordered mesoporous channels, superand the integration of dual affinity of ZreO and TieO. Compared with single-metal nanocomposites (Fe3O4@ TiO2@ mSiO(2) and Fe3O4@ ZrO2@ mSiO(2)), Fe3O4@ TiO(2)eZrO(2)@ mSiO(2) much enhanced enrichment performance towards mono-and multi-phospho-peptides with sensitivity. With all the advances, the Fe3O4@ TiO(2)eZrO(2)@ mSiO(2) was also successfully applied to endogenous phosphorylated peptides from human saliva. And consequently, a total of 30 containing 2 multi-and 28 mono-phosphopeptides were identified efficiently. These show that the novel materials have the great potential in peptidome analysis.

AB An easy-to-use, portable 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mPAD) for the determination of total ammonia (i.e., ammonia thorn ammonium) in freshwaters is described. It consists of two layers of paper patterned with hydrophilic circular zones, one impregnated with sodium hydroxide (sample zone) and another (detection zone) with an acid-base indicator (nitrazine yellow (NY) or bromothymol blue (BTB)), separated by a m-distillation chamber. Ammonium ions present in the water sample are converted into ammonia gas by reaction with sodium hydroxide in the sample zone. Ammonia then diffuses through a headspace and reacts with an acid-base indicator in the detection zone, the reflectance of which can be related to the total ammonia concentration. The analytical signal at 7.8 mg L-1 offered by the m-distillation chamber-based mPAD is more than double of that obtained using a gas-permeable membrane. The proposed mPAD is characterised by a limit of detection of 0.32 or 0.47mg N L-1 and working concentration ranges of 0.5-3.0 mg N L-1 or 2.0-10mg N L-1 when using NY or BTB indicators, respectively. This is the first mPAD whose working range covers almost the entire trigger value range (0.32 -2.3 mg N L-1) for ammonia nitrogen in freshwater systems which makes it suitable as a field screening tool for ammonia in freshwaters. An inter-and intra-device repeatability of 7.6% and 9.0%, respectively, has been achieved for the NY-based mPAD (3mg N L-1) and 13 and 2.5% (8 mg N L-1) for the BTB-based mPAD. The NY-based mPAD is stable under vacuum for at least 12 days at room temperature, and 56 days if stored in a freezer (<=-20 degrees C). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bead-based ELISA in microfluidics is a promising platform for reducing the reagent consumption and improving assay throughput due to its fast binding kinetics and low reagent consumption. Current microfluidic bead-based immunoassay mainly relies on magnetic and centrifugal forces to manipulate microparticles to complete an assay protocol. Here we report an acoustic streaming-based microfluidic method that can perform all the fluid and particle operations of bead-based ELISA. A series of sharp-edge structures are used to generate a long-range coupled acoustic streaming that enables simultaneous particle trapping and active molecular exchange in a dead-end microchannel. The device achieved > 99% of molecular exchange in 4 min, while maintaining a particle trapping efficiency of 85%. This acoustofluidic-based method demonstrates all three key operations in a bead-based immunoassay: (1) Beads "immobilization"; (2) Active mixing of fluid for bead/target binding; (3) Active molecular exchange for reagent loading and washing. Finally, on-chip quantitative detection of biomarker IL-6 with a limit of detection similar to 50 pg/mL is achieved using this platform including an enzymatic signal amplification step. The small footprint, simple setup, and continuous flow operation of the acoustic streaming-based method makes it an attractive platform for continuous flow bead-based immunoassay.

AB A short G-rich sequence with three G-tracts can form a G-triplex (G3), a recently identified noncanonical DNA structure. Until now, very limited functional study and application of G3 is reported. Herein, we integrated G3 with isothermal exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) for achieving simple and sensitive biosensing strategy. In this strategy, the cascade EXPAR cycles produces larger numbers of short G-rich sequences, which self-assemble into G3 structure and then bind hemin to form G3/hemin DNAzyme. This G3/hemin DNAzyme-based EXPAR strategy could detect as low as 4.7 fM target DNA with colorimetric detection, and the sensitivity of G3/hemin DNAzyme-based EXPAR strategy was much higher than that of the conventional G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme-based EXPAR strategy. We explored the reason for higher sensitivity of G3/hemin DNAzyme-based EXPAR strategy. The experimental results demonstrated that G3/hemin DNAzyme is an ideal signal generator for EXPAR-based biosensing platform. This work opens a new avenue to develop effective signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive biosensing. This work is also helpful for a deeper understanding of G3 structure and the future application of G3. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel versatile locked nucleic acid modified molecular beacon probe (LNA-MB) was developed for imaging intracellular precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and disturbing Dicer-mediated cleavage process. The target recognition reaction between the smart probe and pre-miRNA can not only induce the conformational changes of probe and block the Dicer cleavage site, but also inhibit the cleavage process, and then achieve down-regulation of miRNA expression. Simultaneously, the target recognition reaction broke the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorophore donor FAM and acceptor TAMRA, which were labelled on the LNA-MB probe, further induced the relevant change of fluorescence signal, and then achieved imaging analysis of pre-miRNA and inhibition events in situ. Both in vitro and in single living cell studies showed that the versatile probes exhibited a remarkable performance in targeting with pre-miRNA-21, and nearly 65% downregulation of mature miRNA-21 was achieved with 100 nM probes. All investigations demonstrate that the proposed strategy represents a promising alternative for regulating and inhibiting endogenous disease-associated RNAs, then further for achieving therapeutic outcomes in personalized treatments.

Compared to the neutral diarylethene, the closed-ring isomer of the ionic liquid-modified diarylethene exhibits obvious solvent-dependence. The closed-ring isomer showed solvatochromism depending on the solvent dielectric constants. More importantly, a dual colorimetric cyanide sensor with high selectivity has been achieved based on this ionic liquid-modified diarylethene derivative. Both the open-ring and closed-ring isomers recognized the strongly nucleophilic cyanide by forming of C4-cyano adducts. This study provides a novel design strategy for the development of photochromic diarylethenes for the colorimetric recognition of CN-. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets have attracted numerous attention due to their unparalleled advantages such as unique structures, large surface areas, good stability and high catalytic efficiency. In this paper, 2D Cu(bpy)(2)(OTf)(2) nanosheets (Cu-MOF, bpy = 4,4-bipyridine, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) are first utilized to achieve the fluorescent detection for H2O2 and glucose with their intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. The fluorescent biosensor Cu-MOF nanosheets were achieved by the efficient catalysis of non-fluorescent thiamine (TH) to strong fluorescent thiochrome in the presence of H2O2. With the combination of glucose oxidase, highly selective and sensitive fluorescent detection for glucose could be established with a detection limit of 0.41 mu M and two separate linear ranges of 10-100 mu M and 100-1000 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, the developed method has been applied to human serum for the quantitative determination of glucose as a clinical diagnosis indicator of diabetes mellitus. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent study proves that the combination of loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) with one-step strand displacement (OSD) is of great help to improve the sequence specificity during genetic detection. However, because OSD is incapable of signal amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage. With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies. Especially when using FCM or PGM, with the assistance of magnetic beads (MBs), the detection shows even higher tolerance capability to complicated biological matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this research, a novel Resonance Rayleigh Scattering (RRS) aptasensor was developed for thrombin monitoring using in-situ synthesized and embedded Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) into poly vinyl alcohol eborax hydrogel (PBH). Thiolated-thrombin binding aptamer (thiolated-TBA) was attached to the surface of AuNPs embedded into PBH to design the PBH-aptasensor for thrombin detection (thiolatedTBA@ AuNPsePBH). To verify the characteristic and morphology of PBH nanocomposite, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, TEM, average particle size analizer and UVeVis spectra were performed. The difference in RRS intensities in the absence and presence of thrombin was calculated and selected as the monitoring signal. Effect of different parameters on the RRS signal was investigated at excitation wavelength of 500 nm. Under the approved conditions, the linear detection range was validated over the concentration of 0.70 pM- 0.02 mu M. The limit of detection based on 3S(b) was 0.10 pM. The relative standard deviation for 5.6 pM and 3.6 nM were 4.0 and 2.7% (n = 10), respectively. The proposed aptasensor was successfully applied as an experimental model for thrombin detection in serum samples of healthy volunteers with acceptable results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, a zinc ion (Zn2+)-triggered aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE) fluorescence "onoff-on" nanoswitch was fabricated for inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) activity detection. Dual ligand functionalized Au NCs were utilized as the substrate of the AIEE nanoswitch. The introduction of Zn2+ can cause Au NCs aggregated along with the enhanced fluorescence. After the addition of PPi, aggregated Au NCs disaggregated along with decreased fluorescence due to the competitive combination between PPi and Zn2+ (on-off). When PPase was introduced, PPi was hydrolyzed and release Zn2+, resulting in aggregated Au NCs along with enhanced fluorescence again (off-on). On the basis of this, highly selective and sensitive detection PPi (liner range from 0.1 to 300 mu M) and PPase activity (liner range from 0.1 to 10 mU) can be achieved. The detection limits are 0.04 mu M for PPi and 0.03 mU for PPase, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared Zn2+-triggered AIEE nanoswitch was successfully used for quantitative analysis of PPase activity in human serum with satisfactory spiked recoveries, and applied for the inhibitors screening.

AB Arginine is an important amino acid in humankind bodies and is of essential clinical significance. This paper presents a novel bioprobe based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which can be used to detect arginine efficiently and economically. In this bioprobe system, positively charged upconversion phosphor NaYF4 (NYF) acts as energy donor, and negatively charged gold nanoparticle (AuNP) acts as energy acceptor. The oppositely charged donor and acceptor come into close proximity through electrostatic attraction effect, which results in the occurrence of FRET between NYF and AuNP. The FRET process is thus in the "on" state, meanwhile the system is in the "off" state, and the emitting light of NYF quenched. When positively charged arginine is added into the system, the guanidyl of arginine binds to AuNP and leads to the negatively charged AuNP becomes positively charged one, and the AuNP separates from NYF because of the electrostatic repulsion. The FRET process is blocked and the system switches to the "on" state because the distance between NYF and AuNP becomes longer. In the "on" state, the intensity of the restored emitting light is proportional to the concentration of arginine. This approach brings a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of arginine in the concentration range of 14.42-115.04 mu M. The limit of detection is as low as 2.9 mu M. A new method for quantitative determination of arginine by just measuring the fluorescence intensity of the system is established. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Signal amplification strategy have been the intensive direction for highly-sensitive microRNA (miRNA) detection, however, it is worth noting that signal quenching approach is rarely realized. Inspired by the unwinding of G-quadruplex with Klenow Fragment polymerase (KF), a simple and label-free signal quenching system for detection of miRNAs was developed. In the presence of target miRNA, miRNA was used as a primer to promote KF activity resulting in the disruption of G-quadruplex structure of probe and the biological catalysis inactivation of DNAzyme formed by G-quadruplex structure and hemin. As a result, the probe would be transformed from G-quadruplex to duplex and the obvious differential signal could be observed in most cases even with naked eyes. With the significant signal decreasing, the target miRNA can be rapidly analyzed by UVevis spectra with a considerably low detection limit (4.5 nM). This method exhibits excellent selectivity and anti-interference ability by discriminating base-mismatched and other miRNA families from target miRNA. Meanwhile, a good recovery (90.7%similar to 102.4%) in 5% human serum was obtained and this strategy verified a high expression level of miR21 in total RNA of MCF-7 compared with 293T and HeLa. It implies that this assay is of great potential to be applied in biochemical research and clinical diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the efficiency of pH-dependent, fluorescent carbon dots for the sensing of hazardous anions in aqueous media and cell imaging. The nitrite anion, an important water-soluble element for environmental and biological systems, requires continuous monitoring because a high concentration can affect the systems severely. The as-synthesized carbon dots efficiently detected the nitrite anion in aqueous solution through a fluorescent 'Turn Off' phenomenon. The quenching mechanism was investigated through proper microscopic and spectroscopic studies. The limit of detection and linear detection range were 7.9 nM and 2.3 mu M-7.7 mM, respectively. The sensitivity was tested with different water samples. In a parallel experiment, the as-synthesized carbon dots were used as a cell-imaging probe for HeLa cells, highlighting their potential in different biological studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We developed temperature-responsive mixed-mode columns packed with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-modified beads and poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS)-modified beads in various ratios. The PNIPAAm-modified silica beads and PAMPS-modified silica beads were prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, respectively. We confirmed polymer modification of the silica beads by CHN elemental analysis, FTIR, zeta-potential measurements, and SEM. To determine the column separation efficiency, we examined the elution behaviors of cold medicine active ingredients and monoamines from each column. Analyte separation occurred on columns with PNIPAAm to PAMPS ratios of 1:20 and 1:10, whereas a column containing only PNIPAAm-modified beads did not retain the analytes. The analytes were retained on the columns through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with PNIPAAm and PAMPS, respectively. The separation performance improved with increasing column temperature because of dehydration of PNIPAAm and enhancement of hydrophobic interactions at elevated temperatures. The mixed-mode columns will be useful for separating basic bioactive compounds because the retention of analytes can be modulated by changing the column temperature and the composition.

AB The use of immobilized pH gradient (IPG) capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) was confirmed to be possible with packed capillaries. The success of this experiment was due to two key factors: first, the use of surface-confined atom transfer radical polymerization method led to an increase in active reaction sites on the surface of silica particles; second, the subsequent free radical reaction caused carrier ampholytes (CAs) to bond faster and firmer. Based on this scheme, both CIEF with free pH gradient and CIEF with IPG were performed in capillaries packed with 3 mu m modified silica particles. In our online CIEF-UV platform, both reversible and irreversible adsorption of proteins was shown to be negligible. Four proteins were focused: cytochrome c (pI 10.2), myoglobin (pI 7.3), carbonic anhydrase (pI 5.9) and trypsin inhibitor (pI 4.5). The comparison of the two CIEF columns showed that the time required for focusing in the packed capillary with IPG is only increased by a factor of 1.5 compared to the packed capillary, giving complete focusing in less than 12 min at 400 V/cm. With the increment of the electric field (the maximum at 600 V/cm), the run time was continually decreasing in these packed capillaries while the peak shape was improving. The four proteins (pH 4.5-10.2) could be successfully separated in our online CIEF platform. Moreover, for the newly online CIEF platform, pressure-driven mobilization without an applied electric field was achieved in the packed capillary with immobilized pH gradient. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Panax notoginseng leaves (PNL) was considered as a potential medicinal part with abundant protopanaxdiol type ginsenosides. In this study, an integrated system was developed for simultaneously qualitative and quantitative analysis of ginsenosides in PNL using online comprehensive two-dimensional hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (online HILIC x RP-ESI/HRMS/MSn). The system was configured based on the combination of a XBridge amide column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 2.5 mu m) and Accucore phenyl-hexyl (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 2.6 mu m) for the first and second dimensions, respectively. An additional water phase was introduced to dilute the eluent from the first dimension to decrease its elution strength in the second dimension. The online dilution, modulation interface and the second-dimension gradient program were deeply optimized to reduce possible sample loss and improve system resolution. Under the optimal conditions, a total of 226 ginsenosides were unambiguously identified or tentatively characterized by aid of high-resolution accurate mass and MSn fragment data in both negative and positive ion modes, and 93 of them were discovered as potentially new ginsenosides in PNL. Besides, the validated online HILIC x RP-LTQ-MS method was applied to determine 24 ginsenosides directly on 2D-EIC contour plots in nine batches of PNL samples. The powerful separation capability acquired by the developed online HILIC x RP system affords not only reliable structural information for identification, but also accurate quantitation. This combined system can also be used to characterize and quantify bioactive ingredients in the samples with complex matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of coupling of size-exclusion HPLC with ICP/MS (SEC-ICP/MS) was first applied in this work as a novel approach in the biotechnology field to assess metal binding to Immunoglobulin G (IgG) mAbs. This method can be used to probe the mechanism and biophysical properties of metal-protein interactions to gain a deeper understanding of the potential impact of metals during drug product manufacturing.
   Two IgG1s and one IgG2 drugs were investigated. Cu2+ was selected as the metal of interest due to its known ability to form strong complexes with organic molecules and to bind and enhance the degradation of mAbs. Instrument and separation conditions (interface, columns, and mobile phase) were studied for the separation of the protein-metal bound and unbound fractions of a bovine superoxide dismutase (SOD) standard prior to on-line detection of the mAb-metal (Cu) binding. The SEC-ICP/MS method was used to show copper binding by biotherapeutics by comparing the retention times of the protein by SEC and the metal by ICP/MS, to see if they co-elute at the same time. The approach developed offers considerable advantages over methods based on ultrafiltration followed by off-line metal determination in terms of speed, simplicity, precision and selectivity regarding the molecular weight of the complexes involved. In conjunction with other techniques, this method may provide in-depth knowledge of metal-induced mAb degradation mechanisms in biologics process development, be used as an analytical tool for mAb manufacturing in the cell culture process, and be applied during various stages of drug product manufacturing to gain a deeper understanding of the potential impact of metals during biotherapeutic development.

AB Sarcosine is a recently identified biomarker for prostate cancer. However, the rapid detection methods for sarcosine are relatively lack because of the low concentration and the presence of complicated interfering substances in serum or urine. In this manuscript, hollow nanospheres of Fe3O4 was synthesized and used as carrier to disperse Pt (Pt) nanoparticles. In order to achieve excellent electron transfer ability, we use polyaniline to coat Pt-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and pyrolyze the polyaniline to carbon (C). Thus, hollow magnetic Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites with good electron transfer ability are formed. The Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites have high catalytic activity and stability. The nanocomposites were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to construct a nonenzyme hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor (Pt-Fe3O4@C/GCE). We further construct a sensitive sarcosine biosensor by immobilizing sarcosine oxidase (SOx) on the Pt-Fe3O4@C/GCE. The high catalytic activity and good biocompatibility of Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites greatly retained the bioactivity of immobilized SOx, and the prepared sarcosine biosensor has good electrocatalytic performance towards sarcosine. It has a linear detection range between 0.5 and 60 mu M with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.43 mu M (the signal to noise ratio is 3), and the sensitivity is 3.45 nA mu M-1 (48.8 nA mu M-1 cm(-2)), which has the potential to be used for rapid screening of prostate cancer.

AB The novel laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry methodology for the rapid screening of elemental impurities in solid pharmaceutical samples with the daily dose less than 2.0 g has been developed in accordance with requirements of established USP < 232/233 > chapters and ICH-Q3D guideline. The LA-ICP-MS methodology covering the determination of Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Co, V, Ni, Tl, Au, Pd, Ir, Os, Rh, Ru, Se, Ag, Pt was successfully validated in terms of linearity, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity and range. Moreover, the presented 'in-house' matrix-matched standards preparation methodology helps to overcome crucial analytical problem connected with unavailability of commercial certified matrix-matched reference material suitable for the direct elemental impurities analysis in various kinds of solid pharmaceutical products. A two step homogeneity study of prepared matrix-matched calibration standards is also reported to investigate the homogeneity of distribution of elemental impurities and internal standards across the pressed pellet. The validated LA-ICP-MS method was applied on analysis of several types of solid pharmaceutical samples (active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, placebo and final drug products). The proposed method allowed the accurate, precise and fast screening of elemental impurities without necessity of time and labour consuming solutions preparation and thus it can be used in routine practice as an alternative to conventional ICP-MS or ICP-OES for the rapid quality control of different stages of pharmaceutical production.

AB Rotational ambiguity in the bilinear solutions provided by multivariate curve resolution - alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS) leads to an additional source of uncertainty in the estimation of analyte concentrations by second-order multivariate calibration. The phenomenon is particularly important when measuring matrix instrumental data derived from liquid chromatography with spectral detection, where elution time profiles usually vary from sample to sample both in position and shape. This makes the data non-trilinear, precluding the use of unique trilinear decomposition models. The present report compares some analytical results achieved by: (1) the usual MCR-ALS analysis of augmented matrices built from raw matrix data and (2) a previously reported procedure based on synchronizing the MCR-ALS elution time profiles using correlation optimized warping (COW), reconstructing the augmented matrix with the spectra and the aligned chromatograms, and then applying MCR-ALS again with the trilinearity constraint, leading to unique solutions, which is possible because the warping process restores the trilinearity of the data. We show that alternative (2) does not solve the rotational ambiguity issues and artificially modifies the original data, without significant improvements in analytical performance. In the simulated systems, the best average errors for alternative (1) were about 2%, whereas for alternative (2) they were in the range 4-11%. For the experimental system, the corresponding errors were 2-3% and 3-4% respectively, i.e. with no significant improvement in going to alternative (2). All efforts should be directed to reduce the degree of rotational ambiguity by applying a full battery of chemically reasonable constraints. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The adulteration of herbal medicines by dexamethasone or prednisolone is regarded as a serious problem in many communities. Herein, a novel platform for the separation and quantification of both target steroids in herbal medicines based on electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (ePADs) has been created. The ePAD was composed of Whatman SG81 chromatography paper, 3D-printed devices and a commercial screen-printed electrode. Whatman SG81 silica-coated paper was used for the separation of dexamethasone and prednisolone based on the difference in their partition coefficients during the flow of the mobile phase. The optimal mobile phase was composed of 60% ethyl acetate in cyclohexane and required 7min for separation. The separated steroids on the paper were then quantified by electrochemical detection using differential pulse voltammetry, in which the 3D-printed devices facilitated the measurement. Analytical detection ranges of 10-500 mu g mL(-1) were obtained for both dexamethasone and prednisolone (r(2) =0.988 and 0.994, respectively). The limits of detection for dexamethasone and prednisolone were 3.59 and 11.98 mu g mL(-1), respectively, whereas the limits of quantification were 6.00 and 20.02 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The amounts of both target steroids derived from real herbal medicine samples determined by the proposed method were comparable to those obtained with assays using standard high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, a simple evaporation step can be used to increase the concentration of the samples before analysis. These ePADs are simple, low-cost, rapid, and very promising for on-site quantitative detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed and MON89788 of soybean transgenic gene sequence was detected based on a strategy of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and gold nanoparticle cube (AuNPC)-labeled multiple probes. First, the mercapto-modified capture DNA was immobilized on the surface of the Fe3O4@Au magnetic nanoparticles via an Au-S bond, and the capture DNA was opened and complementarily hybridized with the target DNA to form a double-stranded DNA. In the 10 x reaction buffer, Exonuclease III (ExoIII) specifically recognized and sheared the double-stranded DNA to release the target DNA, which led to the next round of reaction. Afterward, AuNP cube-loaded ssDNA (AuNPC/ DNA) was added with the rolling circle reaction with the help of Phi29 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase. Finally, [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) was attracted directly by the anionic phosphate of ssDNA via electrostatic interaction. The determination was carried out by using chronocoulometry (CC), and the CC signal was recorded. The mass amount of DNA strands extended infinitely on the AuNPs cube and numerous [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) were absorbed, thus the detected signal was highly amplified. The corresponding CC signal showed a good linear relationship with the logarithm of the target DNA concentration in the range of 1 x 10(-16) to 1 x 10(-7) mol L-1, with a detection limit of 4.5 x 10(-17) mol L-1. Specific gene sequence of MON89788 in soybean samples was determined, and the recoveries ranged from 97.3% to 102.0%. This sensor is one of the most sensitive sensors for genetic sequence assessment at present. Moreover, it demonstrates good selectivity, stability, and reproducibility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we report double-shelled yolk-shell Si@C structure as a high-performance electrochemical sensing material for heavy metal ions. A SiO2-assisted polybenzoxazine (PB) coating strategy is used to synthesize highly monodispersed Si@C microspheres. After thermal carbonization of PB layers and selective removal of the SiO2 layers, Si@C microspheres were prepared. The resultant Si@C microspheres exhibit uniform spherical morphology and clearly double-shelled yolk-shell structures. The obtained Si@C microspheres are employed to prepare the chemically modified electrode for the sensitive determination of Cd(II) and Pb(II). By the method of anodic stripping voltammetry, the Si@C-based electrode shows a very wide linear dynamic range for target ions (e.g., 0.5-400 mu g L-1 for Cd(II) and Pb(II)) and low limit of detections (e.g., 0.068 mu g L-1 for Cd(II) and for 0.105 m mu g L-1 Pb(II)). The remarkable results, such as excellent resistance to interference ions, good repeatability, and reproducibility were also obtained. Furthermore, compared with those Cd(II) and Pb(II) sensors known in the literature, the analytical performance of Si@C-based electrode is better. Finally, when further used to determine Cd(II) and Pb(II) in tap water and lake water, the results of fabricated electrode successfully achieve good consistency with the data obtained from inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

AB Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a standard biomarker to measure long-term average glucose concentration for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes. Various methods have been reported for measuring HbA1c, however, portable and precise determination is still challenging. Herein, a new highly sensitive electrochemical nanobiosensor is developed for the specific determination of HbA1c. A nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and gold with hierarchical architecture structure was electrochemically deposited on a cheap and flexible graphite sheet (GS) electrode. The nanocomposite increased the surface area, improved the electron transfer on the electrode surface and augmented the signal. It also provided a suitable substrate for linkage of thiolated DNA aptamer as a bioreceptor on the electrode surface by strong covalent bonding. The quantitative label free detection was carried out by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing redox probe Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-). The detection is based on insulating the surface in presence of HbA1c and decreasing the current, which is directly related to the HbA1c concentration. The nanobiosensor demonstrated high sensitivity of 269.2 mu A. cm(-2), wide linear range of 1 nM-13.83 mu M with a low detection limit of 1 nM. The biosensor was successfully used for measuring HbA1c in blood real sample. Furthermore, it is promising to use it as a part of a point of care device for low-invasive screening and management of diabetes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Potentiometric aptasensors enhanced by integrating advanced nanomaterials are of particular interest for the detection of multiplex species (e.g., proteins, bacteria, micro-organisms) due to their low cost, ease of operation, and low detection limits. However, potentiometric detection of small ionic species aptasensors is still challenging. This article describes the first example of a label-free G-quadruplex-based potentiometric aptasensing platform for the detection of Pb2+. Polyion oligonucleotide-labeled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-DNA) as probes are modified on Au electrode, providing high-density negative charge on the electrode surface. These signal-amplifying probes can selectively form G-quadruplexes with the presence of Pb2+ ions and reduce the negative charges on the electrode surface, hence achieving potentiometric detection of Pb2+ ions with high selectivity. The AuNPs-DNA-based aptasensor shows an acceptable sensitivity over a wide range from 10(-11) to 10(-6) M with a detection limit of 8.5 pM. Furthermore, confirmed by coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the sensing platform is capable of performing effective and accurate detection of Pb2+ level in real water samples. The presented aptasensor offers a fast, convenient, low-maintenance, and highly sensitive alternative for on-site water pollution detections. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multicomponent functionalized nano-material (Au@CP5@MoS2) is prepared by control assembly of Au nanoparticles on the surface of CP5@MoS2 for sensing and catalysis reduction of toxic explosives p-dinitrobenzene (p-DNB). Firstly, the Au nanoparticles are obtained by a green redox reaction between HAuCl4 and hydroxylatopillar[5]arene (HP5) in the presence of a small amount of hydroxide ion without any harsh reduced agent. The CP5@MoS2 is prepared by a rapidly supramolecule mediated hydrothermal route in the presence of aqueous solution of cationic pillar[5]arene (CP5). Therefore, we construct an electrochemical sensing platform for the high sensitive and selective determination of p-DNB based on the excellent supramolecular recognition of CP5/HP5 and the high catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles. Moreover, the p-DNB can be reduced into 1,4-diaminobenzene by NaBH4 in the presence of the prepared Au@CP5@MoS2, which can reduce the explosion dangerousness of p-DNB to some extent. This strategy might present a prospective value in sensing and reducing toxic explosives. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been widely used in analysis of trace organic contaminants in environmental samples. Stable, efficient, and selective fiber coating is the key to the development of SPME technique. In this study, an in situ fabricated porous carbon coating that derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) was introduced for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The carbon coating (denoted as MOF-74-C) was prepared by the direct carbonization of a MOF-74 coating that was in situ grown on stainless steel wire, which was explored for the extraction of odorous organic contaminants for the first time. MOF-74-C coated fiber showed high extraction efficiency (1.1-16.0 times larger than commercial fibers for most tested analytes under the same extraction conditions), as well as good thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, it can selectively extract the analytes with the simultaneous exclusion of coexisting dissolved organic matter due to the molecular sieve effect invoked by the well-defined micropores. The method based on MOF-74-C coating for analysis of odorants afforded wide linear ranges (more than two orders of magnitude), low detection limits (below the odor threshold concentrations), good intra-and inter-day accuracies (90.1-107.3%) and precisions (relative standard deviations/RSDs below 9.4%) and satisfactory reproducibility (RSDs below 8.7%). Finally, the MOF-74-C coated fiber was successfully applied for the SPME analysis of odorants in real water samples. These results highlight the great potential of in situ fabricated porous carbons derived from MOFs for SPME applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on a one-step combustion fabrication approach, a novel magnetic porous carbon (MPC) was fabricated using filter paper as porous carbon source and iron salts as magnetic precursors. The textural properties of the MPC were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) and nitrogen absorption-desorption isotherms. The as-prepared MPC possessed a high specific surface area, a microstructure comprised of mesopores and strong magnetic response. It was employed as a magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) adsorbent for the determination of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in environmental water and biological samples coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The main parameters affecting extraction efficiency were investigated in detail and a satisfactory performance was obtained under the optimal conditions. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranging from 1 to 1200 mu g L-1 for ketoprofen (KET) and 2-1200 mu g L-1 for naproxen (NAP) and diclofenac (DCF) with determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.9995 and 0.9997. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.2-0.4 mu g L-1. The intra-and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 4.03% and 8.72%, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 84.67% to 113.73% with RSDs less than 7.76%. The satisfactory results confirmed the great potential of the novel MPC adsorbent for the extraction of NSAIDs from complex sample matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mixed hemimicelle SDS-coated magnetic chitosan nanoparticles (MHMS-MCNPs) were utilized as an efficacious adsorbent for both removal and preconcentration of pesticides named diazinon, phosalone and chlorpyrifos. In this method, the formation of mixed hemimicelles made up of SDS on the surface of MCNPs leads to solubilization and the retention of target analytes by strong hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which has been realized for the first time in magnetic chitosan nanoparticles support. Different parameters affecting the adsorption of pesticides were optimized as rFemoval efficiency by response surface methodology and one variable at a time. Under the optimum condition, adsorption equilibrium data were fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm. Extraction recoveries for 5 ngmL(-1) of diazinon, phosalone and chlorpyrifos were 99%, 98% and 96%, respectively; with relative standard deviations values were lower than 4.6% for five replications of extraction. Limit of detection obtained for mentioned pesticides were <0.09 ngmL(-1). Eventually, MHMS-MCNPs were successfully applied for both removal and trace determination of pesticides in surface and ground environmental and waste water samples collected from various places in northern Iran.

AB A series of polymers and metal ions have been observed to be useful in triggering aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and AIE enhancement (AIEE) of thiolated gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). However, peptide-induced AIEE of thiolated AuNCs and their applications in biosensors have rarely been investigated. In this study, we showed that positively charged peptides induced efficient AIEE of negatively charged glutathione-capped AuNCs (GSH-AuNCs) through electrostatic attraction. In contrast to GSH-AuNCs, polyarginine (polyArg), a cationic peptide, stimulated the AIEE of the GSH-AuNCs, resulting in a 3.5fold luminescence enhancement, 10-fold enhancement in quantum yield, 8-nm blueshift in the luminescence maximum, and a 2.1-fold increase in the mean luminescence lifetime. Four different AIEE-based biosensors with excellent selectivity and acceptable sensitivity were fabricated using cationic peptides as an AIEE-active trigger and as a biorecognition element. A heparin biosensor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 nM was constructed by combining AG73 peptide-mediated AIEE of the GSH-AuNCs and the specific interaction of AG73 peptides with heparin macromolecules. The concentration of human trypsin was selectively detected at a concentration as low as 1 nM using an arginine-glycine repeat peptide as an enzymatic substrate and as an AIEE-active trigger. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-catalyzed dephosphorylation of phosphopeptides paired with the corresponding product-mediated AIEE of the GSH-AuNCs was used for ALP sensing with an LOD of 0.3 U L-1. A peptide consisting of a cyclic RGD unit and an AIEE-active unit was designed to synthesize RGD-modified GSH-AuNC aggregates that can target alpha v beta 3 integrin receptors. These AIEE-based sensors were practically applied for the quantitative determination of heparin in human plasma, trypsin in human urine, and ALP in human plasma as well as for luminescent imaging of alpha v beta 3 integrin-overexpressing HeLa cells.

AB Herein, an array-based in situ fluorescence assay is proposed for high-throughput analysis and localization of multiplex matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities in cell monolayers and tissue sections. Five specific MMPs (MMP-2, -3, -7, -9, and -14) peptide substrates containing FAM/Dabcyl fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair are directly spotted on the surface of cell monolayers or tissue sections, and hydrolyzed by localized MMPs, resulting in fluorescence recovery of FAM. MMPs activities are determined by the fluorescence intensity of stained cells/tissues due to the cellular internalization of peptide fragments with FAM moiety. We demonstrate that the array-based in situ fluorescence assay is suitable for identifying the MMPs expression patterns of cells, as well as determining the secreted MMPs activities in cell monolayer with high sensitivity (as low as hundreds of cells per square centimeter). The feasibility of the assay is further confirmed by evaluating inhibition potencies of six compounds toward five MMPs. Profiling of five MMPs activities in the localized parts of 32 thyroid tissues is performed without separation or extraction procedures, demonstrating the good practicality of the method.

AB In this work, CaF2 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a simple direct precipitation method and firstly used as a peroxidase mimics for rapid and high sensitive colorimetric detection of aldosterone. The CaF2 nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The CaF2 nanoparticles can oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce a blue product oxidized TMB (oxTMB) in the presence of H2O2 and this peroxidase-like activity of CaF2 is found out to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Experiments showed that the catalytic mechanism of CaF2 nanoparticles was attributed to that it could result in the decomposition of H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). The absorbance change value of the reaction system was linear with the aldosterone concentration in the range of 2.0-40.0 nM, and the detection limit was 0.6 nM. Moreover, the developed method was applied to detect aldosterone in human serum samples. It provides a new platform for enzyme functional simulation and analytical sensing research.

AB We synthesized three kinds of nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon nanomaterials (represented by N-mC) through a cost-effective method, that is, pyrolysis of plant biomasses (grass, flower, and peanut shells). We further explored their potential as sensitive bioplatforms for electrochemical label-free aptasensors to facilitate the early detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Chemical structure characterizations revealed that rich functional groups coexisted in as-synthesized N-mC nanomaterials, such as C-C, C-O, C=O, C-N, and COOH. Among the three kinds of N-mC nanomaterials, the one derived from grass (N-mC(g)) exhibited the lowest carbon defect degree, the highest I-D/I-G ratio in the Raman spectra, and the largest specific surface area (186.2 m(2) g(-1)). Consequently, N-mC(g) displayed excellent electrochemical activity and strong affinity toward aptamer strands, further endowing the corresponding aptasensor with sensitive detection ability for AFP. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to investigate the whole detection procedure for AFP. The EIS and DPV results showed that the fabricated N-mC(g)-based aptasensor possessed an extremely low limit of detection of 60.8 and 61.8 fg.mL(-1) (s/n = 3), respectively, for detecting AFP within a wide linear range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1). Moreover, the aptasensor displayed acceptable selectivity and applicability, high reproducibility, and excellent stability in serum samples of cancer patients. Therefore, the proposed cost-effective and label-free strategy based on the nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon derived from plant biomass is a promising approach for the early detection of various tumor markers.

AB Hypochlorous acid (HOCl)/hypochlorite (OCl-), important reactive oxygen species, play essential roles in many physiological and pathological progresses. Accordingly, we developed a novel dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (DCM)-based probe DCM-OCl for colorimetric and near-infrared fluorescent turn-on detection of OCl-. The probe exhibited excellent selectivity and sensitivity for OCl- over other bio-related analytes with a detection limit of 80 nM. The excellent selectivity of DCM-OCl for OCl- was ascribed to specific oxidative cleavage of the dimethylthiocarbamate (DMTC) recognition unit by OCl-. Moreover, DCM-OCl exhibited an ultrafast turn-on response (< 3 s) to OCl-, potentially allowing real-time detection of OCl-. Furthermore, DCM-OCl was successfully used to image endogenous/exogenous OCl- in living cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mycotoxins and pesticides are prevalent in cereal food. It is difficult to detect these two kinds of hazard factors simultaneously in rapid assay. In order to find a solution to the problem, carbamates and aflatoxins were selected in this study to establish a rapid, on-site, and quantitative paper sensor. Two novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against carbaryl and carbofuran (1D2 and G11) were developed. The IC50 values (half maximal inhibitory concentration) were 0.8 ng/mL and 217.6 ng/mL for carbaryl and carbofuran, respectively. Based on the sensitive and specific mAbs, a multi-TRFICA (time-resolved fluorescence) paper sensor was developed, which simultaneously detected six types of hazardous chemicals, including AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), AFG(2), carbaryl, and carbofuran. A universal sample pretreatment method for mycotoxins and pesticides was explored to apply on established competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and multi-TRFICA-paper sensor. The established paper sensor can be easily observed with naked eyes, qualitatively under a UV lamp, and quantitated using a home-made device. It exhibited a calculated limit of quantity for AFTs, carbaryl, and carbofuran of 0.03, 0.02, and 60.2 ng/mL in corn samples, respectively. The spiking-recoveries and real sample studies proved that multi-TRFICA-paper sensor is an accurate, sensitive, and high throughput detection method for simple and low-cost analysis in corn samples.

AB Herein, we report a new signal amplification scheme for quantitative biochemical analysis based on gold nanoparticle (GNPs) catalyzed polymerization of transparent silane solution to milky white and turbid siloxane. Using immunoassay as a proof of concept, GNP labeled immunoprobe was used to bind captured antigen and catalyse the polymerization reaction allowing sensitive biochemical investigation. The polymerization reaction was optimized for standard 96 well polystyrene microtiter plates and we discovered that sodium lactate acts as an enhancer in the polymerization reaction as it reduces detection time to merely 30 min. The sensing strategy was applied to detection and quantification of Salmonella Typhimurium in water and egg samples and the platform showed excellent visibly quantifiable analytical response up to 100 cells mL(-1). Furthermore, clinical utility and potential of the method was validated by detecting Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi antigen) responsible for typhoidal Salmonellosis in human serum in sandwich format with a detection limit of 1 ngmL(-1). The method serves as the first report towards nanoparticle triggered polymerization for development of rapid and low cost quantitative biochemical assay. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here, we designed and synthesized two fluorescent probes for detecting phosgene by nucleophilic substitution reaction using BODIPY as a fluorophore and 2-aminobenzylamine as reactive functional group. For the first time, we have studied the similarities and differences between asymmetric monosubstituted (1) and symmetric disubstituted (2) probes. A monosubstituted probe 1 (having a 2-aminobenzylamine group at the 3-position of BODIPY) has fluorescence-enhancing (weak green fluorescence to strong green fluorescence) responce to phosgene in 30 s with a large Stokes shift (similar to 70 nm) and sensitive property (DL = 0.81 nM); while the disubstituted probe 2 (having two 2-aminobenzylamine groups at the 3, 5-position of BODIPY) has a ratiometric fluorescent responce to phosgene in 2 min. The linear range of the response is wider than that of the monosubstitution probe 1, and the detection limit is also lower (2.36 nM). In addition, probes 1 and 2 can effectively eliminate the interference of other substances with similar chemical structure as phosgene. They can not only detect phosgene in solution environment, but also in gaseous environment quickly and sensitively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intracellular microRNA (miRNA) analysis in single cell is highly informative and offers valuable insights to its physiological and pathological state, but it must confront the pivotal challenge of gene probe delivery and conditional release. Herein, we report an assembled DNA mini-hexahedron (DMH) that can selectively package and protect miRNA probe, target-cell-specific delivery and release it based on the target sequence recognition for intracellular miRNA detection. In brief, the DMH is self-assembled from six single-stranded oligonucleotide strands through rational design, one of which containing AS1411 sequence for specific uptake. Two fluorescent dye labeled recognition strands are inserted into two DMH edges with quencher groups through partially complementary hybridization. We find that this DMH possesses great biocompatibility, good trans-membrane ability and are able to protect the gene cargo against enzymatic degradation and protein binding. Fluorescence restoration caused by the target-mediated competitive chain replacement reaction allows to simultaneous detection of two cancer-related intracellular miRNAs with little false-positive signal, providing a powerful tool to discriminate healthy normal cell and cancerous cell. Thus, the construct opens a new avenue to circumvent the challenges in gene delivery, specific delivery and intrinsic interferences resistance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Early detection of toxic proteases in food matrices plays a major role in preventing the occurrence of diseases as well as outbreaks. However, on-site detection of proteases, for instance, botulinum, anthrax and cholera in food matrices remains challenging due to their extremely low lethal dose levels. Here, we report a lateral flow assay (LFA) in a dipstick format for on-site visual detection of proteases in food matrices. The light chain of BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A LC) is used as a model system for validation of the proposed assay using magnetic beads conjugated to a synthetic peptide that provide a specific cleavage site for BoNT/A LC. Magnetic beads serve as both reporters for visual detection and as facilitators for sample clean-up, owing to the efficient magnetic separation protocol adopted. Digestion of the peptide substrate by BoNT/A LC for 5 h followed by the dipstick assay yields a reduction in color intensity of the test line on the dipstick compared to the control line obtained using an un-cleaved peptide substrate. Concentration dependent responses for the assay in carrot juice were obtained with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 nM/2.5 nM (with/without amplification), also supported by RGB (DE) analysis, indicating the potential of the proposed methodology for on-site assaying of proteases in food matrices. Unlike typical affinity-based assays that yield a collective response for the active and inactive forms of the proteases, the proposed functional LFA targets only the active form, thereby enabling a more precise analysis for preventing potential false-positives. The proposed approach could be extended for detection of BoNT serotypes and other proteases in food matrices, upon utilizing appropriate substrates with specific cleavage sites.

AB Silica-based lectin microcolumns were developed and optimized for the separation and analysis of glycoform fractions in alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) based on both the degree of branching and level of fucosylation. Concanavalin A (Con A) and Aleuria Aurantia lectin (AAL) were immobilized onto HPLCgrade silica by reductive amination and packed into 2.1mm i.d. x 5.0 cm microcolumns. Factors examined for these microcolumns include their protein content, binding capacity, binding strength and bandbroadening under isocratic conditions (Con A) or step elution conditions (AAL) and in the presence of various flow rates or temperatures. These factors were examined by using experiments based on frontal analysis, zonal elution, peak profiling and peak decay analysis. Up to 200 mu g AGP could be loaded onto a Con A microcolumn and provide linear elution conditions, and 100 mu g AGP could be applied to an AAL microcolumn. The final conditions for separating retained and non-retained AGP glycoform fractions on a Con A microcolumn used a flow rate of 50 mu L min(-1) and a temperature of 50 degrees C, which gave a separation of these fractions within 20 min or less. The final conditions for an AAL microcolumn included a flow rate of 0.75 mL min(-1), a temperature of 50 degrees C, and the use of 2.0 mM L-fucose as a competing agent for elution, giving a separation of non-retained and retained AGP glycoforms in 6 min or less. The inter-day precisions were +/- 0.7-4.0% or less for the retention times of the AGP glycoforms and +/- 2.2-3.0% or less for their peak areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of the ionization in the RP-HPLC retention of 66 acid-base compounds, most of them drugs of pharmaceutical interest, is studied. The retention time of the compounds can be related to the pH measured in the mobile phase ((s)(w)pH) through the sigmoidal equations derived from distribution of the neutral and ionic forms of the drug into the stationary and mobile phases. Fitting of the obtained retention vs. pH profiles provides the retention times of the ionic and neutral forms and the pK(a) values of the drugs in the mobile phase ((s)(w)pK(a)).
   The obtained (s)(w)pK(a) values are linearly correlated to the pK(a) values in water ((w)(w)pKa) with two different correlations, one for neutral acids and another for neutral bases that reflect the different influence of the dielectric constant of the medium in ionization of acids and bases. The retention of the neutral species is well correlated to the octanol-water partition coefficient of the drugs as measure of the lipophilicity of the drug, which affects chromatographic retention. Also, the retention time of the ionized forms is related to the retention time of the neutral forms by two different linear correlations, one for anions and the other for cations. These last correlations point out the different retention behaviour of anions and cations: anions are less retained than cations of the same lipophilicity, as measured by the octanol-water partition coefficient of the neutral form.
   The different retention behaviour of anionic, cationic and neutral forms is confirmed by the hold-up times obtained from different approaches: pycnometry and retention times of anionic (KBr and KI) and neutral (DMSO) markers. Hold-up times obtained by pycnometric measurements agree with those obtained by retention of neutral markers (0.83-0.85 min), whereas hold-up time for anions is mobile phase pH dependent. At acidic pH it is similar to the hold-up time for neutral markers (0.83 min), but then it decreases with the increase of mobile phase pH to 0.65 min at pH 11. The decrease can be explained by the ionization of the silanols of the column and exclusion of anions by charge repulsion. Although not directly measured, the obtained retention data and correlations indicate hold-up time for cations are similar or slightly lower than hold-up time for neutral compounds (0.77-0.83 min).
   The model proposed and the correlations obtained can be very useful for its implementation in retention prediction algorithms for optimization of separation purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present paper, we demonstrated that Cinchona alkaloid cyclohexyl sulfonic acid-based zwitterionic chiral selectors (SOs) and the respective chiral stationary phases (CSPs) can be successfully employed for the enantioseparation of underivatized thus zwitterionic amino acids (the selectands, SAs) even in the absence of ionic additives in the eluent, generally used as displacer counter-ions in ion exchange chromatography. Therefore, we provided evidence that cooperative "intramolecular and intermolecular counter-ion effects" of the zwitterionic SO moiety and the zwitterionic SAs can be sufficient to modulate alone the retention characteristics without a loss of stereoselectivity. Four fully constrained beta-amino acids were used as target compounds for this study.
   The analyses were carried out with either neat methanol, acetonitrile, water or their binary hydroorganic mixtures. A U-shaped retention profile was observed both with methanol-and acetonitrilebased eluents.
   Except a few cases, enantioselectivity experienced a remarkable amelioration at the "balanced region" of a buffer free hydroorganic mobile phase composition. At "the bottom" of the U-shaped curve, high alpha-and resolution values could be reached with most of the screened mobile phases. An electrostatically driven "attraction-repulsion model" was postulated to explain the very favourable characteristic of the two studied zwitterion-type CSPs for the retention and enantiomer separation of zwitterionic analytes.

AB Determination of the retention factor of ionized compounds in microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography requires two mobility measurements at the same pH: one in the presence of the microemulsion and another in plain buffer. However, it has been observed that in some cases subtracting one mobility from another determined in a different medium leads to negative retention factors, which makes no sense from a chemical point of view. This indicates that there is some error in the process which has a direct impact when retention factors are used for further applications.
   Here, we evaluate how the components of the microemulsion confer different properties to the buffer medium, particularly varying the viscosity parameter (which is inversely related to mobility). Whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate, the surfactant used in the microemulsion, has little effect on the medium viscosity (only an increase of 5% e6%), the presence of 1-butanol, used as a stabilizer, increases it by around 30%. Meanwhile, heptane, which is used as an oil, provokes a slight decrease. Consequently, the mobilities obtained in the microemulsion system are shifted to higher values (less negative mobilities) compared to mobilities obtained in the aqueous buffer, and so one cannot be directly subtracted from the other. Since the microemulsion- buffer medium cannot be directly reproduced, we propose a correction that takes into account the variation of viscosities. This is determined from the electrophoretic mobility of the benzoate ion. As this ion does not interact with the microemulsion, the ratio of its mobilities (measured in plain buffer and microemulsion) is equivalent to the ratio of viscosities, and can be used as the correction factor for other measurements. Thus, mobilities in buffer and microemulsion media are placed on the same scale, overcoming the errors in retention factor determination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB UV photoionization (UV-PI) is a promising non-radioactive ionization method for ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). It could work at either direct photoionization mode or chemical ionization mode by adding photoionizable dopants, and thus its applications extend to a wide range of compound classes. This work is to present a comprehensive review on the development of UV-PI-IMS. It focuses on UV-PI's capabilities and how to use them fully. A summary discussion of the ionization processes in UV-PI would be presented first for understanding the fundamentals of UV-PI-IMS. Followed by descriptions of the technical configurations of UV-PI source in IMS. Improvements in the design of UV-PI source for achieving optimum results will be presented with references to examples. Further, a broad range of applications, including environmental contaminants analysis, trace explosives and chemical warfare agents detection, food safety and quality analysis, and clinical diagnosis, would be presented to demonstrated the analytical performance of UV-PI-IMS. In the conclusion, perspectives on areas of UV-PI technique which have the potential to be improved would be reasonably presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electronic nose (enose, EN) and electronic tongue (etongue, ET) have been designed to simulate human senses of smell and taste in the best possible way. The signals acquired from a sensor array, combined with suitable data analysis system, are the basis for holistic analysis of samples. The efficiency of these instruments, regarding classification, discrimination, detection, monitoring and analytics of samples in different types of matrices, is utilized in many fields of science and industry, offering numerous practical applications. Popularity of both types of devices significantly increased during the last decade, mainly due to improvement of their sensitivity and selectivity. The electronic senses have been employed in pharmaceutical sciences for, among others, formulation development and quality assurance. This paper contains a review of some particular applications of EN and ET based instruments in pharmaceutical industry. In addition, development prospects and a critical summary of the state of art in the field were also surveyed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review summarizes progress in electroanalysis of organic compounds and biomacromolecules by means of bare BDD-based electrodes for the period of 2009-2018. New trends, which have emerged in the reported decade and which have improved their performance in batch voltammetric and amperometric methods and electrochemical detection in liquid flow techniques are commented. Importance of BDD surface termination, effect of boron doping level, and utilization of adsorption of analytes on BDD surfaces enabling development of adsorptive voltammetric techniques are addressed. Further, possibilities of simultaneous determination of analytes by means of voltammetric techniques utilizing computational approaches and multiple-pulse amperometric detection are discussed. Strategies leading to enhancement of sensitivity such as nanostructuring of the BDD surface, fabrication of BDD-based composite materials or new approaches in construction of microelectrodes and microelectrode arrays for biosensing represent another area of interest. Attention is paid to possibilities in detection of amino acids, peptides and proteins, nucleobases, nucleos(t) ides and DNA/RNA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The determination of endogenous substances is of great significance for obtaining important biotic information such as biological components, metabolic pathways and disease biomarkers in different living organisms (e.g. plants, insects, animals and humans). However, due to the complex matrix and the trace concentrations of target analytes, the sample preparation procedure is an essential step before the analytes of interest are introduced into a detection instrument. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME), an emerging sample preparation technique that integrates sampling, extraction, concentration, and sample introduction into one step, has gained wide acceptance in various research fields, including in the determination of endogenous compounds. In this review, recent developments and applications of SPME for the determination of endogenous substances over the past five years are summarized. Several aspects, including the design of SPME devices (sampling configuration and coating), applications (in vitro and in vivo sampling), and coupling with emerging instruments (comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)) are involved. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of SPME methods in endogenous substances analysis are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The most challenging part in performing a single cell ICP-MS (sc-ICP-MS) approach is the sample preparation, in particular the reduction of the ionic background. This step is, in many cases, time-consuming and required for each sample separately. Furthermore, sc-ICP-MS measurements are mostly carried out "manually", given the fact that present systems are not allowing for an automated change of samples. Thus, within this work, we developed an approach based on a HPLC system coupled on-line with sc-ICP-MS via a set of switching valves as well as an in-line filter for automated cell washing. This set-up enables the ionic background removal as well as analysis of single cells completely automated without any manual sample pretreatment. Our approach was applied for the analysis of the single celled diatom species Cyclotella meneghiniana, a marine diatom species, on the basis of Mg-24 and facilitates testing in 11 min per sample, requiring only around 10,000 cells in a volume of 10 mu L and approx. 10 mL of a 5% MeOH/95% deionized water (v/v) mixture. Even at extremely saline culturing media concentrations (up to 1000 mg L-1 magnesium) our on-line approach worked sufficiently allowing for distinction of ionic and particulate fractions. Furthermore, a set of diatom samples was analyzed completely automated without the need for changing samples manually. So, utilizing this approach enables analyzing a high quantity of samples in a short time and therefore in future the investigation of ecotoxicological effects is simplified for example in terms of metal accumulation by taking biovariability into account.

AB In this work, the effects of using collision/reaction cell (CRC) technology in quadrupole-based ICP-MS (ICP-QMS) instrumentation operated in single-particle (SP) mode have been assessed. The influence of (i) various CRC gases, (ii) gas flow rates, (iii) nanoparticle (NP) sizes and (iv) NP types was evaluated using Ag, Au and Pt NPs with both a traditional ICP-QMS instrument and a tandem ICP-mass spectrometer. It has been shown that using CRC technology brings about a significant increase in the NP signal peak width (from 0.5 up to 6 ms). This effect is more prominent for a heavier gas (e.g., NH3) than for a lighter one (e.g., H-2 or He). At a higher gas flow rate and/or for larger particle sizes > 100 nm), the NP signal duration was prolonged to a larger extent. This effect of using CRC technology has been further demonstrated by characterizing custom-made 50 and 200 nm Fe3O4 NPs (originally strongly affected by the occurrence of spectral overlap) using different CRC approaches (H-2 on-mass and NH3 mass-shift). The use of NH3 (monitoring of Fe as the Fe(NH3)(2)(+) reaction product ion at m/z = 90 amu) induces a significant peak broadening compared to that observed when using H-2 (6.10 +/- 1.60 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.49 ms). This extension of transit time can most likely be attributed to the collisions/interactions of the ion cloud generated by a single NP event with the CRC gas and it even precludes 50 nm Fe3O4 NPs to be detected when using the NH3 mass-shift approach. Based on these results, the influence of a longer peak width on the accuracy of SP-ICP-MS measurement data (NP size, particle number density and mass concentration) must be taken into account when using CRC technology as a means to overcome spectral overlap. To mitigate the potential detrimental effect of using CRC technology in the characterization of NPs via SP-ICP-MS(/MS), the use of light gases and low gas flow rates is recommended.

AB A novel method for the determination of ultratrace Pb in seawater by solution-cathode glow discharge atomic emission spectrometry (SCGD-AES) coupled with hydride generation (HG) has been developed. In the SCGD process, the hollow Ti tube, which can introduce gas instead of a solid tungsten rod is used as a discharge anode and combined with hydride generator. HG technology can not only separate Pb from a seawater matrix and reduce the matrix interference on detection, but can also significantly improve the transfer and atomization efficiencies for SCGD-AES. The optimum working conditions for HG and SCGD-AES for quantitative analysis of Pb were determined as 1% H2C2O4 as the masking agent and addition of 3% formic acid to increase Pb volatilization. The limit of detection (LOD) for Pb was decreased by two orders of magnitude in comparison to the SCGD-AES process alone. Under optimal conditions, the LOD for Pb was 0.17 mu g L-1, and the relative standard deviation was 2.1% (n = 11) for 100 mu g L-1 Pb in artificial seawater. The proposed quantification method was verified using a seawater reference material (BWQ7001-2016), and the obtained results agreed well with certified values. Finally, the approach was used to quantitatively analyse Pb in seawater, and the results agreed well with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The recoveries of standard addition were between 96.0% and 103.0%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Using spatial information for evaluating the quality of prediction maps

SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA

DT Article

ID REGRESSION; VARIABILITY; DESIGN
AB Applying a calibration model onto hyperspectral (HS) images is of great interest because it produces images of chemical or physical properties. HS imaging is widely used in this way in food processing industries for monitoring product quality and process control. In this context, one of the main difficulties in the application of regression models to HS images is to evaluate the error of the obtained predictions, since in a proximal imaging set up, the size of the pixels is usually much smaller than the area required to obtain a wet chemical reference. Moreover, the selection of regression model parameters, such as the number of latent variables (LV) in a partial least squares (PLS) model, can modify the appearance of the prediction maps. The objective of this work is to propose an approach based on geostatistical indices to use spatial information of prediction maps for supporting the evaluation of regression models applied to HS images. This work stablishes a theoretical connection between linear regression model performance estimates and the spatial decomposition of variance in prediction maps, when the ground truth to estimate is spatially structured. This approach was tested in a simulated dataset and two real case studies. Geostatistical indices of the prediction maps were compared to model performance metrics for PLS models with increasing number of LV. The theoretical framework was proven by the results on the simulated dataset. In particular, the evolution of the nugget effect, C0; corresponded with the evolution of the random error of the model. Conversely, the error term of the model related with the slope of the model corresponded with the evolution of the structured variance observed in the prediction maps. On the real case studies, geostatistical indexes, extracted from the prediction maps, allowed to quantitatively evaluate the spatial structure of the estimations and complement the Root Mean Standard Error of Cross Validation (RMSECV) for the choice of optimal number of LV to consider in the model.
   The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require ground truth values. It could be used as a source of information for supporting the choice of optimum calibration parameters, such as the number of latent variables, or the choice of pre-treatments, complementing the traditional visual inspection of prediction maps with quantitative and objective metrics.

AB A comparative study was made by using two matrices (Linear poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (GMA) polymer (LP(GMA)) and carbon black-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-LP(GMA) composite CLP(GMA)) as immobilization platforms for anti-IL 1 alpha antibody on the development of impedimetric immunosensor for IL 1 alpha biomarker determination. These materials were spin coated onto the clean ITO electrode surface separately and used for IL 1 alpha immunosensor fabrication. Carbon black is utilized as a conductive material and has been employed over the last few decades for electrochemical biosensors development. The using of CLP(GMA) composite as an interface material shows fast electron transfer, when compared to LP(GMA) modified ITO electrode. This comparative study investigated the efficacy of carbon black for impedimetric biosensing. Anti-IL 1 alpha antibodies were utilized as bioreceptors and bound to epoxy groups of GMA polymer. For electrochemical characterizations, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry and Single Frequency Impedance methods were employed. Furthermore, to follow the antibody attachment on the modified ITO substrates, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Raman spectral techniques were utilized. The morphological characterizations of immunosensor construction stages were carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy analyses. The sensitive and label-free technique of EIS was used for quantification of IL 1 alpha concentration. Under optimum experimental conditions, the immunosensor had a good linear relationship between impedance values and the IL 1 alpha concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 2 pg/mL and from 0.01 to 3 pg/mL for LP(GMA) and CLP(GMA) modified ITO electrodes, respectively. The results confirmed that CLP(GMA) used in the preparation of the immunosensor illustrated improvements in immunosensor performance, comparing to the LP(GMA) modified immunosensor. Additionally, the immunosensor was successfully applied to evaluate human serum and saliva samples. The obtained results from these samples illustrated the feasibility of the immunosensor for clinical diagnosis in complex biological samples. Also, a simple and low-cost approach was attempted for development of immunosensor with remarkable performance characteristics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In cancer diagnostics, specific analysis of blood-circulating proteins biomarkers of cancer is often complicated both by their inherently low concentrations and by strong interference from serum/blood proteins. Here, we report a simple and robust electrochemical cellulase-linked sandwich assay on magnetic beads (MBs) for fM-sensitive analysis of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor-2 HER-2/neu protein that is over-expressed in most aggressive breast cancers. In the assay, a sandwich is assembled by capturing HER-2/neu on either antibody (Ab) or aptamer-modified MBs accompanied by reaction with the second Ab or aptamer labelled with cellulase. On application of the sandwiches assembled on MBs onto a cost-effective graphite electrode modified with an insulating nitrocellulose film, the cellulase label digests the film. This results in the pronounced changes in the electrical properties of the modified electrodes. The chronocoulometrically-measured extent of the produced changes was proportional to the 10(-15)-10(-10)M HER-2/neu in the analyzed samples, and down to 1 fM of HER-2/neu could be detected in human serum samples in an overall less than 3 h assay. The developed simple and electrochemically label-free methodology is general and can be easily adapted for testing of any other protein. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we demonstrate the potentiostatic electrodeposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to develop a nanocomposite-modified electrode that separates three coexisting biofluids - ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA) - in a 0.1M Phosphate buffer solution at a physiological pH (7.4). The texture, physicochemical properties, and electrochemical behavior of the PEDOT-RGO were explored using UV-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopic techniques, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A PEDOT-RGO/GCE was evaluated with respect to a bare GCE, RGO/GCE, and PEDOT/GCE for the simultaneous sensing of AA, DA, and UA. The difference in voltammetric peak potentials was about 180 mV between AA and DA and 120 mV between DA and UA. The differential pulse voltammetric sensor provided a linear calibration for a wide concentration range (0.1-907 mu M for AA, 0.1-901 mu M for DA, and 0.1-701 mu M for UA) with detection limits of 1.5 mu M, 0.6 mu M, and 0.2 mu M for AA, DA, and UA, respectively. The developed sensor was validated by the detection of AA, DA, and UA in a vitamin C tablet, a dopamine hydrochloride injection, and human serum samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here, a label-free fluorescent sensor was developed for detection Fe (III) by utilizing the quenching effect of Fe (III) on the fluorescence of the hydroxyl functionalized metal-organic framework MIL-53(Fe)-(OH)(2), which was synthesized by using a one-step solvothermal method. The specific binding interaction between Fe (III) and hydroxyl facilitated the absorption of free Fe (III) to MIL-53(Fe)-(OH)(2), which leads to rapid fluorescent intensity quenching effect. The potential quenching mechanism was proved to be the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) from electron-rich ligands of MIL-53(Fe)-(OH)(2) to the half-filled 3d orbitals of free Fe (III) in the sample solution. For in-field applications, the fluorescence signal was detected rapidly by using a homemade 3D-printed, portable, and low-cost smartphone sensor. A commercial 365 nm UV LED light was adopted as the excitation light source, while the camera in a smartphone was utilized as the optical detector. The fluorescent signals obtained by using the smartphone sensor were in a good agreement with those obtained from a commercial microplate reader. Under the optimal assay conditions, the linear detection range of Fe (III) was 5.0-200 mu M, and the limit of detection is 1.7 mu M. This result is compatible with the commercial microplate reader. The developed method was successfully adopted to detect Fe (III) in human serum and environmental water samples with acceptable recovery values of 90-108.5%. The portable, low-cost, fast-response, user-friendly and sensitive fluorescent protocol based on a self-quenching fluorescent nanoprobe can be conducted at home or anywhere else without sophisticated instruments, showing a great application potential in clinical diagnosis, on-site environmental monitoring and healthcare at home.

AB Nitrite is a naturally occurring species present in various food samples and also present in our bodies as a product of nitric oxide (NO) oxidation. Considering the ubiquity of nitrite, its determination is of great importance in both biological and food samples. Herein, a very facile indirect method of nitrite determination in meat samples via selective reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is presented. The resulting gaseous product is quantified via portable and cost-effective electrochemical sensors. Both a novel laboratory prepared Pt-Nafion based NO sensor and a commercially available amperometric NO sensor are compared. Excellent correlations between the nitrite amount found in tested samples using both of the electrochemical sensors and a reference chemiluminescence method are demonstrated (r = 0.997 and r = 0.999 for Pt-Nafion based and commercially available NO-B4 electrochemical sensors, respectively, n = 12). Moreover, the slope of the linear regression curves are very close to unity for the comparison of the three systems tested. The amperometric sensors compared within this work exhibit good precision and accuracy and are shown to be an attractive alternative to the costly chemiluminescence detection method for accurately determining nitrite levels in food samples.

AB With the rapid development of immunometabolism, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is being promoted as a key immunometabolite to regulate the immune system. Based on the well-established crosstalk between 2-HG and other immunometabolites, here we firstly constructed a 2-HG metabolic panel by mapping the related metabolic pathways. Quantitative methods to globally monitor 2-HG metabolic panel are of great importance for immunometabolism study. However, the existence of enantiomer hampers the accurate measurement of these immunometabolites. This study addressed an original isotopically-paired chiral derivatization approach for UPLC-MS/MS quantification of 2-HG metabolic panel. To achieve better chromatographic separation, N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-L-phenylalanyl chloride (TSPC) was utilized as an optical resolving reagent to form diastereomers. For accurate quantitation, an O-18(2)-labeled-TSPC reagent was designed and readily synthesized to produce one-to-one internal standards. The developed approach enabled an accurate quantification of 13 immunometabolites in 2-HG metabolic panel with good linearity (R-2 > 0.99) and high sensitivity (0.5-120 fmol for LLOQ). With this method, we were able to simultaneously monitor the specific alterations of 2-HG metabolic panel in collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) rats. The measured levels of this panel ranged from 0.02 to 85.14 mg g(-1) for synovium tissue and 0.012 to 87.75 mu mol L-1 for serum samples. We envisage that the present isotopically-paired chiral derivatization approach will be practicable for different bio-samples to quantitatively profile the amino-and hydroxyl acids submetabolome, especially for the endogenous enantiomers. By virtue of the low cost of reagents and the simple procedure used in the assay, this method could be readily implemented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatially resolved metabolomics is an excellent tool for elucidating in situ molecular events, but its use remains challenging due to the complexity of the endogenous metabolites in bio-tissue and tissue heterogeneity. In this study, a data processing pipeline for spatially resolved metabolomics analysis of tumor microregion heterogeneity was developed and built into a graphical interface with MSI software. Biological tissue sections were analysed by ambient air-flow assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Histology-driven and characterized ion images overlay combined with metabolic feature-based spatial segmentation were developed to accurately extract the metabolic profile from the tissue microregion of interest. In addition, appropriate data pretreatment methods were investigated to evaluate their ability to identify biological variations from the complicated spatially resolved metabolomics data. Diverse graphical metabolic feature extraction and various data pretreatment methods enable not only the achievement of the best multivariate statistical results in an intuitive and simple way but also the discovery of low-abundance but reliable biomarkers. The results from a papillary thyroid cancer tissue study demonstrated that this data processing pipeline is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for investigating the spatial molecular events in tumor microenvironments and to therefore thoroughly understand their metabolic heterogeneity.

AB Recently, microplastics (MP) have emerged as global contaminants of serious concern to human and ecological health. However, identification and visualisation of MP are still a challenge, whether from wastewater, oceans, sediment or soil. Particularly when MP are mapped to visualise their distribution, the background signal from sediment and soil might be high and shield the MP signal from the analysis. Raman has recently received increasing attention, as the complementary spectrum of infrared (IR), because it can overcome the drawbacks of IR analysis including water interference, low lateral resolution and a complex spectrum. Here we show that Raman can identify and visualise MP from a soil/sand background, with almost no sample preparation, no dye, no destruction of the sample and no interference from water/organic matter/fluorescence background signals as well. By mapping image via their characteristic and fingerprint peaks, MP including polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) can be individually identified and visualised. The lateral resolution along the focal plane is 1 mm/pixel to catch small MP down to 1 mm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we developed a novel and sensitive ratiometric fluorescence strategy for pH sensing and urea detection based on MoS2 quantum dots (MQDs) and 2, 3-diaminophenazine (DAP). The DAP was pH-sensitive and can be used as pH indicator while MQDs was pH-insensitive and acted as a reference fluorescent signal. The fluorescence intensity of DAP at 568 nm exhibited increases gradually while the fluorescence intensity of MQDs at 420 nm kept unchanged as the pH changed from 3.0 to 9.0. So the ratio of the two fluorescence intensities at 568 nm and 420 nm can be used to monitor the change of pH. The pH-sensing system showed a linear and reversible respond to pH in the range of 3.8-6.0 with an interval of 0.2 pH unit. Furthermore, the enzymatic reaction of urea in the presence of urease can lead to the pH increase of the solution, which can be used to detect urea by using the above-mentioned pH-sensing system. There exhibited a good linear relationship between the ratiometric fluorescence intensity of I-568/I-420 and urea concentrations ranging from 5 to 700 mu M. And a low detection limit of 1.8 mu M was obtained. The proposed strategy exhibited excellent selectivity and sensitivity. Additionally, the developed ratiometric fluorescence strategy was successfully applied to detect urea in water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel microRNA (miRNA) quantification method has been developed using one-step rolling circlequantitative PCR (RC-qPCR) analysis. Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase is firstly utilized to combine a rolling circle amplification (RCA) and qPCR in one step with high sensitivity and specificity in our RC-qPCR assay. Before performing the RC-qPCR, a padlock probe is ligated only when it is perfectly hybridized with miRNA. This ligation-based miRNA assay is highly specific for mature miRNAs, discriminating among related miRNAs that differ by as little as one nucleotide. It exhibits a dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude with a detection limit of 500 aM, and could be also used for the quantification of other small RNA molecules such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

AB We designed a smartphone based field-portable cell counter combining the smartphone microscope for bright-field image recording and the smartphone application for automatically cell recognition, counting and analysis. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a smartphone based cell counter can distinguish and count both live and dead cells simultaneously. Compared to the results obtained by hemocytometer, commercial cell counter and flow cytometer, the proposed device was proved to detect cell concentration and viability accurately within the application range between 10(5) cells/mL and 10(7) cells/mL. Though multiple fields of view were measured to increase the sampling amount for error reduction, the whole operations including image recording and processing can still be finished rapidly. Moreover, the proposed device is cost-effective with small size of 170 mm x 113mm x 168mm containing a built-in power supply. Considering its advantages as high accuracy, fast speed, low cost, long battery life and compact configuration, it is believed the proposed device is a potential tool applied in on-site cell analysis.

AB In recent years, alpha-glucosidase (alpha-Glu) inhibitor has been widely used in clinic for diabetic and HIV therapy. Although different systems have been constructed for sensitive and selective detection of alpha-Glu and screening its inhibitor, the method based on ratiometric fluorescence for alpha-glucosidase inhibitor screening remains poorly investigated. Herein, we constructed a new MnO2 nanosheet (NS)-based ratiometric fluorescent sensor for a-glucosidase activity assay and its inhibitor screening. MnO2 NS as an oxidase-mimicking nanomaterial directly oxidized o-phenylenediamine (OPD) into 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) which had a strong fluorescence emission at 575 nm, whereas the fluorescence of Ag nanoclusters (NCs) at 450 nm was then quenched by the generated DAP through inner filter effect (IFE). When 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AAG) as alpha-Glu substrate and a-Glu were introduced into the above system, MnO2 NS would be reduced to Mn2+ and lose the oxidase-like property since ascorbic acids (AA) were released with the hydrolysis of AAG by alpha-Glu. Thus, DAP would not be produced and IFE was stopped accompanying with the fluorescence decrease of DAP and fluorescence increase of AgNCs. A ratiometric fluorescent alpha-Glu nanosensor was thus developed. The fluorescence intensity ratio of DAP to AgNCs linearly decreased with the increasing of alpha-Glu concentrations in the range of 0.2-8 UmL(-1), and limit of detection was 0.03 UmL(-1). This proposed sensing approach was also expanded to alpha-Glu inhibitor screening and showed excellent applicability. As a typical alpha-Glu inhibitor, acarbose was investigated with a low detection limit of 10(-8) M. The constructed sensor platform was proven to be sensitive and selective as well as simple, label-free and low-cost, making it promising for the accurate diagnosis of relevant disease and discovery of potential drugs.

AB y Sepsis is a condition characterized by a severe stage of blood-infection often leading to tissue damage, organ failure and finally death. Fast diagnosis and identification of the sepsis stage (sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock) is critical for the patient's evolution and could help in defining the most adequate treatment in order to reduce its mortality. The combined detection of several biomarkers in a timely, specific and simultaneous way could ensure a more accurate diagnosis. We have designed a new optical point-of-care (POC) device based on a phase-sensitive interferometric biosensor with a label-free microarray configuration for potential high-throughput evaluation of specific sepsis biomarkers. The sensor chip, which relies on the use of metallic nanostructures, provides versatility in terms of biofunctionalization, allowing the efficient immobilization of different kind of receptors such as antibodies or oligonucleotides. We have focused on two structurally different types of biomarkers: proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin 6 (IL6), and miRNAs, using miRNA-16 as an example. Limits of Detection (LoD) of 18 mu g mL(-1), 88 mu g mL(-1) and 1 mM (6 mu g mL(-1)) have been respectively obtained for CRP, IL6 and miRNA-16 in individual assays, with high accuracy and reproducibility. The multiplexing capabilities have also been assessed with the simultaneous analysis of both protein biomarkers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal sensing in thin films polymers has been a significant limitation towards optimizing the heat dissipation in micro-and nano-electronic devices as well as many other thin film-based technologies. In this work, we report on poly (phenylene ethynylene) fluorescent-based conjugated polyelectrolyte capable of detecting thermal fluctuations in polymer films prepared from polyvinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate. The sensor was first optimized in solution by testing two polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) copolymers (co-vinyl acetate (VA) and co-polystyrene (PS)) before it was spun cast onto quartz slides and imaged using a DSLR camera at different temperatures. The images were analyzed and showed a change in color with the increase in temperature. When not illuminated, the polymer thin film is clear and transparent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, we propose a highly sensitive and selective three-dimensional electrochemical paper-based analytical device (3D-ePAD) to determine serotonin (Ser). It uses a graphite-paste electrode modified with nanoparticles coated with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles were encapsulated with silica to create novel nano-sized MIP. Morphology and structural characterization reveal that silica imprinted sites (Fe3O4@Au@SiO2) synthesized via sol-gel methods provide excellent features for Ser detection, including high porosity, and greatly improve analyte diffusion and adsorption to provide a faster response by the MIP sensor. The template molecule was effectively removed by solvent extraction to provide a greater number of specific cavities that enhance analyte capacity and sensitivity. The 3D-ePAD was fabricated by alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)-inkjet printing of a circular hydrophobic detection zone on filter paper for application of aqueous samples, coupled with screen-printed electrodes on the paper, which was folded underneath the hydrophobic zone. The sensor was constructed by drop coating of Fe3O4@Au@SiO2-MIP nanocomposites on the graphite electrode (GPE) surface. The MIP sensor (Fe3O4@Au@SiO2-MIP/GPE) was used in the detection of Ser by linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. The device exhibits high sensitivity toward Ser, which we attribute to synergistic effects between catalytic properties, electrical conductivity of Fe3O4@Au@SiO2, and significantly increased numbers of imprinted sites. Ser oxidation was observed at +0.39 V. Anodic peak currents for Ser show linearity from 0.01 to 1000 mu M (y = 0.0075 +/- 0.0049 x + 0.4071 +/- 0.0052, r(2) = 0.993), with a detection limit of 0.002 mu M (3S/N). The device provides good repeatability (% relative standard deviations; RSD) = 4.23%, calculated from the current responses of ten different MIP sensors). The device also exhibits high selectivity and reproducibility (% RSD = 8.35%, obtained from five calibration plots). The analytical performance of the device is suitable for the determination of Ser in pharmaceutical capsules and urine samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluorescence quenching based immunoassay format for the detection of a trace amount of some nitro-explosives with a high degree of selectivity is reported in this study. The immunoassay comprises anti-explosive antibodies functionalized microtitre strips specific to the targeted explosives, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). UV induced photolysis of nitro-explosive bound to targeted antibodies generates primarily nitrite ions which after the quick reaction with the detector molecule, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN), a fluorophore, quenches its fluorescence intensity, however, proportionately undergo cyclization to produce a highly fluorescent product, 2,3-naphthotriazole (NAT). The synthesized product, NAT, was verified using various chromatographic and spectrophotometric techniques. This newly developed antibody-based detection method, utilizing DAN dye, demonstrated a high selectivity towards PETN, RDX, and TNT. This method can be used as an economical testing kit for direct quantification of explosives, implying the great potential for quick, low-cost trace detection of explosives.

AB As a multifunctional signaling molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays an essential role in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The two-photon fluorescence probes detecting H2S selectively in vivo could be useful tools to better study the mechanism of diseases. Then, an efficient two-photon lysosome-specific probe 1 has been developed to detect endogenous H2S in living cells and mice. Probe 1 displays excellent properties with 28-fold fluorescence enhancement, marked color changes in naked-eye and fluorescence, high selectivity and sensitivity, and low detection limit (0.22 mu M) to H2S. These remarkable properties of probe 1 enable its practical applications in detecting H2S in environment (wastewater) and food (beer). Moreover, as a two-photon probe under near infrared excitation at 790 nm, probe 1 can monitor the level changes of endogenous H2S of lysosome and tumor in living system with good membrane permeability and high imaging resolution. Specially, the probe detecting H2S distribution in lysosome could provide more evidences to explain the association of target-organelle and H2S. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, a novel signal-off photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was proposed for sensitive detection of thrombin on the basis of C-60@C3N4 nanocomposites as quencher and Au nanoparticles (depAu) decorated perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) as sensing platform. Owing to the excellent membrane-forming of PTCA and superior conductivity of depAu, the PTCA between two depAu layers can simply and effectively produce an extremely high initial photocurrent to afford a precondition for sensitive biodetection. Thereafter, the assembly of C-60@C3N4 nanocomposites on electrode via typical sandwich reaction enabled the generation of a significantly decreased photocurrent. Here, the C3N4 with high surface area not only provided massive binding sites for C-60 immobilization, but also partly competed with PTCA in light absorption for producing a significantly smaller photocurrent in the presence of electron donor ascorbic acid (AA). Additionally, both the C3N4 and C-60 have the poor conductivity, which could inhibit the electron transfer to achieve a further decreased photocurrent, effectively improving the sensitivity of proposed biosensor. As a result, the PEC biosensor in a "signal-off" mode showed an extremely low detection limit down to 1.5 fM, providing a sensitive and universal strategy for protein detection.

AB Rapid and reliable detection of pathogenic bacteria is vital to prevent and control bacterial diseases. In this study, we present a magnetically assisted surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensor based on the dual-recognition of bacterial cell by aptamer and antibiotic molecules. Aptamer-Fe3O4@Au magnetic nanoparticles (AuMNPs) were synthesized as magnetic and SERS activated substrate for specific bacteria enrichment, vancomycin-SERS tags (Au@MBA) were prepared for the sensitive quantification of pathogenic bacteria. Due to the Au-shell based dual-SERS enhancement and aptamer/vancomycin based dual-recognition ability, a detection limit of 3 cells/mL with a wide dynamic linear range from 10 to 10(7) cells/mL can be achieved within 50 min without other non-target bacteria interference. When applied in real samples, the approach shows recoveries from 95.0% to 106.4% with relative standard derivation (RSD) less than 5.3%. The SERS strategy could be used to detect a broad range of bacteria by using different aptamers, moreover, the simple operation and precise quantification ability empower this assay great potential in the application of food safety and infectious disease point-of-care diagnosis.

AB In this study, we designed a fluorescence enhancement strategy based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregates for the detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences. AgNPs were functioned with recognition probes (Cy3-probe) and hybrid probes (Oligomer-A and Oligomer-B). The presence of target DNA mediated the formation of sandwich complexes between the immobilized capture probes and the functionalized AgNPs, which was followed by hybridization-induced formation of AgNP aggregates. The fluorescent intensity could be extremely amplified by both the increasing number of fluorophores and metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect. Under optimal conditions, this method achieved a detection limit of 50 fM which was 1560-fold lower than that of un-enhanced fluorescent assays. It was illustrated that the HBV DNA concentrations ranging from 100 fM to 10 nM had a good log-linear correlation with the corresponding fluorescent intensity (R = 0.991). Moreover, this method had high specificity both for distinguishing single-base mismatches and identifying target DNA under the interference of genomic DNA. This fluorescent microarray had high-throughput analytical potential and could apply to many other disease diagnoses. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Boronate affinity materials, as widely used sorbents for the enrichment of cis-diol-containing molecules, have been rapidly developed and increasingly utilized for various applications in recent years. cis-Diol-containing molecules, including saccharides, nucleosides, catecholamines, glycans and glycoproteins/glycopeptides, are major targets in the frontiers of many research areas, such as environmental analysis, the food industry and bioanalysis. As the analysis of these molecules usually suffers from the low abundance of targets and the high abundance of interference, selective enrichment is a fundamental step of sample preparation before analysis. In this review, we survey recent achievements of boronate affinity materials and their applications in sample preparation. We mainly focus on the fundamental considerations of materials as well as important applications in the past 3 years. Particularly, the effects of the substrate structure on the performance of boronate affinity materials, such as binding capacity, affinity, selectivity and working pH, will be discussed. Furthermore, the applications in sample preparation will also be introduced, with a main emphasis on what merits can be provided by boronate affinity materials to overcome the challenges in sample preparation.

AB Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are first-line drugs used for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. These drugs do not require the regular biochemical monitoring that is mandatory for warfarin, and they exhibit shorter half-lives and have a faster onset of action. Since recent real-world studies evidence a higher prevalence of adverse side effects than what was anticipated in clinical trials, monitoring the plasma concentrations of DOACs is being used to personalize their pharmacotherapy, in accordance to the characteristics of the patient, and to evaluate the adherence to therapy.
   In order to fulfill the aforementioned clinical unmet needs, there are specific coagulation assays that indirectly assess the plasma concentrations of DOACs. Nevertheless, these assays are not sufficiently accurate or sensitive. For this reason, liquid chromatography techniques coupled to mass spectrometry detection, are considered the gold standard method to accurately determine plasma concentrations of DOACs.
   Therefore, the present paper provides the first comprehensive review of the current analytical methods that were developed and validated for the quantitative determination of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and/or edoxaban and their main metabolites in biological samples. The chromatographic methods will be particularly highlighted and an emphasis will be placed on the major difficulties faced during optimization and development steps. In addition, the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug will be critically related to chromatographic conditions. Their influence on the pre-treatment procedures and storage conditions of DOACs will be examined, suggesting strategies that should be applied to accurately quantify DOACs in biological samples.

AB Electroactive microorganisms possess the unique ability to transfer electrons to or from solid phase electron conductors, e.g., electrodes or minerals, through various physiological mechanisms. The processes are commonly known as extracellular electron transfer and broadly harnessed in microbial electrochemical systems, such as microbial biosensors, microbial electrosynthesis, or microbial fuel cells. Apart from a few model microorganisms, the nature of the microbe-electrode conductive interaction is poorly understood for most of the electroactive species. The interaction determines the efficiency and a potential scaling up of bioelectrochemical systems.
   Gram-positive bacteria generally have a thick electron non-conductive cell wall and are believed to exhibit weak extracellular electron shuttling activity. This review highlights reported research accomplishments on electroactive Gram-positive bacteria. The use of electron-conducting polymers as mediators is considered as one promising strategy to enhance the electron transfer efficiency up to application scale. In view of the recent progress in understanding the molecular aspects of the extracellular electron transfer mechanisms of Enterococcus faecalis, the electron transfer properties of this bacterium are especially focused on.
   Fundamental knowledge on the nature of microbial extracellular electron transfer and its possibilities can provide insight in interspecies electron transfer and biogeochemical cycling of elements in nature. Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of cell-electrode interactions may help in overcoming insufficient electron transfer and restricted operational performance of various bioelectrochemical systems and facilitate their practical applications.

AB The crucial point of this study was to verify the hypothesis that both thallium species are not affected by the procedure of photolysis when it is applied as a method of simplification of sample matrix containing surfactants, and that this method of sample pretreatment leads to reliable results of Tl speciation analysis. It is important especially because of high instability of Tl(III), which makes partial reduction of Tl(III) DTPA complex unavoidable. After conservation of Tl speciation by addition of DTPA the photolysis assisted with nanostructured hierarchically organized film was performed using "solar lamp" (Fe2O3/WO3/Fe2O3 film, pH 6, 380-800 nm). The results imply that under proposed photolysis conditions Tl(I) is not oxidized in the presence of water matrix, SDS nor DTPA. Also, even 100-fold excess of Fe(III) ions over Tl(I) ions does not accelerate the oxidation of Tl(I) to Tl(III), and already 2 h of heterogeneous photolysis allow to limit the interferences caused by SDS and obtain reliable results. The data obtained by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) were verified using an inter-method comparison with SEC ICP MS. Moreover, after 2 h irradiation the reduction rate of Tl(III) DTPA standard solution increased only slightly from 2-3% to 4-6%. The presence of river water matrix causes a slightly higher (9%) reduction of the trivalent form. These changes are irrelevant in the context of instability of Tl(III) compounds. This study indicates that "soft decomposition" can be applied in speciation analysis of thallium in water matrix. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an implantable and minimally invasive micro-aptasensor for adenosine monitoring in vivo, based on flexible integrated electrodes, was developed. Firstly the sensor was made by the modification of a needle-type electrode with reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoclusters (rGO-AuNCs) using two-step electrodeposition. Secondly Sulfhydryl-terminated capture probe (ssDNA1) was immobilized on rGO-AuNCs modified electrode surface by self-assembly, and then it was hybridized with adenosine aptamer (ssDNA2). Lastly methylene blue (MB) as an electrochemical indicator was adsorbed on the aptamer through specific interaction of MB with guanine base. The peak current of MB decreased linearly with increasing adenosine concentration due to the formation of aptamer-adenosine complex and displacement of the aptamer from the modified electrode surface. The sensor showed a low detection limit of 0.1 nM with signal-to-noise ratio equal to 3 as well as a wide linear response range (0.1 nM-1 mM) in vitro. Also, a high selectivity was demonstrated for adenosine in relation to uridine, guanosine, and cytidine. Experiments in vivo demonstrated fast responses for a range of adenosine concentrations. This work demonstrates a promising path for implantable devices for the determination of biomolecules in vivo, thus allowing for health tests, detection of infectious diseases, and other medical conditions.

AB A new and facile method for selective measurement of profenofos (PFF) using a simple flow-injection system with a molecularly-imprinted-polymer-coated carbon nanotube (3D-CNTs@MIP) amperometric sensor is proposed. The 3D-CNTs@MIP was synthesized by successively coating the surface of carboxylated CNTs with SiO2 and vinyl end groups, then terminating with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shells. MIP was grafted to the CNT cores using methacrylic acid (MAA) monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross linker, and 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. We constructed the PFF sensor by coating the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with 3D-CNTs@MIP and removed the imprinting template by solvent extraction. Morphological and structural characterization reveal that blending of the MIP on the CNT surface significantly increases the selective surface area, leading to greater numbers of imprinting sites for improved sensitivity and electron transfer. The 3D-CNTs@MIP sensor exhibits a fast response with good recognition when applied to PFF detection by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The PFF oxidation current signal appears at +0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl using 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) as the carrier solution. The designed 3D-imprinted sensor provides a linear response over the range 0.01-200 mu M (r(2) = 0.995) with a low detection limit of 0.002 mu M (3 sigma). The sensor was successfully applied to detection of PFF in vegetable samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Experimental optimization of analytical methods based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a complex and labor-intensive process associated with uncertainties. Using the theoretical basics of SPME and finite element analysis software for the optimization proved to be an efficient alternative. In this study, an improved finite element analysis-based model for SPME of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by porous coatings was developed mainly focussing on the mass transport in coatings. Benzene and the Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (Car/PDMS) coating were used as the model VOC and a porous SPME coating, respectively. It has been established that in the coating, volumetric fractions of Carboxen, PDMS, and air are 33, 42 and 24%, respectively. Knudsen diffusion in micropores can slow down a mass transport of analytes in the coating. When PDMS was considered as the solid part of the coating, lower root-mean-square deviation of the modeling results from experimental data was observed. It has been shown that the developed model can be used to model the extraction of VOCs from air and water samples encountered in a typical SPME development method procedure. It was possible to determine system equilibration times and use them to optimize sample volume and Henry's law constant. The developed model is relatively simple, fast, and can be recommended for optimization of extraction parameters for other analytes and SPME coatings. The diffusivity of analytes in a coating is an important property needed for improved characterization of existing and new SPME polymers and analytical method optimization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present a method to preserve and process urine proteins for proteomic analysis in a filter aided sample preparation (FASP) format. The method combines concentration of urine proteins in ultrafiltration devices, their thermal stabilization, allowing long term storage of the samples, and filter aided sample preparation. Proteomes of four different urines were preserved during 48 h and 6 months using (i) the classic freeze preservation at -20 degrees C, (ii) snap-heated freeze-free preservation at laboratory temperature (20 degrees C) and (iii) snap-heated preservation at -60 degrees C. The three storage methods can effetely preserve the urine proteome for at least 6 months without significant alterations. Abundances of more than 500 proteins and specially 24 selected -cleared or -approved protein assayed in serum or plasma were found similar within the three preservation methods assessed. The new method here proposed dramatically simplifies the conditions for preserving the urine proteome for biobanks in terms of space and storage, including lowering the risks of sample degradation caused by misfunction of the freezer. Furthermore, the shipping of large number of samples can be made without the need of freezing. The application of the FASP format to isolate and preserve the proteins facilitates long-term storage and processing of proteome of urine samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of an automated miniaturized analytical system that allows for the rapid monitoring of carbamazepine (CBZ) levels in serum and wastewater is proposed. Molecular recognition of CBZ was achieved through its selective interaction with microbeads carrying anti-CBZ antibodies. The proposed method combines the advantages of the micro-bead injection spectroscopy and of the flow-based platform lab-on-valve for implementation of automatic immunosorbent renewal, rendering a new recognition surface for each sample. The sequential (or simultaneous) perfusion of CBZ and the horseradish peroxidase-labelled CBZ through the microbeads is followed by real-time on-column monitoring of substrate (3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine) oxidation by colorimetry. The evaluation of the initial oxidation rate and also the absorbance value at a fixed time point provided a linear response versus the logarithm of the CBZ concentration. Under the selected assay conditions, a single analysis was completed after only 11 min, with a quantification range between 1.0 and 50 mu g L-1. Detection of CBZ levels in undiluted wastewater samples was feasible after a simple filtration step while good recoveries were attained for spiked certified human serum, analyzed without sample clean-up.

AB Methods for determining nitrate and nitrite have been comprehensively developed. However, there are few studies of simultaneous shipboard high-frequency monitoring of these two nutrients in estuarine and coastal area. In this study, a multipurpose integrated syringe-pump-based environmental-water analyzer (iSEA) was combined with an on-line filtration system for underway analysis of nitrate and nitrite in saline samples. Vanadium chloride was used instead of a toxic cadmium column to reduce nitrate to nitrite, which was measured on the basis of the classic Griess reaction. This fully automated analyzer had a limit of detection of 0.02 mmol L-1 for nitrite and 0.14 mmol L-1 for nitrate. The sample throughput was 12 h(-1) for simultaneous measurement of nitrite and nitrate. With automated dilution, the calibration curve for nitrate was linear up to a concentration of 400 mmol L-1 (R-2 > 0.999). The relative standard deviation of 24-h measurement (n = 288) of nitrite is 0.92% and that of nitrate is 1.4%. Both the reference solutions and samples of different salinities (range of 0-35) were measured (n = 85). According to the statistical t-test (P = 0.95), the results were insignificantly different from the results obtained using the reference method. After several cruise tests, the analyzer showed excellent spatial resolution for underway analysis of nitrite and nitrate in estuarine and coastal waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Encoded hydrogel microparticles, synthesized by Stop Flow Lithography (SFL), have shown great potential for microRNA assays for their capability to provide high multiplexing capacity and solution-like hybridization kinetics. However, due to the low conversion of copolymerization during particle synthesis, current hydrogel microparticles can only utilize similar to 10% of the input probes that functionalize the particles for miRNA assay. Here, we present a novel method of functionalizing hydrogel microparticles after particle synthesis by utilizing unconverted double bonds remaining inside the hydrogel particles to maximize functional probe incorporation and increase the performance of miRNA assay. This allows covalent bonding of functional probes to the hydrogel network after particle synthesis. Because of the abundance of the unconverted double bonds and accessibility of all probes, the probe density increases about 8.2 times compared to that of particles functionalized during the synthesis. This results lead to an enhanced miRNA assay performance that improves the limit of detection from 4.9 amol to 1.5 amol. In addition, higher specificity and shorter assay time are achieved compared to the previous method. We also demonstrate a potential application of our particles by performing multiplexed miRNA detections in human plasma samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantification of low concentration proteins can facilitate the discovery of some significant biomarkers, and provide us a more profound understanding of cell heterogeneity when applied to single cell analysis. However, most state-of-art single cell protein detection platforms are bulky, expensive and complicated. Here we report a simple and low cost microfluidic dPCR (digital polymerase chain reaction) chip-based proximity ligation assay (PLA) for the quantification of low concentration proteins. First, standard hCSTB (human cystatin B) protein was used to optimize the related experimental conditions. Comparing to ordinary PLA tests, the results showed that our method achieved femtomolar limit of detection (LOD) with a linear dynamic range over three to four orders of magnitude. Then human CD147 protein, a reported biomarker for hepatoma carcinoma, was detected in single HepG2 and L02 cells. The results showed that there were wide disparities in single cell CD147 abundance for both of the two cell lines. And the average CD147 protein content in single HepG2 cells displayed 2-fold increase in comparison to that in single L02 cells. Comparing to the research findings obtained at bulk level, our method can provide more useful information for diagnosis and targeted therapy of tumors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing fluorescent sensors with ability of monitoring gaseous nerve agents in a sensitive and selective manner is of great importance due to the extreme toxicity and volatility of organophosphorus nerve agents. Herein we reported a novel oxime-modified flavonoid sensor and carefully investigated its sensing behavior towards nerve agent simulants, diethylchlorophosphate (DCP). In the presence of DCP, a remarkable fluorescence enhancement accompanied with emission color change could be observed by naked eyes in solution. The response time was less than 90 s and LOD value was calculated as 0.78 mu mmol/L in solution. The sensing mechanism could be ascribed to the specific reaction between halophosphate and hydroxyl group of oxime. Furthermore, sensor strips have been successfully constructed by using PEG as matrix with a simple preparation process, and also achieved the sensitive and selective detection of DCP vapor. These results in this study may provide important references for further design of dye-based sensor strips for detection of nerve agents both in solution and gas phase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB As an important biomarker, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is one of the most commonly assayed enzymes in clinical practice. Here a novel turn-on fluorescent nanoswitch for ALP assay was suggested. The nanoswitch was easily constructed via two high-affinity ligands between GSH and Al3+ and PPi and Al3+ based on the difference in the affinity. The primary fluorescence of as-prepared GSH capped Cu nanoclusters (NCs) turned on first upon the Al3+ addition due to the Al3+ induced aggregation induced emission (AIE) enhancement based on the high affinity of GSH and Al3+. The presence of PPi then made Al3+ desorb from the surface of GSH capped Cu NCs due to the higher affinity of PPi and Al3+. As a result, the fluorescence of the Cu NCs was quenched. ALP could hydrolyze PPi into phosphate, destroying the PPi-Al3+ complex and releasing Al3+. Thus, the Al3+ binds to GSH again and the fluorescence was restored. The nanoswitch was demonstrated to be sensitive and selective for ALP assay and was successfully used for the ALP assay in the human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The detection and quantification of microRNA (miRNA) plays essential roles in clinical and biomedical research. Yet, it is of major challenge to sense miRNA with high degree of selectivity and sensitivity due to its unique characteristics of short length, similarity of sequence among family members and low abundance. Here, with the design of a new hairpin/DNA ring ternary probe, we describe the development of a rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for sensitively and selectively sensing miRNA from cancer cells. The target miRNA binds the hairpin/DNA ring probes through toehold-mediated strand displacement (TSD) to form the ternary structures, in which the bound miRNA and DNA ring are respectively used as the primer and template to realize RCA, leading to the generation of many repeated metal ion-dependent DNAzyme sequences. The fluorescently quenched hairpin signal probes can be cyclically cleaved by these DNAzyme sequences with co-existence of the corresponding metal ions in buffer to show drastically enhanced fluorescence recovery for highly sensitive sensing of miRNA in the range between 10 fM and 10 nM with a detection limit of 1.51 fM. Besides, owing to the high base variation discrimination ability of TSD, selective detection of the target miRNA among the corresponding family members can be achieved by this method. Moreover, such a method can also be employed to differentiate miRNA expression variations in cancer cells for screening potential therapeutic drugs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low-molecular-mass isoelectric point (pI) markers are a reasonable alternative to commonly used peptide and protein pI markers in the field of isoelectric focusing. We present a comparative study dealing with characterization of 44 nitrophenol-based compounds synthesized by the Mannich reaction which pI values cover a pH range from 3.2 to 10.4. The values of pIs of all the presented nitrophenol-based compounds were precisely determined by capillary isoelectric focusing technique (cIEF) when a standard deviation of measurement reached a value of a few hundredths of a pH unit (n >= 3). Differences have been found between in silico analysis of acid-base properties of the investigated compounds and the experimental cIEF data especially at the basic pH region. The data from the acidic pH range showed better correlation between these methods. Only three compounds were excluded from the group of pI markers because they contained impurities originating from the synthesis or long-term storage. Based on the presented results we identified 41 nitrophenol-based pI markers (NPIMs) which can fulfill requirements of the most applications in a field of isoelectric focusing analyses.

AB Cancer cell detection in liquid biopsies has been a widely studied application in many microfluidic devices. The use of a common antibody, such as the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Anti-EpCAM) or other specific antibodies, has facilitated the detection and study of many cancers. However, the use of such antibodies requires a priori knowledge of the cancer source, and many cancer subtypes are missed in screening applications. There remains a need to study a wider range of cancers that maintain the streamlined antibody approach in cell affinity separations. The Human transferrin receptor (CD71) has recently been demonstrated as a cancer cell affinity target in blood samples. CD71 expression in blood cells is low, whereas proliferating cancer cells have a higher expression of the surface protein. CD71 expression is variable with cell cycle, which can impact cell separations. In this work, we investigated the effects of cell cycle and CD71 expression on cell capture metrics. Six cancer cell lines were isolated from blood via CD71 affinity capture, with a capture efficiency and purity that varied with CD71 expression. Despite variation in CD71 expression, the affinity was sufficient to isolate cancer cells spiked into blood; under optimal conditions, CD71-based capture resulted in capture purity >80%. We conclude that CD71 affinity separations show potential as a biomarker for cancer studies without sacrificing sensitivity and selectivity, and that cancer cells can be isolated from liquid biopsies over a range of expression of the target protein.

AB This paper shows a simple, rapid and cost-effective method for multielement analyses of cosmetics. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) is used to determine the composition, particularly the presence of potentially toxic elements, of cosmetics. Three sample preparation methods based on suspension preparation were developed for different types of cosmetic samples, e.g. lipsticks, eye shadows and body creams.
   Limits of detection within the low mg kg(-1) range were obtained and enabled cosmetic screening for compliance with the legal thresholds for some major toxic elements. A good accuracy of the results on a wide range of concentration levels (>10000 mg kg(-1)) was found without the need of sample dilution. Results obtained for most elements in the lipstick and cream samples agreed with those obtained by the reference method recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, based on using inductively coupled plasma techniques after microwave digestion. However, for eyeshadow analysis, a more sophisticate approach is needed to improve the analytical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS/MS) operated in N2O reaction mode (mass-shift mode) was established for the analysis of six congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs): BDE 28, BDE 47, BDE 99, BDE 100, BDE 153 and BDE 154 in fish samples. The spectral interference on the determination of PBDEs was eliminated by measuring the product ion (BrO+) instead of traditional methods measuring Br+. After comparing the signal intensities of the three reaction gases (O-2, H-2, and N2O), the highest sensitivity was found using N2O as the reaction gas. The results showed that bromine is an element that suffers from strong spectral overlap in ICP, mainly from Ar-based polyatomic interferences. Spectral interference was assessed by measuring the bromine isotope ratio of Br-81(+) and Br-79(+) of the six priority PBDEs in the He collision mode and N2O reaction mode, respectively. In the conventional He collision mode, the relative isotope ratio of Br-79/Br-81 (the measured isotope ratio to the natural isotope ratio) of the analytes ranged from 0.955 to 0.965, which proves that using He as the collision gas cannot completely eliminate the spectral interference. In the N2O reaction mode, the relative isotope ratio of Br-79/Br-81 ranged from 0.991 to 1.004, demonstrating that spectral interference can be fully eliminated. Samples were processed using the modified QuEChERs method with detection limits ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 ng g(-1) with a relative standard deviation of less than 3%. Six priority PBDEs in the NIST reference materials SRM 1947 (frozen fish tissue homogenate) were determined by mass-shift mode to verify this conclusion. No statistically significant difference was observed between the measured value and the certified value, with recoveries between 95% and 114%. The method was applied to the analysis of PBDEs in marine fish samples and five PBDEs were observed (BDE28,BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100 and BDE-153) at concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 0.54 ng g(-1).

AB The discrepancy between concentrations and activities is a predicament well known to the analytical chemist. Because of the difficulty of determining activity coefficients, the standard technique for quantitative equilibrium studies is to work under a particular 'constant ionic strength' by adding an excess of an inert salt. Under such conditions, activity coefficients are approximately constant and can be taken into the equilibrium constants which are defined for the chosen ionic strength (I). Here we propose a fundamentally different approach. Throughout the numerical analysis of the titration data, activity co-efficients for all individual species are approximated by well-known equations based on the work of Debye-Hfickel. The computational analysis of the measurements strictly obeys the law of mass conservation and obeys the law of mass action only approximately. The main novelty is that now the addition of inert salts is no longer required and measurements are done at minimal I. Consequently, the thermodynamic equilibrium constants are now determined much more robustly based on experiments taken at low I. The approach has been tested and validated with the two very well investigated 3-protic phosphoric and citric acids. In summary: the technique of artificially keeping ionic strength constant has been replaced by improved computational analysis. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB New strategies of ordered predictors selection (OPS) were developed in this work, making this method more versatile and expanding its worldwide use and applicability. OPS is a recognized method to select variables in multivariate regression and is used by analytical chemists and chemometrists. It shows high ability to improve the prediction of models after the selection of a few and important variables. At the core of OPS is sorting variables from informative vectors and systematically investigating the regression models to identify the most relevant set of variables by comparing the cross-validation parameters of the models. Nevertheless, the first version of the OPS method performs variable selection using only one informative vector at a time and is limited to just one variable selection run. Then, three new strategies were proposed. First, an automatic method was developed to perform variable selection using several informative vectors and their combinations. Second, the feedback OPS is presented, in this new strategy the pre-selected variables would return to a new selection. Last, a method to apply OPS in full array subdivisions called OPS intervals was established. Initially, the new strategies were applied in the six datasets used in the original OPS paper to compare the prediction performance with the new OPS algorithms. After that, twelve new datasets were used to test and compare the new OPS approaches with other variable selection methods, genetic algorithm (GA), the interval successive projections algorithm for PLS (iSPA), and recursive weighted partial least squares (rPLS). The new OPS approaches out-performed the first OPS version and the other variable selection methods. Results showed that in addition to greater predictive capacity, the accuracy in the selection of expected variables is highly superior with the new OPS approaches. Overall, the new OPS provided the best set of selected variables to build more predictive and interpretative regression models, proving to be efficient for variable selection in different types of datasets.

AB In this work, porphyrin-based 2D MOF CuTCPP/platelet ordered mesoporous carbon (pOMC) composites were successfully synthesized by conventional solvothermal reaction. The introduction of pOMC increases conductivity of CuTCPP/pOMC composites, weakens accumulation of the CuTCPP layers, and exposes active sites of CuTCPP. CuTCPP/pOMC composites show high electro-catalytic activity to the oxidation of hydroxylamine and the redox of chlorogenic acid. An electrochemical sensor based on CuTCPP/pOMC was constructed for quantitative determination of hydroxylamine and chlorogenic acid, and relevant mechanisms were discussed. Under optimized conditions, the fabricated sensor displays two wide linear responses in the ranges of 5.8-733.8 mu M and 733.8-2933.8 mu M for hydroxylamine, with a rapid response time about 1 s. For chlorogenic acid, the sensor presents linear responses in the ranges of 0.1-2 mu M and 2-15 mu M, with a high sensitivity of 10.18 mu A/mu M. The sensor was used to detect hydroxylamine and chlorogenic acid in real samples, and satisfactory results were obtained. The synthesis of CuTCPP/pOMC composites provides new strategy for designing electrochemical sensors based on 2D MOFs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified by thiolated calix[n]arene (TCnA, n = 4, 6, 8) were anchored on graphene nanosheets (GN) by pi-pi stacking interaction between TCnA molecules and GN. Testing of various electrochemical techniques display that the AuNPs@TCnA/GN modified glass carbon electrodes (GCE) show good electrocatalytic property, molecular recognition and enrichment performance toward dopamine (DA) and acetaminophen (AC), and exhibit high current response. In all of modified electrodes, AuNPs@TC8A/GN/GCE shows an outstanding electrochemical response for DA and AC with high sensitivity of 5.08 and 9.76 mA mmol(-1) L cm(-2), respectively. The analytical curves for DA obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) are linear in the range from 0.5 to 150 mu M and from 0.3 to 1.0 mM. The linear range for AC obtained by DPV is from 0.5 to 120 mu M. Besides, AuNPs@TC8A/GN/GCE can be applied to determinate of DA and AC simultaneously, implying the prospect to develop a dual sensor under the same construction platform. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antioxidants are important to protect and maintain biological barriers, such as the skin. Antioxidant effects are often assessed using clinical trials, however these tests are costly and time consuming. In this work we introduce a skin membrane-covered oxygen electrode (SCOE) as an in vitro tool for monitoring H2O2 and antioxidant reactions in skin. The SCOE gives amperometric response to H2O2 concentrations down to 0.05 mM. More importantly, the electrode allows measurements of polyphenol penetration and reaction with H2O2 in skin. Measurements with SCOE show that lipophilic polyphenols such as quercetin, piceatannol, resveratrol, and plant extract from Plantago major impose their antioxidant effect in skin within 2-20 min. Rutin is however too hydrophilic to penetrate into stratum corneum and therefore cannot deliver its antioxidant effect during similar time interval. The measurements are interpreted considering polyphenol partition-penetration through stratum corneum and the reaction with the H2O2-catalase system in the skin. The contribution of other enzymes will be addressed in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and sensitive method, using automated online in-tube solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), was developed for the determination of four tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in mainstream and sidestream smoke of combustion cigarettes and heated tobacco products. These TSNAs were separated within 4 min on a Capcell Pak C18 MGIII column and detected in the positive ion mode by multiple reaction monitoring. The optimum in-tube SPME conditions were 30 draw/eject cycles of 40 mu L of sample at a flow rate of 200 mu L min(-1) using a Supel-Q PLOT capillary column as an extraction device. The extracted TSNAs were easily desorbed from the column by passage of the mobile phase, with no carryover observed. This intube SPME LC-MS/MS method showed good linearity for four TSNAs in the 0.5-100 pg mL(-1) ranges, with correlation coefficients above 0.9998 (n = 24), using stable isotope-labeled TSNAs as internal standards. The validation assays for limit of detection, limit of quantification, specificity, precision and accuracy of the analytes were consistent with the requirements recommended by the ICH guidelines. The validated method was utilized successfully to analyze four TSNAs in mainstream and sidestream smoke samples without any interference peaks. Overall recoveries of TSNAs spiked into smoke sample solutions were 97.3-104.6%. The developed method can automate the extraction, concentration and analysis of samples, and is sensitive and selective for TSNAs. This method was used to analyze TSNAs in mainstream and sidestream smoke samples of several commercially available combustion cigarettes and heated tobacco products. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been extensively employed as a pretreatment method. In SPE, reversed-phase-type sorbents have been widely applied for the pretreatment of environmental or biological samples. Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)-type sorbents, constituting the copolymers used as reversed-phase-type sorbents, have been applied for various sample pretreatment methods. In HLB-type sorbents, the hydrophilic monomer contributes to the improved wettability of sorbents and increase of polar interactions. In this study, three pendant-like hydrophilic monomers, viz. N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), 4-acryloylmorpholine (AMO), and 4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one (VDO), respectively, exhibiting different Log P values and possibly causing different polar interactions, were selected to improve the adsorption properties of polar compounds, and divinylbenzene (DVB)-based HLB-type sorbents containing each hydrophilic monomer were synthesized and examined. By the optimization of the molar ratio of DVB and the hydrophilic monomer (i.e. HLB), the inert diluent, and the degree of cross-linking, the developed sorbents exhibited higher recoveries for various polar compounds (viz. cytosine, uracil, cytidine, uridine, 2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, adenine, thymidine, adenosine, and 2'-deoxyadenosine) compared to commercially available HLB-type sorbents.

AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is a commonly used technique for analysis of various samples. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a simple and efficient technique that combines both sampling and sample preparation into one consolidated step, preconcentrating extracted analytes for ultra-sensitive analysis. Historically, SPME has been coupled with chromatography-based techniques for sample separation prior to analysis, however more recently, the chromatographic step has been omitted, with the SPME device directly coupled with the mass spectrometer. In this study, direct coupling of SPME with ESI-MS was developed, and extensively validated to quantitate ketamine from human urine, employing a practical experimental workflow and no extensive hardware modification to the equipment. Among the different fibers evaluated, SPME device coated with Cis/benzenesulfonic acid particles was selected for the analysis due to its good selectivity and signal response. Different approaches, including desorption spray, dripping, desorption ESI and nano-ESI were attempted for elution and ionization of the analytes extracted using the SPME fibers. The results showed that the desorption spray and nano-ESI methods offered better signal response and signal duration than the others that were evaluated. The analytical performance of the SPME-nano-ESI-MS setup was excellent, including limit of detection (LOD) of 0.027 ng/mL, limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL, linear range of 0.1-500.0 ng/mL (R-2 = 0.9995) and recoveries of 90.8-109.4% with RSD 3.4-10.6% for three validation points at 4.0, 40.0 and 400.0 ng/mL, far better than the performance of conventional methods. The results herein presented, demonstrated that the direct coupling of SPME fibers with ESI-MS-based systems allowed for the simple and ultra-sensitive determination of analytes from raw samples such as human urine.

AB In situ identification and quantification of unsaturated fatty acid (FA) C=C positional isomers in human serum is herein performed by negative-ion paper spray (PS) mass spectrometry. Typically, by direct application of an alternating current (AC) voltage to the wet paper, the PS ionization could perform stably in the negative-ion mode without severe discharge. We suppose epoxidation reaction between unsaturated C=C bonds and reactive oxidative species might be initiated by a mild electrical discharge, which could be rapidly and controllably produced via a low amplitude AC voltage. Upon collision-induce dissociation (CID), the epoxide was fragmented to generate diagnostic ions indicating the C=C location. The intensity of the characteristic product ions could also be used for absolute quantification of the FA C=C positional isomers. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were roughly in the range of 0.0178-0.0506 mu M and 0.0218-0.3634 mu M for standard FAs. Without the additional sample preparations or reactive chemical reagents, epoxidation of unsaturated FAs and ionization of the epoxide could be achieved in one-step by negative-ion mode PS, which enable a promising methodology for on-site clinical diagnosis.

AB A fluorescent detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is established based on a finely designed functional chimera sequence, a molecular beacon (MB), and strand displacement target recycling. The chimera sequence, which consists of the aptamer sequence of S. aureus and the complementary sequence of MB, can form a hairpin structure due to the existence of intramolecular complementary regions. When S. aureus is present, it binds to the aptamer region of the chimera, opens the hairpin and unlocks the complementary sequence of MB. Subsequently, the MB is opened and intensive fluorescence signal is restored. To increase the sensitivity of the detection, signal amplification is achieved through strand displacement-based target recycling. With the catalysis of Nb. Bpu10I nicking endonuclease and Bsm DNA polymerase, the MB sequence can be cleaved and then elongated to form a complete duplex with the chimera, during which S. aureus is displaced from the chimera and proceeded to the next round of the reaction. This assay displays a linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the logarithm of the concentration of S. aureus within a broad concentration range from 80 CFU/mL to 8 x 10(6)CFU/mL. The detection limit of 39 CFU/mL can be derived. The assay was applied to detect S. aureus in different water samples, and satisfactory recovery and repeatability were achieved. Hence the designed chimera sequence and established assay have potential application in environmental pollution monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Eliminating the secondary structure of targeting strands for enhancement

SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA

DE Nucleic acid probes; Secondary structure; Fluorescent detection;
   Low-abundance detection; Point mutations
AB Nucleic acid probes are very useful tools in biological and medical science. However, the essential sensing mechanism of nucleic acid probes was prone to the interference of surrounding sequences. Especially when the target sequences formed secondary structures such as hairpin or quadruplex, the nucleic acid probes were hindered from hybridizing with target strands, greatly disabled the function of probes. Herein, we have established an Open strand based strategy for eliminating the influence of secondary structures on the performance of nucleic acid probes. The strategy was general toward different lengths, secondary structures and sequences of the targeting strand, and we found that the improvement was higher when the secondary structure of the targeting strand was more complicated. Experiments on synthetic single stranded DNA and real clinical genomic DNA samples were conducted for low abundance mutation detection, and the limit of detection for TERT-C228T and BRCA2 rs80359065 mutations could be 0.02% and 0.05% respectively, demonstrating the clinical practicability of our proposed strategy in low abundance mutation detection.

AB Salmonella is a widely distributed, extremely harmful bacteria, the presence of which requires confirmation via an on-site visual biosensor. In this study, we constructed a label-free, cascade amplification visualization biosensor for the sensitive and rapid detection of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium based on the RDTG principle (recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), duplex-specific enzyme (DSN) cleavage, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) extension and G-quadruplexes output). Following DNA extraction of Salmonella spp., the first step in the construction involved the recognition and amplification of nucleic acids, carried out by RPA, to achieve the first signal amplification within 10 min. This RPA product was then specifically cleaved by DSN to produce a large number of small double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products with 3'-OH within 15 min to achieve the second signal amplification. Thereafter, TdT was employed to empower these small 3'-OH dsDNA products to extend and produce a large number of long G-rich single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) within 20 min, thus realizing the third signal increase. These long G-rich ssDNA products displayed a color change that could be directly observed through the naked eye by adding H2O2/3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The RDTG biosensor for the detection of Salmonella spp. has several advantages, including a low limit of 6 cfu/mL. It is an isothermal-free instrument, simple to operate, with a rapid detection time of less than 1.5 h. Furthermore, it can be visually characterized and quantified by a microplate reader to detect Salmonella spp., in food and environmental samples, and it has broad application prospects.

AB Electrochemistry has been developed toward high spatial resolution and throughput during the past decades to match the growing demands for studying heterogeneous electrodes and nanomaterials that are widely used in electrocatalysis, electroanalysis and energy conversion. Combining optical methods with electrochemistry enables us to obtain local electrochemical information via a noninvasive way. Optical methods also possess high throughput, which are beneficial to investigate large amounts of nanoelectrodes or nanocatalysts simultaneously, and to develop electrochemical multiplex sensors. This article critically reviews the optical methods that have been developed with spatial resolution for imaging electrochemical reactions and processes in the nanometer-scale. Recent development on these methods, such as plasmonics-based electrochemical current microscopy (PECM), dark field microscopy (DFM), Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy (FLM) and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL), and research progress in the relevant fields, particularly nanocatalysis and single particle/molecule electrochemistry, will be briefly overviewed. Finally, current limitations and trends of these optical methods and potential strategies to further improve the spatial resolution of electrochemistry are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many methods for quantifying chlorinated paraffins (CPs) yield only a total concentration of the mixture as a single value. With appropriate analytical instrumentation and quantification methods, more reliable and detailed analysis can be performed by quantifying total concentrations of short-, medium-, and longchain CPs (SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs), and in the current optimal situation by quantifying individual carbon-chlorine congener groups (CnClm). Sample extraction and clean-up methods for other persistent organochlorines that have been adapted for recovery of CPs must be applied prior to quantification with appropriate quality assurance and quality control to ensure applicability of the methods for SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs. Part critical review, part tutorial, and part perspective, this paper provides practical guidance to analytical chemists who are interested in establishing a method for analysis of CPs in their lab facilities using commercial reference standards, or for expanding existing analysis of total CPs or SCCPs to analysis of SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs, or to analysis of CnClm congener groups.

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fouries transform infrared spectroscopy images manifested that the hydrothermal systhesis promoted the binding of Fe3O4 particles with g-C3N4. The enrichment performance of composites depended on their compositions, and the recovery of Hg(II) on C-m30 (with Fe3O4/g-C3N4 mass ratio 2:3) was higher than that on other ratios. Recorded data showed that ultrasound wave was an effective method for reducing the agglomeration of magnetic materials and enhancing their adsorption properties. The Hg signal obtained by 80% power input is 3.2 times stronger than the signal by strring mode. X-ray diffraction characterization of the recovered adsorbent showed that g-C3N4 needed to be updated after repeated use for four times. In addition, competitive adsorption may be main factor affecting the inhibitory effect of high concentration methylmercury on inorganic mercury. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit of the proposed method was 1.4 ng L-1 and relative standard deviation of 4.6% for 0.05 mu g L-1 Hg(II) was obtained. The linear calibration range was 0.005-0.4 mu g L. The accuracy of the method was verified through analysis of the certificated reference materials. The proposed method has been applied in the determination of inorganic Hg in natural water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work evaluates the possibility of placement of high-resolution imaging and single-cell analysis via laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) within precision medicine by assessing the suitability of LA-ICP-MS as a micro-analytical technique for the localization and quantification of membranous receptors in heterogeneous cell samples that express both the membrane-bound receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Staining of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 X4 and MDA-MB-468 was achieved using receptorspecific hybrid tracers, containing both a fluorophore and a DTPA single-lanthanide chelate. Prior to LA-ICP-MS imaging, fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) imaging was performed to localize the receptors, hereby enabling direct comparison. Based on the different expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR, a distinction could be made between the cell lines using both imaging modalities. Furthermore, FCM and LA-ICP-MS demonstrated complementary characteristics, as a more distinct discrimination could be made between both cell lines based on the EGFR-targeting hybrid tracer via LA-ICP-MS, due to the intrinsic CXCR4-related green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal present in the MDA-MB-231 X4 cells. Employing state-of-the-art LA-ICP-MS instrumentation in bidirectional area scanning mode for subcellular imaging of MDA-MB-231 X4 cells enabled the specific binding of the CXCR4-targeting hybrid tracer to the cell membrane to be clearly demonstrated. The stretching of cells over the glass substrate led to a considerably higher signal response for pixels at the cell edges, relative to the more central pixels. The determination of the expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR for the MDA-MB-468 cell line was performed using LA-ICP-MS single-cell analysis (sc-LA-ICP-MS) and external calibration, based on the quantitative ablation of Ho-spiked dried gelatin droplet standards. Additionally, a second calibration approach was applied based on spot ablation of highly homogeneous dried gelatin gels in combination with the determination of the ablated volume using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and yielded results which were in good agreement with the expression levels determined via flow cytometry (FC) and mass cytometry (MC). Hybrid tracers enable a direct comparison between (i) FCM and LA-ICP-MS imaging for the evaluation of the microscopic binding pattern and between (ii) FC, MC and sc-LA-ICP-MS for the quantification of receptor expression levels in single cells.

AB For the past several decades, lots of adsorbent nanomaterials have been adopted for the enrichment of mercuric compounds. In this paper, graphene oxide bounded silica particles were employed as the absorbent for online preconcentration of Hg(II), methylmercury (MeHg) and ethylmercury (EtHg) by solid phase extraction. The adsorbent offered satisfactory adsorption capacities of 40.7 for Hg(II), 91.4 for MeHg and 103.8 mg g(-1) for EtHg. Enrichment conditions such as type, concentration and volume of conditioning and eluting reagents were optimized. The pH, volume and flow rate of sample were also optimized. High enrichment factors (1963, 1881 and 1794 for Hg(II), MeHg and EtHg, respectively) were obtained with 10 mL sample (adjusted to pH 4-7) at 10 mL min(-1) flow rate, 5 mu L of 10 mM benzoic acid for elution and 4 mL of 1 mM 4-phenyl-3-aminothiourea for preconditioning. The detection limits obtained were downscaled to be 0.005 for Hg(II), 0.006 for MeHg and 0.009 ng L-1 for EtHg with relative standard deviations of all the analytes below 5%. Standard reference material and spiked water samples were analyzed for validating the method with satisfactory recoveries of 89-106%. The present method was successfully applied to determine mercury compounds in drinking water, and river and tap water, in which Hg(II), MeHg and EtHg were presented below the China's drinking standard limit of 1 mu g L-1.

ID SPECTROSCOPY
AB Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is an important method in analytical chemistry. A material can be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed from its FTIR spectrum. Spectrum denoising is commonly performed before online FTIR quantitative analysis. The average method requires a long time to collect spectra, which weakens real-time online analysis. The Savitzky-Golay smoothing method makes peaks smoother with the increase of window width, causing useful information to be lost. The sparse representation method is a common denoising method, that is used to reconstruct spectrum. However, for the randomness of noise, we can't achieve the sparse representation of noise. Traditional sparse representation algorithms only perform denoising once, and the noise can not be removed completely. FTIR spectrum denoising should therefore be performed in a progressive way. However, it is difficult to determine to what degree of denoising is required. Here, a fast progressive spectrum denoising combined with partial least squares method was developed for online FTIR quantitative analysis. Two real sample data sets were used to test the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results indicated that the progressive spectrum denoising method combined with the partial least squares method performed markedly better than other methods in terms of root mean squared error of prediction and coefficient of determination in the FTIR quantitative analysis.

AB The characterization of cancer tissues by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry images (MALDI-MSI) is of great interest because of the power of MALDI-MS to understand the composition of biological samples and the imaging side that allows for setting spatial boundaries among tissues of different nature based on their compositional differences.
   In tissue-based cancer research, information on the spatial location of necrotic/tumoral cell populations can be approximately known from grayscale images of the scanned tissue slices. This study proposes as a major novelty the introduction of this physiologically-based information to help in the performance of unmixing methods, oriented to extract the MS signatures and distribution maps of the different tissues present in biological samples. Specifically, the information gathered from grayscale images will be used as a local rank constraint in Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares MCR-ALS) for the analysis of MALDI-MSI of cancer tissues. The use of this constraint, setting absence of certain kind of tissues only in clear zones of the image, will help to improve the performance of MCR-ALS and to provide a more reliable definition of the chemical MS fingerprint and location of the tissues of interest.
   The general strategy to address the analysis of MALDI-MSI of cancer tissues will involve the study of the MCR-ALS results and the posterior use of MCR-ALS scores as dimensionality reduction for image segmentation based on K-means clustering. The resolution method will provide the MS signatures and their distribution maps for each tissue in the sample. Then, the resolved distribution maps for each biological component (MCR scores) will be submitted as initial information to K-means clustering for image segmentation to obtain information on the boundaries of the different tissular regions in the samples studied. MCR-ALS prior to K-means not only provides the desired dimensionality reduction, but additionally resolved non-biological signal contributions are not used and the weight given to the different biological components in the segmentation process can be modulated by suitable preprocessing methods.

AB A rapid and sensitive electrochemical biosensor was constructed to detect Salmonella using invA gene biosensor. The biosensing was based on polyrrole-reduced graphene oxide (PPy-rGO) nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and signal amplification with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin biofunctionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-HRP-SA). PPy-rGO was prepared at 60 degrees C by chemical reduction of PPy-functionalized graphene oxide (PPy-GO) that was synthesized by in situ polymerization at room temperature. The detection signal was amplified via enzymatic reduction of H2O2 in the presence of hydroquinone (HQ) using AuNPs-HRP-SA as nanotag. Under optimal conditions, the differential pulse voltametric (DPV) signal from the biosensor was linearly related to the logarithm of target invA gene concentrations from 1.0 x 10(-16) to 1.0 x 10(-10) M, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 4.7 x 10(-17) M. The biosensor can also detect Salmonella in the range of 9.6 to 9.6 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1), with LOD of 8.07 CFU mL(-1). The biosensor showed good regeneration ability, acceptable selectivity, repeatability and stability, which bode well as an alternative method for Salmonella screening. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work describes the development of a paper-based platform for highly sensitive detection of diclofenac. The quantification of this anti-inflammatory drug is of importance in clinical (e.g. quality and therapeutic control) and environmental (e.g. emerging contaminant determination) areas. The easy-tohandle platform here described consists of a carbon-ink paper-based working electrode and two metallic wires, provided by a gold-plated standard connector, as reference and counter electrodes. The porous paper matrix enables the preconcentration of the sample, decoupling sample and detection solutions. Thus, relatively large sample volumes can be used, which significantly improves the sensitivity of the method. A wide dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, between 0.10 and 100 mu M, was obtained for diclofenac determination. Due to the predominance of adsorption at the lowest concentrations, there were two linear concentration ranges: one comprised between 0.10 and 5.0 mu M (with a slope of 0.85 mu AM(-1)) and the other between 5.0 and 100 mu M (with a slope of 0.48 mu A mu M-1). A limit of detection of 70 nM was achieved with this simple device that provided accurate results with an RSD of ca. 5%. The platform was applied for diclofenac quantification in spiked tap water samples. The versatility of this design enabled the fabrication of a multiplexed platform containing eight electrochemical cells that work independently. The low cost, small size and simplicity of the device allow on-site analysis, which is very useful for environmental monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new cyclometalated iridium complex, [(bt)(2)Ir(bpy-Fc)PF6 (bt = 2-phenylbenzothiazole, bpy-Fc = 4-ferrocenecarbonyl hydrazinocarbonyl-4'-methyl- 2,2'-bipyridine) (probe 1) was designed and synthesized for rapid photoluminescent (PL) and electrochemiluminescent (ECL) sensing of hypochlorite (ClO-). Probe 1 exhibits weak PL and ECL emissions attributed to its electron transfer process. In the presence of ClO-, the cleavage of the hydrazine-linked Fc moiety in probe 1 led to the enhancement of both PL and ECL. The photophysical and ECL properties of probe 1 were investigated and the proposed mechanism of the luminescence enhancement was confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and PL and ECL investigations. In addition, the role of the Fc group in probe 1 in intra- and intermolecular electron transfer processes in the absence and presence of ClO- is demonstrated for both PL and ECL processes. Further, a "switch-on" multi-signal method was developed for sensitive and selective detection of ClO- with detection limits of 466 nM and 302 nM via PL and ECL techniques, respectively. Further, probe 1 was successfully applied for PL imaging of ClO- in living macrophage cells. This work demonstrates that cyclometalated iridium complex bearing recognition and quenching groups is a promising "switch-on" probe in aqueous solutions to image living cells with high sensitivity and selectivity for biomedical applications.

AB As an important "food and drug dual-use" product, chrysanthemums are widely used in both botanical medicine and food applications. However, the misuse of pesticides during chrysanthemum cultivation makes pesticide residue monitoring crucial. The aim of the present work was to address this practical demand for the simultaneous determination of multiple pesticide residues in various species of chrysanthemums. Both the sample pre-treatment and instrumental methods were systematically investigated. Seven chrysanthemum samples were extracted using acetonitrile and purified by dispersive solid-phase extraction with amino-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-NH2) and C18 as the cleanup co-adsorbents. After optimizing the amounts of MWCHTs-NH2 and C18, matrix effects could not be avoided during LC-MS/MS analysis of 112 pesticides, although satisfactory recoveries were obtained. The use of SFC-MS/MS was evaluated, which demonstrated the significant positive role of SFC-MS/MS in reducing the matrix effects during pesticide residue analysis. In addition, the use of SFC-MS/MS permitted a shorter run time and afforded greater analytical efficiency. Method validation was further performed to evaluate the linearity, sensitivity, recovery, and precision of the developed method. Good linearity was observed for 92% of the analytes in the concentration range of 2-250 mu g L-1 for all seven of the chrysanthemum samples. The LODs of the 112 pesticides ranged from 0.01 to 31.41 mu g L-1, depending on the sample, while the mean recoveries of all of the spiked pesticides ranged from 81.8% to 102% for concentrations of 20, 50, and 200 mu g kg(-1). These results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the developed method for the simultaneous determination of multi-pesticides in various chrysanthemum samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction procedure based on primary amine phase separation was developed as a novel approach for the pretreatment of biological fluids. The procedure assumes primary amine dissolution in the aqueous sample phase, resulting in the creation of a homogeneous sample solution followed by phase separation and analyte extraction in the presence of a polar, water-miscible organic solvent. The phenomenon of primary amine phase separation from homogeneous aqueous solution in the presence of a polar, water-miscible organic solvent was studied in detail and applied for separation and preconcentration in chemical analysis for the first time. The suggested approach was used for the HPLC-UV determination of meropenem as a proof-of-concept analyte in human plasma and serum samples. Under optimal conditions, the detector response of meropenem was linear in the concentration range of 0.1-100.0 mg L-1. The limit of detection was calculated from a blank test based on 3 sigma, was 0.03 mg L-1. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Abnormal levels of Cys, Hcy and GSH are associated with various diseases, thus monitoring biothiols is of great significance. In this work, a dual-emission responsive near-infrared fluorescent probe NIR-NBD for detecting Hcy and Cys/GSH was developed based on the conjugation of a dicyanoisophorone based fluorophore (NIR-OH) and 7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD). To our surprise, the addition of Hcy induced significant fluorescence enhancement at both 549 and 697 nm; while Cys/GSH resulted in major fluorescence emission at 697 nm. The detection limit was determined to be 33.2 nM for Cys, 33.5 nM for Hcy, and 34.4 nM for GSH. Therefore, the probe can be used for discriminative detection of Hcy and Cys/GSH. Moreover, fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells indicated that the probe was cell membrane permeable and could be used for visualizing Hcy and Cys/GSH in living cells.

AB Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) have been demonstrated as an excellent material for transistors, miniaturized devices and sensors due to their high carrier mobility, stability, scattering-free ballistic transport of carriers etc. Herein, we have designed a biosensor to selectively detect methyl parathion (MP, organophosphorus pesticide) using glutaraldehyde (Glu) cross-linked with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) immobilized on s-SWCNTs wrapped with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The fabricated biosensor was characterized and confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). In the presence of MP, the effective interaction between AChE and MP favours the accumulation of MP-AChE complex on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface which reduces the electron transfer property. Based on this interaction, detection of various concentration of MP was demonstrated by SWV using BSA/AChE-Glu-s-SWCNTs composite modified electrode. The proposed biosensor exhibited a wide linear range (WLR) for MP target in 100 mM phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (pH 7.4) from 1 x 10(-10) M to 5 x 10(-6) M with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.75 x 10(-11) M. In addition, the BSA/AChE-Glu-s-SWCNTs/GCE biosensor showed good repeatability and reproducibility for MP detection. Moreover, the proposed biosensor showed better electrode stability when stored at 4 degrees C. This new electrochemical biosensor is also exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity for MP, which made it possible to test MP in real strawberry and apple juices. Furthermore, the BSA/AChE-Glu-s-SWCNTs/GCE offered a favourable electron transfer between the acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCI) and electrode interface than BSA/AChE-s-SWCNTs/GCE, s-SWCNTs/GCE and bare GCE.

AB A simple proximity hybridization-induced on particle DNA walker was designed for ultrasensitive detection of proteins, for example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) secreted by cancer cells, in which the DNA walker was activated by specific target binding and powered by an enzymatic cleavage to produce amplified signal. High-density FAM-labeled hairpin oligonucleotides (FAM-DNA1) were functionalized on AuNPs to construct three-dimensional (3D) DNA tracks. The specific binding of PDGF-BB with two aptamer probes (DNA3 and DNA4) led to the proximity hybridization-induced DNA displacement and the free of DNA walker (DNA2) to perform movement on the 3D tracks by an enzymatic cleavage, resulting in the release of massive FAM-DNA1 fragments from the AuNPs and the generation of fluorescent signal. This DNA walker based sensing strategy could detect PDGF-BB in a concentration range of 4 orders of magnitude with a detection limit down to sub-pM level. The practical applicability of the assay was demonstrated by detecting PDGF-BB secreted from MCF-7 cells with satisfactory results. The proposed DNA walker based assay could conveniently detect PDGF-BB with high sensitivity and good accuracy, along with the good extensibility of the assay, showing promise for practical diagnosis.

AB Since the discovery of the "fish arsenic" arsenobetaine in a mushroom, arsenic species have been studied in all kinds of mushrooms, with very diverse results, for more than 20 years. Depending on the fungal species, inorganic arsenic, methylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine and a couple of other arsenic-containing compounds have been detected in all kinds of concentrations in natural samples. A rule to predict the arsenic speciation of a new mushroom is yet to be found. Some research has been devoted to the question about the origin of the different arsenic species in mushrooms. It is still not clear whether mushrooms are able to transform arsenic by themselves or if they just take it up from the environment.
   For the determination of the arsenic species in mushrooms, high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is used most of the times, but a few alternative approaches exist. This review will give an overview of these different techniques and critically discuss them. The arsenic species that have been found in mushrooms so far will be summarized, and the work that has been devoted to unraveling the origins of these compounds will be discussed in depth. The interesting phenomenon of arsenic hyperaccumulation by mushrooms will be reviewed as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An electrochemical sensor based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified by three-dimensional graphene (3D-GE) and polyglutamic acid (PGA) was developed to quantitatively detect Amoxicillin (AMX), a worldwide used antibiotic. AMX response at PGA/3D-GE/GCE involving the transfer of one electron and an equal number of protons were determined using electrochemical approaches. Density functional theory simulations were performed to give insights on the reaction mechanism of AMX on the surface of the modified electrode. When the optimization of the experimental conditions was completed, the linear range of AMX was 2-60 mu M. Besides, the detection limit was calculated as 0.118 mu M(S/N = 3). And the modified electrode could detect the concentration of the AMX in human urine samples. Overall, the developed PGA/3D-GE/GCE for determination of AMX shows great potentials in practice.

AB Highly N-doped SiC was presented as an optimal electrode for electrochemical immunoassays with a far higher sensitivity than chemiluminescence detection. As the first step, the electrochemical properties of highly N-doped SiC, such as the double-layer capacitance (C-dl), rate constant for electron transfer (k(app)) and ideal polarizable potential range (electrochemical window) were analyzed and compared with those of Au, Pt, and graphite electrodes. The highly N-doped SiC electrode was used for the quantification of oxidized 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) which was widely used as chromogenic substrate for commercialized immunoassay kits. In order to enhance the sensitivity for the quantification of the oxidized TMB the chronoamperometry was applied to avoid the background current of i-V measurement. Finally, the chronoamperometry based on the highly N-doped SiC electrode was applied to commercial immunoassay kits for the medical diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human hepatitis B surface antigen (hHBsAg). The chronoamperometric measurement based on the highly N-doped SiC electrode was proved to detect at far lower limits in comparison with the conventional optical density measurement as well as the chemiluminescence assay based on luminol as a chemiluminescent probe.

AB Methods for in-situ measurements of heavy metal ions in coastal sediment pore water to elucidate fine-scale biogeochemical and environmental processes are highly required but have rarely been reported. In this work, an all-solid-state lead-selective microelectrode (Pb2+-IS mu E) based on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(sodium4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) modified gold wire with a diameter of 14 mu m has been fabricated. The proposed Pb2+-IS mu E is capable of in-situ measurement of Pb2+ in coastal sediment pore water at millimeter depth intervals. The Pb2+-IS mu E shows a Nernstian response for Pb2+ within the activity range of 2.1 x 10(-9)-2.1 x 10(-4) M (S = 28.1 +/- 1.3 mV/dec, R-2 = 0.998) in 0.5 M NaCl, and the detection limit is 6.4 x 10(-10) M. By lowering the microelectrode into a coastal sediment core with a micro-manipulator, the proposed Pb2+-IS mu E allows the direct measurement of the vertical distribution profile of Pb2+ in the pore water. The in-situ measurement of Pb2+ using the microsensor could avoid the problems of sample handling. Moreover, the detection system can be extended to assess the vertical distribution profiles of other heavy metal ions in sediment pore water by using different ion-selective microelectrodes.

AB A novel and ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bioassay has been developed for the detection of atrazine (ATZ), whereby bifunctional S, N-codoped carbon dots (S, N-CDs) and activated mesoporous bicarbons (BCs) have been innovatively integrated to synergistically amplify the ECL signal. When endogenous dissolved O-2 is used as a coreactant, its sluggish reduction hinders the enhancement of ECL intensity of the luminophore, thus restricting its further application in bioanalysis. Here, bifunctional S, N-CDs severe as not only the ECL luminophore but the coreaction accelerator of dissolved O-2 to generate more intermediates to boost the coreaction without using any other coreactant and coreaction accelerator. The as-formed nanoarchitectures of BCs possess enlarged surface area as the nanocarriers. They could provide adequate active sites for immobilization of tyrosinase (Tyr), which greatly prompts the ECL bioassay applications. Such a smart integration of bifunctional S, N-CDs, activated mesoporous BCs and the enzyme inhibition reaction achieves a unique and attractive high-performance signal-on ECL bioassay, realizing ultrasensitive detection of ATZ. Under the optimal condition, this bioassay exhibits two linear ranges, from 0.0001 to 0.01 mu g L-1 and 0.01-20 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 0.08 ng L-1 at signal to noise ratio of 3. The as-fabricated assay is sensitive and economical, opening a new way for the enhancement of ECL signal output and a versatile strategy for ultrasensitive ECL bioanalysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The FIA system comprises two in-house detectors, a contactless conductivity detector and a light emitting diode (LED) detector. The contactless detector was built as a flow-through detection cell with axial electrodes, commonly known as capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C4D) and the diode detector was fabricated based on the concept of paired emitter detector diodes (PEDD). With appropriate dilution of urine, the sample is directly injected into a stream of glycine-NaOH buffer pH 8.8 (the gas donor stream) and is carried by the carrier through a urease minicolumn for on-line enzymatic hydrolysis. The generated NH3 diffuses from the carrier stream through a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane into a stream of deionized water (the acceptor stream) leading to an increase in the signal at the C4D due to the NH3 dissolution in the water. In this system, creatinine is determined based on the Jaffe reaction by merging a stream of alkaline picrate with the gas donor stream. The change in color is detected using the PEDD equipped with two green LEDs. Under the optimum condition, the linear range of urea and creatinine were 30-240 mg L-1 and 10-500mg L-1, with limits of detection of 9.0 mg L-1 and 0.9 mg L-1, respectively. The proposed system provides satisfactorily good precision (RSD < 3%), with sample throughput of 31 sample h(-1) for the two analytes. The FIA system tolerates potential interference commonly found in human urine. The system was successfully applied and validated with selected reference methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, silver nanostructures decorated magnetic nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements were prepared via heat induced catalytic activity of ZnO nanostructures. The ZnO/Fe3O4 composite was first prepared by dispersing pre-formed magnetic nanoparticles into alkaline zinc nitrate solutions. After annealing of the precipitates, the formed ZnO/Fe3O4 composites were successfully decorated with silver nanostructures by dispersing the composites into silver nitrate/ethylene glycol solution at 95 degrees C in water bath. To find the optimal condition when preparing Ag/ZnO/Fe3O4 composites for SERS measurements, factors such as reaction time and concentration of silver nitrate were studied. Results indicated that the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on ZnO/Fe3O4 was significantly improved with the assistance of ZnO. The concentration of silver nitrate and reaction time affected the morphologies and sizes of the formed composites and optimal condition in preparation of the composites for SERS measurement was found using 100 mM of silver nitrate with a reaction time of 20 min. Under optimized conditions, the obtained SERS intensities were highly reproducible. The substrates were applied for quantitative analysis of uric acid in aqueous solution and a linear response for concentrations up to 10 mu M was obtained. Successful application of these prepared composites to determine uric acid in urine sample without any pretreatment of the urine sample was done. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Routine detection of Pb2+ is of great importance to environmental monitoring because of its deleterious effects on human health and environment. In this work, an easy-to-operate method for the one-step detection of Pb2+ was developed based on the phage-Pb2+ interactions and their influence on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band of AuNPs. AuNPs grow in-situ on the surface of M13 phages and the resulting phage-AuNP networks were directly used for lead sensing. The addition of Pb2+ facilitates further growth of the parent AuNPs and results in a blue shift of the SPR absorption peak. By integrating AuNPs preparation and sensing procedure into one step, a simplified Pb2+ detection approach was developed with improved sensitivity and shortened analysis time. By quantifying A(528) with UV-vis spectrometer, a linear range of 0.5-5.0 mu mol L-1 together with a limit of detection of 45 nmol L-1 was obtained. The one-step approach avoided complicated AuNPs preparation and functionalization process, and got rid of the unstable problems of AuNPs for long-term preservation, offering simple and cost-effective Pb2+ detection method for resource-poor settings.

AB We investigated the effect of oxidative stress (OS) on lipidomic perturbations in the subcellular fractions and exosomes of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nUHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). We treated HEK 293 cells with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and fractionated the cell lysates using AF4 to determine the change in size and population of the subcellular fractions and exosomes, and to obtain narrow size fractions for lipid analysis. A total of 438 lipids from 642 identified species-including oxidized lipids-were quantified. The relative amount of secreted exosomes increased by 28% during OS, whereas the amount of subcellular species decreased by 35%. There was a significant increase in the level of oxidized phospholipids in the mitochondrion-enriched subcellular fractions, but not in the exosomes. Most high-abundance triacylglycerol (TG) species increased in the stressed cells, whereas they decreased in the exosomes. During OS, ceramides involved in the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway were accumulated in the subcellular fractions, whereas their levels were unaffected in the exosomes. The present study demonstrated that AF4 and nUHPLC-ESI-MS/MS can be used to investigate lipid alterations in subcellular and extracellular species during OS, and the pathological relationships in diseases caused by reactive oxygen species.

AB It is challenging to design and fabricate new and high-performance cellulose-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs), due to the indistinct chiral recognition mechanism and the inherent difficulty to control the structure of cellulose derivatives. Herein, taking advantage of the high regioselective benzoylation of cellulose in 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, a series of regioselectively substituted cellulose mixed esters, cellulose 6-benzoate-2,3-phenylcarbamate, are directly obtained by a facile two-steps route without protecting and deprotecting process. The resultant cellulose mixed esters exhibit high chiral recognition capability. In particular, when the benzoate group has an electron-donating substituent on phenyl ring, such as 4-tert-butyl group, the corresponding regioselectively substituted cellulose mixed esters have much better enantioseparation capability than cellulose tri(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), which is commercially available as Chiralcel OD column, one of the most powerful CSPs. More importantly, via adjusting the chemical structure of cellulose derivatives and adding a post-treatment process to optimize their chiral recognition properties, the chiral recognition mechanism is clearly revealed. The synergy of the hydrophobic helical conformation, weak hydrogen-bond donating ability and appropriate distribution of substituents of cellulose derivatives is essential to fabricate high-performance CSPs.

AB Miniaturised photometric detection cell based on the 150 mu m I. D. L-shaped fused silica capillary (L-cell) and silica optical fibre is discussed in this paper. Light enters the cell via right angle bend and transmitted light is collected by silica optical fibre inserted into the capillary outlet. Ray trace analysis reveals that L-cell geometry works as a waveguide and effectively eliminates parasitic light, which is guided by the wall of any fused silica capillary cell. Low total level of stray light is further documented by measurement of absorbance of acetone-water mixture at 266 nm with the observed upper limit of dynamic range 2.2 AU. 3-mm L-cell has a volume of 53 nL and exhibits effective optical path 2.7 mm. Cell variance determined in the flow rate range 1-10 mu L min(-1) indicates, that 3-mm L-cell is optimal for use with 200-300 mu m I. D. capillary columns. Furthermore, isocratic separation of alkylbenzenes mixture at 0.5 mu L min(-1) demonstrates effective use of 0.5-mm L-cell (8.8 nL) and possible performance of longer L-cells with high efficiency 100 mu m I.

AB A novel and simplified gradient IC-HRMS approach is presented in this work for forensic profiling of ionic energetic material residues, including low-order explosives and gunshot residue (GSR). This new method incorporated ethanolic eluents to facilitate direct coupling of IC and HRMS without auxiliary post-column infusion pumps that are traditionally used to assist with gas phase transfer. Ethanolic eluents also enabled better integration with an in-service protocol for direct analysis of high-order organic explosives by IC-HRMS, without requiring solvent exchange before injection. Excellent method performance was achieved, enabling both full scan qualitative and quantitative analysis, as required. In particular, linearity for 19 targeted compounds yielded R-2 > 0.99 across several orders of magnitude, with trace analysis possible at the low-mid pg level. Reproducibility and mass accuracies were also excellent, with peak area %RSDs < 10%, t(R) %RSDs < 0.4% and delta(m/z) < 3 ppm. The method was applied to targeted analysis of latent fingermarks and swabbed hand sweat samples to determine contact with a black-powder substitute containing nitrate, benzoate and perchlorate. When combined with principal component analysis (PCA), the effect of time since handling on recorded signals could be interpreted further in order to support forensic investigations. In a second, non-targeted application, PCA using full scan IC-HRMS data enabled classification of GSR from three different types of ammunition. An additional 20 markers of GSR were tentatively identified in silico, in addition to the 15 anions detected during targeted analysis. This new approach therefore streamlines and adds consistency and flexibility to forensic analysis of ionic energetic material. Furthermore, it also has implications for targeted, non-targeted and suspect screening applications in other fields by expanding the separation space to low molecular weight inorganic and organic anions.

AB Bioinspired materials have attracted great attention due to their great functionality, bioactivity and biocompability. In particular, electroactive polyamino acid surfaces endow preparation of robust coatings for various applications. In this research article, preparation of carbon nanotubes doped polyglycine coated electrodes and their applications in the biomedical field such as DNA hybridization, DNA-antitumor agent interaction and antitumor agent determination were described. This biosensing platform was created using a simple, reproducible and fast in situ and one-pot electropolymerization procedure onto graphite surfaces by cyclic voltammetry. The coated electrodes were characterized with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After the characterization studies, bioapplications of the proposed electrode were demonstrated. The new electrode led to significant improvement for the investigation of the electrochemical behavior of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). 6-fold and 5-fold improvements were obtained for oxidation of the electroactive DNA bases, guanine (G) and adenine (A), respectively over the bare electrode. For these steps, each electrode was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Then, DNA hybridization studies were performed in the light of these results. The proposed electrode allowed the quantification of specific target DNA down to 11.2 fM in serum samples (n = 3). In addition, it constituted a sensitive `biosensing platform for electrochemical monitoring of the interaction between dsDNA and a commonly used antitumor agent, Mitomycin C. Mitomycin C determination was also carried out using the inhibition effect occurred at the guanine oxidation signal. The detection limit of this antitumor agent was found as 1.78 mg L-1 in untreated serum samples (n = 3). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, a simple electrochemical co-deposition was utilized to synthesis the gold and zirconia nanocomposites modified graphene nanosheets on glassy carbon electrode (Au-ZrO2-GNs/GCE) for electrocatalytic analysis of methyl parathion (MP). According to Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), the gold nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of graphene-based nanocomposite. The AuZrO2-GNs/GCE based sensor exhibited superior capacity for MP detection, ascribed to the strong affinity of zirconia towards the phosphoric group, as well as the high catalytic activity and good conductivity of Au-GNs. The best fabrication and work conditions were then obtained by systematically optimization of the electrodeposition process, pH value and enrichment time. Compared to the gold nanoparticles, zirconia or graphene modified electrodes, AueZrO(2)-GNs/GCE sensor displayed superior electro-catalytic response toward MP oxidation. The sensor response current of square wave voltammetry was highly linearly correlated with the MP concentrations range of 1-100 ngmL(-1) and 100-2400 ngmL(-1) with the detection limit of 1 ng mL(-1). The Au-ZrO2-GNs/GCE nanocomposite sensor showed excellent accuracy and reproducibility for detection of MP in Chinese cabbage samples, providing a new method for efficient pesticide detection in practical applications.

AB From a safety perspective, it is vital to have fast responding gas sensors for toxic and explosive gases in the event of a gas leak. Amperometric gas sensors have been developed for such a purpose, but their response times are often relatively slow - on the order of 50 seconds or more. In this work, we have developed sensors for hydrogen gas that demonstrate ultra-fast response times. The sensor consists of an array of gold microchannel electrodes, electrodeposited with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to enable hydrogen electroactivity. Very thin layers (similar to 9 mu m) of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) result in an extremely fast response time of only 2 s, significantly faster than the other conventional electrodes examined (unmodified Pt electrode, and PtNP modified Au electrode). The RTIL layer in the micro-channels is much thinner than the channel length, showing an interesting yet complex diffusion pattern and characteristic thin-layer behavior. At short times (e.g. on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry), the oxidation current is smaller and steady-state in nature, compared to macrodisk electrodes. At longer times (e.g. using long-term chronoamperometry), the diffusion layer is large for all surfaces and extends to the liquid/gas phase boundary, where the gas is continuously replenished from the flowing gas stream. Thus, the current response is the largest on the microchannel electrode, resulting in the highest sensitivity and lowest limit of detection for hydrogen. These microchannel electrodes appear to be highly promising surfaces for the ultrafast detection of hydrogen gas, particularly at relevant concentrations close to, or below, the lower explosive limit of 4 vol-% H-2.

AB In clinical practice, the excess concentration of bilirubin can trigger diseases such as neonatal jaundice, hepatic failure, septicemia, and so on. The concentration of bilirubin is one of important clinical indexes to evaluate patients with hepatic function disease in clinical practice. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop a rapid detection technique detecting the bilirubin in body fluids. Here, a new electrochemical sensor based on Au nanoparticles/tetrathiafulvalene-carboxylate functionalized reduced grapheneoxide 0D-2D heterojunction(AuNPs/TTF-COOH/RGO) was fabricated for the discrimination of bilirubin in real human blood. The TTF-COOH could effectively repair electron conductivity of RGO nanosheets, decrease interface resistance, and also enhance the dispersity of TTF-COOH/RGO nanosheets in water. What's more, the S atoms of TTF-COOH can bonding the gold nano-particles (AuNPs) to fabricate a 0D-2D heterojunction with excellent biocompatibility and enhanced specific surface area. After bilirubin oxidases were self-assembled on the surface of AuNPs, a specific recognition interface was formed as a sensor for the detection of bilirubin. The heterojunction showed enhanced interface electron transfer rate, excellent biocompatibility, and also prominent electrocatalytic activity for the high efficiency catalysis of bilirubin. The sensor shows a linear response for bilirubin from 2.66 to 83 mmol L-1 and a low detection limit of 0.74 mmol L-1 at 3s. This work provides one novel approach to detection of bilirubin by functional RGO nanosheets, and broadens the application area of RGO nanosheets in selective catalysis and detection of biomolecule in biological specimens, such as blood, urine.

AB In this work, we reported a novel electrochemical sensor for enantiorecognition of electrochemically inactive aspartic acid (Asp) enantiomers. By combining sol-gel processing with molecular imprinting technology, an enantioselective interface of molecularly imprinted sol-gel (MIS) films with imprinted cavities was prepared on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In order to obtain the electrochemical responses of electrochemically inactive Asp, the ternary derivative of (L)-aspartic, ((L)-aspartic acid) Cu2+ (N-carbobenzoxy-(L)-aspartic acid), was used as the template for fabrication of MIS. The stripping currents of target molecules could be detected by square-wave stripping voltammetry due to the reduction of cupric ion on the modified electrode. The resulted sensor showed good adsorbability to (L)-Asp derivative, and the recognition efficiency was obtained as 2.1. Meanwhile, the (L)-Asp was quantitatively determined by the MIS sensor. As a result, the proposed electrochemical sensor could be regarded as a potential platform for enantiorecognition of electrochemically inactive chiral compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the recent years, the number of commercial products containing engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has increased exponentially. Consequently, the toxicological profile of ENMs on the ecosystems as well as on human health has to be carefully evaluated. Nanotoxicology, an interdisciplinary research area devoted to assessing the hazards associated with ENMs, is expanding rapidly. Many physicochemical techniques and biochemical methodologies have been proposed and are currently used to characterize nanomaterials from a toxicological point of view. Electroanalytical and bioelectrochemical methods can be useful in expanding the repertoire of accessible nanotoxicity-assessment technologies and to accelerate the testing and screening of the toxicological effects of ENMs. These methods can be used for elucidating the toxicological behavior of ENMs at single cell, cell population and whole-organism levels, for in vitro and in vivo measurements, respectively. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the bioelectrochemical approaches that have been proposed for ENMs toxicity assessment. Furthermore, an overview on cutting-edge electroanalytical devices with a potential impact to this peculiar application is provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly specific and sensitive isothermal method for mercury detection using DNA-conjugated upconversion nanoparticles is reported. A single-stranded DNA containing thymine bases, used as the Hg2+-capturing element through the formation of thymine-Hg2+-thymine complex, is covalently attached to the NaYF4: Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles. Luminescence resonance energy transfer takes place between the NaYF4: Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles as donor and DNA-intercalating SYBR Green I as the acceptor upon excitation of 980 nm. The sensitivity and selectivity toward Hg2+ are enhanced using the nicking enzyme, Nt. Alwl, which leads to signal amplification. By monitoring the ratio of acceptor emission to a reference peak, the presence of Hg2+ ions are quantitatively determined with a lower detection limit of 0.14 nM, which is much lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit of Hg2+ in drinking water.

AB This work describes a new simultaneous on-flow dual parallel enzyme assay based on immobilized enzyme reactors (ICERs) with mass spectrometry detection. The novelty of this work relies on the fact that two different enzymes can be screened at the same time with only one single sample injection and in less than 6 min. The system consisted of two immobilized capillary enzyme reactors (ICERs). More specifically, the ICERs comprised two different enzymes that were accommodated in parallel and were placed between a liquid chromatography (LC) system and a mass spectrometer (MS). The resulting system could be adapted to other types of enzyme reactors with different supports. All the elements in the system were interfaced by means of two 10-port/two-position switching valves. Different tubing dimensions allowed us to monitor the activity of each enzyme independently during the same analysis. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) bioreactors were chosen as proof of concept. Acetylcholine (ACh) was used as substrate; the area of its protonated enzymatic hydrolysis product ion, choline, [M+H](+) m/z 104.0, was monitored in the presence and absence of the standard cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine. This method proved to be an interesting tool for fast, simultaneous, and independent label-free dual enzyme inhibitor assay. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Waterborne polymers are increasingly applied in our society, replacing traditional solvent-borne coatings and thus reducing environmental impact of coatings. The majority of waterborne dispersions are stabilized by the incorporation of neutralizable carboxylic acid functionality. The characterization of synthetic waterborne polymer systems can be performed by a wide variety of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. However, none of these approaches is able to determine the acid functionality distribution over the molecular-weight distribution directly. In this research, an innovative approach is developed which enables this analysis. The approach is based on the specific and complete derivatization of carboxylic acid functionality with phenacylbromide.
   Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis of the derivatized polymers is performed followed by ultraviolet-(UV) and refractive index (RI) detection, enabling the quantitative determination of the acid content per molecular weight fraction. The applicability of the developed protocol is shown for various polymer systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have recently obtained extraordinarily high efficiencies and sharp peaks using narrow open tubular (OT) columns for liquid chromatographic separations. On-column focusing is commonly observed in liquid chromatography, but this effect alone could not satisfactorily explain the sharpness of these peaks. In this work we investigated the reasons that could have led to the peak sharpness. We hypothesized initially that analytes confined in a narrow OT column might have significantly reduced analyte diffusivities and the reduced diffusivities consequently resulted in the peak sharpness. This hypothesis was invalidated immediately after we measured the diffusion coefficients and did not notice any noticeable diffusivity increases of the analytes inside such columns. We then designed an experiment and revealed a "re-focusing effect". Investigation of this re-focusing effect eventually led us to the observation of a gradient focusing caused by the composition difference between the eluent and the sample matrix. It was this gradient focusing that had contributed primarily to the peak sharpness. On the basis of this insightful understanding, we further developed a simple and economic approach to perform pico-gradient narrow open tubular liquid chromatographic separations.

AB Quantitatively paper-based senor is performed with simple distance-readout on mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter paper based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-mediated alginate hydrogel. The method is accomplished with the aid of the inhibition effect of target samples on the AChE enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylcholine, which changes the pH value of the solution to release Ca2+ and trigger alginate hydrogelation. The viscosity of the solution is thus regulated with the presence of target samples in the reaction mixture, leading to a significant change in the diffusion diameter of the solution spotted on the filter paper. The concentration in the sample is quantitatively determined by ruler-measureable diffusion diameter of the spot on the paper. With successfully application for quantitatively sensing of organophosphorus pesticides (ON), we show that the method exhibits excellent reproducibility with RSD (n = 5) as low as 0.09% and good selectivity for detection of OPs. The dynamic range of the method is up to 66.7 ng/mL with the limit-of-detection (LOD) of 3.3 ng/mL. The present study provides a new approach for developing paper-based sensors with quantitative distance-readout, by utilizing enzymatic inhibition to modulate liquid viscosity, which would be of value for target detection in complex samples.

AB A high throughput, and eco-friendly method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) was established for the determination of trace pollutants in water. A laboratory-made SPME device coated with a metal organic framework (MIL-100(M)) was fabricated for the on-site enrichment of triazine herbicides in environmental water, and the device was directly subjected to DART ionization (<20 s) for high resolution MS. The interactions between the target analytes and sorbents were investigated to improve the SPME device targeting specific pollutants, as well as to improve the desorption and ionization processes with DART-MS. Other factors were also systematically studied to obtain the optimal conditions, including pH, salinity, extraction temperature, pressure at the Vapur (R) interface, linear rail moving speed, gas temperature, extraction time, and sample volume. The limit of detection of target compounds were 5.0-50.0 ng L-1 and the recoveries ranged from of 92.4%-125.7%. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, novel porous carbon composites were successfully prepared with graphene-modified high-internal-phase emulsions (HIPEs) via a simple process of polymerization followed by carbonization. The morphology of the macroporous composites was observed and the verification of structural and functional groups were verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and other characterizations techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FI-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and Raman spectroscopy. The prepared porous carbon composites were applied to farmland water for the simultaneous adsorption of triazine herbicides and the conditions of extraction and desorption were optimized. Due to the pi-pi interaction and hydrophobic interaction between triazine herbicides and carbon composites, the maximum adsorption capacity of simazine, prometon and prometryn were 33.4, 34.5 and 33.8 mu g g(-1), respectively. Adsorption and desorption of triazine herbicides can be achieved in 10 min, and high-speed mass transfer was observed. The calibration curves of three triazine herbicides were linear (R-2 >= 0.9996) in the range from 25.0 to 500.0 ng mL(-1). The LOD of three triazine herbicides by using the proposed SPE-HPLC-DAD method were 2.5-5.6 ng mL(-1). All the results suggest that these materials may be useful for more efficient hazardous residue separations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mass spectrometry (MS) has become the primary method for high-sensitivity structural determination of oligosaccharides. Fragmentation in the negative-ion MS can provide a wealth of structural information and these can be used for sequence determination. However, although negative-ion MS of neutral oligosaccharide using the deprotonated molecule [M-H](-) as the precursor has been very successful for electrospray ionization (ESI), it has only limited success for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In the present study, the features of negative-ion MALDI primary spectra were investigated in detail and the product-ion spectra using [M-H](-) and [M+Cl](-) as the precursors were carefully compared. The formation of [M-H](- )was the main difficulty for MALDI while [M+Cl](-) was proved to be useful as alternative precursor anion for MALDI-MS/MS to produce similar fragmentation for sequencing of neutral oligosaccharides. N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride was then used as both the matrix and the Cl- dopant to evaluate the extent of structural information that can be obtained by negative-ion fragmentation from [M+Cl](-) using laser-induced dissociation (LID)-MS/MS for linkage assignment of gluco-oligosaccharides and for typing of blood-group ABO(H) and Lewis antigens on either type 1 or type 2 backbone-chains.

AB This study describes for the first time the development of 3D printed microfluidic devices with integrated electrodes for label-free counting of E. coli cells incorporated inside droplets based on capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection ((CD)-D-4). Microfluidic devices were fully fabricated by 3D printing in the T-junction shape containing two channels for disperse and continuous phases and two sensing electrodes for (CD)-D-4 measurements. The disperse phase containing E. coli K12 cells and the continuous phase containing oil and 1% Span (R) 80 were pumped through flow rates fixed at 5 and 60 mu L min(-1), respectively. The droplets with incorporated cells were monitored in the C-4 D system applying a 500-kHz sinusoidal wave with 1 V-pp amplitude. The generated droplets exhibited a spherical shape with average diameter of 321 +/- 9 mu m and presented volume of 17.3 +/- 0.5 nL. The proposed approach demonstrated ability to detect E. coli cells in the concentration range between 86.5 and 8650 CFU droplet(-1). The number of cells per droplet was quantified through the plate counting method and revealed a good agreement with the Poisson distribution. The limit of detection achieved for counting E. coli cells was 63.66 CFU droplet(-1). The label-free counting method has offered instrumental simplicity, low cost, high sensitivity and compatibility to be integrated on single microfluidic platforms entirely fabricated by 3D printing, thus opening new possibilities of applications in microbiology.

AB A multifunctional microchip-based distillation apparatus is presented for the distilled of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in food products. The microchip is fabricated on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates, and comprises a sample zone, a buffer zone, a serpentine distillation column, and a collection zone. In the process, the sample is introduced into the sample zone and is heated under carefully controlled temperature and time conditions. The resulting SO2 and water vapor are carried by nitrogen (N-2) gas to the distillation column, where the SO2 is separated from the water vapor via the condensing effects of a continuous cold water flow. Finally, the SO2 is transported to the collection zone, where it is collected with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its concentration determined using an alkali-based titration and paper-based detection method. A distillation efficiency of 90.5% is obtained under the optimal distillation conditions at concentrations of 20-4000 ppm. Moreover, a linear correlation (R-2 = 0.9997) is observed between the experimental measurements of the SO2 concentration and the known concentration. The validity of the presented microchip-based distillation apparatus is further investigated by distilling the SO2 concentrations of 25 commodity samples. The detection results show that the deviation does not exceed 5.4% compared with the traditional official method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An ultrasensitively multicolor colorimetric assay on the basis of enzyme-catalyzed reaction mediated etching of gold nanobipyramids (Au NBPs) is developed for detection of blood glucose with naked eye. This assay depends on the catalytic oxidation of H2O2 (generated from glucose oxidation) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to generate hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) with strong oxidizability, which can accelerate the Au NBPs etching and accompany with vivid color changes and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) blue shift. On the basis of this, the proposed colorimetric glucose assay accomplishes a dynamic range of 0.05-90 mu M with detection limit of 0.02 mu M, which is almost three orders of magnitude lower than that (10 mu M) based on gold nanorods (Au NRs). Moreover, the approximate glucose levels can be intuitively and conveniently judged by the color changes with naked eye. Most importantly, visually distinguish between healthy people and diabetic patients by naked eye dispense with any sophisticated instrument is the most important highlight of this colorimetric assay, indicating the available potential for diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of colorimetric assay using Au NBPs as etching substrates for visually analysis of glucose. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Early diagnosis of cancer by biomarker detection has been widely studied since it can lead to an increase in patient survival rates. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) play an important role in this field acting as a valuable tool in the biomarker immunocapture and detection. In this work, Co0.25Zn0.75Fe2O4 (CoZnFeONPs) nanoparticles were synthesized and applied as enzyme mimics of peroxidase-like catalysis in a disposable enzyme-free microfluidic immunoarray device (mu ID). The catalytic activity of CoZnFeONPs was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide detection using cyclic voltammetry and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant was estimated by Lineweaver-Burk equation showing good K-m values. In mu ID, the immunosensors were assembled with monoclonal antibody against CYFRA 21-1 covalently immobilized on graphene oxide previously deposited on the screen-printed carbon-based electrodes. Under optimized conditions, the method presented a good linear response for CYFRA 21-1 in the range of 3.9 -1000 fg mL(-1) achieving an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 0.19 fg mL(-1). For comparison, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FeONPs) was also synthetized and presented results slight inferior to that obtained with CoZnFeONPs. The methods developed using both MNPs exhibited countless advantages when compared with the immunosensors developed for CYFRA-21-1, previously reported in the literature. The methods were successful applied for the detection of CYFRA 21-1 in real serum samples of healthy and prostate cancer patients and showed good correlation with results obtained with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The CoZnFeONPs associated with the disposable microfluidic immunoarray device provides a simple and effective method for biomarker detection that could satisfy the need for a low-cost and rapid test for early diagnosis of cancer.

AB In this study, a simple paper-based aptasensor has been developed for the ultrasensitive detection of lead (Pb2+) ion within about 10 min. The aptasensor has been successfully designed by taking advantages of the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) process and the super fluorescence quenching property of graphene oxide (GO) sheet. The sensing mechanism of the aptasensor is based on the conformational switch of the Pb2+-specific aptamer from a random coil to a G-quadruplex structure. An injection of Pb2+ on the paper-based platform induces the release of the specific aptamer from the GO surface that recovers the fluorescence emission. Under the optimal experimental conditions, there is a good linear relationship between the fluorescence recovery and the Pb2+ concentration in the ranges of 5-70 pM and 0.07-20 nM. Moreover, the aptasensing array exhibits a high sensitivity to Pb2+ with an ultra-low detection limit of 0.5 pM. The developed aptasensor has been successfully applied to determine Pb2+ in tap water, lake water, milk, and human blood serum. The paper-based aptasensor can be efficiently utilized to detect other metal ions and biological molecules by substituting target specific aptamer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of a low-cost and disposable biosensing technologies has received a great interest of healthcare for the sensitive and reliable detection of single nucleotide mutation related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the present study, an impedimetric biosensing platform based on zip nucleic acids (ZNA) was developed for the sensitive detection of Factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) mutation. After optimization of experimental parameters, the sequence selective hybridization between ZNA probe and target related to FV Leiden mutation was evaluated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (EIS) by measuring changes at the charge transfer resistance, R-ct. Sensitive and selective impedimetric analysis was performed using carbon nanofiber (CNF) modified screen printed electrodes (SPE) and multi-channel screen printed array of electrodes (MULTIx8 CNF-SPE) resulting in a relatively shorter time in comparison to conventional methods. The selectivity of ZNA probe to mutation-free DNA sequences was also investigated. The applicability of single-use ZNA biosensor was also tested in synthetic PCR samples containing a single base mutation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Individual drug concentration data can be a valuable tool for the clinical management of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV infection. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based assays are currently the gold standard for drug measurement but its high cost and requirement of technical expertise limits its widespread use. Simpler user-friendly and inexpensive detection assays are needed. A novel immunochromatographic (IC) strip test to detect HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) was fabricated by combining the proteolysis activity of HIV-protease (PR) and an immunochromatographic reaction. The PIs-IC strip cut-off to detect lopinavir (LPV) concentrations was set at 1,000 ng mL(-1). We evaluated this novel PIs-IC strip for the semi-quantification of HIV PIs in plasma samples collected from healthy subjects and HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment with and without LPV. LPV plasma drug levels were quantified by HPLC and evaluated (blinded to the HPLC results) using the PIs-IC strip. Results of plasma samples tested using the PIs-IC strip were available within 5 min. Using the PIs-IC strip test the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity were 97.8%, 97.1%, and 100%, respectively, compare to the gold-standard assay, to detect LPV in human plasma samples. This novel PIs-IC strip test could be used as a simple tool for the rapid monitoring of Pis levels in HIV-infected patients, although further clinical evaluation is needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we report a sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor for the detection of dopamine (DA) neurotransmitter based on VS2-SnS2/f-MWCNIT hybrids. Herein, the binary metal sulfide (VS2-SnS2) was synthesized via single step hydrothermal route and hybrids with f-MWCNT via the ultrasonication process. The as-prepared VS2-SnS2/f-MWCNIT hybrids were characterized through the FESEM, EDX and elemental mapping, TEM, XPS, Raman and XRD techniques. The electrochemical performance and catalytic activity of the modified electrodes were probed using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Interestingly, DPV results exhibits an appreciable linear range from 0.025 to 1017 mu M and LOD of 0.008 mu M. The selectivity study was performed to prove the high selectivity of theVS(2)-SnS2/f-MWCNIT hybrids modified electrode. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the DA sensor was scrutinized in human serum sample and rat brain sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method is a simple and straightforward extraction technique involving an initial partitioning followed by an extract clean-up using dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE). Originally, the QuEChERS approach was developed for recovering pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables, but rapidly gained popularity in the comprehensive isolation of analytes from different matrices. According to PubMed, since its development in 2003 up to November 2018, about 1360 papers have been published reporting QuEChERS as extraction method. Several papers have reported different improvements and modifications to the original QuEChERS protocol to ensure more efficient extractions of pH-dependent analytes and to minimize the degradation of labile analytes. This analytical approach shows several advantages over traditional extraction techniques, requiring low sample and solvent volumes, as well as less time for sample preparation. Furthermore, most of the published studies show that the QuEChERS protocol provides higher recovery rate and a better analytical performance than conventional extraction procedures.
   This review proposes an updated overview of the most recent developments and applications of QuEChERS beyond its original application to pesticides, mycotoxins, veterinary drugs and pharmaceuticals, forensic analysis, drugs of abuse and environmental contaminants. Their pros and cons will be discussed, considering the factors influencing the extraction efficiency. Whenever possible, the performance of the QuEChERS is compared to other extraction approaches. In addition to the evolution of this technique, changes and improvements to the original method are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In natural product drug discovery, several strategies have emerged to highlight specifically bioactive compound(s) within complex mixtures (fractions or crude extracts) using metabolomics tools. In this area, a great deal of interest has raised among the scientific community on strategies to link chemical profiles and associated biological data, leading to the new field called "biochemometrics". This article falls into this emerging research by proposing a complete workflow, which was divided into three major steps. The first one consists in the fractionation of the same extract using four different chromatographic stationary phases and appropriated elution conditions to obtain five fractions for each column. The second step corresponds to the acquisition of chemical profiles using HPLC-HRMS analysis, and the biological evaluation of each fraction. The last step evaluates the links between the relative abundances of molecules present in fractions (peak area) and the global bioactivity level observed for each fraction. To this purpose, an original bioinformatics script (encoded with R Studio software) using the combination of four statistical models (Spearman, F-PCA, PLS, PLS-DA) was here developed leading to the generation of a "Super list" of potential bioactive compounds together with a predictive score. This strategy was validated by its application on a marine-derived Penicillium chrysogenum extract exhibiting antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells). After the three steps of the workflow, one main compound was highlighted as responsible for the bioactivity and identified as ergosterol. Its antiproliferative activity was confirmed with an IC50 of 0.10 mu M on MCF-7 cells. The script efficiency was further demonstrated by comparing the results obtained with a different recently described approach based on NMR profiling and by virtually modifying the data to evaluate the computational tool behaviour. This approach represents a new and efficient tool to tackle some of the bottlenecks in natural product drug discovery programs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) are a kind of remarkable adsorbents in environment area due to high surface area, controllable pore size and superior stability. However, the inherent hydrophobicity and strong pi-pi interaction make OMCs have an advantage for the adsorption of nonpolar pollutants, leading to great demands for the development of new-type OMCs with outstanding adsorption efficiencies towards polar pollutants. The zirconium and nitrogen co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (Zr/N-OMC) was obtained by directly carbonizing the composites of phenolic resin and UiO-66-NH2, with uniform mesopore structure, large surface area (583 m(2) g(-1)) and widely dispersed heteroatoms. Due to these prominent properties, the Zr/N-OMC was fabricated as high-performance solid phase microextraction coating. The results proved that the doping zirconium and nitrogen could act as active sites to interact with polar pollutants, resulting in fast adsorption rate and enhanced adsorption capacity. Therefore, the high-performance Zr/N-OMC-coated fiber was coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to establish sensitive analytical method for the detection of trace phenols from real water samples. This work would open up a new avenue for simple and efficient modification of OMC with enhanced adsorption performance to expand applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are one class of bacterial metabolites mainly formed by gut microbiota from undigested fibers and proteins. These molecules are able to mediate signal conduction processes of cells, acting as G protein-coupled receptors (GPR) activators and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors. It was reported that SCFAs were closely associated with various human diseases. However, it is still challenging to analyze SCFAs because of their diverse structures and broad range of concentrations. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive method for simultaneous detection of 34 SCFAs by stable isotope labeling coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. In this respect, a pair of isotope labeling reagents, N-(4(aminomethyl)benzyl)aniline (4-AMBA) and N-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)aniline-d(5) (4-AMBA-d(5)), were synthesized to label SCFAs from the feces of mice and SCFA standards, respectively. The 4-AMBA-d(5) labeled SCFAs were used as internal standards to compensate the ionization variances resulting from matrix effect and thus minimize quantitation deviation in MS detection. After 4-AMBA labeling, the retention of SCFAs on the reversed-phase column increased and the separation resolution of isomers were improved. In addition, the MS responses of most SCFAs were enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude compared to unlabeled SCFAs. The limits of detection (LODs) of SCFAs were as low as 0.005 ng/mL. Moreover, good linearity for 34 SCFAs was obtained with the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.9846 to 0.9999 and the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <17.8% and 15.4%, respectively, indicating the acceptable reproducibility of the developed method. Using the developed method, we successfully quantified 21 SCFAs from the feces of mice. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and t-test analysis showed that the contents of 9 SCFAs were significantly different between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and wide type (WT) mice fecal samples. Compared to WT mice, the contents of propionic acid, isobutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and 3-hydroxyisocaleric acid were decreased in AD mice, while lactic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, levulinic acid, and valpronic acid were increased in AD mice. These significantly changed SCFAs in the feces of AD mice may afford to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.

AB Determination of site-specific glycoforms is the key to reveal the micro-heterogeneity of protein glycosylation at proteome level. Herein, we presented an integrated virtual multistage MS strategy to identify intact glycopeptides, which allowed the determination of site-specific glycoforms. In this strategy, the enzymatically de-glycosylated peptides and intact glycopeptides were mixed and analyzed in the same LC-MS/MS run. The acquired MS2 spectra of intact glycopeptides allowed determination of the glycans, and the MS2 spectra of the de-glycosylated peptides enabled the identification of peptide backbone sequences. Compared with the conventional multistage strategy, the peptide backbones could be directly identified by the MS2 of the de-glycopeptides with higher sensitivity. This strategy was first validated by analyzing the glycosites and site-specific glycoforms of mouse liver tissues. Then, it was applied to differential analysis of the glycoproteomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissues. Compared with the identification scheme using only MS2 spectra of intact glycopeptides or glycosites, this approach enabled quantitative analysis on two levels, i.e. glycosites and site-specific glycoforms, simultaneously. Thus, it could be a powerful tool to characterize the subtle differences in the macro- and micro-heterogeneity of protein glycosylation for different samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs therapy is known to be a serious issue in hypertension treatment. Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) was shown to allow the assessment of such nonadherence in blood and urine sample. However, their sampling may represent a logistical challenge and are often not favored by the patients. We questioned whether oral fluid (OF) might be an easier accessible alternative matrix for adherence monitoring of cardiovascular drugs (CD). A qualitative method for adherence monitoring of 78 commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs in OF using LC high-resolution MS (LC-HRMS/MS) was therefore developed, validated, and used to study the presence of antihypertensive medication in OF. Selectivity, ion suppression and enhancement due coeluting analytes, carry over, limits of detection (LOD), limits of identification (LOI), recovery (RE), matrix effects (ME), and process efficiency (PE) were investigated. For demonstrating applicability, over 50 OF samples were investigated and data were compared to findings in blood and urine. Selectivity in OF was given for all compounds via their MS2 spectra and no total suppression of signals could be observed. Determined LOI in OF for ten analytes was higher than the given therapeutic plasma concentration. Furthermore, RE, ME, and PE were in acceptable ranges for more than 65% of the compounds. In total, 208 prescriptions of CD to 57 patients were analyzed and demonstrated the suitability of for adherence monitoring in principle. OF was comparable to plasma regarding the drug categories and the frequencies of hits, except for acidic compounds but more hits could be found in urine samples. A analytical method using OF as analytical matrix was successfully developed. Application showed that it might be a suitable alternative for adherence monitoring of selected drugs in the future, particularly those having no acidic function. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ultrasensitive bioassays are increasingly demanded for disease diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The combined unique natures of the components in nanocomposites have led to their wide applications in bioanalysis. In the current study, a simple strategy for preparing polyethyleneimine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide-hemin-bovine serum albumin (PEI-rGO-Hemin-BSA) nanocomposites as peroxidase mimetics was demonstrated. The developed nanocomposites of PEI-rGO-Hemin- BSA showed an excellent peroxidase-like activity. Importantly, through the glutaradelhyde crosslinking, PEI-rGO-Hemin-BSA could be further simply combined with various oxidases such as glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, lactate oxidase and choline oxidase for the detection and quantitative measurement of multiple metabolites including glucose, cholesterol, L-lactate, and choline. The developed detection strategy, which is sensitive, convenient, low-costed, and in tiny sample consumption, could be expected wide applications in the disease diagnosis and management of metabolite disorders.

AB Herein, we developed a simple and rapid strategy to synthesize gold/silver bimetallic nanoclusters (Au/Ag NCs) with highly biochemical stability by a one-pot route. The Au/Ag NCs were obtained via a chemical reduction procedure in alkaline aqueous solution at 75 degrees C within only 20 min by employing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as both ligand and reductant. The as-obtained Au/Ag NCs displayed bright orange fluorescence with an emission peak located at 570 nm and temperature-dependent fluorescence property, which were utilized as fluorescent thermometer directly. More intriguingly, the Au/Ag NCs were very stable against various pH values, ions, biothiols, H2O2, fetal bovine serum (FBS), RPMI 1640 medium and amino acids. Taking advantage of the excellent biochemical stability, a ratiometric fluorescence biosensor, fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-Au/Ag NCs, was constructed for pH sensing based on the incorporation of FITC into the Au/Ag NCs. Furthermore, the ratiometric pH sensor was also successfully applied on the model of HeLa cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a typical antibiotic that is harmful to the health of human beings and widely used in animal husbandry, oxytetracycline (OTC) has a potential threat to the food safety. Therefore, the design of portable sensors for efficiently monitoring trace amounts of OTC in foods is vital to maintain safe food supply in our daily life. Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) molecularly imprinted photonic crystal hydrogel (MIPCH) sensor for the detection of OTC was fabricated by combining the photonic crystal (PC) method and molecular imprinting technique. In this regard, OTC was used as imprinted template to form the MIPCH sensor with specific binding sites during polymerization. After the removal of template, the obtained MIPCH possessed the specific nanocavities that were complementary to target compound, OTC. In addition, the response of the MIPCH to tetracyclines (TCs) in aqueous solution was monitored through a readable change of Debye diffraction ring, which is related to the particle spacing variation of MIPCH in response to the target molecules. As the concentration of OTC increased from 0 to 60 mu M, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased to about 94 nm and the structural color redshifted from blue to red. More importantly, the detection of OTC in milk sample by this portable, cost-effective MIPCH sensor has also been achieved at the same range of OTC. With the increasing concentration of OTC in milk sample, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased about 92 nm and the structural color of MIPCH changed from blue through green to orange.

AB Herein, we introduce a nanopaper-based analytical device (NAD) or "lab-on-nanopaper" device for visual sensing of human serum albumin (HSA) in human blood serums, which relies on embedding of curcumin within transparent bacterial cellulose (BC) nanopaper. BC nanopaper is an appropriate candidate to be an excellent platform for the development of optical (bio) sensors due to having exceptional properties such as optical transparency, high flexibility, porosity, biodegradability, and printability. The hydrophilic test zones were created on the fabricated bioplatform through creating the hydrophobic walls via laser printing technology. The color changes of curcumin embedded in BC nanopaper (CEBC) due to the inhibitory effect of HSA on the curcumin degradation in alkaline solutions, which can be monitored visually (naked eye/Smartphone camera) or spectroscopically using a spectrophotometer, were linearly proportional to the HSA concentration in the range of 10-300 mu M and 25-400 mu M, respectively. The developed NAD/CEBC as a novel albumin assay kit was successfully utilized to the determination of HSA in human blood serum samples with satisfactory results. Building upon the fascinating features of BC nanopaper as a very promising bioplatform in optical (bio) sensing applications we are confident "lab-on-nanopaper" devices/NADs, which take the advantages of the nanopaper and also meet the ASSURED criteria, could be considered as a new generation of optical (bio) sensing platforms that are currently based on paper, glass or plastic substrates.

AB Capillary electrophoresis-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX) has proven to be an effective technique for aptamers selection. In this study, we present an online reaction based convenient single-step CE-SELEX (ssCE-SELEX) mode with human thrombin (H-Thr) as a model target. The selection progress was monitored through bulk K-d analysis, which showed more than a 1000-fold improvement over the initial library after two rounds of selection. Three selected candidate sequences presented high binding affinities against H-Thr with nanomolar (nM) K-d determined by nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM, 56.4-177.1 nM) and CE based non-linear fitting (CE-NLF, 98.2-199.7 nM). They also exhibited high specificities towards H-Thr compared with bovine thrombin, IgG, lysozyme, and lactoferrin. Meanwhile, the K-d results by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the effective CE in measuring the aptamer affinity. In addition, three candidates were applied as aptasensors in the AuNPs based colorimetric assay, which showed visible color change and good linear relationships (R-2 > 0.93) with H-Thr concentration. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to validate the binding of the three candidates with H-Thr by binding sites and binding free energy. The ssCE-SELEX method avoids off-line incubation, saves time and sample, and may provide a universal and convenient method for aptamers selection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aflatoxin B1(AFB1) is one of the most toxic mycotoxins produced by fungi and results in inevitable contamination of food and feed at very low concentrations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement selective, sensitive and highly convenient methods for the determination of aflatoxin B1. Among these methods, the progress of nanomaterials, owing to their high performances and versatile properties, offers great prospects for realizing highly sensitive, selective and simple detection of AFB1, overcoming the restrictions of traditional methods such as process-complicated, time-consuming, labor-intensive and instruments-expensive. Many nanomaterials have been used for the immobilization of biomolecules as signal generators or fluorescent quenchers or for signal amplification in AFB1 detection. This review highlights recent progress that has been made in the development of nanoparticle-based assays and focuses on the analytical potential of nanomaterials, such as Au/Ag nanoparticles (Au/Ag NPs), carbon-based nanoparticles (CBNs), magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), Quantum dots (QDs) and novel nanomaterials, including up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanomaterial-functional DNA intelligent hydrogels, as well as hybrid nanostructures. The determination of AFB1 is divided into three aspects: sample pretreatment prior to AFB1 detection, immunoassays and biosensors. The details of the detection methods and their application principles are described, and the challenges and opportunities in the field of food analysis are described. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Behavior of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) in sweet basil was studied using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) as an in situ monitoring tool. Although the use of SiNP for environmental applications is interesting, detailed studies in plants for distributional mapping and quantitative determination have been difficult because the detection of Si-28(+) suffers from severe molecular interference and high background in ICP-MS. In this work, yttrium/fluorescein-isothiocyanatedoped silica nanoparticles (Y/FITC-doped SiNPs) synthesized in our lab were used to substitute for undoped SiNP, allowing the doped Y-89(+) to be monitored instead of Si-28(+), while retaining the same surface properties. Based on this model, the physiological influence was studied by nourishing them with a nutrient solution spiked with the synthesized SiNPs and a co-pollutant, Cs ion. Mapping images obtained by LA-ICP-MS showed distinct accumulation patterns associated with exposure. For example, Cs was distributed widely over the leaves, whereas SiNPs were concentrated in specific regions such as main veins, leaf margins, and tips. Furthermore, the possible effect of SiNP and Cs on the photochemical reaction was confirmed through monitoring the change of the concentration of chlorophyll and carotenoid and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.

AB Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) allows spatially and temporally resolved measurements of a broad range of reactive surfaces and specimens, typically using electrochemically active metal probes. While conducting polymers (CPs) present several analytical properties of interest due to their chemical versatility, potentially enabling the measurement of ionic fluxes as well as redox processes, they have not been widely used as probe materials for SECM. CPs can be modified and fine-tuned to improve experimental parameters and they can be easily prepared by electrodeposition. In this paper, we show a new type of CP probe for SECM that retains the spatial resolution of conventional metal probes and introduces the possibility to exploit a wide range of ionic and redox systems. Poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) was electrochemically deposited on flat and recessed Pt microdisks to generate CP SECM probes. To demonstrate their usefulness, an insulating substrate with conducting features was imaged. Well-defined SECM feedback images were observed for both the CP well-probe and the Pt probe, proving the efficiency of the new electrode to image redox reactions. Additionally, an organosulfur compound was used as mediator taking advantage of the electrocatalytic effect PEDOT has on the molecule's kinetics. Finally, these probes were also used in a mediator-less fashion, taking advantage of the ion flux required to electrochemically oxidize the PEDOT deposit. We investigated the impact of anion size and concentration on current-distance relationships for SECM probe positioning. CP probes pose exciting prospects for the imaging and measurement of combined redox and ionic processes in energy materials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we introduce an ultrasensitive and stable sensing platform based on gold nanoparticle decorated 3D reduced graphene oxide - carbon nanotube nanocomposites (GNP/CNT/rGO) for detection of tryptase (Tryp), which is a potential biomarker within nasal secretions for allergic rhinitis (AR). The GNP/CNT/rGO on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated through single-step one-pot electrochemical co-reduction and deposition. The GNP/CNT/rGO exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity as the working electrode compared with bare GCE, GNP/rGO and CNT/rGO on GCEs. The enhanced performance of GNP/CNT/rGO may be attributed to 3D macroporous structures, which may provide increased surface area, faster charge transfer and lower mass transport resistance, as well as high electrocatalytic activity and good biocompatibility due to GNP. A GNP/CNT/rGO-based sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for detection of Tryp, which requires high sensitivity and specificity. The GNP/CNT/rGO-based immunosensor exhibited a detection range from 100 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL, a detection limit of 50 pg/mL and a sensitivity of 1.64 mu A/(ng/mL). This immunosensor possessed high selectivity, excellent reproducibility (RSD 2.1%) and high stability over approximately 1 month. Therefore, we expect that the GNP/CNT/rGO and the modified immunosensor will be useful tools for detecting Tryp in nasal secretions for clinical diagnosis of AR. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a novel environmentally-friendly approach was developed to overcome certain limitations in the analysis of solid food samples. An experimental setup based on solid-phase microextraction apparatus coupled to a rotating disk device is proposed for the determination of polar and slightly-polar pesticides including carbofuran, molinate, atrazine, simazine and tebuconazole in rice samples. In this innovative procedure, a rice sample is inserted into the cavity of the rotating disk device which is then immersed in an aqueous solution followed by high-speed agitation. In this case, water is employed as a green solvent for leaching the analytes from the sample matrix. Simultaneously, a solid-phase micro-extraction fiber comprised of divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (2 cm length and 50/30 mu m film thickness) was immersed in the aqueous solution to extract the slightly polar analytes from the aqueous matrix with subsequent thermal desorption in the injector of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer instrument. The optimal extraction conditions were obtained using an extraction temperature of 80 degrees C for 40 min, with 125 mg of rice inserted in the rotating disk. Using the previously optimized extraction conditions, the analytical performance was satisfactory with correlation coefficients higher than 0.9881 for all analytes, limits of detection ranging from 0.46 to 5.9 ng g(-1), limits of quantification from 1.5 to 19.7 ng g(-1), relative recoveries from 76 to 109%, intra-day precision (n = 3) from 1.3 to 19%, and inter-day precision (n = 9) from 3.5 to 6.5%. The proposed method represents a promising alternative for the analysis of complex solid food samples using SPME, since the SPME fiber damage is substantially decreased when the contact with the solid matrix is avoided.

AB A simple paper-based analytical device (PAD) has been developed to rapidly detect formaldehyde (FA) in food samples. The analysis was based on sulfite assay where FA reacted with excess sulfite to generate sodium hydroxide (NaOH) that was quantified on PAD using acid-base titration. The PAD consisted of a central sample zone connected to ten reaction and detection zones. All detection zones were pre-deposited with polyethylene glycol (PEG) with phenolphthalein (Phph) as an indicator. Reaction zones contained different amounts of the titrant, potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP). On flowing into reaction zones, the NaOH product reacts with KHP to reach the end point. In the presence of excess NaOH, unneutralized NaOH reached the detection zone and caused Phph color change from colorless to pink. In contrast, when NaOH was less than KHP, the detection zone remained colorless. Concentration of FA can be quantified from the number of pink detection zone(s) which were correlated with a known amount of pre-deposited KHP on the PAD. Total analytical process could be completed within 5 min. Areas of each zone and amounts of reagents added to the corresponding zones of the PAD were optimized to obtain reproducible and accurate results. PAD gave ranges of FA detection of 100-1000 mg L(-1 )with an interval of 100 mg L(-1 )and the limit of detection (LOD) was 100 mg L-1. PADS were stable for up to a month under dark and cold conditions. Analysis of FA in food samples using PAD agreed well with those from the classical sulfite assay. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer. Because the value of biomarkers primarily depends on whether they are quantifiable, great effort has been taken to develop assays for sensitive and accurate quantification of miRNAs. However, most of current assays have high nonspecific amplification effect, which limits quantification accuracy. In this study, we circumvented copying of nucleic acid sequence and developed a signal amplification strategy based on a novel DNA-peptide dendrimer (DPD) probe coupled with mass spectrometry. The DPD probe RP8-MAP4-DNA contained three functional domains, including substrate peptides containing eight reporter peptides and tryptic cleavage sites, peptide dendrimer scaffold and DNA complementary to target miRNA. The probe was first hybridized with the target miRNA (i.e., miR-21) that was biotinylated and attached to streptavidin agarose in advance. After trypsin digestion, the reporter peptide was liberated and quantified using LC-MS/MS. The signal intensity was approximately 8 fold greater than that without signal amplification. Finally, the developed assay was applied for the quantitative analysis of miR-21 in 3 human breast cell lines and 102 matched pairs of breast tissue samples. The miR-21 expression in tissue was also evaluated depend on histopathological features, molecular subtypes and prognosis of breast cancer.

AB Nerve agent metabolites (NAMs) derived from alkyl methyl phosphonic acids, such as ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA), isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), and pinacolyl methylphosphonic acid (PMPA), were extracted from human urine using diethyl ether as an extractant. After exchanging the diethyl ether solvent to acetonitrile, the analytes were derivatized with 2-(bromomethyl)naphthalene (BMN). The reaction products of the BMN and NAMs, i.e., MN-EMPA, MN-IMPA, and MN-PMPA, were separated by gas chromatography (GC) and measured by mass spectrometry (MS) using a femtosecond laser emitting at 267 nm as the ionization source for resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization (RE2PI). The limits of detection (LOD) were <1 ng/mL for these analytes. The use of BMN increased the volatility of the analytes for separation by GC and also increased the ionization efficiency via the RE2PI process as the result of presence of a naphthalene functional group. A two-dimensional GC-MS display can be used for comprehensive analysis of NAMs, by-products, and impurities in the sample. Then, this approach could be used to confirm the use of chemical weapons and for forensic identification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Either widely targeted metabolomics or quantitative proteomics usually requires unique analytical platform. However, cross-platform omics studies entail higher levels of complexity and uncertainty, and result in a significant obstacle for high throughput assay as well. It is thereby urgent to pursue an integrative approach being capable of merging these two omics terms, namely widely targeted bi-omics. As an eligible analytical tool for large-scale targeted metabolomics, reversed phase liquid chromatography-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tailored selected reaction monitoring (RPLC-HILIC-tailored SRM) was deployed here to further receive the tryptic peptides as the analytes. Comparative evaluation of metabolites and tryptic peptides, 101 ones in total, between HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells was conducted as a proof-of-concept. All analytes, regardless of metabolites or peptides, exhibited satisfactory chromatographic behaviors on RPLC-HILIC. Quantitative MS parameters, such as SRM transitions and collision energies (CEs), of either tryptic peptides or metabolites were online optimized in a standard compound-independent manner. It was worthwhile to mention that the signal responses of the peptides-of-choice generated by the optimized CEs were significantly superior to those values suggested by Skyline software. Calibration curves of both metabolites and peptides were constructed by serially diluting a so-called universal metabolome standard (UMS) sample. The quasi-content of each peptide or metabolite was gained according to applying those regressive calibration curves. After subjecting the quasi-content dataset into SIMCA-P software, significant differences took place between the two hepatic cell lines, and not only metabolites but tryptic peptides contributed to the discrimination. Above all, RPLC-HILIC-tailored SRM offered a promising choice towards widely targeted bi-omics attributing to the advantage of simultaneous monitoring metabolites and tryptic peptides.

AB This study positions the fabricated Pt/Hg-supported phospholipid sensor element in the context of more conventional biomembrane-based screening platforms. The technology has been used together with immobilised artificial membrane (LAM) chromatography and COSMOmic simulation methods to screen the interaction of a series of low molecular weight narcotic organic compounds in water with phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. For these chemicals it is shown that toxicity to aquatic species is related to compound hydrophobicity which is associated with compound accumulation in the phospholipid membrane as modelled by LAM chromatography measurements and COSMOmic simulations. In contrast, the Hg-supported dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) sensor element records membrane damage/modification which is indirectly related to general toxicity and directly related to compound structure. Electrochemical limit of detection (LoD) values depend on molecular structure and range from 20 timolL(-1) for substituted phenols to 23 mmolL(-1) for aliphatics. Rapid cyclic voltammetry (RCV) "fingerprints" showed that the major structural classes of compounds: alkyl/chlorobenzenes, substituted phenols, quaternary ammonium compounds and neutral amines interacted distinctively with the DOPC on Hg and that these observations correlated with and supported those predicted by the COSMOmic simulations of the compound/DMPC association. In addition, the compatibility of the electrochemical and COSMOmic methods validates the electrochemical device as a meaningful high throughput technology to screen compounds in water and report on the mechanistic details of their interaction with phospholipid layers.

AB Multisensor systems with low-power consumption are emerging for the Internet of Things. In this work, we demonstrate the use of self-heated networked Ag-decorated SnO2 NW sensors integrated into a portable module for selective detection of H2S gas at low power consumption, and the integrated system is simulated as a virtual multisensor under varying heating powers for identifying and quantifying different reducing gases. The H2S gas-sensing characterisations at the different self-heating powers of 2-10 mW showed that the gas response significantly increased with the increase in Ag density decoration and the heated power strongly affected the gas-sensing performance and sensor stability. Excellent response of 21.2 to 0.5 ppm H2S gas was obtained at a low heating power of 2 mW with an acceptable response/recovery time of 18/980 s. The increase of the heating power over 20 mW can destroy the devices. The integrated system could selectively detect H2S at the heating power below 4 mW and H-2, C2H5OH and NH3 gases at the heating power upon 4 mW. The virtual multisensor could discriminate qualitatively (with an accuracy of 100%) and quantitatively H2S, H-2, NH3, C2H5OH (Ethanol) and CH3COCH3 (Aceton) gases with average errors of 13.5%, 14.7%, 16.8%, 16.9%, and 14.8%, respectively. The proposed sensing platform is a promising candidate for selective detection of H2S gas and virtual mul- tisensor with low power consumption for mobile or wireless network devices.

AB Sensitive detection of early ovarian cancer is imminent for women's health. Human epididymis specific protein 4 antigen (HE4 Ag), as a novel tumor marker, has good specificity and sensitivity in ovarian cancer markers, especially for the detection of early ovarian cancer. In this work, a novel and ultrasensitive sandwich-type amperometric electrochemical immunosensor was constructed using amine modified graphene supported gold nanorods (Au NRs/NH2-GS) as a sensor platform and core-shell Au@Pd urchin-shaped nanostructures (Au@Pd USs) as a label of the secondary antibodies (Ab(2), Au@Pd USs-Ab(2)) to realize the quantitative determination of HE4 Ag. The Au NRs/NH2-GS were used for increasing the electrode surface area and effectively immobilizing primary antibodies (Ab(1)) due to its good water-solubility. The Au@Pd USs have special morphology with high crystal surface index and good stability, capable of loading secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) and providing a larger active site for the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The proposed immunosensor displays excellent performance for HE4 Ag detection over the range from 1 pmol L-1 to 50 nmol L-1 with a detection limit of 0.33 pmol L-1 (signalto-noise ratio of 3). Moreover, the designed immunosensor exhibits excellent reproducibility, selectivity, and stability, which shows great potential in clinical diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a source of mutant DNA found in plasma and holds great promise in guiding cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment. However, ctDNA fragments are challenging to detect in plasma due to their low abundance compared to wild-type DNA. In this study, a series of ion-tagged oligonucleotides (ITO) were synthesized using thiol-ene click chemistry and designed to selectively anneal target DNA. The ITO-DNA duplex was subsequently captured using a hydrophobic magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) as a liquid support. Extracted target DNA was quantified by adding the DNA-enriched MIL to the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) buffer to streamline the extraction procedure. Clinically relevant concentrations of the mutation prone KRAS fragment, which has been linked to colorectal, lung, and bladder cancer, were preconcentrated using the ITO-MIL strategy allowing for enrichment factors as high as 19.49 +/- 1.44 from pure water and 4.02 +/- 0.50 from 10-fold diluted plasma after a 1 min extraction. Preconcentration could only be achieved when adding the ITO probe to the sample validating the selectivity of the ITO in the capture process. In addition, the amplification efficiency of qPCR was not affected when performing extractions from a diluted-plasma matrix demonstrating that the ITO-MIL approach coupled to direct-qPCR can be used to quantitate DNA from complex matrices. In comparison, commercially available steptavidin-coated magnetic beads were observed to lose selectivity when performing extractions from a 10-fold diluted plasma matrix. The selectivity of the ITO-MIL method, coupled with the ability to rapidly preconcentrate clinically relevant concentrations of target DNA from 10-fold diluted plasma, suggests that this method has the potential to be applied towards the extraction of ctDNA fragments from clinical samples.

AB A novel freestanding all-solid-state polymeric membrane Cu2+ -selective electrode (Cu2+ -ISE) is proposed based on three-dimensional graphene sponge (3D GS). The 3D GS electrode has been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements. Experiments show that 3D GS possesses a large electrical double layer capacitance, good conductivity, and high hydrophobicity. Based on these superior properties, 3D GS has been applied as both electrode substrate and solid contact for construction of a freestanding all-solid-state polymeric membrane Cu2+-ISE. The 3D GS-based Cu2+-ISE shows a good Nernstian response ranging from 1.0 x 10(-8) to 7.9 x 10(-4) M with a low detection limit of 2.5 x 10(-9) M. Moreover, the proposed Cu2+-ISE exhibits a stable potential response with a reduced water layer at the sensing membrane/3D GS interface and is not affected by interferences from light, O-2 and CO2.

AB In this work, water-soluble pillar[6]arene functionalized PdPt porous core-shell octahedral nano-dendrites (WP6@PdPt PCONs) were simply synthesized and used for the fabrication of NSE immunosensor. The newest generation of macrocyclic host and biomimetic nano-enzymes have been effectively integrated to achieve the robust immobilization of signal molecules by host-guest molecular recognition and sensitively catalytic amplification of electrochemical signals. The addition of Pd and the formation of WP6@PdPt PCONs unique bimetallic nanostructure are beneficial to changing Pt-based catalyst electronic structure, accelerating the electron transport, promoting the generation of synergistic catalysis effect. Compared with enzyme-based methods, the fabricated sandwich-type immunosensor demonstrates more advantages in robustness owing to the introduction of host-guest chemistry and biomimetic nano-enzymes. In the wide range from 0.0003 to 100.00 ng mL(-1), a good linear relationship (R-2 = 0.998) and a low LOD (0.095 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3) can be obtained. The proposed immunosensor shows remarkable analytical performances in the measurements of selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and real sample analysis, which provided a promising approach for clinical detection of NSE in human serum. Besides, the successful synthesis of WP6@PdPt PCONs provides a new idea for the preparation of biosensors based on bionic materials, nanotechnology and host-guest molecule recognition.

AB Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an important and prevalent technique in biotechnology because of its crucial role in cloning DNA fragments and diagnostic applications. In the present study, a high-throughput two-phase PCR device is designed and fabricated which utilizes a serpentine micro-channel together with a spiral structure. The former is for the droplet-generation and mixing and the latter is for the thermal cycling process. Moreover, the effect of diamond nanoparticles (diamondNP) on the performance of PCR is also investigated while using commercial PCR devices and the fabricated PCR device designed in this study. Using numerical simulation, it is shown that within the simple and easy-to-make microchannel structures designed in this study, there are different transient secondary flows which can help mixing the contents of the droplets including PCR solution and diamondNP. Moreover, a new fabrication process is used for the design of the droplet-generation chip which is applicable for the fabrication of all high-pressure microfluidic devices. It is found that the effect of diamondNPs on the PCR performance depends on the nanoparticle concentration; diamaondNPs can improve the PCR performance more than 5 times. On the other hand, if a high concentration of diamondNPs is used, PCR performance decreases significantly. Moreover, it is shown that the fabricated device is able to do the same PCR procedure faster than the commercial PCR devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Foodborne pathogens pose one of the greatest challenges facing public health in the modern day. One important pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, is known to be challenging to detect and identify. Three serovars cause most of the Listeria related food-borne illnesses, which the Centers for Disease Control currently utilizes a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing for identification and the determination of clusters and outbreaks. There is a potential method for rapid collection of epidemiological information by exploiting the electrokinetic and dielectrophoretic properties of the L. monocytogenes serovars. Using dielectrophoresis, the three most commonly identified serovars of L. monocytogenes can be distinguished from each other. The electrokinetic and dielectrophoretic mobilities of each serovar was determined through a combination of electrokinetic velocity and dielectrophoretic trapping assessments, in conjunction with finite element multi-physics modeling. A mathematical model of the data, which defines the various factors of dielectrophoretic trapping, is utilized and verified based on the behavior of L monocytogenes in the microchannel. The trapping condition for the serovars were evaluated as 2.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(9), 2.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(9), and 2.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(9) Vm(-2) and the electrokinetic mobility was assessed to be 19 +/- 0.7, 17 +/- 0.7, and 9.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9)m(2)V(-1)s(-1) for the L. monocytogenes serovars 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b, respectively.

AB Early detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is of great significance for the screening, diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis analysis of lung cancer. Herein, a novel fluorescence aptasensor with high signal-noise ratio (SNR) was constructed to achieve highly-sensitive detection of CEA relied upon the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between near-infrared carbon dots (NIR-CDs) and gold nanorods (AuNRs). Initially, AuNRs@SiO2-Aptamer and NIR-CDs-DNA probe were prepared via the covalent bonding reaction between their corresponding carboxyl and amino groups, respectively. After DNA hybridization, the aptasensor was formed, meanwhile, the fluorescence of NIR-CDs was quenched by AuNRs@SiO2. Once CEA encountered the aptasensor, it would selectively combine with CEA aptamer to unwind the preformed DNA double-strand architecture thereby resulting in the NIR-CDs-DNA detach from the surface of AuNRs@SiO2. The attendant fluorescence recovery of NIR-CDs was linearly correlated with the concentration of CEA. According to this relationship, the NIR-CDs based "turn on" sensing system was constructed and exhibited prominent responses toward CEA in the concentration range of 0.1 -5000 pg/mL and a relatively low detection limit (0.02 pg/mL). Moreover, it displayed high specificity against other biomarkers or proteins, good reproducibility and acceptable accuracy regarding human pleural effusion samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Three hydrogen sulfide (H2S) probes based on an azonia-cyanine skeleton were successfully designed and prepared. Probe 1a, containing 4-chloro-7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole connected to the cyanine dye, had an emission at 660 nm that was enhanced 4.5-fold by the reduced photoinduced electron transfer process when reacting with H2S. Probes 1b and 1c were constructed from cyanine dyes with electron withdrawing 2,4-dinitrophenyl and 7-nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl groups, respectively. Probes 1b and 1c gave off-on type responses with 169- and 17-fold fluorescent enhancements at 639 nm with H2S. Their emission properties were influenced by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intramolecular charge transfer processes. The detection limits of probes 1a-1c were calculated at 178, 121, and 9.6 nM, respectively. The intracellular imaging experiments with HeLa cells indicated probe 1a was a mitochondria-targeting H2S probe, while probes 1b and 1c were lysosome-targeting H2S probes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we proposed the functionalization of a surface plasmon-polariton (SPP)-supported gold grating surface with the metal-organic framework (MOF-5) for sensitive, selective and reproducible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of organophosphorus pesticides. Homogeneous distribution of plasmon intensity along the Au grating surface ensures the high reproducibility of SERS results (deviation of Raman peak intensity does not exceed the 4% along the sample). The surface-assisted growth of thin MOF-5 film was accomplished in two steps procedure: (i) covalent grafting by 4-carboxyphenyl groups and (ii) the immersion of samples in the mother liquid of MOF-5. Proposed SERS chip proved itself to be a perfect analytical probe for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides with high reliability and low detection limit up to 10(-12) M. Moreover, selective detection and recognition of several relevant organic contaminants (azo-dye, mycotoxin, and pesticide) from the simulated soil was successfully demonstrated. All SERS measurements were performed using portable Raman spectrometer and can easily be expanded to environmental conditions. Our work combines the high affinity of organic contaminants to the MOF-5 with excellent plasmonic excitation on the surface plasmon-polariton supported structure and shows the way to the realization of closed-to-ideal analytical SERS chip.

AB Effective detection of the intracellular expression level of transcription factors is important for biological research and medical diagnosis. This study proposes a rapid and simple fluorescence sensing strategy for highly sensitive detection of a transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). NF-kappa B binds to double-stranded DNA duplex, one of which is then protected from Exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion. An Exo III-mediated hydrolysis cycle on TaqMan probes is then triggered to achieve highly sensitive detection of NF-kappa B. This method can detect NF-kappa B with concentration as low as 45.6 pM. Furthermore, sequence-specific binding of NF-kappa B to DNA provides good selectivity. This method can be used for the direct quantification of nuclear proteins extracted from cells. More importantly, by simply replacing the sequence of the probe binding site, this method can also be used for reliable quantification of other DNA-binding proteins and is thus a universal sensing protocol. This strategy can be a powerful technology in the areas of disease diagnosis and pharmaceutical research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), a novel, simple and label-free aptamer biosensor was designed for the detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)). Here, the aptamers were used as molecular recognition probes and "gated molecules" while Rh6G was loaded into the interior of the particles as the signal probe. In the absence of AFB(1), the "gate" was closed to prevent the leakage of the signal probe because of the immobilization of aptamers on the surface of MSN-NH2. With the presence of AFB(1), the "gate" could be opened to release the signal probe for the specifical binding of aptamers to AFB(1). Our results showed that the fluorescence intensity was positively correlated with the concentration of AFB(1) (0.5-50 ng mL(-1)), with the detection limit as low as 0.13 ng mL(-1). What's more, this design provides a new approach for rapid, sensitive and selective detection based on aptamers and it could be applied to numerous other analytes if appropriate aptamers are available.

AB Herein, we combined toehold exchange with ligation-free rolling circle amplification (RCA) by programming nucleolytic conversion of hairpin probe into sensors, allowed for both high specific recognition and universal signal amplification for RNA detection. The rational engineered HP ensured highly specific recognition based on toehold exchange and allowed the pre-formed circular template for RCA to be shared for different RNAs detection. Generally, detecting different RNA requires different circular template for signal amplification. In this paper, the circular template for RCA was independent of the sequences of the target, so the signal amplification system was an universal one for different RNAs detection. Taking miRNA let-7d as a model target, this method showed a wide linear range from 1 fM to 1 nM with a detection limit of 0.46 fM and exhibited a remarkable selectivity even in distinguishing homologous miRNAs with 1-nt or 2-nt difference. To evaluate the potential of the method, it was applied to analysis the let-7d concentration in human serum, total RNA, and cell lysates. In conclusion, we believe this method exhibits potential for both specific discrimination and universal signal amplification for RNA analysis in complex matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A uranyl detection strategy with ultra-sensitivity was developed based on entropy-driven amplification and DNAzyme circular cleavage amplification. The cleavage of UO22+-specific DNAzyme produces a DNA fragment to initiate the entropy-driven amplification. Two DNA sequences released from the entropy-driven amplification are partly complementary. They can form an entire enzyme strand (E-DNA) of Mg2+-specific DNAzyme. The formed E-DNA can circularly cleave FAM-labeled probes on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), causing the leaving of FAM from AuNPs and recovery of fluorescent signal. A linear relationship was obtained in the range from 30 pM to 5 nM between fluorescence intensity and concentration of UO22+. The limit of detection was low to 13 pM. This method showed a promising future for practical application in real water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Arginine/lysine methylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) involved in DNA repairing, transcriptional regulation, etc. Immunoaffinity enrichment is currently the most widely used methods for the methylproteome analysis. Large-scale analysis of arginine methylation has been realized by using pan-R-methyl antibodies. Unfortunately, pan specific antibodies targeting all three lysine methylation forms are not available. In this study, we presented a novel chromatography-based enrichment method for global methylproteome analysis. The offline multidimensional tandem chromatography combining strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and high-pH reversed-phase chromatography (high-pH RP) was applied in the large-scale analysis of methylproteome. Totally, 860 forms on 765 sites were identified from BEL cells, covering all five arginine/lysine methylation forms. Among them, 27.21% were lysine methylation forms. This technique allows the simultaneous analysis of both arginine and lysine methylation while it has improved performance for the identification of lysine methylation. Therefore, it is a promising strategy for the investigation of biological functions related to methylation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays solid materials in which amino groups are linked to silica matrices through alkyl chains of different length (C18, C8, C4) are successfully employed in CO2 capture and storage technologies, as well as in a variety of chromatographic applications. In particular, their use as stationary phases finds remarkable success in performing HILIC separations and, in general, in the effective resolution of important compound classes (e.g. mixtures of mono- or oligo-saccharides). In this study an original and operationally simple procedure designed to quantify the density of basic groups (typically amino groups) chemically bonded to the surface of porous solids, which also allows a full recovery of the analysed material, is presented. The method is based on the preventive acid-base reaction of the basic groups linked to the solid by 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA). The quantification of the basic functionalities is then performed by an UV-spectrophotometric retro-titration of the thus salified solid matrix (or, alternatively, by HPLC approach), resorting to a preventive either acid or basic displacement of DNBA from the matrix. The uncertainty of the density measurements is assessed by 13%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glycosylation and phosphorylation are two important mechanisms in organism, both of which can finely regulate protein function respectively or simultaneously. Functional nanoprobes with various reversible interactions of aiming at glycan or phosphate group have been advanced dramatically, however, the comprehensive analysis towards them is largely restricted by the challenge to capture glycopeptides and phosphopeptides at the same time from complex samples due to the limitation of nanoprobe functionalization. Here, we fabricate a promising nanoprobe using the hydrophilic L-cysteine and titanium ions to enhance the phosphopeptides capture, meanwhile, realize the glycopeptides capture. We test the performance of the promising nanoprobe, showing that it is not only equipped with good unbiased ability in glycopeptides capture with high sensitivity and selectivity, but also highly effective for phosphopeptides capture. More importantly, the promising nanoprobe enables the simultaneous capture and analysis of glycosylated and phosphorylated peptides from mouse brain, as well as human eye lens of normal and cataract. The identification of glycosylated and phosphorylated sites within normal and cataract reflects their differential expression and offers an excellent insight to glycosylation/phosphorylation-related human eye diseases, indicating its great potential in glycoproteomics and phosphoproteomics researches.

AB The employment of spectroscopically-resolved NMR techniques as analytical probes have previously been both prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging in view of the large sizes of high-field facilities. However, with recent advances in the miniaturisation of magnetic resonance technology, low-field, cryogen-free "benchtop" NMR instruments are seeing wider use. Indeed, these miniaturised spectrometers are utilised in areas ranging from food and agricultural analyses, through to human biofluid assays and disease monitoring. Therefore, it is both intrinsically timely and important to highlight current applications of this analytical strategy, and also provide an outlook for the future, where this approach may be applied to a wider range of analytical problems, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB Novel enzymatic microsystems have strong prospects in chemical and biological analysis due to their low consumption of reagents, fast analysis time, easy manipulation and satisfactory portability. Nano-materials (NMs) provide a favorable platform for integrating enzymes into microsystems with enhanced selectivity and sensitivity. Various NM-enzyme immobilization strategies applied in the fabrication of capillary-based and chip-based enzymatic microsystems are summarized in this manuscript. We focus on highlighting the advantages of employing NM-based enzymatic microsystems for enantioseparation, inhibitor screening, bioreaction and biosensing. Innovative nanocomposites and NM-functionalized monoliths used to construct multienzymatic microsystems are also illustrated. The general development trend identified in this review indicates that the application of NMs has significantly improved enzymatic microsystem performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Immunoassay is a powerful technique to identify and quantify biological molecules, which base on the specificity and selectivity of antigen-antibody interaction. Impedance-based immunosensor has recently shown a great potential to provide rapid and label-free detections. However, the conventional impedance-based immunosensors rely on dedicated electrochemical measurement interface which involves expensive fabrication procedures such as gold deposition and photolithography. In this work, we propose an ultra-low-cost and high processing efficiency platform for impedance-based immunosensing. With effortless operations of direct-laser-writing, an impedance-based immunoassay can be fabricated within 5 min in standard laboratories. The as-fabricated devices have shown great stability and a high device-to-device uniformity. In order to further validate impedance sensing system's performance, finite element analysis and impedance equivalent model analysis were performed. The measured data was consistent with the simulation results. With the standard gold electrodes surface bio-functionalization procedures, the disposable immunoassay can detect anti-IgG down to 10 ng/ml. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. In this work we studied two glycan isomers, 2,3-sialyllactose (3-SL) and 2,6-sialyllactose (6-SL), frequently appearing in glycoproteins connected with cancer. A combination of square wave voltammetry and glycan modification with osmium(VI) N, N, N', N'-tetramethylethylenedi-amine (Os(VI) tem) allowed to distinguish between these regioisomers, since the 6-SL molecule can bind three Os(VI), while the 3-SL only two Os(VI) moieties, as experiments using capillary electrophoresis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography showed. A similar pattern of Os(VI)-modification was found for isomers of sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine and sialylgalactose. Covalent adducts of Os(VI) tem with glycans yielded three reduction voltammetric peaks. The ratio of peak I/peak II heights depends on the content of individual regioisomer in the sample. Our proposed approach allows the determination of isomer percentage representation in the mixture after one voltammogram recording. These results show a new appropriate method for the discrimination of glycan isomers containing terminal sialic acid important for distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous origin of biomarkers.

AB The use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is steadily increasing. Previous studies have reported the clinical interest of mAb therapeutic-drug monitoring (TDM), including that of adalimumab, for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Proof of concept mAb-quantification studies by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have been published, but a specific and reliable routine-suited multiplex quantification method is still needed to facilitate mAb TDM.
   We describe an electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of seven mAbs (adalimumab, cetuximab, infliximab, rituximab, secukinumab, tocilizumab, and trastuzumab) in human plasma. Sample preparation was performed using protein-G purification and trypsin digestion to obtain proteotypic peptides. We retrospectively measured the adalimumab concentration in 65 plasma samples from 56 CD patients and determined the adalimumab therapeutic cut-off concentration associated with biological remission.
   Calibration curves were linear from 1 to 100 mu g mL(-1), except for rituximab (5-100 mu g mL(-1)). This method was reproducible, repeatable, and accurate (coefficient of variation and bias < 20%), with no cross contamination. Adalimumab concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.0198) for patients with biological remission (median: 11.3 mgmL(-1) [4.6; 18.3]) than that for patients without a biological response (9.5 mu g mL(-1) [3.94; 17.0]). An adalimumab cut-off concentration of 8.0 mu g mL(-1) correctly discriminated patients with or without biological remission (sensitivity: 74.1%, specificity: 57.9%).
   This validated LC-MS/MS routine-suited method is the first allowing simultaneous quantification of up to seven mAbs acting against different pharmacological targets. It opens the field of TDM to numerous mAbs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a sensitive, selective and robust method for the determination of 14 thiol compounds in aqueous samples. Thiols were derivatized with omega-bromoacetonylquinolinium bromide (BQB) and its deuterium labeled equivalent D7-omega-bromoacetonylquinolinium bromide (D7). Derivatized thiols were preconcentrated by online solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography separation and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry determination (SPE/LC-ESI-MS/MS). The robustness of the method was validated for wide ranges in pH, salinity, and concentrations of sulfide and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to cover contrasting natural water types. The limits of detection (LODs) for the thiols were 3.1-66 pM. Between 6 and 14 of the thiols were detected in different natural sample types at variable concentrations: boreal wetland porewater (0.7-51 nM), estuarine sediment porewater (50 pM-11 nM), coastal sea water (60 pM-16 nM), and sulfate reducing bacterium cultures (80 pM-4 nM). MS/MS fragmentation of the compounds produces two pairs of common product ions, m/z 130.2/137.1 and 218.1/225.1, which enables scanning for unknown thiols in precursor ion scan mode. Using this approach, we identified cysteine, mercaptoacetic acid, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sulfurothioic S-acid in boreal wetland porewater. The performance of the developed method sets a new state of the art for the determination of thiol compounds in environmental and biological samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In metabolomics research, false positive features from non-sample sources and noises usually exist in the peak table, they will make the results of screening differential metabolites or biomarkers unreliable. In this study, a method to remove false positive features (rFPF) was developed to improve the quality of the peak table. rFPF recognizes real peak profiles based on the information entropy and statistical correlation, and eliminates false positive features from non-sample sources and noises. A standard mixture with 42 standards (14 isotopic labeled internal standards and 28 common standards) and a urine sample were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the rFPF method. The analysis results of metabolite standards showed that more than 92% false positive features were removed by rFPF, but target standards completely remained. The analysis results of urine sample showed that the number of features was significantly reduced from 7182 to 2522. Interestingly, 98% of the identified metabolites remained after removing false positive features. The proposed rFPF shows great prospects as a new data handling method for metabolomics studies.

Herein, we rationally designed four NO probes, BDP-NO, Mito-NO-T, Mito-NO and Lyso-NO, based on BODIPY dye substituted at meso position with 5-amino-2-methoxy-phenyl scaffold. These four probes all showed fast fluorescence off-on response toward NO with excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with the detection limit of BDP-NO to reach 5.7 nM. We introduced triphenylphosphonium and morpholine moieties onto BODIPY scaffold respectively to enable organelle-targetability. MTT and flow cytometry assay demonstrated that the probes exhibited low cytotoxicity, which was beneficial to the biological application in living cells. Confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments confirmed excellent mitochondria targeting for Mito-NO and lysosome-targeting with Lyso-NO for the detection of NO in living cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The quest for detecting bacteria has gained momentum in food and beverage industry for preventing spoilage of products to maintain requisite quality. The present paper describes the development of a SERS immunosensor for the detection of model pathogen, S. typhimurium using strategically synthesized functionalized polymeric magnetic nanoparticles (FPMNPs) as effective capture probe and immuno-magnetic separator. The synthesized probe contains surface diketonic functionalities which covalently link with amino groups of antibodies against Salmonella common structural antigen (CSA-1-Ab) and hence specifically captured the target bacteria. Magnetic core of nanoparticles facilitated easy separation of target bacteria from the milieu of non-specific molecules. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) modified with CSA-1-Ab and external Raman reporter molecules (RRM) were used as signal probes. We compared the signalling attributes of 4-mercapto benzoic acid (MBA) and 5,5'-dithiobis(succinimidyl-2-nitrobenzoate) (DSNB) as RRMs. Capture and signal probes sandwich the target bacteria upon its addition, generating Raman signal from the 'hot-spots' created by signal probe. Under optimal conditions, the SERS intensities of MBA and DSNB at 1588 and 1336 cm(-1) respectively were used to measure the concentration of the pathogen in the range of 101-107 cells mL(-1). Limit of detection (LOD) of MBA and DSNB based immunosensor was measured as 100 cells mL(-1), and 10 cells mL(-1) respectively. Moreover, appreciable recovery (82-114%) was recorded for sensing method for different spiked food products. Thus, the developed magnetically assisted SERS immunosensor is sensitive, specific and has strong potential to be used for detecting contamination in food samples in field conditions.

AB A novel and versatile immunosensing strategy was developed for ultrasensitive and specific detection of proteins by organically integrating interfacial specific target recognition and homogeneous transcription amplification. In principle, classic antigen-antibody sandwich structure on the microplate could realize the specific identification of target protein. Biotinylated DNA probe was subsequently introduced by streptavidin-biotin system as a bridge linking interfacial and homogeneous reaction. The biotinylated DNA initiated exponential transcription amplification in the solution, which converted per target recognition event on the interface to numerous single-stranded RNA products in solution for highly sensitive fluorescence immunosensing. The proposed immunoassay based on interfacial recognition-induced homogeneous exponential transcription (IR-HET) for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) detection showed a good linear range from 0.01 to 1000 pg/mL and the limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL, which was 3 orders lower than traditional ELISA method. The established strategy was also successfully applied to directly detect VEGF from culture supernatants of tumor cells and clinical body fluid samples, proving very high sensitivity, selectivity and low matrix effect. Therefore, IR-HET-based immunosensing strategy might become a potential powerful tool be applied in ultrasensitive detection of low abundance protein biomarker for clinical early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.

AB An efficient method for the highly sensitive and specific detection of cancer cells is crucial for the early diagnosis of cancer. In this work, we propose a one-pot approach to fabricating magnetic-fluorescent iron oxide-carbon hybrid nanomaterials (MCNP) with excellent stable, high quantum yield and excellent magnetic properties for breast cancer cells recognition and detection via magnetic resonance and multicolour fluorescence imaging. MCNPs were efficiently synthesised via one-pot, multi-component reactions of FeCl3, FeCl2 center dot 4H(2)O, citric acid and ethylenediamine in diethylene glycol. The MCNPs showed strong excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence in the blue-red region with a high quantum yield of 58.4%, and they presented higher stability and T-2 relaxivity than pure iron oxide nanoparticles. After conjugating with CD44 monoclonal antibodies, the fabricated targeting nanoprobe, MCNPs-CD44, demonstrated a specific fluorescence/MRI dual imaging contrast effect in 4T1 breast cancer cells. Biological transmission electron microscope imaging showed a significant preferential uptake of the nanoparticle conjugates by the 4T1 cells. By taking advantage of the high binding affinity and specificity of the CD44 antibodies to the overexpressed CD44 on the cancer cell surface, the developed MCNPs-CD44 probe distinguished 4T1 breast cancer cells from normal cells and detected as low as a few hundred cancer cells, thus indicating the potential application of multifunctional nanocomposites in the MR diagnosis and fluorescence positioning of breast cancer at cellular-level resolution.

AB BCR/ABL(p210) fusion gene, the characteristic biomarker of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), contains two different transcription isoforms, e13a2 and e14a2, which lead to differences in the pathological features and response to targeted drug. At present, there is short of simple and fast technology to distinguish these two transcript isoforms. In this paper, RNA fusion-triggered rolling circle amplification (RF-RCA) strategy was developed to distinguish e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts directly from RNA extraction in one step. The simultaneous binding of dumbbell template and corresponding primer with target fused RNA can induce their proximal hybridization and trigger the RCA to produce lots of tandem repeat G-quadruplexes sequences for real time fluorescence readout with the interaction of Thioflavin T and G-quadruplex. The proposed strategy can detect as low as 0.1 aM target and discriminate e13a2 (0.01%) and e14a2 (0.1%) transcript isoforms directly from complex genomic RNA extraction, proving high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the RF-RNA was successfully applied to analyze BCR/ABL(p210) isoforms from clinical samples for accurately molecular subtyping and monitoring the response of imatinib treatment. The developed RF-RCA strategy presented an ultrasensitive, accurate and pragmatic toolbox to simple and rapid discriminate BCR/ABL(p210) fusion isoforms for promoting clinical research and personalized treatment of CML.

AB Carbohydrates are among the most abundant organic molecules in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems; however, very few studies have addressed their isotopic signature using compound-specific isotope analysis, which provides additional information on their origin (delta C-13) and fate (Delta C-14). In this study, semi-preparative liquid chromatography with refractive index detection (HPLC-RI) was employed to produce pure carbohydrate targets for subsequent offline delta C-13 and Delta C-14 isotopic analysis. delta C-13 analysis was performed by elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) whereas Delta C-14 analysis was performed by an innovative measurement procedure based on the direct combustion of the isolated fractions using an elemental analyzer coupled to the gas source of a mini carbon dating system (Aix-MICADAS). In general, four successive purifications with Na+, Ca2+, Pb2+, and Ca2+ cation-exchange columns were sufficient to produce pure carbohydrates. These carbohydrates were subsequently identified using mass spectrometry by comparing their mass spectra with those of authentic standards.
   The applicability of the proposed method was tested on two different environmental samples comprising marine particulate organic matter (POM) and total suspended atmospheric particles (TSP). The obtained results revealed that for the marine POM sample, the d13C values of the individual carbohydrates ranged from -18.5 to -16.8%, except for levoglucosan and mannosan, which presented values of -27.2 and -26.2%, respectively. For the TSP sample, the delta C-13 values ranged from -26.4 to -25.0%. The galactose and glucose Delta C-14 values were 19 and 43%, respectively, for the POM sample. On the other hand, the levoglucosan radiocarbon value was 33% for the TSP sample. These results suggest that these carbohydrates exhibit a modern age in both of these samples. Radiocarbon HPLC collection window blanks, measured after the addition of phthalic acid (C-14 free blank), ranged from -988 to -986% for the abovementioned compounds, indicating a very small background isotopic influence from the whole purification procedure. Overall, the proposed method does not require derivatization steps, produces extremely low blanks, and may be applied to different types of environmental samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Surfactant bilayers or admicelles at the solid surface-liquid interface inside 50-200 mm inner diameter (i.d.) open-tube fused-silica capillaries were developed as 'soft' stationary pseudophases for the liquid chromatographic (LC) separations of neutral and charged analytes. Admicelles were formed in-situ from buffered aqueous mobile phases with cetytrimethyl ammonium bromide at concentrations between the critical surface aggregation concentration and critical micelle concentration, which were determined by electroosmotic flow measurements using capillary electrophoresis. There were no micelles in the mobile phase solution. Also, there was no solid phase that is classically required in LC. Pressure and voltage driven modes or open-tubular admicellar liquid chromatography (OT-AMLC) and electrochromatography, respectively were proposed based on the separation of neutral analytes. The parameters (i.e., pH, concentration of surfactant, salt, and methanol in the mobile phase and capillary i.d.) that affected the surprising chromatographic effect of admicelles at the interface were investigated. The analytical performance of OT-AMLC for small molecules were found acceptable. Applications to environmental water and biological (HepG cell line metabolism media) samples analysis with appropriate sample preparation procedures were also conducted. The use of pseudophases at the solid surface-liquid interface could be a viable solution to problems associated with the use of solid stationary or support materials in nano- and micro-liquid chromatography and electrochromatography.

AB Sample preparation for non-target analysis is challenging due to the difficulty in the extraction of polar and non-polar analytes simultaneously. Most commercial solid sorbents lack the proper comprehensiveness for extraction of analytes with different physiochemical properties. A possible key is the combination of hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic surface functional groups in solid based extraction methods in order to generate the susceptibility for retaining both polar and non-polar analytes. To pursue this goal, in this study, four polar groups including -NH2, -NO2, -COOH, and -COCH3 were chemically bound to Amberlite XAD-4 substrate in order to prepare a generic extraction platform. To validate the applicability of extractive phases, 22 analytes possessing wide range of polarities (LogP range between -2 and +7) were chosen for extraction using the synthesized polymers by online micro solid phase extraction (mu-SPE) and further analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography and UV-Vis detection (HPLC-UV). The recovery data were compared with commercial sorbents by t-test, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Amberlite XAD-4 modified with COOH group (XAD-COOH) revealed extraction efficiencies statistically better than commercially available sorbents including LiChrolut (R) EN, Oasis (R) HLB and Amberlite (R) XAD-4 (R). The reproducibility and repeatability of XAD-COOH were also studied and acceptable results were obtained. Furthermore, the swellability of polymers was also measured and the results were comparable with commercial ones. To evaluate the extraction ability of XAD-COOH in real sample matrix, water sample near a heavy crude oil spill, urine and hospital wastewater were analyzed. Comparison of the data with LiChrolut (R) EN corroborates the dominance of XAD-COOH for screening analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is of great importance to elucidate the fate of drugs, e.g., their cellular uptake, transport and metabolism/excretion at single cell level. In the present work, cellular uptake and excretion of curcumin in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were investigated by measuring Co-59 in a curcumin cobalt complex ([Co(tpa)(cur)1(CIO4)(2)) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The uptake and distribution pattern of the metal drug complex in single cells were thoroughly studied, demonstrating extremely large discrepancy of uptake behavior among individual cells. The complex concentration-dependent uptake and excretion behavior is observed for both HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. The uptake of ([Co(tpa)(cur)](CIO4)(2)) by HepG2 cells is firstly increased with the concentration of the complex followed by level-off at certain level. On the other hand, however, the uptake by MCF-7 cells increases exponentially with the complex concentration within a same concentration range. The present study provides important information on the transport process of the metal drug complex at single cell level, it may be promising for further applications in the elucidation of metal drug effectiveness in vivo.

AB The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process is a practical approach to convert synthesis gas (CO and H-2) into hydrocarbons and oxygenates, and these product mixtures are usually well-characterized. However, the analysis of Fischer-Tropsch waste water (FTW) is still somewhat underdeveloped and the exact composition of FTW remains unclear. Herein, various qualitative NMR techniques, especially diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) and one dimension (1D) selective gradient total correlation spectroscopy (SelTOCSY) were strategically applied in the analysis of FTW. The NMR results show that the DOSY technique can pseudo-separate most of components in complex mixtures over the diffusion dimension. The SelTOCSY technique is used as a supporting method in the cases where the DOSY technique cannot clearly distinguish overlapped signals. Moreover, the quantitative H-1 NMR (qNMR) was further used to quantify the components of the sample. These routine and advanced qualitative and quantitative NMR technique utilized here provide a fast, effective and feasible method for the identification of complex mixtures in FTW, which might be a powerful and fast alternative to gas chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography for FTW research.

AB A novel mushroom-like electrochemical immunoassay for the ultrasensitive detection of histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT p300) has been established on account of the new composite graphene oxide (GO) nanolayer. The immunoassay involves immobilization of substrate peptide onto Au electrode, acetylation in lysine of substrate peptide, and the interaction between acetyl group of lysine and acetylantibody (Ab(Ac)) of the GO nanolayer. The GO nanolayer comprises large amounts of methylene blue molecules (MB), giving rise to large signal amplification. Only in the presence of HAT p300, an obvious electrochemical signal appears and the peak linear current is proportion to the HAT p300 concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 150 nM with a detection limit of 0.0036 nM. The great enhancement on sensitivity of the proposed mushroom-like immunosensor derives from both the constructed Faraday cage and the extended outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). Further, the immunosensor with excellent sensitivity and selectivity can be applied for the HAT p300 activity detection in Hela cell lysates, serum and urine, hinting an improved and splendid analytical performance. Briefly, this stable, simple and ultrasensitive electrochemical immunoassay has considerable promise for further applications in the HATs-interrelated epigenetic studies and drug development.

AB As an ideal alternative to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) has similar biotoxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity as BPA. Nevertheless, to date, a fast, sensitive and portable method for meeting on-site measurement of BPS had not been established. Hence, it was particularly urged to develop a fast and highly sensitive method for tracing BPS. Currently, a novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor had been successfully fabricated for the detection of BPS, wherein the composite of three-doped carbon quantum dots (B, N, F-CQDs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were utilized as an electron conducting layer, and MIP was applied as recognition element of target molecules. The step-by-step fabrication process and the adsorption capacity of the modified electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronocoulometry (CC). The results indicated that the synergy between B, N, F-CQDs and AgNPs dramatically improved the sensitivity of the electrode and achieved the amplification of the electrical signal. Meanwhile, the electrochemical activities of BPS were explored by CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). And, the various parameters relating to the electrochemical kinetic properties of BPS were calculated. To the best of our knowledge, this was rarely reported in peer journals. The MIP remarkably improved the selectivity of the sensor owing to the specific recognition of the imprinted cavities. The linear response range of the new sensor was 1 x 10(-8) M to 5 x 10(-5) M with a detection limit of 1.12 x 10(-8) M and the electrode designed in this paper could meet the requirement of trace-level measurement of BPS in biological and environmental samples. Additionally, the sensor was used to determine BPS in plastic products with good anti-interference and acceptable recovery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A mechanochemical magnetic solid phase extraction (MCMSPE) method was developed for a one-pot extraction and enrichment of organochlorine pesticides in tea leaves to demonstrate the advantage of using magnetic nanoparticles in the sample preparation process. The enriched analytes were subsequently detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The presence of magnetic metal-organic-framework (MMOF) (Fe3O4@MIL-100 (Fe)) nanoparticles help to rupture the cell walls in solid plant samples more thoroughly, and at the same time, act as a selective sorbent for the enrichment of target analytes. Compared to traditional methods, this approach significantly shortens the sample processing time from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. The parameters of the procedure were systematically studied and optimized to achieve good limits of detection (0.62-3.92 ng g(-1), LOD S/N = 3), significantly improved recoveries (81.46-113.59%), and good reproducibility (RSD 2.63-9.87%, n = 5). The results indicated that this method can be applied for high throughput determination of organochlorine pesticides in tea leaves, and can be used for other dried plant samples.

AB Highly efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides in low abundance prior to mass spectrometry analysis is essential in phosphopeptidomics analysis. Herein, an affinity probe possessing both interactions of polyoxometalates (POMs) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was facilely prepared. POMs and cysteamine hydrochloride-modified chitosan (CYECS) were assembled onto magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) via a layer-by-layer approach. The developed MNPs-(POM/CYECS) material owned merits of large metal oxide surfaces, positive charge, and hydrophilicity as well as superparamagnetism. By combining with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), the prepared material was utilized for effective enrichment of phosphopeptides. High selectivity (mass ratio of beta-casein and bovine serum albumin digests of 1:5000) and low detection limit (0.02 fmol) toward phosphopeptides were achieved. The recovery of phosphopeptides was measured to be 92.6%. The specific enrichment of phosphopeptides from complex samples (nonfat milk, human saliva, serum, and A549 cell lysate) with MNPs-(POM/CYECS) material further confirmed its bright prospects for isolation of phosphopeptides from biological samples.

ID OF-CARE IDENTIFICATION
AB In order to provide timely emergency management for the patients accidently or intentionally ingested of household pesticides, it is crucial to develop a point-of-care analytical technique for early ex vivo identification of swallowed pesticides. In this study, probe sampling combined with electrospray laser desorption ionization/mass spectrometry (ELDI/MS) was performed to rapidly detect spiked non-volatile household pesticides in the gastric juice drained from the patients during lavage. Since no sample pretreatment is required, probe sampling is fast, and high thermal energy for analyte desorption is provided; ELDI/MS detects the household pesticides in gastric juice within 30 s. The detection limits of the household pesticides were found to be 0.05-1 mg/L, this makes ELDI/MS combined with probe sampling a novel and efficient analytical tool for providing important toxicological information to ensure an appropriate emergency medical response.

AB Current untargeted approaches for metabolic fingerprinting of colon tissue and cell lines lack validation of reproducibility and/or focus on a selection of metabolites as opposed to the entire metabolome. Yet, both are critical to ensure reliable results and pursue a fully holistic analysis. Therefore, we have optimized and validated a platform for analyzing the polar metabolome and lipidome of colon-derived cell and tissue samples based on a consecutive extraction of polar and apolar components. Peak areas of selected targeted analytes and the number of untargeted components were assessed. Analysis was performed using ultra-high performance liquid-chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This resulted in an optimized extraction protocol using 50% methanol/ultrapure water to obtain the polar fraction followed by a dichloromethane-based lipid extraction. Using this comprehensive approach, we have detected more than 15,000 components with CV < 30% in internal quality control (IQC) samples and were able to discriminate the nontransformed (NT) and transformed (T) state in human colon tissue and cell lines based on validated OPLS-DA models ((RY)-Y-2 > 0.719 and Q(2)> 0.674). To conclude, our validated polar metabolomics and lipidomics fingerprinting approach could be of great value to reveal gastrointestinal disease-associated biomarkers and mechanisms.

AB Non-targeted small molecule screening methods are used to analyze samples for potential compounds of interest without focusing on specific molecular species. There is great interest in these methods for metabolomic, environmental, forensic, and food safety applications, among others, to determine compounds that are responsible for a particular disease state or the presence of a harmful compound. In order for non-targeted analyses to become standardized and routine, best practices for sample preparation, data collection, and data analysis must be determined. This work focuses on optimizing specific aspects of a non-targeted workflow that utilizes high-resolution mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap instrument coupled to liquid chromatography. Sample preparation, liquid chromatography gradient length, and mass spectrometry resolving power and ionization modes were investigated to determine optimal conditions for detecting and extracting compounds from the data that cover broad molecular and polarity ranges. Infant rice cereal, orange juice, and yogurt with spiked standards were analyzed; food is inherently challenging to analyze due in part to sample complexity and diversity. Of the conditions tested, optimal conditions included a generic sample extraction using acetonitrile, water, and formic acid, a 25 min chromatographic gradient, collecting data in both positive and negative ion modes, and using 70 k resolving power. There are of course tradeoffs associated with each of these options that will be described in detail so that the appropriate conditions can be chosen for the desired application.

AB A flow-through colorimetric assay for detection of nucleic acids in plasma is reported. The proposed assay features an array of four polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes impregnated with cationic poly (3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene) (PT) as an optical reporter. The sensing strategy is based on monitoring the changes in optical properties of PT, upon complexation with target nucleic acids in the presence and in the absence of their corresponding complementary peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). As a proof of concept, the proposed methodology is validated using two biomarkers; lung cancer associated microRNA (mir21) and hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA). The flow-through colorimetric assay enabled detection of mir21 and HBV-DNA in plasma without requiring tedious sample pre-treatment and clean up protocols. Colorimetric responses for mir21 and HBV-DNA were obtained at nanomolar concentrations over five orders of magnitudes (from 1 nM to 10 mu M), with a limit of detection of -0.6 nM and -2 nM in DI water and plasma, respectively. A logic gate system was developed to utilize the colorimetric assay responses as inputs for discrimination of mir21 and HBV-DNA and subsequently to obtain a profile of nucleic acids in samples that exceed respective clinical threshold limits, thereby enabling rapid and point of care (POC) disease diagnosis. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be utilized for detection of a large number of nucleic acids in plasma by extending the array of PT impregnated membranes incorporated with their corresponding complementary PNAs.

AB A new boronic acid derivative functionalized with a 4-(3-(4-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole-2-yl)phenyl)1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yllphenyl (LOP) moiety was synthesized for use as a sequential "on-off-on"-type relay fluorescence probe for Fe3+ ions and F- ions with high selectivity and sensitivity under physiological conditions. The introduction of Fe3+ to LOP boronic acid (IOPBA) formed an Fe3+-IOPBA complex, which led to quenching of the blue fluorescence intensity at 458 nm. The lowest-energy conformation of IOPBA was theoretically predicted to adopt an extended structure, and the Fe3+ ion in the Fe3+-IOPBA complex was coordinated to two phenyl groups to form a pi-complex. Upon addition of F- to the Fe3+-IOPBA complex, the original fluorescence was recovered due to formation of [FeF6](3-), resulting in "on-off-on"type sensor behavior. IOPBA showed high selectivity towards Fe3+ among other cations. Moreover, the Fe3+-IOPBA complex showed specific selectivity towards F-, with other cations and anions not interfering with detection. Both sensing processes showed 1:1 stoichiometry with binding constants of 6.87 x 10(6) and 4.49 x 10(6) mol(-1) L for Fe3+ with IOPBA and F- with Fe3+-IOPBA, respectively. The limits of detection for Fe3+ and F- were 10 and 1 nM, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied in real water samples. Furthermore, the probe had low cytotoxicity and was successfully used as a bioimaging reagent to detect intracellular Fe3+ and F- in living HeLa cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A visual, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection of two algal metabolites, geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) using a competitive displacement technique based on molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) and fluorescent tags was developed. In this method, fluorescent tags that bind to synthetic receptor sites of MIPs were designed and synthesised. In the presence of target analytes (geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol respectively), the tags are displaced leading to fluorescence signals. The MIPs were derived from the polymerisation of functional monomers and crosslinkers in the presence of suitable templates. Good to high binding capacities and selectivities were obtained with the MIPs. The displacement of fluorescent-tagged substrates from the respective MIPs by the target analytes enabled the quantitative detection of geosmin at concentrations as low as 0.38 mu M (69 mu g L-1), while the LOD for 2-methylisoborneol is 0.29 mu M (48 mu g L-1) without any cross-reactivity, non-specific (false-positive) binding, and matrix complications. Qualitative detection of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol is also possible via visualisation of fluorescence using a hand held UV lamp, with LOD for geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol at 0.44 mu M (80 mu g L-1) and 0.35 mu M (60 mu g L-1), respectively. The sensitivity of the system can be improved with a pre-concentration step using the respective MIPs as a sorbent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report a sensitive fluorescence probe Ratio-ALP for in vivo ratiometric imaging of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The probe was designed by conjugating a naphthalimide with a phosphate group as the responsive moiety for enzymatic reactions. The fluorescence intensity ratio displayed a linear relationship against the concentration of ALP in the concentration range from 0 to 200 U/L, its LOD is as low as 0.25 U/L. Ratio-ALP has good selectivity and sensitivity, high cell permeability, and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, probe Ratio-ALP was also successfully applied to image endogenous ALP activity in living cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glucaric acid (GlucA) has been identified as one of the top 10 potential bio-based chemicals for replacement of oil-based chemicals. Several synthetic enzyme pathways have been engineered in bacteria and yeast to produce GlucA from glucose and myo-inositol. However, the yields and titres achieved with these systems remain too low for the requirements of a bio-based GlucA industry. A major limitation for the optimisation of GlucA production via synthetic enzymatic pathways are the laborious analytical procedures required to detect the final product (GlucA) and pathway intermediates. We have developed a novel method for the simple and simultaneous analysis of GlucA and pathway intermediates to address this limitation using mixed mode (MM) HILIC and weak anion exchange chromatography (WAX), referred to as MM HILIC/WAX, coupled with RID. Isocratic mobile phase conditions and the sample solvent were optimised for the separation of GlucA, glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), inositol-1-phosphate (I1P), myo-inositol and glucuronic acid (GA). The method showed good repeatability, precision and excellent accuracy with detection and quantitation limits (LOD and LOQ) of 1.5-2 and 577 mM, respectively. The method developed was used for monitoring the enzymatic synthesis of the final step in the GlucA pathway, and showed that GlucA was produced from GA with near 100% conversion and a titre of 9.2 gL(-1).

AB The analysis of bacterial volatile organic compounds has gained attraction as a non-invasive way to identify disease-causing organisms, given that bacteria have unique metabolisms and volatile metabolic byproducts. In the present research, different adsorbent materials (Carbopack Y, X, B, Carboxen 1000 and Tenax TA), packed singularly or in combination, were compared in terms of sampling performance (sensitivity, repeatability and selectivity) for the extraction of standards and bacterial volatile metabolites in vitro (from Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli). After extraction, bacterial volatile organic compounds were desorbed and analyzed in a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography system coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC x GC-ToF MS).
   The results show that Tenax has the greater ability to extract the standard mix as well as volatile organic compounds with better repeatability (4-26 RSD%), higher sensitivity (on average similar to 24 fold) compared to Carbopack Y, X and Carboxen 1000 tube, which followed in terms of performance. In addition, Tenax confirmed the best sensitivity and discriminatory power with no misclassification in the untargeted and unsupervised analysis for the differentiation of the bacterial species.

AB This work proposed a procedure for microwave-assisted sample preparation of medicines using diluted nitric acid followed by determination of elemental impurities using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) according to the United States Pharmacopeia Chapters 232 and 233. Three solutions, i.e. inverse aqua regia, 7.0 and 2.0 mol L-1 HNO3, were evaluated for microwave-assisted digestion of nine drugs samples. The applicability of each digestion procedure was assessed by comparison of analyte concentrations determined using total (reference procedure) and partial digestions (proposed procedure) as well as by determining dissolved carbon content and evaluating matrix effects. There were none significant differences at a 95% confidence level among the concentrations determined applying reference and proposed procedures. Internal standardization (ICP OES) and aerosol dilution (ICP-MS) were applied for minimization and correction of matrix effects. Addition and recovery experiments were performed according to oral permissible daily exposures values specific for each element and each sample was spiked with element concentrations of 0.5J and 1.5J in order to check accuracies for 24 analytes. Recoveries ranged from 70 to 138% for ICP OES and from 72 to 128% for ICP-MS, for all elements but Os. All analytes were below the respective limits of quantification when applying all sample preparation procedures, except As, Ba, Co, Cu, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, TI and V, however the determined concentrations for these elements were lower than the limits proposed by Chapter 232.

AB We are reporting an innovative building-block for the development of biosensors based on the non-covalent functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with avidin (MWCNTs-avidin). In this work, at variance with previous reports, avidin has the double role of simultaneously being the exfoliating agent of MWCNTs and the platform for anchoring different biotinylated biomolecules. The optimum dispersion was obtained by sonicating for 5.0 min 0.50 mgmL(-1) MWCNTs with 1.00 mgmL(-1) avidin solution prepared in 50:50 v/v ethanol/water. As proof-of-concept, we immobilized biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (b-HRP) at glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) modified with MWCNTs-avidin to develop a hydrogen peroxide biosensor using hydroquinone as redox mediator. Surface plasmon resonance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and amperometry demonstrated that, even after the partial denaturation of avidin due to the drastic conditions used to functionalize the MWCNTs, it preserves the biorecognition properties and efficiently interacts with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (b-HRP). The analytical characteristics of the resulting hydrogen peroxide biosensor are the following: linear range between 1.0 x 10(-6) M and 1.4 x 10(-5) M, sensitivity of (1.37 +/- 0.04) x 10(5) mu AM(-1), detection limit of 24 nM and reproducibility of 2.9%. The sensor was challenged with different samples, a mouthwash solution, human blood serum and milk, with very good performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This report outlines an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing platform based on watersoluble tungsten oxide quantum dots (WOx QDs) for the detection of dopamine (DA) released from P12 cells. The WOx QDs with good stability and water solubility were prepared by a facile and green hydrothermal method, and used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (WOx QDs/GCE). The proposed ECL sensor exhibited a stable and strong cathodic ECL signal when potassium peroxodisulfate (K2S2O8) as the coreactant in aqueous solution. The possible ECL mechanism was studied and deduced, and the ECL response signal of the proposed sensor decreased rapidly in the presence of dopamine (DA). Under optimal conditions, the ECL signals of WOx QDs linearly decreased with the increase of DA concentration in the range of 10 (-15) M to 10(-9) M and 10(-9) M to 10(-5) M, respectively. The detection limit was as low as 10(-15) M (S/N = 3). Based on these results, this method has been successfully applied to the determination of DA released by PC12 cells. The detection linear range for the detection of DA released by PC12 cells was from 0.1 to 0.9 mu M with a detection limit of 0.045 mu M. Therefore, the proposed ECL sensor displayed high sensitivity, good specificity and long-term stability, which may shed light on a new way to construct other high-performance ECL detection systems based on WOx or WOx QDs-based nanocomposites.

AB It remains a significant challenge for fast and high-throughput detection of trace analytes in complex samples with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) strategy due to the severe interference from matrices. In this work, a miniaturized array gas membrane separation (AGMS) device coupled with SERS was designed and drew up to eliminate matrix influence and improve the reproducibility of SERS signal during real sample analysis. The design of miniaturized AGMS tube was optimized based on quantitative calculation of its air permeability by computational fluid dynamics simulation. A 10 mm height tube was selected as an optimized design with a recovery of 98.3% for acetaldehyde. The practical feasibility of miniaturized AGMS was validated based on the applications in biochemical analysis and food analysis, such as albuminuria and acetaldehyde in urine sample and metaldehyde and thiram in food samples. The results showed that SERS responses of all analytes dramatically increased by eliminating sample matrices after miniaturized AGMS process. Acetaldehyde, albuminuria, metaldehyde and thiram in real samples could be accurately quantified with recoveries of 82.0-123.3%, and the analytical results were validated by corresponding standard methods with relative error ranging from -4.8% to 5.3%. Time consumption of miniaturized AGMS-SERS for one real sample analysis including sample preparation and determination was less than 20 min and could treat 96 samples with 45 min in one run. It is potential that the miniaturized AGMS technique automated by implementation with a robotic arm could greatly expand the range and accelerate the speed of SERS analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Development of novel matrix for surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) is a hot-spot in research frontiers. Herein, we established novel SALDI-MS approach for the analysis of cis-diol small molecules by using boronate affinity metal-organic frameworks (BA-MOFs) as the sor-bent for extraction and later as matrix for SALDI. In the meantime, the prepared BA-MOFs exhibited several significant merits, such as excellent selectivity, tolerance to interference and fast binding equilibria. By integrating the advantages of MOFs and the molecular recognition of boronate affinity, a novel platform for simultaneous enrichment and MS detection of cis-diol small molecules was proposed for the first time. There are only two steps in the operation procedure, which greatly simplified the whole experimental workflow. Efficient analysis of cis-diol small molecules in real samples were also well demonstrated. This proposed novel protocol not only gave new insights into the application of functionalized MOFs, but also promoted the development of SALDI- MS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel approach for effective liquid-liquid microextraction based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) decomposition was suggested for the first time. It was established that DESs synthesized from tetrabutylammonium bromide and long-chain alcohols decomposed in aqueous phase resulting in in situ dispersion of organic phase and extraction of hydrophobic analyte(s). It this process long-chain alcohol acted as an extraction solvent and tetrabutylammonium bromide acted as a dispersive agent and promoted mass transfer between aqueous and organic phases as a salting out agent. Phenomenon of DES decomposition was studied in detail and applied for separation and preconcentration in chemical analysis for the first time. The developed approach was applied for 17 beta-estradiol microextraction from transdermal gel samples as a proof-of-concept example. The results showed that the in situ dispersed organic phase obtained can provide efficient extraction of 17 beta-estradiol with good extraction recovery (95 +/- 5%) and excellent reproducibility (6%). The reported approach proves to be fast, simple, and inexpensive. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Toxicity assay is crucial in identifying biological mechanisms, detecting disease and screening therapeutics. Single cell toxicity assay reveals heterogeneous responses of each cell without ensemble average, but still cannot indicate responses of the same individual cells to multiple treatments. This article reports an identical cell assay that can be used at high throughput to locate each cell and track its responses to multiple treatments (chemicals and radiation), thus greatly facilitates toxicity based drug screening and testing. Each cell is located through its coordinators pre-engraved on a patterned substrate with soft lithography. Cell responses to X-ray radiation, chemical reagents or a combination of both are obtained by probing reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals and quantified by fluorescent intensity in MATLAB. The method can provide toxicities of over thousands of identical cells with superior statistics power to allow deep analysis of toxicity data. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In most cases, three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic analytical devices (3D-mu PADs) were fabricated manually by stacking or folding methods. For the first time, digital light processing stereolithography (DLP-SLA) 3D printing technology was adopted to automatically make 3D-mu PADs. In the fabrication process, a printing pause was set between two layers to allow paper to be placed in the resin tank. The resin on the fresh paper spontaneously bonded to the former cured paper layer during curing, thus realizing the automatic bonding and alignment between different layers of paper and avoiding the human participation and errors as in stacking and folding methods. There was a gap between two vertical aligned flow paths, therefore the liquid did not flow spontaneously from the upper layer to the lower layer. Most of the fluid flow in 3D-mu PADs was spontaneous or manually activated, which was not conducive to complex assays that require different regents to be delivered sequentially. Herein, we used an electric field or airflow to trigger the fluid flow and demonstrated the flow controllability by a proof-of-concept colorimetric assay. The limits of detection of glucose and albumin were 0.8 mM and 3.5 mu M, respectively, which were sufficient for clinical requirements. Given the characteristic of flow controllability, we believe that the proposed 3D-mu PADs have great potential to make paper-based complex assays automated and programmable. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Whooping cough also called Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory infection that affects all age populations. Given recent pertussis outbreaks, there is an urgent need for a point-of-care (POC) device for rapid diagnosis of pertussis. Herein, we report a low-cost microfluidic POC device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of pertussis. The 3D-printed bioanalyzer housed not only the biochip but also an in-house-developed portable and fully battery-powered heater for rapid POC detection of pertussis, without the need of external electricity. The fluorescence-based results could be rapidly visualized in about one hour by the naked eye without the need for any additional instrumentation. In addition, a simple centrifuge-free sample preparation process was optimized for the efficient lysis of pertussis samples and successfully used for direct detection of bacteria in nasopharyngeal samples. High sensitivity, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5 DNA copies per LAMP zone, and high specificity were demonstrated. We envision that the microfluidic POC device can be used in various venues such as medical clinics, schools, and other low-resource settings for the fast detection of pertussis.

AB Micro ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging enables the visualization of two-dimensional chemical distribution at a higher spatial resolution than macro-transmission FTIR imaging approach. In this study, micro ATR-FTIR imaging was applied for analysis of a specific morphology in a spherulite of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). The PHB spherulites crystallized at an isothermal condition, showed the fine band structure due to the twisting lamellar crystals during the spherulite growth under the polarized optical microscope (POM). In addition, the band structure observed in the PHB spherulite was the double band pattern in which the higher and lower birefringence banded areas alternatively appear due to the three-dimensional orientation of crystallographic axes and the biaxial refractive index ellipsoid of PHB crystalline structure. Micro ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging was employed for detecting the double band structure in the PHB spherulite. However, the obtained spectral images did not indicate any band structures.
   To detect the difference of molecular orientation among the double band structures, the micro ATR-FTIR imaging was performed with a linear polarizer at four different angles.
   The mean values of absorbance in each measured area changed depending on the polarizer angle. The in-plane molecular orientation to the tangential direction of spherulite, caused by the dependence of the average absorbance on the polarizer angles, was determined by the position of measured area in the spherulite and the linear dicroism of each of the spectral band used. To visualize the small difference of molecular orientation in the double band structure, micro ATR-FTIR images of the dichroic differences at three spectral bands were calculated from two different sets of polarizer angles. The micro ATR-FTIR images representing the dichroic differences displayed their corresponding distributions among three spectral bands. The complementary distributions of the dichroic difference were caused by the crystallographic orientation of b- and c-axes and were successfully visualized to reveal the pattern with the features less than 10 mu m in size. The results achieved in this study were due to two advantages of the polarized micro ATR-FTIR imaging: the high spatial resolution of micro ATR-FTIR imaging technique, and the high sensitivity of polarization measurements. Thus, this work demonstrates the power of this spectroscopic approach for such analytical investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Telomerase substrate (TS) primer is elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG)n in the presence of telomerase. The elongated primer can trigger hybridization chain reaction between two hairpins H1 and H2, result in the aggregation of AuNPs due to the hybridization between the tail sequence on H1 (or H2) and DNA-AuNPs probe, and accompany with the increase of hydrodynamic diameter of AuNPs, which can be measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS). The biosensor displayed a detection limit of 4 MCF-7 cells (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) and a dynamic range of 10-1000 cells. Moreover, only urine specimens from bladder cancer patients induced a significant change in the average hydrodynamic diameter, indicating its specificity for the non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer.

AB The sensitive detection of tumor proto-oncogenes is indispensable because the early diagnosis and accurate treatment of genetic diseases is the key guarantee of patients' health. In this study, we proposed a novel palindromic molecular beacon (PMB) that it bases on the signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of Kras gene codon 12. PMB is designed to have two palindromic fragments at its two ends, one of which is locked via folding into a hairpin structure and the other promotes the formation of PMB duplex via intermolecular self-hybridization. Target DNA can hybridize to the loop portion of PMB and release the palindromic fragment at the 3' end. Within the PMB duplex, the two palindromic fragments released hybridize with each other and serve as polymerization primer responsible for the strand-displacement amplification (SDA). Namely, hybridized target DNA can be displaced and initiates the next round of reactions, making the polymerization/displacement/hybridization process go forward circularly. As a result, a large number of polymerization products are produced, dramatically enhancing optical signal. Because primer hybridization and polymerization-based displacement occur within PMB duplex, the reaction process is called intramolecular strand-displacement amplification (ISDA). Via utilizing the newly-proposed PMB-based ISDA strategy, the target K-ras gene could be detected down to 10 pM with a wide response range of 1 x 10(-11)-1.5 x 10(-7) M, and point mutations are easily distinguished, realizing the ultrasensitive, highly selective detection of K-ras gene. This impressive sensing paradigm demonstrates a new concept of signal amplification for the detection of disease-related genes only via using a simple way to efficiently amplify optical signal.

AB Herein, a simple electrochemical sensor is proposed for 17 beta-estradiol (E2) determination. In this sensing platform, split DNA aptamers for E2 were applied as recognizing agents. In the presence of E2, split aptamers are bound to E2 and establish splitl-E2-split2 complex as a bridge on the surface of electrode. This physical bar leads to ultrasensitive detection of E2. This aptasensor is capable of recognizing E2 within 30 min without complicated procedures and expensive equipment. This sensing approach indicated a wide linear range with detection limits of 0.5 pM and 0.7 pM for E2 in tap water and milk samples, respectively. Simplicity and high specificity of the proposed electrochemical aptasensor make it an ideal sensing platform for ultra-low detection of other targets in complicated samples by replacement of split DNA aptamers.

AB A new highly selective and sensitive dual-mode sensor 3TD based on the conjugate of oligothiophene and barbituric acid moiety was developed for colorimetric and turn-on fluorescent detection of CN-. The sensor 3TD exhibited high specificity towards CN- by interrupting its own ICT producing thereupon a large blue-shift in UV-Vis spectrum and remarkable "turn-on" fluorescence emission. The detection limit was 2.26 x 10(-7) M, which is quite lower than the permissible level of CN- in drinking water according to the WHO. The fluorescent detection of CN- was well demonstrated by filter paper strips and silica coated TLC plates. Moreover, the sensor was also used to detect CN- in environmental water and agro-products with satisfactory results. Most importantly, in terms of these advantages of colorimetric and turn-on fluorescent dual-mode, immediate response, excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, low cytotoxicity, and good biocompatibility, the sensor 3TD was successfully applied into CN- imaging in living cells, demonstrating its excellent value in practical application.

AB The detection and discrimination of serum albumins (SAs) has been transforming as a research work of keen interest to the scientists in recent times. This is in the root of foundation of more and more fluorescent probes to selectively identify and distinguish the SAs in the modern era of research. Fluorescence based sensors are preferably on high demand because of high sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy. Herein we have synthesized berberine derivatives with substitutions at two different positions (9 and 13) with the purpose of an analytical study to detect and differentiate the SAs. It was found that only the 9-O substituted derivatives showed a dramatic enhancement in their inherently weak fluorescence intensity after the addition of serum albumins (BSA and HSA) indicating the occurrence of heteroatom induced hydrophobic binding interaction. Lower value of detection limit, 6.8 nM and 6.1 nM for BSA and 17.8 nM and 16.3 nM for HSA respectively for the two compounds N1 and N2 and extended range of linearity for both the probes justify the fruitfulness of the research work. Moreover, the two effective 9-O substituted probes response differently in presence of the two SAs by the nature, intensity of the fluorescence spectra and position of wavelength maxima which enable us in deciphering the two essential proteins. All the results reveal how the presence of a heteroatom influences the hydrophobic sensing of the SAs and divulge the utility of the synthesized berberine derivatives in detection and distinction of two SAs successfully in the coming years.

Copper ion induces a remarkable fluorescence enhancement and causes formation of a BT-1-Cu complex. The clamp-on coordination mode of BT-1 to Cu2+ was demonstrated using Job's plot, mass spectrum (MS) and DFT calculations. The calculations also indicate that Cu2+ was chelated to BT-1 through N and alkyne instead of S and alkyne. The probe could quantify Cu2+ with the detection limit of 3.2 x 10(-9)M. The in vitro imaging results indicated that the probe BT-1 was membrane-permeable and could be applied into the recognition of Cu2+ ions in living cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unraveling of enzymatic reactions, especially identification of enzymatic substrates or products, is important to elucidate biological processes. Here a selenium-isotopic signature for mass spectrometric identification of enzymatic-related species is demonstrated by using selenium-containing peptides (SePeps) as substrates. Thus a strategy is proposed for rapid and precise assay of multiple enzyme activity. These SePeps can be synthesized by introduction of one selenomethionine residue in the sequence and simply identified in the full-scan mode with the feature of distinctive selenium-isotopic distribution without MS/MS verifications, which proposes a novel solution to the specific identification of enzymerelated species, allows to exclude the interferences of species with tiny mass differences in biosamples, and meanwhile can offer a judgement on data accuracy for the analysis of enzyme activities. As a proof-of-concept, a method for multiple analysis of two representative enzymes in MCF-7 cell lysate has been developed with the isotopic peak areas of either SePep substrates or enzymatic products with the top intensities. These results could be the foundation to extend the method for more complicated enzyme systems. The selenium-isotopic signature provides a powerful protocol for high-throughput assays of peptide-metabolizing enzymes with enhanced confidence and can be extended to screen enzymatic reaction-related substrates.

AB Accurate determination of major elements using limited standard samples is always a big challenge in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Based on a simple calculation process, we propose a new one-point calibration method called single-sample calibration LIBS (SSC-LIBS) to build the calibration and improve the accuracy of determination of major elements. In this work, several major elements (Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Nb, and Mo) in three sets of matrix-matched certified samples were determined without sample preparation. The results showed that compared with multipoint calibration LIBS (MPC-LIBS), the R 2 , RMSECV, and ARE of Cu elements were improved from 0.40 to 0.97, 3.55 wt% to 0.76 wt%, and 5.19% to 1.05%, respectively, while the ARSD decreased from 16.22% to 1.15%. Furthermore, the AREs in the concentration ranges of 1-10, 10-20, 30-40, 50-60, 60-70, and 80-100 wt% were 5.16%, 2.55%, 1.75%, 1.69%, 1.05%, and 0.44%, respectively, with almost all less than 5%, as calculated by SSC-LIBS. These results demonstrated that SSC-LIBS can improve the accuracy and stability of detecting major elements using only one standard sample, which can greatly promote the application of LIBS.

AB Long-term and multipoint monitoring is very important to evaluate the safety of water environment. Atomic fluorescence spectrometer (AFS) is generally used for analyzing metals or metalloids in water quality monitoring. In the present work, for the first time, AFS is employed for sensitive monitoring of nitrogen nutrients, i.e., NO2-, NO3- and NH4+, with nitric oxide (NO) vapor generation. By taking advantage of the different vapor generation conditions for NO2-, NO3- and NH4+, a unit integrating with sampling, heating, cooling, gas-liquid separation and moisture removal is employed for controlling the vapor generation process, by reacting with either iodide or titanium (III). An antimony hollow cathode lamp is used for the excitation of NO to produce fluorescence emission at 193-320 nm. Linear calibration graphs are obtained within 0.02-2, 0.1-20, 0.2-1 mg L-1 for NO2-, NO3- and NH4+, along with detection limits of 0.006, 0.03, 0.06 mg L-1, respectively. The new analytical strategy obviously broadens the application of AFS, and it is well demonstrated by the determination of NO2-, NO3- and NH4+ in certified reference materials as well as various real water samples, providing competitive sensitivity with the current techniques for nutrient monitoring in environmental water.

AB In this work, toehold strand displacement cascade (TSDC) has been delicately designed and carried out on the cellular interface for the amplification and output of dual-electrochemical signal. Specifically, antibody cross-linked T strand can recognize cell which is linked with immune-magnetic bead. Subsequently, T strand on the cellular interface can mediate the occurrence of TSDC, resulting the change of S-N-3/S1-MB to S-N-3/S2-Fc ratio in the supernatant after magnetic separation. The resultant S-N-3/S1-MB and S-N-3/S2-Fc can be immobilized on the electrode interface through click chemistry and give the amplified double electrochemical signal. So the tumor cell amount can closely correlate with the change of the double signal. Except for output of the double signal for improvement of analytical accuracy, the double magnetic separation not only eliminate the interference of the complicated substances in serum, but also remove the influence of cell on click reaction on the electrode interface. So based on cellular interface supported TSDC for amplified dual-electrochemical signal, the established method has been successfully applied to analyze the tumor cells in serum accurately and sensitively.

AB The detection of sequence-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) is an important factor to the diseases diagnosis. Herein, a triple signal amplification electrochemical biosensor for highly sensitive detection of miRNA-21 was developed based on a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted target recycling combined with gold nanoparticles (NPs), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzymatic signal amplification. The electrochemical biosensor generated significantly amplified amperometric current changes (Delta i) for the detection of miRNA-21 down to 43.3 aM, and Delta iwas proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of miRNA-21 within the range of 0.1 fM to 100 pM. Meanwhile, the inherent selectivity of the term hairpin capture probe endowed the biosensor with high differentiation of similar miRNAs. The good feasibility of the proposed strategy for cell miRNA detection was confirmed by analyzing miRNA-21 in A549 lysates, which indicates its promising potential in biomedical research and clinical analysis.

AB A novel isotope dilution method for the analysis of inorganic chloride in fuel oil matrix is presented. The samples were diluted by isopropyl alcohol:toluene, mixed with Cl-37(-) internal standard and reacted with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate at room temperature. This reagent promoted conversion of Cl- into stable ethyl chloride (EtCI) which was selectively detected by headspace GC-MS/MS with no matrix effects. A limit of detection of 0.2 mg kg(-1) Cl- was obtained in fuel oil. The method was tested on the NIST SRM 1634c (trace elements in residual fuel oil) and validated through a series of robustness tests. Over 18 days, the variation in the signal response was less than 10% and the RSD for quantitative isotope dilution results was below 3%. Overall, the method is fast, simple and allows robust quantitation of inorganic chloride directly in the non-aqueous media. (C) Copyright 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel and green synthesis of a new hydrophilic molecularly imprinted 3-aminophenol-hexamethylenetetramine (MIAPH) resin for the selective recognition and separation of plant hormones was developed. The MIAPH resin was obtained using 3-aminophenol as multifunctional monomer which introduced hydroxyl, amino, and imino groups simultaneously, and adenine was used as a dummy template for molecular imprinting. Meanwhile, hexamethylenetetramine released formaldehyde slowly through hydrolysis which was used as the cross-linking agent to avoid the direct and excessive use of toxic formaldehyde. The entire procedure was performed under mild conditions, and was facile, environmentally friendly and energy-efficient. The obtained MIAPH resin showed high specific recognition toward plant hormones and higher recoveries in bean sprouts compared to NIAPH, HLB, and C18. Various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized, and the calibration linearity of the MIAPH-SPE-HPLC method was determined from 0.07 to 2.86 mg kg(-1) with a correlation coefficient (r) >= 0.9994 under the optimal conditions. Recoveries of spiked standards ranged from 90.2 to 99.1% for bean sprout with a relative standard deviation of <= 5.3%. Finally, the established MIAPH-SPE-HPLC method was successfully applied for the selective extraction and sensitive detection of plant hormones in a variety of complex vegetable matrices.

AB An analytical concept using stable isotope fractionation for analyzing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in food webs was developed and tested. We have evaluated methods for the extraction and clean-up of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs) as the model compounds of POPs from water, soil, plant, milk, fish oil and pork liver in order to study the reactive transport processes of HCHs in food webs using multi-element compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA). The extraction and clean-up methods were evaluated for recovery efficiency and isotope effects. The precision and accuracy for carbon, hydrogen and chlorine isotope analysis were within the analytical precision of +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, +/- 5 parts per thousand and +/- 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. The method was applied for stable isotope analysis of HCHs in possible food webs from soil to plants, and to animals. Isotope compositions of HCHs in cow/buffalo milk and dung, wild animal livers and seal blubber were obtained and compared to the sources of HCHs. The magnitude of isotope enrichment demonstrated the potential of CSIA for analyzing reactive transport processes of HCHs in the food web. The concept using multi-element stable isotope analysis can be applied for source identification, characterization of degradation mechanisms, and particularly contaminant accumulation in the food web, which demonstrates the potential in new scientific areas for CSIA.

AB The deuterium kinetic isotope effect has been known for a period of 40 years, but it is only relatively recently that new drug entities (NDEs) incorporating deuterium demonstrating beneficial pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology have arrived to market. Determination of the precise location to deuterate and subsequently any evaluation for a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is challenging. Typically, such an evaluation would be performed in an in vitro metabolic assay (e.g. liver microsomes) in separate reaction media for both the deuterated and non-deuterated analogues. Here, we have devised an approach whereby we incubate a 1:1 ratio of both the deuterated and protio-form of an imaging agent together in the same liver microsomal assay and determine the relative rate of consumption of both moieties, based upon specific MS-MS transitions unique to both molecules without the need for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) separation and quantification. Any deviation of the ratio of the MS transitions from the initial starting point indicated an observable KIE.
   A site specific deuteration of PBR111, a neuroinflammation imaging agent, was chosen for a proof-of-concept study. Based upon prior mechanistic knowledge of PBR111, two locations were selected for deuteration; an active and inactive site, to corroborate that there was no significant KIE for the inactive site and confirm the efficacy of the developed methodology.

AB We conducted single cell metabolomics studies of live cancer cells through online single cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) experiments combined with a generalized comprehensive data analysis workflow. The SCMS experiments were carried out using the Single-probe device coupled with a mass spectrometer to measure molecular profiles of cells in response to two mitotic inhibitors, taxol and vinblastine, under a series of treatment conditions. SCMS metabolomic data were analyzed using a comprehensive approach, including data pre-treatment, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and pathway enrichment analysis. For comparative studies, traditional liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) experiments were conducted using lysates prepared from bulk cell samples. Metabolomic profiles of single cells were visualized through Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and the phenotypic biomarkers associated with emerging phenotypes induced by drug treatment were discovered and compared through a series of rigorous statistical analysis. Species of interest were further identified at both the single cell and population levels. In addition, four biological pathways potentially involved in the drug treatment were determined through pathway enrichment analysis. Our work demonstrated the capability of comprehensive pipeline studies of single cell metabolomics. This method can be potentially applied to broader types of SCMS datasets for future pharmaceutical and chemotherapeutic research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) of organic molecules encapsulated in a crystalline sponge (CS). Cyclic organic compounds 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene, zerumbone, and muscone were encapsulated in CS as guest regardless of guest crystallization. Single-crystal X-ray analysis closely scrutinized the position of the guest in the pore and the interaction between the guest and the CS framework. After single-crystal X-ray analysis, the same single crystal was subjected to LDI-MS. Ionization efficiency differed markedly depending on whether pi-pi interaction existed or not. It is obvious that pi-pi interaction is the key to transferring laser energy from the CS framework to the guest for the ionization of molecule encapsulated in CS. The results suggest the importance of controlling the positions of analyte and matrix as well as noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding interaction, electrostatic interaction, and so on.

AB A ratiometric fluorescence probe (named ZOC) for the fast detection of HClO/ClO- was constructed by coumarin (donor) and pyridinium (acceptor) based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and intramolecular charge transfer (Icr) platform. ZOC possessed red emission signal (610 nm), large Stocks shift (190 nm), high energy transfer efficiency (95.3%), high selectivity and sensitivity, low detection limit (25 nM), wider detection range (from 25 nM to 30 mu M), rapid response (within 13 S), and good biocompatibility. It was very interesting that the recognition mechanism involved a new organic reaction in which olefin double bond reacted first with HClO/ClO - regioselectively, followed by cyclization. ZOC was successfully used to the real time detection of endogenous HClO/ClO- in RAW 264.7 cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid subtyping of influenza viruses in clinical laboratories has been increasingly important because three subtypes (seasonal H1N1, H3N2, and 2009 H1N1) of influenza A virus currently disseminated in humans have variable susceptibilities to antiviral drug. Herein, we present DNA aptamers for selective detection of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1) viruses by targeting recombinant influenza A mini-hemagglutinin (mini-HA) protein (the stable stem region of HA) and whole H1N1 viruses. The dissociation constants (K-D) of aptamer candidates V46 and V57 were 19.2 nM and 29.6 nM, respectively, according to electrochemical characterization (differential pulse voltammetry), demonstrating strong binding to mini-HA. In comparison, the K-D of the influenza virus antibodies is in the range of 1 mu M-10 nM. Aptamer V46 showed higher specificity and binding affinity to the mini-HA protein and H1N1 subtypes, and it was also incorporated into an indium tin oxide-based electrochemical sensor, showing sensitive and specific detection of H1N1 viruses, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.7 plaque-forming units per mL. The binding affinity, specificity, and LOD achieved with the electrochemical sensor suggest that it can be used for rapid subtyping of H1N1. We also propose that this aptamer can be used for the neutralization of H1N1 subtypes, suggesting potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A proximity ligation assay (PLA) induced hairpin to DNAzyme structure switching strategy has been described for entropy-driven amplified detection of thrombin. The enzyme-strand (E-DNA) and substrate-strand (S-DNA) of DNAzyme are locked in hairpins structure, and the catalytic activity of DNAzyme is inhibited simultaneously. However, in the presence of thrombin, the PLA can induce the unlocking of hairpin, and then the forming of active DNAzyme. Subsequently, the cleavage of DNAzyme can release DNA fragment to induce the entropy-driven amplification reaction, resulting significant recovery of fluorescent intensity by the separation of FAM from quencher. There was a good linear relationship in the range of 5 pM -1 nM. This method provides high reliability and sensitivity under enzyme and hairpin-free conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bioluminescent solid-phase sandwich-type microassay was developed to detect multiple sclerosis (MS)-associated autoantibodies in human sera. The assay is based on two different 2'-F-Py RNA aptamers against the target autoantibodies as biospecific elements, and Ca2+-regulated photoprotein obelin as a reporter. The paper describes elaboration of the assay and its application to 91 serum samples from patients with clinically definite MS and 86 ones from individuals healthy in terms of MS. Based on the receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis, the chosen threshold value as clinical decision limit offers sensitivity of 63.7% and specificity of 94.2%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.87 shows a good difference between the groups under investigation. The likelihood ratio of 10.97 proves the diagnostic value of the assay and its potential as one of the laboratory MS-tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A luminescent Zn-II-MOF named TMU-41, [Zn-2(BDC)(1.5)(L)(DMF)].1.5DMF, (L = pyridine 4-carboxylic acid and BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate), has been successfully assembled and well characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, which shows good stability especially in aqueous solutions. To fabricate open metal sites (OMS) of TMU-41(OMS), the coordinated DMF molecules were exchanged and removed by using acetonitrile as exchanging solvent and drying at 250 degrees C. The values of obtained surface areas after removing the coordinated DMF molecules are in the range of 740 m(2)/g. This MOF indicates high potential ability in detection of anions due to its strong luminescence effect and stability in water. All these results suggest TMU-41(OMS) to be a highly selective and recyclable luminescent sensing material for the quantitative detection of Cr-VI and Mn(VII )anions in aqueous solutions.
   TMU-41(OMS) has the highest sensing ability in comparison to the reported MOFs-based fluorescent and the detection limits towards MnO4-, Cr2O72- and CrO42- ions are about 5 ppb which is among the lowest reported detection limits for the LMOFs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When the polymers are studied by interaction chromatography (IC) in porous media, the IC separation mechanism competes with the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) mechanism and under specific conditions close to the critical adsorption point (CAP), the elution times of monodisperse polymer samples nonmonotonically depend on pore sizes. We performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to elucidate this intriguing effect. By analyzing the behavior of self-avoiding and intersecting chains in twodimensionally (2D)-confining square pores and in 1D-confining slits in good and Theta-solvents, we confirmed that the dimensionality of the confinement, more specifically, pore geometry, controls the chromatographic behavior. The nonmonotonic dependence of chromatographic characteristics on pore sizes occurs only in separations of self-avoiding chains on stationary phases composed of 2D-confining pores with strongly interacting walls. In agreement with experimental observations, the partition coefficient, K, increases with pore size, D, in narrow pores, peaks and then decreases in wider pores. The combination of thermodynamic and conformational analyses clearly showed that a complex interplay between enthalpy and entropy in 2D-confined media explains the nonmonotonic pore size dependence observed in the IC regime. The study specifies the region of conditions which endanger unambiguous interpretation of elution curves. Because the interplay of steric and adsorption effects takes place not only in chromatography, but also in other separation techniques (e.g., gel electrophoresis, nanofluidic techniques), the conclusions are generally relevant for all separations of large molecules in porous media.

AB Orthogonality is a key parameter in the evaluation of the performance of a 2D chromatography-based separation system. Two different perspectives on orthogonality are determined: the extent of the separation space utilized (global orthogonality) and the uniformity of the coverage of the separation space (local orthogonality). This work aims to elucidate the impact of sample dimensionality (the number of separation processes involved) on orthogonality evaluation through the use of descriptors from seven different algorithms utilizing mutually different properties of a chromatogram: Pearson correlation, conditional entropy, asterisk equations, convex hull, arithmetic mean (AN) and harmonic mean of the nearest neighbor, and geometric surface coverage (SC). Artificial chromatograms generated in silico and real GC x GC separations of diesel, plasma, and urine were used for the evaluation of orthogonality. The sample dimensionality has a deep effect on the orthogonality results of all approaches. The SC algorithm emerged as the best descriptor of local orthogonality samples of both low and high dimensionality, the AN algorithm on the global orthogonality of low-dimensionality samples. However, in the case of samples of high dimensionality, AN consistently indicated just the exploitation of the whole separation space; therefore, only local orthogonality is optimized by means of SC. Since no approach was able to monitor both global and local orthogonality as a single value, a new descriptor, ASCA, was developed. It combines the best global (AN) and local (SC) orthogonality algorithms by averaging, giving the same importance to data spread and crowding. ASCA thus provides the best estimation of orthogonality.

AB Chloride (Cl-) is an inorganic anion present in a broad range of samples (e.g. biological, environmental, food, water, etc.), the determination of which is of widespread significance. In this work, we translate the well-established traditional argentometric method (Mohr's precipitation titration) into a small, simple, portable, and low-cost paper-based microfluidic diagnostic device, which provides rapid and quantitative analysis. The developed device enables the determination of chloride sample volumes as small as 5 mu L. A distance-based detection method is implemented providing fully instrument-free quantitation. The beneficial effects of channel geometry (variable widths with constant heights) on analytical parameters were investigated. Trapezoidal channels (channel width changes linearly with height) were used to create a gradient of paper surface (titrant) available for the reaction, compared to the typical uniform rectangular channels (constant channel width). The trapezoid with increasing width offered higher sensitivity and lower detection limits (i.e. 0.05 mM vs 0.1 mM from the rectangular channel) for chloride determination across the concentration range of 0.05-25 mM. In addition, the effect of concentration of the deposited reagent on the obtained distance signals was investigated using varying concentrations of titrant (AgNO3), which allowed determination of chloride across a wider dynamic range (up to 200 mM). The utility of the paper devices was demonstrated by determination of chloride in a variety of matrices including body fluids (sweat, serum, and urine) and water samples (drinking, mineral, river water).

AB Forensic science is an emerging field driven by a number of factors, and the development of different methods of analyses, instruments, and techniques is of great help to experts in the field. Sampling and sample preparation in forensic cases are of utmost importance, and therefore, the methods for processing (or not) the samples are critical for acquiring accurate results. Some alternatives for attaining the minimalist concept, i.e. little or no sample treatment, are discussed in this review. For elemental analysis, analytical techniques, such as X-ray spectrometry, laser-ablation mass spectrometry, laser-induced breakdown spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and optical emission spectrometry, and Mossbauer spectrometry are overviewed. Molecular analysis, such as Raman spectroscopy, and ambient ionization mass spectrometry are discussed. Some representative examples are presented that involve in situ analysis, counterfeit bank notes and documents, post-mortem and bone analyses, and forensic analysis of drugs, glass, fingerprints, biological fluids and explosives.

However, they require further study owing to their compositional complexity and the innate limitations of current analytical approaches. In this review, we briefly introduce a series of individual approaches used for the qualitative and quantitative investigation of protein-surfactant interactions, including absorbance-or emission-based spectroscopy, scattering-based spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, calorimetry, computation and microscopy. More importantly, we then compare and evaluate various combinations of these approaches and provide comprehensive critical assessments and comments regarding their application to the advanced study of protein-surfactant interactions at the molecular level.

AB Uncertainty estimation provides a quantitative value of the predictive performance of a classification model based on its misclassification probability. Low misclassification probabilities are associated with a low degree of uncertainty, indicating high trustworthiness; while high misclassification probabilities are associated with a high degree of uncertainty, indicating a high susceptibility to generate incorrect classification. Herein, misclassification probability estimations based on uncertainty estimation by bootstrap were developed for classification models using discriminant analysis [linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)] and support vector machines (SVM). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as variable reduction technique prior classification. Four spectral datasets were tested (1 simulated and 3 real applications) for binary and ternary classifications. Models with lower misclassification probabilities were more stable when the spectra were perturbed with white Gaussian noise, indicating better robustness. Thus, misclassification probability can be used as an additional figure of merit to assess model robustness, providing a reliable metric to evaluate the predictive performance of a classifier.

AB We reported a novel strategy for rapidly and accurately screening biomarkers based on ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) metabolomics data. First, the preliminary variables were obtained by screening the original variables using method validation. Second, the variables were selected from the preliminary variables and formed the variable sets by testing different thresholds of single factor (variable importance in projection (VIP), fold change (FC), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and -ln(p-value)). Then the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were performed. The best threshold of each factor, and the corresponding variable set were found by comparing the models' (RX)-X-2, (RY)-Y-2, and Q(2). Third, the second-step-obtained variable sets were further screened by multi-factors. The best combination of the multi-factors, and the corresponding variable set were found by comparing (RX)-X-2, (RY)-Y-2, and Q(2). The expected biomarkers were thus obtained. The proposed strategy was successfully applied to screen biomarkers in urine, plasma, hippocampus, and cortex samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model, and significantly decreased the time of screening and identifying biomarkers, improved the (RX)-X-2, (RY)-Y-2, and Q(2), therefore enhanced the interpreting, grouping, and predicting abilities of the PLS-DA model compared with generally-applied procedure. This work can provide a valuable clue to scientists who search for potential biomarkers. It is expected that the developed strategy can be written as a program and applied to screen biomarkers rapidly, efficiently and accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glass capillary nanopore has been developed as a promising sensing platform for bioassay with single-molecule resolution. Although the diameter of glass capillary nanopore can be easily tuned, direct event-readouts of small biomacromolecules, like short-chain oligonucleotide fragments (within similar to 20 nucleotides) remain great challenge, which limited by the configuration of the conical-shaped nanopore and the instrumental temporal resolution. Here, we exploit a smart strategy for glass nanopore detection of short-chain oligonucleotides by using relatively big-sized tetrahedral DNA nanostructures as a signal amplifier, which can amplify the signals and retard the translocation speed meanwhile. The tetrahedral DNA nanostructure with a hairpin loop sequence in one edge, undergoes a shape transformation upon the complementary combination of the target oligonucleotides, in which the presence of short-chain target oligonucleotide can be readout due to obvious variation in amplitude of ion current pulse that caused by volume change of the DNA tetrahedral. Therefore, this strategy is promising for extending glass nanopore sensing platform for sensitive detection of short-chain oligonucleotides. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, combined with the outstanding adsorption ability of flower-like MoS2 with ultra-thin nanosheets and the good electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a sensitive and anti-interference electrochemical sensing interface for the analysis of Pb(II) was constructed by using MoS2/rGO nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (MoS2/rGO-GCE). The stripping behavior of Pb(II) was estimated using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), a high sensitivity of 50.80 mu A mu M-1 was achieved, and the limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.005 mu M (3 sigma method). The reasons for the excellent electrochemical performance of MoS2/rGO-GCE toward Pb(II) is that the excellent adsorption capacity and electrical conductivity, and the redox reaction of Pb(II) occurs directly on the surface of the MoS2/rGO nanocomposite. Moreover, series interference experiments were systematically conducted, the sensitivity of Pb(II) has no obvious change in the presence of other coexist heavy metal ions. In addition, an intriguing interference phenomenon between Pb(II) and Cu(II) was found. When Cu(II) exists in the solution, two stripping peaks of Pb(II) were observed, this phenomenon can be explained that the form of Pb-Cu alloy or intermetallic compounds during the preconcentration process. Further experiments indicated that the proposed method has good stability and reproducibility. Finally, the accurate detection result of Pb(II) in wastewater sample gathered from Wangxiaoying wastewater treatment plant were obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An untargeted screening method for the rapid identification of veterinary drug residues in incurred animal tissues using liquid microjunction surface sampling probe mass spectrometry (LMJSSP-MS) was developed. Current analytical methods for veterinary drug residue screening involve lengthy sample preparation, extraction, and instrumental analysis steps. This method identifies veterinary drug residues in several different incurred animal tissues more quickly than conventional analytical methods. This LMJSSP-MS method uses an ambient ionization technology called liquid microjunction surface sampling probe along with a data dependent scan function of a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer. Collected product ion spectra are searched against the mzCloud (TM) online mass spectral database to identify veterinary drug residues found in incurred animal tissue samples. Examples of veterinary drugs identified with this method include flunixin, tilmicosin, pentobarbital, xylazine, and ketamine. Optimization of method parameters is described and discussed. The limit of identification (LOI) of this method is estimated to be approximately 1 mu g g(-1) for xylazine and ketamine. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel automatic analytical methodology using a titanium dioxide (TiO2)-assisted preconcentration/on-site vapor-generation (VG) chip hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for online determination of mercuric ions (Hg2+) was developed. Interestingly, the TiO2 nanoparticle (nano-TiO2) coating on the channel surface acted not only as a sorbent for preconcentration but also as a catalyst for photocatalyst-assisted VG. Under optimum operation conditions, the developed method was validated by analyzing the certified reference material (CRM) Seronorm (TM) Trace Elements Urine L-2 (freeze-dried human urine). Based on the obtained results, the dramatic reduction of "hands-on" manipulation and the elimination of hazardous materials (e.g., sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and stannous chloride (SnCl2)) from the process enabled a simple and ultraclean procedure with an extremely low detection limit of 0.75 ng L-1 for Hg2+ in urine samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the direct exploitation of a nano-TiO2-coated microfluidic device for online sample preconcentration and on-site VG prior to ICP-MS measurement.

AB RNA was obtained from discrete locations of frozen rat brain tissue sections through infrared (IR) laser ablation using a 3-mu m wavelength in transmission geometry. The ablated plume was captured in a microcentrifuge tube containing RNAse-free buffer and processed using a commercial RNA purification kit. RNA transfer efficiency and integrity were evaluated based on automated electrophoresis in microfluidic chips. Reproducible IR-laser ablation of intact RNA was demonstrated with purified RNA at laser fluences of 3-5 kJ/m(2) (72 +/- 12% transfer efficiency) and with tissue sections at a laser fluence of 13 kJ/m(2) (79 +/- 14% transfer efficiency); laser energies were attenuated similar to 20% by the soda-lime glass slides used to support the samples. RNA integrity from tissue ablation was >90% of its original RIN value (similar to 7) and the purified RNA was sufficiently intact for conversion to cDNA and subsequent qPCR assay.

AB The ability of LC-MS/MS for high coverage metabolite analysis lags behind the requirements of global metabolomics. The introduction of chemical derivatizations could significantly extend the ability of LCMS/MS with enhanced MS response and improved LC separation, which has been serving as a promising quantitative tool for metabolomic analysis. However, as one specific derivatization reagent usually targets to a certain moiety, only a single chemical-group-based submetabolome could be analyzed in one injection. Therefore, the coverage of detected metabolites by derivatization-based LC-MS/MS is largely limited. To overcome this technical obstacle of derivatization-based LC-MS and increase submetabolome coverage, we proposed an extendable all-in-one injection LC-MS/MS strategy. 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dns-Cl)/5-diethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dens-Cl) and 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl piperazine (Dns-PP)/5-diethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl piperazine (Dens-PP) were used as twins labeling reagents for amino/phenol and carboxyl submetabolomes, respectively. "Series Mode" and "Parallel Mode" were proposed and investigated using eight representative standards with the consideration of interaction between different derivatization systems, time-consumption, and extendability. As a result, we found that "Series Mode" led to yield reduction, while "Parallel Mode" gave identical results with those of individual derivatization. Finally, a "Parallel Mode" was chosen to develop an extendable all-in-one injection twin derivatization LC-MS/MS strategy to quantify eighty metabolites assigned to five classes of microbial metabolites, including polyamines, amino acids, indole derivatives, bile acids, and free fatty acids. This well-validated method quantified 67 metabolites absolutely and discovered additional 40 differential metabolites compared with the untargeted method in rat serum from irinotecan (CPT-11)-induced gastrointestinal toxicity model.

AB Background: Hyphenation of liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offers the potential to develop broad-spectrum screening procedures from low volumes of biological matrices. In parallel, dried blood spot (DBS) has become a valuable tool in the bioanalysis landscape to overcome conventional blood collection issues. Herein, we demonstrated the applicability of DBS as micro-sampling procedure for broad-spectrum toxicological screening.
   Methods: A method was developed on a HRMS system in data dependant acquisition (DDA) mode using an extensive inclusion list to promote collection of relevant data. 104 real toxicology cases were analysed, and the results were cross-validated with one published and one commercial screening procedures. Quantitative MRM analyses were also performed on identified substances on a triple quadrupole instrument as a complementary confirmation procedure.
   Results: The method showed limits of identification (LOIs) in appropriateness with therapeutic ranges for all the classes of interest. Applying the three screening approaches on 104 real cases, 271 identifications were performed including 14 and 6 classes of prescribed and illicit drugs, respectively. Among the detected substances, 23% were only detected by the proposed method. Based on confirmatory analyses, we demonstrated that the use of blood micro-samples did not impair the sensitivity allowing more identifications in the low concentration ranges.
   Conclusion: A LC-HRMS assay was successfully developed for toxicological screening of blood microsamples demonstrating a high identification power at low concentration ranges. The validation procedure and the analysis of real cases demonstrated the potential of this assay by supplementing screening approaches of reference. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive lipidomic analysis at the molecular level using nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nUHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was performed to elucidate the lipid profiles of patient blood samples from five commonly found cancers (liver, lung, gastric, colorectal, and thyroid), which were then compared with the lipid profiles of healthy controls. From a total of 335 lipids identified and quantified, 50 high abundance lipids showing significant changes (> 2-fold and p < 0.01) in at least one of the five cancers (vs. controls) were analysed. Lipid species were found to be significantly associated with more than one type of cancer; the numbers of lipid species found as significantly changed in all five, four, three, two, and one type of cancer were 1, 8, 8, 15, and 17, respectively. Among these, the high abundance phosphatidylethanolamine species, including lysophosphatidylethanolamine and PE plasmalogen, was significantly low in four cancer types, but was high in thyroid cancer. Receiver operating characteristic analysis resulted in the selection of lipids specific to each cancer:liver (four phosphatidylinositols and diacylglycerol 16:1_18:0), gastric (phosphatidylcholine 34:2, 36:3, and 36:4, and lysophosphatidic acid 18:2), lung (lysophosphatidylinositol 16:0, sphingomyelin d18:1/20:0, and triacylglyceride 50:1 and 54:4), and thyroid (lysophosphatidylinositol 18:0 and 18:1). Our results provide a basis for future validation of cancer-specific lipid markers with high diagnostic ability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Characterizing cell behavior is important to modern medical diagnoses as the changes of cell behavior are often indicators of huge diseases. In order to gain enough information about cells, developing novel methods of cell sorting and imaging is an important task. With development of micro-fabrication technologies, more advanced miniaturized devices are applied to cell research. Here, a portable and easy-to-use chip with high-density periodic micro-well array is designed and fabricated to capture target cells specifically. Combining with aptamer-silver conjugates and FAM functioned report probes, the sandwich assay was successfully applied for imaging cells. Any well of the chip is carefully designed to provide abundant information on single cells. Since there are 19,200 microwells in a single chip, more information is available. Compared to other cells, such as HEK-293, MCF-7, U2OS and Ramos cells, the sandwich assay shows high specificity towards target cell CCRF-CEM. What's more, the applications of the chip can be further expanded to other cells imaging if suitable aptamers were selected. This high-density micro-well array of aptamer-silver conjugates is hopeful to play an important role in medical diagnosis in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel composite was synthesized by polymerizing the dummy-template molecularly imprinted microspheres on the surface of magnetic graphene. This composite was used as recognition reagent and energy acceptor to develop a platform for determination of chloramphenicol according to the principle of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. The light signal was induced with luminol-H2O2-4-(imidazole-1-yl) phenol system, and the chemiluminescence intensity was positively correlated with the analyte concentration. The limit of detection for chloramphenicol in meat sample was 2.0 pg/g, and the recoveries from the standard fortified blank meat sample were in the range of 69.5%-97.3%. Furthermore, one single assay could be finished within 10 min, and the magnetic composite could be reused for at least thirty times. Therefore, this platform could be used as a rapid, simple, sensitive, accurate and recyclable tool for screening the residue of chloramphenicol in meat. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional synthesis methods of carbon dots (CDs) have some disadvantages of complicated operation and a large amount of energy consumption. To address these limitations, we synthesized yellow-green luminescent CDs at room temperature according to the principle of amine-aldehyde condensation in this work. This reaction is simple, economical, energy saving and is extremely consistent with the concept of green synthesis and sustainable development. In addition, studies have found that tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) can quench the fluorescence of the as-prepared CDs through Inner filter effect (IFE). The changes of the fluorescence intensity also have a good linear relationship with the concentration of TC in the range of 10.0-400.0 mu M, and the detection limit is 6.0 mu M. This method has been successfully used to determine the tetracycline content of tetracycline tablets. Finally, the interaction mechanism between TC and CDs was analyzed and discussed.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) plays significant roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and has been considered to be valuable biomarker for cancer. Accurate and sensitive detection of miRNA is crucially significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, a MnO2 nanosheet-mediated ratiometric fluorescence biosensor was designed for miRNA detection and imaging in living cells. It contained MnO2 nanosheets acting as DNA carrier, and fluorescent donor (FAM)-labeled hairpin H1 (recognition probe) and fluorescent acceptor (TAMRA)-labeled hairpin H2 (amplification probe). When the biosensor entered cell by endocytosis, MnO2 nanosheets were degraded to Mn2+ via intracellular glutathione (GSH) and the adsorbed hairpins H1 and H2 were released. The intracellular target miRNA-21 hybridized with the recognition unit of H1 to initiate catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and a large amount of H1-H2 duplexes were produced. This brought fluorescent donor FAM and fluorescent acceptor TAMRA into close proximity to produce fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), inducing a ratiometric fluorescent response (donor signal decreased and acceptor signal enhanced) for miRNA-21 detection. Furthermore, this method could be applied to differentiate the expression levels of miRNA-21 in HeLa, HepG-2 and L02 cells. These results indicated that the proposed method possessed great potential in the early diagnosis of miRNA-related diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an innovative and high-throughput parallel-single-drop microextraction (Pa-SDME) using the [P-6,6,6,14(+)](2)[ MnCl42-] magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) as extraction phase is demonstrated, for the first time, in the determination of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, bisphenol A, butylparaben, benzophenone and triclocarban from environmental aqueous samples. This experimental setup comprised of a 96-well plate system containing a set of magnetic pins which aided in stabilizing the MIL drops and enabled the simultaneous extraction of up to 96 samples. Using this low-cost experimental apparatus, the sample throughput was lower than 1min per sample. This novel approach exhibits a number of advantages over classical SDME approaches, particularly in maintaining a stable solvent microdrop and facilitating high-throughput analysis. Experimental conditions were carefully optimized using one-factor-at-a-time and multivariate designs. The optimal conditions employed 5.38 +/- 0.55 mg (n = 10) of MIL, a sample volume of 1.5 mL at pH 6, and dilution in 20 mL of acetonitrile. The analytical parameters of merit were determined under the optimized conditions and highly satisfactory results were achieved, with LODs ranging from 1.5 to 3 mu g L-1 and coefficients of determination higher than 0.994. Intraday and interday precision ranged from 0.6 to 21.3% (n = 3) and 10.4-20.2% (n = 9), respectively, with analyte relative recovery in three aqueous samples ranging between 63% and 126%.

AB The significant advance of delivering high value multi-species data from sub-1 mL ice core sample volumes allows higher temporal resolution in deposition records of inorganic and low molecular weight organic anions and cations. The determination of these species is a fundamental strategic requirement in modern paleoclimate studies. Herein, for the first time, a dual capillary ion chromatography (Cap-IC) based method for the simultaneous separation of 17 organic and inorganic anions and cations in low volume Antarctic ice core samples is presented. The total amount of sample required for direct injection has been reduced to 190 mL, which is 35 times lower than the amount of sample required by standard ion chromatography methods. A dual Cap-IC system configured for the simultaneous determination of cations and anions was used throughout. A range of chromatographic parameters was optimised for both anion and cation systems to obtain baseline separations of all target analytes in a suitable run time and to minimise the amount of sample required. Baseline separation of matrix and trace 'marker' ions were achieved in less than 35 min, after injecting only 40 mL of sample in each IC system. Limits of detection (LODs) for all analytes determined were within a range similar to that achieved by previously published standard bore IC-based methods. Intra-and inter-day repeatability were evaluated, with both parameters being typically below 3% for peak area. In further validation of the method, a comparative analysis of a set of 420 ice core samples from Aurora Basin North site, Antarctica, previously analysed by standard IC, established that the proposed low sample volume technique was applicable as a routine measurement approach in ice core analysis projects.

AB !! A traditional immobilized pH gradient (IPG) has a high stability for isoelectric focusing (IEF) but suffers from time-consuming rehydration, focusing and staining-imaging as well as complex performance. To address these issues, an IEF system with an array of 24 IPG columns (10 mm x 600 mu m x 50 mu m) and dynamic scanning imaging (DSI) was firstly designed for protein focusing. Moreover, two IPG columns (pH 4-9 and pH 6.7-7.7 of 10 mm in length) were firstly synthesized for IEF. A series of experiments were carried out based on the IEF array. In contrast to a traditional IPG IEF with more than 10 h rehydration, 50-14 h IEF and ca 10 h stain-imaging, the IEF array had the following merits: 25 min rehydration for sample loading, 4 min IEF, and 2 min dynamics scanning of 24 columns, well addressing the issues of traditional IEF. Furthermore, the IEF array had fair sensitivity (LOD of 60 ng), good recovery (95%), and high stability (1.02% RSD for intra-day and 2.16% for inter-day). Finally, the developed array was successfully used for separation and determination of HbA1c (a key biomarker for diabetes diagnosis) in blood samples. All these results indicated the applicability of the developed IEF array to diabetes diagnosis. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The present paper is aimed at providing an overview of the recent advances in the electrochemical sensing of glutathione (GSH), an important electrochemically and biologically active molecule, for the period 2012-2018. Herein, the analytical performances of newly developed electrochemical methods, procedures and protocols for GSH sensing are comprehensively and critically discussed with respect to the type of method, electrodes used (new electrode modifications, advanced materials and formats), sample matrices, and basic validation parameters obtained (limit of detection, linear dynamic range, precision, selectivity/evaluation of interferences). This paper considers electrochemical methods used alone as well as the hyphenated methods with electrochemical detection (ECD), such as HPLC-ECD or CE-ECD. The practical applicability of the platforms developed for GSH detection and quantification is mostly focused on pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis. The most significant electrochemical approaches for GSH detection in multicomponent analyte samples and multicomponent matrices and for real-time in vivo GSH analysis are highlighted. The great variability in the electrochemical techniques, electrode approaches, and obtainable performance parameters, discussed in this review, brought new insights not only on current GSH and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) determinations, but, along with this, on the advances in electrochemical analysis from a more general point of view.

AB Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an appealing analytical technique for simultaneous multi-elemental analysis. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has also been suggested for the same purpose, mainly for vegetable samples. However, LIBS has failed to provide adequate results in many cases due to sample matrix complexity, and NIRS performance is harmed because of its lack of sensitivity and indirect correlation with inorganic elemental species. In this work, the performance of these two techniques are compared for the determination of micro- and macroelements in vegetable samples (Brachiaria forages) using multivariate regression. In addition, a data fusion scheme, in which spectral data sourced by NIRS is integrated with LIBS, is proposed to improve elemental content determination in those samples. The information of the molecular composition detected by NIR vibrational spectroscopy was consistently selected by recursive partial least squares to yield quantitative multivariate models for K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe in forage plants that are superior to models based on the use of individual NIRS and LIBS spectral information. While all data fusion models showed better predictive accuracy than any of the two individual techniques, best results were observed for Ca. This suggests that matrix composition affects each element determination by LIBS distinctively and supports the idea that a successful quantitative data fusion strategy for LIBS requires a technique such as NIRS which is sensitive to this variability.

AB An unsupervised data-driven methodology is used to quantify matrix effects caused by carbon and easily ionizable elements (ElEs) in inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Background signals from nine plasma naturally-occurring species of Ar, H and O are used with principal component analysis (PCA) and affinity propagation (AP) clustering to evaluate the effects of complex matrices on ionic emission lines of Cd, Co, Cr and Pb. Matrix effect severity is then quantified based on Euclidean distance in principal component space from an average calibration curve point. The method has been applied to spiked solutions of Mediterranean Sea and Dead Sea water samples, and a significant correlation (- 0.997) was found between Euclidean distance and analyte recoveries. For sea water analysis, accurate results are found using external standard calibration (EC) when Euclidean distance <1 for a given sample, and/or when that sample point groups with the calibration curve after affinity propagation clustering. Thus, by applying the PCA-AP strategy, one needs to perform no addition/recovery experiment to evaluate EC applicability. In addition, it can be carried out on the fly, as the background species used to monitor plasma changes are simultaneously recorded with the analytical signals, and a specific algorithm can be added to the instrument control software to flag instances in which EC may be ineffective. This is a proof-of-concept study, and additional work is required to evaluate the method's applicability to a larger number of analytes and sample matrices. However, the PCA-AP method described here for ICP OES can be used to quantify matrix effects, allowing for informed decisions regarding calibration. It requires no additional sample preparation and can be easily implemented in routine analyses of such complex-matrix samples as sea water. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many plant tissues can be observed thanks to autofluorescence of their cell wall components. Hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging using confocal microscopy is a fast and efficient way of mapping fluorescent compounds in samples with a high spatial resolution. However a huge spectral overlap is observed between molecular species. As a consequence, a new data analysis approach is needed in order to fully exploit the potential of this spectroscopic technique and extract unbiased chemical information about complex biological samples. The objective of this work is to evaluate multi-excitation hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging to identify biological components in wheat grains during their development through their spectral profiles and corresponding contribution maps using Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least-Squares (MCR-ALS), a signal unmixing algorithm under proper constraints. For this purpose two different scenarios are used: 1) analyzing the total spectral domain of data sets using MCR-ALS under non negativity constraint in both spectral and spatial modes; 2) analyzing a reduced spectral domain of data sets using MCR-ALS under non negativity in both modes and trilinearity constraint in spectral mode. Considering the original instrumental setup and our data analysis approach, we will demonstrate that extracted contribution maps and spectral profiles of constituents can provide complementary information used to identify molecules in complex biological samples.

AB In this study, a sensitive immunosensor was developed for the first time for p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK 2) detection. In the design of the immunosensor, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) was utilized as an ITO electrode modification material for anti-PAK 2 antibody immobilization. This molecule had epoxy group, which was reactive to amino groups of antibodies. Anti-PAK 2 antibodies were also used as biomolecules for sensitive interaction for PAK 2 antigen. In the presence of PAK 2 antigens, high impedance signal was observed when the process followed by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy technique (EIS). Apart from EIS technique, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV) and Single Frequency Impedance (SFI) techniques were utilized. Microscopic surface characterizations of immunosensor fabrication steps were performed by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The immunosensor exhibited good sensitivity and selectivity for PAK 2 antigen detection. A linear calibration curve between EIS response and PAK 2 concentration was obtained in the range of 0.005-0.075 pg/mL with the detection limit of 1.5 fg/mL. It had good repeatability, excellent reproducibility and high stability. Additionally, this immunosensor can be reused by simple application protocol. Furthermore, it had good recovery for PAK 2 antigen detection in human serum samples. The good recovery illustrated that the developed immunosensor was a promising tool for PAK 2 detection in practical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Ln(III) nitrate hydrate (Ln = Eu, Er) as precursors have been prepared through a one-step solvothermal approach. The as-synthesized compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, confirming that the targeted Ln-MOFs were successfully synthesised, with a straw-sheaf appearance. Their sensing properties were studied using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the results showed that the prepared Ln-BTCs possessed larger electrochemical-response areas and stronger electron-transport capability, especially the Er-BTC. The oxidation behaviour of Sunset Yellow was investigated, and it was found that the Er-BTC exhibited a superior enhancement effect. Chronocoulometry was used to prove that Er-BTC more strongly adsorbs Sunset Yellow, resulting in a larger electrochemical response signal. The novel Sunset Yellow sensor exhibited a linear response in the range of 0.2-100 nM with a low limit of detection (0.05 nM, S/N = 3), and was applied in drink samples. The results were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography, indicating this sensor is a promising tool for Sunset Yellow detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for the ultrasensitive detection of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J). The immunosensor used a (beta-cyclodextrin-nanogold-ferrocene (beta-CD-AuNP-Fc) host-guest complex as the label and a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid functional graphene nanocomposite (GR-PTCA) as the sensor platform. The abundant polycarboxylic sites of GR-PTCA facilitated the binding of primary antibodies (Ab(1)), whilst the excellent electrical conductivity of GR-PTCA promoted electron transfer. Immobilization of beta-CD directly onto secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) via covalent bonding allowed strong binding of ferrocene-decorated gold nanoparticles (Fc-Au NP), thereby amplifying the immunosensor signal. Under optimized testing conditions, the reduction current of ferrocene exhibited a linearly dependence on the ALV-J titer in the concentration range of 10(2.0) -10(4.0) TCID50/mL, with a low detection limit of 10(1.93) TCID50/mL. Furthermore, the immunosensor demonstrated high sensitivity, good reproducibility, reusability and stability, suggesting excellent potential for the quantitative detection of ALV-J in clinical applications.

AB A multifunctional microchip-based distillation apparatus for distilling and detecting formaldehyde (CH2O) in food products is developed. The presented apparatus comprises a disposable microchip, a steam supply system, and a recirculating cooling water supply. The microchip is formed on PMMA substrates by laser ablation and includes a sample zone, a flash distillation zone, a cooling zone, a condensation zone, and a collection zone. In the presented method, the CH2O sample is placed in the microchip and is vaporized by the high-throughput vapor supply and driven through the condensed zone. The condensed CH2O liquid is guided into the collection zone of the microchip. Finally, the distilled CH2O solution is determined using an AHMT spectrometry method and a paper-based RGB (red, green and blue) intensity analysis method. A distilled efficiency is as high as 98%, when a vapor stream rate is 0.4 ml/min and a distilled time is 10 min. Moreover, both detection methods show linear relationships of the corresponding CH2O concentrations. The actual sample suitability of the presented multifunctional microchip-based distillation apparatus is confirmed by analyzing the CH2O concentrations of 21 commodities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This work develops an instrument-free, cost-effective, convenient paper-based method for quantitative analysis of phosphorylated peptides. With a novel portable device, Phos-PAD, this method can achieve selective enrichment and colorimetric detection of phosphopeptides within 15 min TiO2 nanoparticle-based chemisorption and tetrabromophenol blue-based colorimetric assay were integrated into the single paper-based analytical device. The color change can indicate the presence of phosphopeptides and the mean pixel intensity of the red channel can be used for phosphopeptide quantification. With capability of quantifying phosphopeptides in serum samples, this Phos-PAD assisted phosphopeptide assay may attract significant attention to clinical analysis of endogenous serum phosphopeptides.

AB Sepsis is a life-threatening disease that affects millions of people every year. Rapid detection of sepsis assists clinicians to initiate timely antibiotic therapy and to reduce mortality. At the same time, accurate point-of-care detection is needed to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. One of the principal challenges in sepsis diagnosis is that many sepsis cases do not result in positive blood cultures. These so-called culture-negative cases present a significant health threat. In this work, we present a microfluidic cells separation system for the detection of sepsis in both culture-positive and culture-negative cases. Leukocytes were captured in several affinity separation zones of a microchip based on CD64, CD69, and CD25 expression. To validate this assay 40 septic patients and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Septic patients were divided into culture-positive (n = 12) and culture-negative cases (n = 21). CD64(+) cell capture demonstrated excellent accuracy for sepsis detection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.962. A combined panel of CD64(+) and CD69(+) cell counts was constructed, and the new panel outperformed each of these two biomarkers alone with the AUC of 0.978. Our affinity microfluidic devices were validated by conventional flow cytometry analysis. Results showed that the cell capture number of specific affinity region increased along with the increase of its corresponding antigen expression. This clinical validation confirms that CD64 and CD69 cell separations are a powerful sepsis assay with the potential for point-of-care analysis in culture-positive and culture-negative cases.

AB We present a proof-of-concept "on-off" detection scheme, which uses gadolinium phthalocyanine (GdTcPc)-grafted silica nanoparticles as paramagnetic centers, capable of modifying the transverse relaxation time (T-2) of water protons in solution. A DNA strand (as probe) was conjugated to the GdTcPc to act as a recognition element. In the presence of the target DNA, which was complementary to the probe, an increase in the T-2 value was detected, with magnitude proportional to the target DNA concentration. The linear range was observed from 30 to 140 nM, with limit of detection of 15 nM. The developed nuclear relaxation-based detection scheme is shown to be a simple, fast and selective method to detect DNA and could be useful in point-of-care diagnostic applications.

AB Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP), as a kind of harmful bacterium to human beings, its rapid and accurate detection is particularly important. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient dual-modal Faraday cage-type immunosensor for ultrasensitive detection of VP based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). After being captured by capture unit on magnetic glassy carbon electrodes, VP was recognized by detector unit, achieving ECL and ASV dual-modal detection. Compared with traditional sandwich-type immunosensors, this proposed immunosensor has the advantages of significant signal amplification effects, due to its distinctive Faraday cage-type structure. Benefited from it, all Ru(bpy)(2)(2+)and AgNPs labeled on the detector unit could participate in the electrode reaction and generate stronger ECL and electrochemical signals respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range was from 10(2) to 10(2) CFU mL(-1) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 33 CFU mL(-1), and the selectivity, stability and reproducibility were satisfactory. In addition, the results of two detection methods can mutually validate each other to avoid false positive results. Moreover, this Faraday cage-type immunosensor with dual-modal detection can also be used for detection of VP in seawater samples with recoveries in the range of 96.1-107.9%, which would be a promising tool for pathogenic bacteria analysis.

AB We report the development of a versatile surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor based on the use of multifunctional polymer-coated Au colloids. Our results demonstrated that dopamine (DA) serves as a reducing agent for the facile one-pot synthesis of Au nanoparticles (NPs). Under Au reductive conditions, DA was subsequently oxidized to dopamine quinone (DQ), 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), and polydopamine (PDA) via classical Raper-Mason mechanism. HPLC-MS, FTIR, and SERS analysis verified the effect of initial DA concentration on its oxidation products. The universal adhesion of DA, DQ DHI, and PDA on Au surface allows for customized synthesis of multi-sized and multifunctional Au NPs containing different mussel polymer shells. The PDA on Au exhibited a reactive scaffold to exclusively lock PAHs into the hotspots for SERS sensing. More interestingly, the two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy showed that DQ modified Au exhibited a strong binding ability towards Cd2+, yielding SERS vibrational profiles that allowed the qualitative determination of Cd2+ with a detection limit of 10(-8) mol L-1. The systematic investigation reported herein fills significant gaps in the understanding of the DA-mediated Au reduction mechanism, and provides a reliable working basis that allows for the formation of melanin-like polymer coatings on the Au surface. Remarkably, this simple method provides high SERS sensitivity and selectivity in a high-throughput fashion without the requirement for complex pretreatment methods and complicated instruments.

AB We demonstrated an interesting phenomenon that the electrochemical reduction of mercury ions (Hg2+) caused distinctly different morphology of gold nanorods (Au NRs) depending on the concentration of Hg2+. Specifically, in the case of low concentration, mercury formed through electrochemical reduction only deposited onto the gold surface, and then could be reversibly removed from the gold surface by electrochemical stripping process without causing obvious changes of Au NRs in shape and size. But in the case of high concentration, the reduced Hg not only deposited onto the gold surface but also entered into the interior of Au NRs making them change into gold nanospheres (Au NSs) in an irreversible manner due to the alloying effect of gold with Hg. In this situation, even though the most of Hg was removed, the Au NSs can no long return to the previous rod shape. The changing trend of Au NRs was characterized well by measuring the corresponding UV-Visible spectra. The formation of the Au/Hg nanoalloy was confirmed by high-resolution transmit electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. The present study is helpful for having better understanding of the mechanism of electrochemical mercury-analysis by Au nanoparticles, and necessary to optimize the Au nanoparticles-based Hg sensing strategies.

AB Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, HILIC, is a relatively new HPLC mode. Compared with other HPLC modes, HILIC is a high resolution chromatographic mode with high peak capacity for separations of complex mixtures. Although the separation mechanism is still not completely clear, HILIC has been widely used for analysis of hydrophilic compounds which are difficult for reversed phase chromatography to retain and separate. In this study, we fabricated and investigated nanoHILIC columns in terms of separation efficiency, van Deemter curves and more importantly, we focused on long packed capillary columns, and studied their extreme resolution for protein digests. Using meter long nanoHILIC columns packed with 5 mu m particles, we realized a high peak capacity of 130. Based on nanoLC-MS, we compared the resolution and protein identification capabilities of nanoHILIC and nanoRPLC. The results indicate both nanoHILIC and nanoRPLC can provide high resolution for protein sequencing but neither mode is significantly better than the other. Among the 99 digest peptides identified, 17 were uniquely identified by nanoHILIC-MS and 20 were uniquely identified by nanoRPLC-MS and 62 were identified by both methods. Although at this moment in time, nanoRPLC is the most popular microseparation tool in proteomics, the excellent complementarity of nanoHILIC and nanoRPLC suggests their combined use in achieving deep-coverage in MS-based proteomics.

AB This study reports on the conception of magneto-Capillary Electrophoresis (magneto-CE), an approach integrating immuno-capture on circulating bio-functionalized magnetic beads into a unique capillary for preconcentration and electrokinetic separation. This hybrid mode is an evolution of in-capillary magnetic bead-based operation from static cluster format to dynamic configuration where beads are allowed to controllably circulate inside a CE capillary for interaction improvement. To implement the magneto-CE operation, a purpose-made instrument was constructed, allowing visual observation of the movement of the magnetic beads. We applied a new methodological strategy for determination of the amyloid beta peptide (A beta 1-42), which is as an established biomarker for molecular diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The methodology is based on magneto-immuno-capture of fluorescently labeled A beta 1-42 followed by a chemical elution with a basic solution prior to CE separation with laser induced fluorescent (LIF) detection. The superiority of this dynamic configuration of magneto-CE was demonstrated for this target analyte, with sample pretreatment and separation being performed in-capillary without any delay in between and without any waste of pretreated sample, which otherwise would not be the case with offline/batch-wise operation.

AB It has become increasingly crucial to implement the precise determination of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biosystems since the abnormal level of H2S may induce various diseases. However, due to the high volatility and fast catabolism of H2S, traditional H2S detection methods are confronted with great challenges. Fortunately, the development of optical nanotechnology sheds new light on the real-time and sensitive detection of intracellular or subcellular H2S. Nanomaterials emerged as potential candidates for the optical detection of biomolecule analytes due to their excellent properties, such as easy preparation and modification, tunable optical characteristics and high photostability. Recently, many probes based on nanomaterials, ranging from inorganic nanostructures to organic polymers, have been demonstrated to exhibit high sensitive and selective detection toward H2S both in vitro and in vivo. Different from the previous review articles, we mainly summarize the advancements of optical probes, including fluorescence and non-fluorescence probes, for endogenous H2S detection based on nanomaterials in recent five years.

AB Transport processes through ion-channel proteins, protein pores, or solid-state nanopores are traditionally recorded with commercial patch-clamp amplifiers. The bandwidth of these systems is typically limited to 10 kHz by signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) considerations associated with these measurement platforms. At high bandwidth, the input-referred current noise in these systems dominates, determined by the input-referred voltage noise of the transimpedance amplifier applied across the capacitance at the input of the amplifier. This capacitance arises from several sources: the parasitic capacitance of the amplifier itself; the capacitance of the lipid bilayer harboring the ion channel protein (or the membrane used to form the solid-state nanopore); and the capacitance from the interconnections between the electronics and the membrane. Here, we review state-of-the-art applications of high-bandwidth conductance recordings of both ion channels and solid-state nanopores. These approaches involve tightly integrating measurement electronics fabricated in complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) technology with lipid bilayer or solid-state membranes. SNR improvements associated with this tight integration push the limits of measurement bandwidths, in some cases in excess of 10 MHz. Recent case studies demonstrate the utility of these approaches for DNA sequencing and ion-channel recordings. In the latter case, studies with extended bandwidth have shown the potential for providing new insights into structure-function relations of these ion-channel proteins as the temporal resolutions of functional recordings matches time scales achievable with state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations.

AB Mobile phones are one of the fastest growing types of electronic waste disposed of world-wide. One of the main components in these devices is the LCD (liquid crystal display) panel that contains conductive electrodes made of indium tin oxide. A large amount of In, which is categorized as a critical raw element, has been used to manufacture indium tin oxide films. This study applies laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the analysis of LCD samples from mobile phones in order to determine the In content. Both conventional univariate calibration and non-traditional calibration using different transition energies (emission lines), named multi-energy calibration (MEC), were assessed. To evaluate the accuracy of the results, Method EPA 3052 was performed for acid digestion of the samples using microwave-assistance, and the In content was determined by ICP OES. Indium concentrations ranged from 35 to 47 mg kg(-1) for all samples evaluated. The results showed the best accuracy for LIBS methods after the spectra were normalized by the carbon line at 193.09 nm. The univariate-LIBS model showed a standard error of calibration (SEC) about 10-fold lower than the samples' concentration, LOD and LOQ of 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg(-1), respectively. MEC proved to be a fast and efficient alternative for direct solid analysis, and In concentrations were determined by LIBS using only two calibration pellets. The LOD and LOQ for MEC-LIBS method were 2.1 and 7 mg kg(-1), respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a method of simultaneous dual mass detection for single cell analysis by quadrupole-based ICP-MS (ICP-QMS) is proposed. The method shows potential for use in quantitative investigations of nanoparticle association and elemental composition of cells. Dual mass detection had been attempted in the analysis of two-element core-shell nanoparticles and in isotope dilution analysis. In this method the detector switches between two selected masses during the analysis. Dual mass mode eliminates the discrepancies in signal that can occur due to sample instability or fluctuation in sample uptake when two masses are analysed sequentially by conventional single cell analysis (SP mode). Preliminary tests showed that using an Mg spike as marker of cells in dual mass mode was feasible for the quantification of cells. The method showed good linearity and a reproducible detection rate, and the results were comparable to the SP mode. The approach was then employed with algal cells exposed to silver nanoparticles (AgNP), to study on the Ag-associated cells and AgNP by monitoring the Ag and Mg signal in one analytical run. Finally, Mg and Mn were detected, and then quantified using the same approach to evaluate the elemental composition and correlation between different elements of the exposed cells. It is believed that this dual mass approach can extend the capability of ICP-QMS for multi-elemental detection at the single cell level, representing an enormous potential for size characterization, quantification and elemental composition evaluation in single cell (particle) analysis.

AB Metabolomics provides new insights into disease pathogenesis and biomarker discovery. Samples from large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies are typically analyzed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform in several batches. Batch effects that are caused by non-biological systematic biases are unavoidable in large-scale metabolomics studies, even with properly designed experiments. The statistical analysis of large-scale metabolomics data without managing batch effects will yield misleading results. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, called WaveICA, which is based on the wavelet transform method with independent component analysis, as the threshold processing method to capture and remove batch effects for large-scale metabolomics data. The WaveICA method uses the time trend of samples over the injection order, decomposes the original data into multi-scale data with different features, extracts and removes the batch effect information in multi-scale data, and obtains clean data. The WaveICA method was tested on real metabolomics data. After applying the WaveICA method, scattered quality control samples (QCS) and subject samples in a PCA score plot of the original data were closely clustered, respectively. The average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of the QCS increased from 0.872 to 0.972. Additionally, WaveICA significantly improved the classification accuracy for metabolomics data. The method was compared with three representative methods, and outperformed all of them. To conclude, WaveICA can efficiently remove batch effects while revealing more biological information. This method can be used in large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies to preprocess raw metabolomics data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multivariate exploratory data analysis allows revealing patterns and extracting information from complex multivariate data sets. However, highly complex data may not show evident groupings or trends in the principal component space, e.g. because the variation of the variables are not grouped but rather continuous. In these cases, classical exploratory methods may not provide satisfactory results when the aim is to find distinct groupings in the data.
   To enhance information extraction in such situations, we propose a novel approach inspired by the concept of combining weak classifiers, but in the unsupervised context. The approach is based on the fusion of several adjacency matrices obtained by different distance measures on data from different analytical platforms. This paper is intended to present and discuss the potential of the approach through a benchmark data set of beer samples. The beer data were acquired using three spectroscopic techniques: Visible, near-Infrared and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
   The results of fusing the three data sets via the proposed approach are compared with those from the single data blocks (Visible, NIR and NMR) and from a standard mid-level data fusion methodology. It is shown that, with the suggested approach, groupings related to beer style and other features are efficiently recovered, and generally more evident. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report herein the design of a novel biosensing strategy for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), based on the use of Janus-type nanoparticles having Au and silica opposite faces as integrated electrochemical biorecognition-signaling system. The Janus nanoparticles were properly functionalized with horseradish peroxidase on the silica surface to act as signaling element, and a biotin thiol-modified anti-CEA DNA hairpin aptamer the Au face to assemble the biorecognition element. The sensing approach relies on the first specific recognition of CEA by the bifunctionalized Janus nanoparticles, causing unfolding of the DNA hairpin structure and unmasking the biotin residues at the aptamer chain. This CEA-Janus nanoparticle complex was then captured by avidin-modified Fe3O4@SiO2 NanoCaptors (R), allowing further magnetic deposition on carbon screen printed electrodes for the amperometric detection of the cancer biomarker. The Janus nanoparticles-based aptasensor was able to detect CEA in the range from 1 to 5000 ng mL(-1) (5.5 pM-28 nM) with a detection limit of 210 pg mL(-1) (1.2 pM). The aptasensor also showed high reproducibility and storage stability, and was successfully validated in human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a new immunoassay technique, called magnetic-force assisted electrochemical sandwich immunoassay (MESIA), where serum biomarkers can be determined by magnetic actuation and electrochemical detection of gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles as probes for immunocomplex formation. In MESIA, neither washing buffer nor fluidic parts are necessary, because the formation of immunocomplexes and the removal of unbound probes are controlled by magnetic forces. Electrochemical pretreatment and measurement of the gold-coated magnetic probes allows highly sensitive, precise, and robust system for quantification of target analytes. Using MESIA, the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 10 mu l of human serum is determined within 5 min. The limit of detection is 0.085 ng/mL, and the average coefficient of variance is 8.85% for five different PSA concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 ng/mL. This method shows good precision and reproducibility (<10%) and high correlation with cobas e 801 (r = 0.997) for clinical patient samples. We believe this technique to be useful in the development of a point-of-care testing platform for diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases, such as cancer, based on quantification of biomarkers in a drop of blood.

AB Effective detection of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) activity is extremely crucial and urgent for epigenetic research. Herein, a novel label-free electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing method was developed for the detection of TDG activity using DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (DNA-AuNPs) triggered hybridization chain reaction (HCR). In this assay, the thiol modified hairpin probe DNA (hp-DNA) with 50 overhangs and one mismatched base pair of guanines: thymine (G: T) in the stem part was boned onto gold electrode. TDG specifically removed T base of the G: T mismatch to produce apyrimidinic (AP) sites through the N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis. The AP site was then cleaved by the catalysis of Endonuclease IV (EnIV) to generate dsDNA containing a free 3' end in the long sequence, which serves as a complementary sequence to hybridize with the specific sequence (ssDNA1) of DNA-AuNPs. Then, the functionalized DNA-AuNPs with initiator strands (ssDNA2) could trigger HCR to form nicked double helices DNA polymer which can embed numerous ECL indicator, Ru(phen)(3)(2+), resulting in significantly increased ECL signal. The proposed strategy combined the amplification function of DNA-AuNPs triggered HCR and the inherent high sensitivity of the ECL technique, a detection limit of 1.1 x 10(-5) U/mu L (0.0028 ng/mL) for TDG determination was obtained. In addition, this method was successfully applied to evaluate TDG activity in cancer cell, which provides great possibility for TDG activity assay in related clinical diagnostics.

AB Highly selective enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides and phosphopeptides from complex biological samples is extremely important prior to mass spectrometry analysis due to their low abundance as well as numerous extrinsic interferences. In this work, L-cysteine (L-Cys)-modified multifunctional metalorganic frameworks denoted as Fe3O4@PDA@MIL-125@Au@ L-Cys (mMIL-125@Au@L-Cys) were prepared by modifications step by step. By combining hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC), the as-prepared material was firstly utilized to identify N-linked glycopeptides and phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and beta-casein (beta-casein), respectively, with the help of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and exhibited outstanding sensitivity (0.1 fmol mu L-1), great reusability (5 circles) and high selectivity (1: 100). Based on this, it was further applied into the enrichment of glycopeptides and phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of 100 mu g human crystalline lens proteins. In the end, 81 N-linked glycopeptides corresponding to 35 glycoproteins and 175 phosphopeptides ascribed to 55 phosphorylated proteins were identified, respectively. The remarkable results were benefitted from the merits of improved hydrophilicity from L-Cys, strong affinity of Ti-O centers, numerous reaction sites on the large surface of MOFs and superparamagnetism from Fe3O4 cores. The design of mMIL-125@Au@L-Cys not only served as a multifunctional probe for efficient identification of N-linked glycopeptides and phosphopeptides in human crystalline lens, but also set a precedent for fabricating more MOFs with post-modifications for further proteomics research.

AB A facile and efficient method for the determination of triazine herbicides in tomato samples was developed by employing 3-aminophenol-glyoxylic acid resin microspheres as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. These resin microspheres were synthesized by a simple green precipitation polymerization method, and a range of functional groups (hydroxyl, amino, carboxylic group) were introduced through the 3-aminophenol and glyoxylic acid components. The as-prepared resin microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and thermal gravimetric analyzer. The resin microspheres exhibited a good adsorption rate, large adsorption amount, and short adsorption equilibrium time (almost in similar to 5 min). Under the optimal extraction and determination conditions, a good linearity was obtained in the range of 0.025-7.5 mu g g(-1) (r(2) >= 0.9997) for atraton, ametryn, and prometryn. The limits of detection of atraton, ametryn, and prometryn were 0.57, 0.75, and 1.06 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The intraday and inter-day precisions expressed as relative standard deviations were in the ranges of 1.8-3.2% and 1.7-4.1%, respectively. In addition, the recoveries at three spiked levels ranged from 85.1 to 97.7% with the relative standard deviation <= 5.4% (n - 3). This novel method is simple and accurate and has proved to be a reliable alternative method for the determination of triazine herbicides in tomato samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photochrome Aptamer Switch Assay (PHASA) is our unique and recently developed fluorescent biosensing platform that exploits the combination of aptamer adaptive binding and photoisomerisation kinetics of stilbenes. The PHASA is based on converting any suitable stilbene-ligand-aptamer complex into a reversible biosensor. Binding affinity, aptamer concentration, and stilbene molecular structure determine the PHASA performance criteria. Consequently, understanding of the structure-activity relationship of the stilbene-ligand conjugate is extremely important when predicting and optimising the biosensor sensitivity. In the present manuscript, new analytical methods relating to calculation of the limit of detection (LOD) of the PHASA are proposed and discussed. Using these methods, it is possible to optimise the independent or dependent physicochemical parameters of the stilbene-ligand conjugates and evaluate their general sensing performance. The proposed analytical methods are based on the interdependent relationships between the sensitivity and the range of analyte detection and provide starting conditions for known aptamer binding constants in various PHASA applications.

AB A single-chromophore-based photoactive agent (MB-DOPA) capable of rapid sensing of nanomolar hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and in-situ generating photocytotoxicity to cancer cells was developed using dopamine moiety as the recognition unit and methylene blue (MB) moiety as the fluorescence signaling unit. Specifically, HOCl triggered conversion of the nonfluorescent MB-DOPA to MB enabling far-red fluorescence emission (lambda(max) similar to 683 nm) and additional ability to photogenerate O-1(2) species. Owing to the catechol nature of dopamine characterized with strong electron-donating property, MB-DOPA underwent HOCl-mediated conversion with response time of similar to 20 s and a strong fluorescence OFF-to-ON contrast by a factor of more than 3000. The preliminary bioimaging results confirmed the intracellular HOCl sensing ability of MB-DOPA and the in-situ photodynamic therapy (PDT) effectiveness for inducing massive apoptosis of cancer cells. The figure of merits of MB-DOPA, including ability for sensing of nanomolar HOCl with high specificity, rapid response, practicality for intracellular fluorescence imaging, and the in-situ generation of O-1(2) for killing tumor cells, is expected to enable diagnosis of early-stage oncogenesis based on the highly specific detection of abnormal HOCl levels in the transformed cells and the simultaneous treatment in biomedical applications.

AB The present work aimed to provide a novel chemosensor for ferric ion detection in human serum samples using nano-structured Mg-Al layered double hydroxide intercalated with salicylic acid (Mg-Al LDH-SA) as a sensitive fluorescence probe. The Mg-Al LDH-SA nanomaterial was synthesized and characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The synthesized nanomaterial was applied to determine ferric ions by measuring the fluorescence intensity of Mg-Al LDH-SA sol solution at lambda(em) = 404 nm with excitation at lambda(ex) = 287 nm. In the presence of ferric ions, the fluorescence intensity decreases owing to the formation of a stable complex between ferric ions and salicylic acid. Several important parameters affecting the analytical signal were studied and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the concentration range of 0.07 = 100 mu mol L-1 with a corresponding detection limit of 26 nmol L-1. The intra-and inter-day relative standard deviations (n = 6 and ferric ion concentration; 50 mmol L-1) were 3.4% and 4.5%, respectively. The method was successfully employed to assess ferric ion in several human serum samples with relative recovery values between 98.7 and 104.6% for the spiked samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A spiropyran derivative containing an ethyl group (SPEt) was applied for fluorescent recognition of Cu2+. With Cu2+ addition, the SPEt-contained solution using a mixed solvent of DMF/H2O (9/1, v/v) showed a very strong characteristic emission peak with high quantum yield which is 4.3 times that of the pure SPEt solution. As a result, Cu2+ was successfully picked out from totally 17 kinds of common metal ions and a detection limit as low as 14.9 fM had been achieved in using this assay system. Particularly, the recognition process was temperature- and time-dependent and could be effectively promoted by heating. In addition, SPEt had been used to image and detect Cu2+ in mussels. Thus, our results in this study provided an exclusive Cu2+ recognition via fluorometry in wide temperature, time, and dynamic ranges of assay, enabled a femtomolar scale detection of Cu2+ by spiropyran derivative, and showed a promising imaging ability of Cu2+ in marine living organisms.

Following a short introduction, the review first categorizes various electroosmotic pumps into five subclasses based on the materials used for pumping: i) open channel EOP, 2) packed-column EOP, iii) porous monolith EOP, iv) porous membrane EOP, and v) other types of EOP. Pumps in each subclass are discussed. A next section covers EOP applications, primarily the applications of EOPs in micro flow analysis and micro/nano liquid chromatography. Other scattered applications are also examined. Perspectives, trends and challenges are discussed in the final section. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For decades surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been intensely investigated as a possible solution for performing analytical chemistry at the point of sample origin. Unfortunately, due to cost and usability constraints, conventional rigid SERS sensors and microfluidic SERS sensors have yet to make a significant impact outside of the realm of academics. However, the recently introduced flexible and porous paper-based SERS sensors are proving to be widely adaptable to realistic usage cases in the field. In contrast to rigid and microfluidic SERS sensors, paper SERS sensors feature (i) the potential for roll-to-roll manufacturing methods that enable low sensor cost, (ii) simple sample collection directly onto the sensor via swabbing or dipping, and (iii) equipment-free separations for sample cleanup. In this review we argue that movement to paper-based SERS sensors will finally enable point-of-sample analytical chemistry applications. In addition, we present and compare the numerous fabrication techniques for paper SERS sensors and we describe various sample collection and sample clean-up capabilities of paper SERS sensors, with a focus on how these features enable practical applications in the field. Finally, we present our expectations for the future, including emerging ideas inspired by paper SERS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB DNA repair pathways are closely associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity, disease outbreak, and the development of therapeutics. Owing to these significances, novel analytical methods for enzymes that are involved in the DNA repair pathways have been actively investigated. This review focuses on discussions on nucleic acid-based methods, especially those based on the fluorescence, for the determination of DNA repair enzymes. Furthermore, this review not only provides meaningful insights in creating ingenious fluorescent detection methods but it also suggests future directions that will be followed in developing new analytical technologies for the DNA repair enzymes.

AB An effective analytical method for bromine and iodine determination in human hair using interference-free inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed. Human hair was digested based on combustion reaction to obtain compatible solutions with ICP-MS analysis. Using microwave-induced combustion (MIC), masses of human hair ranging from 50 to 300 mg were efficiently digested. Only a diluted alkaline solution (100 mmol L-1 NH4OH) was used for the absorption of both analytes, which was fully compatible with ICP-MS analysis. Using these conditions low limits of detection were obtained (LOD of 0.01 mu g g(-1) for Br and 0.004 mu g g(-1) for I). Recovery tests at two levels (50% and 100%) using a standard solution or mixtures of the sample with certified reference materials (CRMs) were carried out to evaluate the suitability of proposed method and recoveries between 94% and 102% were always obtained. Accuracy was evaluated by analysis of a human hair CRM, and the Br and I concentrations obtained by the proposed method did not differ significantly from those described in the certificate. Repeatability (RSDs <= 4%) and reproducibility (RSDs <= 7%) of the results using proposed method were always very suitable. The digests obtained using the MIC method were fully compatible with ICP-MS and the interferences currently found using conventional digestion methods were completely eliminated. Ultra-trace concentrations of Br and I were determined in human hair, demonstrating that the proposed method is a suitable strategy, and it presents several advantages compared to others published in the literature.

AB The paper presents a study on the matrix-induced transformation of arsenic (As) species spiked into seafoods. Sixteen arsenicals were individually spiked into samples of finfish, crustaceans and molluscs. The spiked samples were subjected to hot water extraction at 90 degrees C, and extracts were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Arsenate (As5+), arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenocholine (AsC), dimethylarsinate (DMA), monomethylarsonate (MMA), tetramethylarsonium ion (TMA) and trimethylarsoniopropionate (TMAP) remained intact in all the matrices. Whereas arsenite (As3+), dimethylarsinoyl acetate (DMAA), dimethylarsinoyl ethanol (DMAE), dimethylarsinoyl propionate (DMAP), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) and glycerol-, sulfonate-, sulfate- and phosphate-arsinoylribosides (arsenosugars 328, 392, 408 and 482, respectively) were transformed to other forms in most finfish and crustaceans. The transformation of the arsenicals was discovered to be induced by matrix thiols. While As3+ was bound to sulfhydryl groups, DMAA, DMAE, DMAP, TMAO and arsenosugars 392, 408 and 482 were thiolated through conversion of their arsinoyl (As=O) functionalities to arsinothioyl (As=S). The newly formed arsinothioyl compounds were characterized by HPLC-ICP-MS and electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-HR-MS/MS) paired with HPLC. The observed matrix-induced transformation of the arsenic species could be prevented by treating the samples (prior to spiking) with a thiol-selective blocking agent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM).
