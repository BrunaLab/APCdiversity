AB Despite its useful properties, imiquimod (IMQ), known as an anti-cancer drug, can be harmful to the skin at high concentrations. Therefore, we have developed a novel electrochemical sensor to determine IMQ, for the first time. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified by a new composite comprising of ionic liquid-based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and gold nanoparticles/graphene oxide (Au/GO). The MIP/Au/GO nano composite was synthesized through non-covalent imprinting process in the presence of IMQ, as template molecule and characterized by SEM and FT-IR. The square wave voltammetry technique (SWV) was applied for IMQ determination in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.0. Several parameters affecting the IMQ quantification were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the sensor presented a linear range of 0.02-20.0 mu M, a limit of quantification and detection of 0.02 mu M and 0.006 mu M, respectively. Low RSD values indicate the good repeatability and reproducibility of the modified electrodes in preparation and determination procedures. The satisfactory results indicated that the proposed sensor could be successfully applied for IMQ determination in real samples.

AB Herein, we report the anionic surfactant, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), mediated synthesis of WO3 nanoparticles and its subsequent modification through gamma irradiation (GI) and electrochemical immobilization with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with GI WO3 NPs and the enzyme NAD exhibited strong electro-oxidation of three important biomolecules such as norepinephrine (NEP), melatonin (MEL) and nicotine (NIC) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at physiological pH of 7. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) studies exhibited three well-defined peaks at potentials of 120, 570 and 840 mV, corresponding to the oxidation of NEP, MEL and NIC respectively, indicating that simultaneous determination of these compounds is feasible at the NAD/GI EDTA-WO3/GCE. The proposed sensor displayed a wide linear range of 0.010-1000 mu M with the lowest detection limit of 1.4 nM for NEP, 2.6 nM for MEL and 1.7 nM for NIC respectively. Furthermore, the modified electrode was successfully applied to detect NEP, MEL and NIC in pharmaceutical and cigarette samples with excellent selectivity and reproducibility.

AB Plasmonic-dielectic hybrid substrates of Ag-islands on three-dimensional photonic crystals are fabricated through magnetron sputtering of silver onto hydrophobized silica photonic crystals, free from etching process. Without typical "hot-spots" such as nanogaps, significant Raman enhancements can be achieved, attributed to the enhanced electromagnetic field and scattering of the plasmonic nanoparticles as well as the enhanced light matter interaction by the slow photon effects. The detection limit for adenine by the hybrid substrates reaches nM level, with a calculated enhancement factor of 1.13 x 10(7), which is three orders of magnitude higher than the conventional noble metal film over nanosphere (FON) control group. Furthermore, microchips based on the hybrid substrates are facilely achieved, enabling micro-detection through super hydrophobic concentration. The facile fabrication and effective Raman enhancements make the Ag-islands on 3D photonic crystals promising candidates in the field of chemical sensors, Raman mapping and bioassays.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as significant regulators in a variety of diseases and have been emerging as a class of promising biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. Herein, an enzyme-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform was proposed for sensitive and reliable detection of target miRNA-21 using a corrective internal standard (IS)-based ratiometric SERS probe coupled with mismatched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification. The 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) was used as IS molecule and modified on the surface of silver nanoparticles decorated silicon wafer. In principle, the presence of miRNA-21 could cyclically trigger the allosteric effects of mismatched CHA amplification and the 3'-R6G labeled hairpin probe 1 (H1) was opened. Then, the hairpin probe 2 (H2) hybridized with H1 to form H1-H2 complex and the released miRNA-21 was free to participate in the next cycle of CHA reaction. Meanwhile, the H1-H2 complex could hybridize with the capture DNA on the SERS chip, making the Raman tag of R6G close to the surface of SERS substrate, and the intensity of SERS signal from R6G labels increase while that from 4-ATP remain relatively unchanged. Benefiting from outstanding performances of the ratiometric SERS strategy and enzyme-free CHA amplification system, this platform exhibits sensitivity toward miRNA-21 with a limit of detection of 3.5 fM and a broad dynamic range from 10 fM to 100 nM, More importantly, this proposed method presents an excellent reliable SERS analysis with the correction of IS. The developed strategy holds a potential alternative tool for miRNA detection in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.

AB The authors report a label-free and direct detection of rheumatoid factor- Immunoglobulin M (IgM-RF) based on an impedimetric-interdigitated wave type microelectrode array (IDW mu E). IDW mu E was functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of thioctic acid for antigen immobilization. The SAM functionalized IDW mu E were characterized by atomic force microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The covalent immobilization of IgG-Fc onto the SAM modified electrode arrays was characterized morphologically via AFM and electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Impedimetric measurements in the presence of redox probe (Potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide) showed a significant change in both the impedance spectrum and charge transfer resistance upon IgM-RF binding. Impedance measurements were target specific and linear with an increase in IgM-RF concentrations between 1 and 200 IU mL(-1) in redox probe and human serum, respectively. The sensor showed detection limits of 0.6 IU mL(-1) in the presence of redox probe and 0.22 IU mL(-1) in the human serum. The biosensor exhibited good reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD), 4.96%) and repeatability (RSD, 2.31%) with an acceptable selectivity towards IgM-RF detection. The sensor also showed a good stability for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C in 1X PBS. Therefore, the sensitive and stable immunosensor exhibiting IDW mu E features can be integrated with a miniaturized potentiostat to develop a sensing system that detects IgM-RF for point-of-care applications.

AB Ketamine is one of the most widely abused drugs in the world and poses a serious threat to human health and social stability; therefore, the ability to accurately monitor the substance in real-time is necessary. However, several problems still exists towards this goal, such as the generally low concentration of the target molecules disturbed in the complex samples that undergo analysis during criminal investigations. In this work, the sensitive and selective detection of ketamine was accomplished by molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor. The molecularly imprinted membrane as a biomimetic recognition element was fabricated by the UV-induced polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) on a metal-organic framework/graphene nanocomposite (MOFs@G) modified screen-printed electrode. The screen printed electrode (SPE) provided good adhesion for the formation of the imprinted membranes and increased the stability of the sensor. The morphology and performance of the imprinted films were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The experimental results demonstrated that the imprinted sensor had excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and long-term stability. It offered a low detection limit (4.0 x 10(-11) mol L-1) and had a dynamic range from 1.0 x 10(-10) mol L-1 to 4.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1. Furthermore, the established method was successfully applied for the determination of ketamine in urine and saliva samples.

AB Herein, a novel biosensing platform for versatile electrochemiluminescence (ECL) "off" and fluorescence (FL) "on" detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with multiple-amplification strategy is proposed. The specific recognition of target to aptamer on the magnetic beads (MB) firstly released abundant DNA sequences of three kinds. The sequences hybridized with multifunctional molecular beacon (MMB) and initiated numerous bidirectional polymerization and shearing reactions, generating a large number of DNA fragments (a1) by multiple cycling amplification. Then a1 was introduced to the triple-helix sensing system, opening the triple-helix structure. In ECL system, the G-rich chains S2 were exposed to form G-quadruplex-hemin complex in the presence of hemin, which could efficiently quench ECL for "off" detection of LPS. In FL system, the fluorophore FAM and quencher BHQ on S1 chain were separated with opening of triple-helix structure, achieving fluorescence "on" signal for LPS assay. So the versatile platform can achieve greatly amplified ECL and FL signal changes for sensitive assay of LPS, showing wide linear ranges (0.1 fg/mL-0.1 ng/mL by ECL and 10 fg/mL(-1)-1 mu g/mL by FL) and low detection limits (0.012 fg/mL by ECL and 1.269 fg/mL by FL). Therefore, the present ECL "Off" and FL "On" dual-signal detection patterns for LPS displayed many advantages over other reported methods, which provided an outlook for future applications in clinical diagnosis.

AB Marine pollution and monitoring have received more and more concern in recent years. Herein, a fully automatic whole-algae biosensor was designed for low-cost and fast detection of toxic contaminants in seawater. It consists of a digital microfluidic (DMF) diluter chip, an actuation element, a detector element, and a microalgae bioreporter. A feedback-control protocol based on charging-time compensation was introduced. It ensures precise actuation of the droplet with diverse salty concentrations and contents in the marine environment. The two mixer cross-split dilution engine increases the accuracy of droplet dispensing and concentration diluting. By selecting motility of P. subcordiformis as the sensor signal, the developed biosensor showed good sensitivity and robustness for a wide range of salinity (10-37 parts per thousand), temperature (0-25 degrees C), light levels (0-325 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), and cell density factor (1.0-4.0). The biosensor responses were examined in the presence of copper, lead, phenol, and nonylphenol (NP). In all cases, toxic responses (i.e. dose-related inhibition of algal motion) were detected with the detection limits of 0.65 mu mol.L-1, 1.90 mu mol.L-1, 2.85 mmol.L-1, and 5.22 mu mol.l(-1) respectively. These results were obtained in a much shorter time (2 h for our biosensor vs. 24 h-10 d for growth inhibition test) and the data are consistent with previous classical studies. We thus developed a simple, rapid, and adaptable system for marine routine monitoring and early-warning detection for lab and on-site applications.

AB With the increasing need for multi-analyze point-of-care diagnosis devices, cell impedance measurement is a promising technique for integration with other sensing modalities. In this comprehensive review, the theory underlying cell impedance sensing, including the history, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations, and applications are critically assessed. Whole cell impedance sensing, also known as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) or electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is an approach for studying and diagnosing living cells in in-vitro and in-vivo environments. The technique is popular since it is label-free, non-invasive, and low cost when compared to standard biochemical assays. CMOS cell impedance measurement systems have been focused on expanding their applications to numerous aspects of biological, environmental, and food safety applications. This paper presents and evaluates circuit topologies for whole cell impedance measurement. The presented review compares several existing CMOS designs, including the classification, measurement speed, and sensitivity of varying topologies.

AB Herein we designed a selective and smartphone-based strategy for visual detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) by utilizing the property of amino-functionalized copper (II)-based metal-organic frameworks (NH2-Cu-MOFs) with oxidase mimic property and fluorescence property. Surprisingly, the oxidase mimic property of NH2-Cu-MOFs can work well at a high pH value 8.0. Thus, a cascade reaction between ALP and NH2-Cu-MOFs was realized for the construction of a ratiometric multicolor sensing platform through the controllable catalytic activity of NH2-Cu-MOFs by pyrophosphate (PPi) and ALP. The catalytic activity of NH2-Cu-MOFs was greatly inhibited because of the binding ability of Cu2+ with PPi. When the ALP was added, the catalytic activity of NH2-Cu-MOFs was restored and then further catalyzed the o-phenylenediamine to form the 2, 3-diaminophenazine due to the hydrolysis function of ALP towards PPi into orthophosphates. RGB analysis of the fluorescent sample images was adopted for ALP quantitative analysis. Besides, a hydrogel test kit and mobile app for ALP detection were designed as conceptual products for point-of-care. The LODs of the fluorescence sensing platform was 0.078 mU mL(-1) and 0.35 mU mL(-1) by solution analysis and hydrogel test kit analysis, respectively. This fluorescent visual method was applied to ALP detection in serum samples with satisfying results, which opened a promising horizon for the diagnosis of other biomarkers in clinical serum samples based on ALP-mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the development of biomedicine and clinical diagnosis.

AB In traditional electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, gold nanomaterials are commonly used as a tool for signal amplification and linking antibodies due to their good electrical conductivity and biocompatibility. Here, we found that multitipped gold nanoparticles-gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) as coreactant accelerator have good catalytic activity for the reduction of dissolved oxygen (O-2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) as electron donor. Based on this, a new enzyme-free and label-free ECL immunosensor have been constructed for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In this system, due to the unique geometric and spatial effects of AuNFs, the dissolved O-2 as endogenous coreactant was catalyzed by AuNFs to produce H2O2 using Tris as an electron donor. The in situ generated H2O2 can more efficiently produce various electrogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROSs) as the important intermediates on the electrode surface. Then, oxidation of luminol reacts with ROSs significantly amplifies the luminol ECL signal. Under optimal experimental conditions, the proposed ECL immunosensor was able to detect the AFP concentration from 0.01 to 100 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 3.4 pg (S/N = 3). In addition, the prepared ITO-based sensor is similar to a micro-test chip and convenient to use, thus making it suitable for clinical use as a disposable device in point-of-care tests (POCTs).

AB In this research, a sensitive and specific electrochemical biosensor for DNA detection was constructed. The highly sensitivity of this biosensor is due to the exploitation of exonuclease III-assisted double recycling and toehold-mediated strand displacement recycling to achieve the target triple recycling amplification, thus generating a large amount of Y-shaped DNA structures. Combination with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT)-mediated cascaded signal amplification strategy can catalyze the repetitive incorporation of biotin-dUTP to the 3'-OH of the Y-shaped DNA. Via biotin-streptavidin interaction, multiple streptavidin-alkaline phosphatases were conjugated to the surface of an Au electrode and generated a sharply increasing electrochemical signal in a 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NP) solution. In this method, an impressive detection limit of 0.05 fM was obtained, presenting outstanding selectivity with a dynamic response scope between 0.1 fM and 1 nM. Thus, the designed biosensor opens an avenue for DNA detection in clinical molecular diagnostics, pathogen detection, gene therapy, food safety and environmental monitoring.

AB We present a sunlight based handheld smartphone spectrometer. The device first gathers the sunlight to pass through the sample, and then the transmitted light illuminates on a grating to generate spectrum finally recorded by the smartphone monochrome camera. All the optical elements are assembled with the smartphone to integrate a handheld device with the size of 140.2 mm x 67.4 mm x 80.5 mm. Besides, a smartphone application is also developed for automatic spectral calibration, detection, analysis and display. Compared to the white light emitting diode and the halogen lamp, the sunlight has more uniform distribution covering the entire visible spectral range; and the proposed device also avoids the bulky sizes of those broadband light sources. Additionally, the monochrome camera is used instead of the color camera not only to pursue a high spectral resolution as 0.276 nm/pixel but also to avoid the color overlapping. We demonstrate the device capability on detecting avian influenza virus H7N9 and porcine circovirus type 2 antibodies, proving the device has rather high sensitivity similar to the commercial microplate reader. Considering its advantages as compact size, high spectral resolution and detecting sensitivity, it is believed the proposed sunlight based handheld smartphone spectrometer is potential to be broadly applied in on-site detections.

AB Blood glucose sensing is very important for diabetic management. It is shifting towards a continuous glucose monitoring because such a system can alleviate patient suffering and provide a large number of glucose measurements. Here, we proposed a novel approach for the development of durable and accurate enzymatic continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). For the long-term durable and selective immobilization of glucose oxidase on a microneedle electrode, a biocompatible engineered mussel adhesive protein was employed through efficient electrochemical oxidation strategy. For the accurate performance in in vivo environments, we also suggested dual real-time compensated algorithms to cover both temperature and time-lag differences. After pre-clinical and pilot-clinical evaluations, we confirmed that our proposed CGMS has an outstanding performance compared with various commercially available continuous systems and achieves comparable performance to disposable glucose sensors.

AB The reliable quantitative analysis of tumor biomarkers in circulating blood is crucial for cancer early screening, therapy monitoring and prognostic prediction. Herein, a novel biosensor combing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface molecularly imprinted polymer (SMIP) technology was developed for quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) that is closely related to several common cancers. Owing to the use of SMIP, recognition sites with high affinity to the target of interest can be well imprinted on the surface of SERS substrate, leading to a more stable and specific capture ability. In addition, two layers of core-shell nanoparticles were integrated to this SERS substrate to form highly efficient electromagnetic enhancement for SERS measurement via the generation of lots of "hot spot". Besides, a unique Raman reporter (C  C) with silent Raman signals at 2024 cm(-1) was capsulated in the nanoparticles to avoid the optical noises originating from endogenous molecules at fingerprint region (300-1800 cm(-1)). Meanwhile, we employed an internal standard molecular to real time correct the fluctuating signals of Raman reporter when performing the quantitative analysis. Due to these features, a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.064 pg mL(-1) with the detection range of 0.1 pg mL(-1) - 10 mu g mL(-1) can be achieved by this assay. Excitingly, this technology even showed wonderful performances for CEA detection in real blood from cancer patients, demonstrating great potential for biomarker-based cancer screening.

AB A novel controlled release system-based antigen-response electrochemical immunosensor was developed for detecting cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by using aminated polystyrene microsphere (APSM) as molecular gate and Fe3O4 as nanocontainer. The amino functionalized mesoporous Fe3O4 (Fe3O4-NH2) was used to load cobalt phthalocyanine nanoparticles (CoPc NPs) and further capture the antibody of cTnI (Ab) to form Fe3O4-Ab. In addition, APSM was introduced to cap on the mesoporous of Fe3O4-Ab by electrostatic interaction. With the addition of cTnI, APSM was separated from Fe3O4-Ab due to the specific binding of antibody to antigen. Then, CoPc NPs were released from the mesoporous. The experimental results revealed that CoPc NPs showed superb catalytic performance when catalyzing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The current responses are correlated with the amount of cTnI. Under the best conditions, a broad linear range from 1.0 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.39 pg/mL (S/N = 3) was obtained. The immunosensor also shows good reproducibility and selectivity, which endows its broad application prospect in clinical research.

AB Mycotoxins are highly toxic secondary metabolites, which may contaminate many types of food and feeds. These toxins have serious health risks for both human and animals. One of the effective ways to prevent food contamination and protect people against mycotoxins is based on timely detection. Several methods like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and affinity chromatography are commercially available for this purpose. Nevertheless, sensitive, fast, simple, low-cost, and portable devices are absolutely required for a fast point-of care information and making decisions. Application of biosensors appears to be a possible technique to meet this need for mycotoxins analyze. The present study has been focused on the literature update of smart using of biosensing for detection of mycotoxin at both academic and industrial levels in order to replace conventional chromatographic methods. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as one of the relatively novel and simple analytical method has been proven for rapid, sensitive, label-free detection and widely used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiplexed pollutant in real-time. This paper aims to provide an extensive overview on biosensors for mycotoxin detection by highlighting the main biorecognition elements. Moreover, SPR principles, assay formats, and signal enhancement are summarized.

AB The first serum diagnosis of leprosy based on the detection of antibodies of patients using a recombinant mimetic peptide (PGL1M3R) as recognition element and exploiting a photoelectrochemical sensor is presented in this work. The photoeletrochemical platform consists of cadmium sulphide and nickel hydroxide electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass slide (CdS/Ni(OH)(2)/FTO). The optical band gap and flat band potential of the photoelectroactive materials were evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The spatial photoelectrochemical response of the platform was evaluated by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy and the morphology of the films was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The photoelectrochemical response of the CdS/Ni(OH)(2)/FTO platform was optimized by evaluating the effects of the kind, concentration, and pH of the buffer. Furthermore, the applied potential to the CdS/Ni(OH)(2)/FTO platform was also investigated. The CdS/Ni(OH)(2)/FTO photoelectrochemical platform was modified with a synthetic peptide by using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent and chitosan (CS) for the covalent coupling of the peptide to the photoelectrochemical platform (PGL1M3R/CdS/Ni(OH)(2)/FTO). The photoelectrochemical immunosensor is able to distinguishing between positive and negative leprosy human sera samples diluted from 1:640 up to 1:10240. Furthermore, to test the specificity of the sensor, samples from tuberculosis and leishmaniasis patients were analyzed using the proposed photoelectrochemical immunosensor.

AB A disposable gas-sensing paper-based device (gPAD) was fabricated in origami design which integrates the gas adsorbent and the electrochemical detection zone in a single device. The gPAD for the determination of NOx gas uses a screen-printed graphene electrode modified with copper nanoparticles (CuNP/SPGE) to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity. The gPAD detects both, NO and NO2 (as NOx) with same current responses. The measurement could be performed directly through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with a detection limit as low as 0.23 vppm and 0.03 vppm with exposure times of 25 min and 1 h, respectively. The reproducibility in terms of relative standard deviation was less than 5.1% (n = 7 devices) at 25, 75 and 125 vppm NO2 and the lifetime of this device was more than 30 days. The gPAD was applied to detect NOx in air and exhaust gases from cars. In comparison with spectrophotometry, there are no significant differences between both methods using a paired t-test of the results on a 95% confidence level. The designed gPAD can provide a new template model for other gas sensors with features of disposability and portability for fieldwork analysis at low cost.

AB A label-free and efficient electrochemical biosensor was developed for the ultrasensitive detection of EBV-related DNA by combing AgDNCs@DNA/AgNCs nanocomposites with noncanonical lambda exonuclease (lambda exo)-assisted target recycling (LNTR). The conjugates of AgDNCs, DNA/AgNCs and probe DNA (pDNA-AgDNCs@DNA/AgNCs conjugates) worked as not only ideal nanocarriers but also efficient electrochemical tags. LNTR didn't require phosphorylated substrates and could be triggered specifically by target DNA, leading to the recycling use of target DNA and the liberation of plentiful linker probes (LP). Subsequently, the LP hybridized with the capture probes on the electrode and then bond to pDNA-AgDNCs@DNA/AgNCs conjugates, generating a sensitive electric signal directly. What's more, the signal amplification effects of DNA/AgNCs and LNTR were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed method exhibited a wide linear range of 1 fM to 1 nM and the detection limit down to 0.38 fM. In addition, the developed biosensing method exhibited excellent specificity and was successfully applied to detect target DNA in complex biological matrix. The proposed biosensor without extra bio-labels may provide a promising platform in bioanalysis and biochemical research.

AB Traditional analytical techniques face many limitations such as time-consuming process, complicated sample preparation, high consumption of reagents and need for expensive equipment. So, it is important that simple, rapid and sensitive detection methods are introduced. Nucleic acids-based assays, particularly aptamers, have a great impact on modern life sciences for biological analysis and target detection. Aptamer-based biosensors with unique recognition properties including high specificity and affinity, rapid response and simple fabrication have attracted much attention. It is believed that two- and three-dimensional structures, sometimes referred to as DNA origami, using DNA aptamers can show more selective binding affinity and better stability over other nucleic acids forms. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in the development and uses of electrochemical and optical DNA origami-based aptasensors to supply readers with a comprehensive understanding of their improvements. Also, the challenges and awards of these approaches are discussed.

AB MicroRNAs are widely used as tumor markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, a multiple signal amplification sandwich-type SERS biosensor for femtomolar detection of miRNA is reported. The signal unit consisted of giant Au vesicles, DNA sequences and deposited silver nanoparticles. The giant Au vesicles provided large-volume hot spots because of sharp tips and abundant hotspot gaps, thus enhancing the electromagnetic intensity for the SERS performance. Further silver stain would easily lead to second-stage amplification of Raman signal. In addition, more SERS signal molecules R6G adsorbed on the signal unit with the aid of HCR and the controlled nanogaps between adjacent AgNPs, brought about the third-stage amplification. The capture unit, prepared by immobilizing the capture probe (CP) on the Fe3O4@AuNPs, could easily capture target miRNA and greatly simplify the separation step to improve reproducibility. The higher concentration of target miRNA definitely formed more sandwich-type structures with combination of capture unit and signal unit, resulting in multiple amplification of SERS signals. The proposed multiple signal amplification sandwich-type SERS biosensor could detect miRNA-141 at the femtomolar level with a low detection limit of 0.03 fM. Meanwhile, it exhibited high selectivity and accuracy, even for practical analysis in human serum. Therefore, the designed multiple signal amplification sandwich-type SERS biosensor would be a very promising alternative tool for the detection of miRNA and analogs in the field of biomedical diagnosis.

AB For the treatment of bacteremia, early diagnosis and rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) are necessary because survival chances decrease significantly if the proper antibiotic administration is delayed. However, conventional methods require several days from blood collection to AST as it requires three overnight cultures, including blood culture, subculture, and AST culture. Herein, we report a more rapid method of sensing bacterial growth and AST in blood based on a vertical capacitance sensor functionalized with aptamers. Owing to their vertical structure, the influence of blood cells sunk by gravity on capacitance measurements were minimized. Thus, bacterial growth in blood at 10(0)-10(3) CFU/mL was monitored in real-time by measuring changes in capacitance at f = 10 kHz. Moreover, real-time capacitance measurements at f = 0.5 kHz provided information on biofilm formation induced during blood cultures. Bacterial growth and biofilm formation are inhibited above the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics; therefore, we also demonstrated that vertical capacitance aptasensors could be applied to rapid AST from positive blood cultures without a need for the subculture process.

AB As a well-known allergenic indicator in kidney beans, lectins have always been the serious threats for human health. Herein, we introduced a new label-free voltammetric immunosensor for the direct determination of kidney bean lectin (KBL) with potential allergenic activity. Gold nanoparticles-polyethyleneimine-multiwalled carbon nanotubes nanocomposite was one-pot synthesized and modified onto the glass carbon electrode to enhance catalytic currents of oxygen reduction reaction. The KBL polyclonal antibody, acquired from rabbit immunization, was orientedly immobilized on the electrode modified with recombinant staphylococcal protein A via fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of antibody. Under the optimized condition, the immunosensor displayed a good linear response (R-2 = 0.978) to KBL with a range from 0.05 to 100 mu g/mL and a detection limit of 0.023 mu g/mL. Simultaneously, the immunosensor exhibited well selectivity, interference-resistant ability, stability (4 degrees C) and reproducibility. Compared with the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, the immunosensor was successfully applied to quantify allergenic activity of lectin in raw and cooked (boiled for 30 min) kidney bean milk samples. This new approach provides new perspectives both for rapid quantification of lectin in kidney beans-derived foodstuffs and as a real-time monitoring tool for the allergenic potential during the whole production and consumption process.

AB Incorporating elements of triple-helix aptamer probes (TAP), catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) signal amplification and host-guest recognition, a novel "signal-on" sensing strategy for sensitive electrochemical quantification of tetracycline (TC) was reported unprecedentedly. TAP was formed involving an aptamer loop, two segment stems and a triplex oligonucleotide serving as trigger probe. Then, the trigger probe would be released from TAP once the target presented due to the conformational variation of TAP induced by aptamer binding event, sparking off the upcoming CHA amplification reaction, in which two coexisting DNA hairpins (H1 and H2 both modified with the electroactive molecules) would hybridize into plentiful H1-H2 double helices. Afterwards, the Exonuclease HI was added, demolishing double helices and simultaneously releasing plentiful electroactive molecules which were capable of diffusing onto the electrode surface under the assistance of beta-cyclodextrin due to host-guest recognition, where appreciable signals were enriched and generated. As thus, considerably slight amounts of targets though, emitted trigger probes, yet efficiently engining spectacular CHA cycles of reactions through which amplified signals were yielded, and in turn progressively enabling the sensitive target detection done. Under optimal conditions, the growing signal stayed a linear relation along with the logarithm of the target concentrations ranging from 0.2 nM to 100 nM, the detection limit reaching as low as 0.13 nM. This approach was desirable regarding to sensitivity, detection limit and range, prospectively rendering a service for diverse targets detection by easily replacing the matched aptamer loop of TAP.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with severe memory loss and impaired cognitive skills. A common pathological change found in AD-affected brains is the accumulation of a peptide named amyloid-beta (A beta) that can form plaques. All aggregates are visible to structural scanning tools; however, these bulky and expensive instruments are accessible to trained personnel in clinical settings only, thus hampering timely diagnosis of the disease, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we design an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) for in vitro detection of A beta aggregates in human serum. The OECT channel is integrated with a nanostructured isoporous membrane which has a strong affinity for All aggregates. The detection mechanism relies on the membrane capturing A beta aggregates larger than the size of its pores and thus blocking the penetration of electrolyte ions into the channel underneath. Combining the high transconductance of the OECT with the precise porosity and selectivity of the membrane, the device detects the presence of A beta aggregates in human serum samples with excellent sensitivity. This is the first-time demonstration of a biofunctionalized, nanostructured, and isoporous membrane integrated with a high-performance transistor for biosensing. This robust, low-power, non-invasive, and miniaturized sensor aids in the development of point-of-care tools for early diagnosis of AD.

AB Reliable and sensitive detection of xanthine has important medical and biological significance. In this work, a novel three-dimensional (3D) conductive polymer hydrogel of polyaniline (PAni) was feasibly prepared using aniline (Ani), amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) and ammonium persulfate ((NH4)(2)S2O8) as monomer, gelatinizing agent and oxidizing agent, respectively. Protonation of aniline can be achieved by ATMP, inducing good conductivity of the obtained hydrogel. ATMP remained the chelating abilities in the conductive hydrogel, enabling further immobilization with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized by a luminol derivative, N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI). ABEI-Ag@PAni-ATMP exhibited an enhanced performance of solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Integrated with xanthine oxidase (XOD), the proposed biosensor can be applied in the detection of xanthine via in-situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and present a low detection limit of 9.6 nM, a wide linear range (from 0.01 to 200 mu M) and excellent stability.

AB Despite the fact that the identification and detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) plays a critical role in cancer monitoring and diagnosis, it remains a major challenge to isolate and detect these cells, due to their extreme scarcity in peripheral blood. In this work, by coupling a dual recognition strategy and the commercial personal glucose meter, we established a point-of-care approach for detecting rare CTCs in whole blood with high sensitivity and selectivity. The antibody-conjugated magnetic beads lead to the capture and isolation of the CTCs while the enzyme- and second antibody-modified microspheres yield the signal for detection. Because of the dual recognition format, the developed method is highly selective, and a low detection limit of 7 cells can be realized as well, owing to the great signal amplification through the enzyme-loaded microbead labels. More importantly, the detection of CTCs in whole blood can be achieved in a point-of-care fashion with the using of the glucose meter transducer, offering our method a convenient and attractive alternative to traditional biopsy for the diagnosis of various cancers.

AB In this work, Ni(OH)(2) nanocages@MnO2 nanosheets core-shell architecture (Ni(OH)(2) NCs@MnO2 NSs CSA) was successfully prepared through coordinated etching and precipitation (CEP) route followed by hydrothermal reaction, and then tested as sensitive electrode material for detection of dopamine (DA). The three dimensional (3D) hollow Ni(OH)(2) core effectively prevented the aggregation of MnO2 NSs, leading to high utilization rate of MnO2 NSs. Meanwhile, the two dimensional (2D) MnO2 shell endowed Ni(OH)(2) NCs with larger specific area and abundant diffusion channels, facilitating mass transport. Ni(OH)(2) NCs@MnO2 NSs CSA modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited two satisfying sensitivities of 467.1 and 1249.9 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) within the two linear ranges of 0.02-16.30 mu M and 18.30-118.58 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2) NCs@MnO2 NSs CSA/GCE presented low detection limit of 1.75 nM and short response time of 1.14 s. Overall, Ni(OH)(2) NCs@MnO2 NSs/GCE looks promising for analytical sensing of DA thanks to its prominent electrocatalytic dynamic issued from the 3D hollow structure@2D nanosheets core-shell architecture.

AB An ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioassay for determination of microRNA was proposed based on an integrative photoactive heterojunction nanomaterial to provide the basis of excellent PEC responses and an efficient redox cycling amplification system to improve the detection performances. To establish the bioassay system, the biosensor was firstly modified with Bi2WO6@Bi2S3 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The detection solution was composed of ascorbic acid phosphate (AAP) and ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcA), where ALP converted AAP into ascorbic acid (AA) to trigger a process of redox cycling amplification by reducing FcA(+) to FcA, resulting in enhanced photocurrent responses of Bi2WO6@Bi2S3. In the presence of microRNA 21, it could trigger a hybridization chain reaction via the special designed hairpin DNA to produce a long repeated DNA sequences to inhibit ALP activity. Thus the reduced ALP activity and consequently decreased photocurrent signal could be obtained for detection of microRNA 21. As expected, this bioassay system performed the satisfactory performances for the ultrasensitive detection of microRNA 21 in the range from 1 fM to 1 nM with an experimental detection limit of 0.26 fM and acceptable practical applicability. Collectively, an efficient PEC bioassay for microRNA 21 is established and this strategy can be expanded to detect other microRNAs, even other molecules in cells.

AB The method of transferring the immunoreaction from electrode surface to tube can greatly improve the analytical performance of electrochemical immunosensor. In this work, based on PtCu nanoprobe-mediated and iodide-catalyzed cascade reaction, an improved electrochemical immunosensor was elaborately designed for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) detection. PtCu nanoparticles combined with NSE antibody (Ab(2)) were used as immunoprobes to trigger cascade reaction. With high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of iodide, PtCu nanoprobes catalyzed iodide to iodine in the presence of H2O2, leading to the decrease of iodide. Subsequently, as a bridge between the tube and iodide-responsive sensing interface, the residual iodide in tube was employed to catalyze the transition from thiol substances (RSH) to disulfide substances (RSSR) on electrode surface. On the basis of this property, thiol-modified DNA (DNA-SH) and 6-mercaptohexanol (MCH) reacted with H2O2 and the residual iodide to form disulfide substances and detach from the electrode surface, causing the decrease of interface resistance in different degrees. Then square wave voltammetry (SWV) was applied for current signal of electrochemical sensing interface to achieve the quantitative detection of NSE. Under optimal conditions, this improved biosensor demonstrated excellent selectivity, stability and reproducibility with wide linear range from 0.0001 to 100 ng mL(-1) and ultralow detection limit of 52.14 fg mL(-1) for NSE, thus holding great promise for sensitive determination of tumor markers.

AB Multiplexed detection of microRNA (miRNA) is of great value in clinical diagnosis. Here, a new type of poly-dopamine (PDA) encapsulated photonic crystal (PhC) barcodes are employed for target-triggering cycle amplification and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to achieve multiplex miRNA quantification. The PDA-decorated PhC barcodes not only exhibit distinctive structural color for different encoding miRNAs, they also can immobilize biomolecules, allowing subsequent reaction with amino-modified hairpin probes (H1). When the PDA-decorated PhC barcodes are used in assays, target miRNAs can be circularly used to initiate HCR for cycle amplification. Therefore, by tuning the structural colors of the PDA-integrated PhC, the multiplexed miRNA quantification could be realized. We demonstrate that our strategy for multiplexed detection of miRNA is reasonably accurate, reliable and repeatable, with a detection limit as low as 8.0 fM. Our results show that PDA encapsulated PhC barcodes as a novel platform offer a pathway toward the multiplex analysis of low-abundance biomarkers for biomedical assays.

AB Accurate and sensitive detection of the Pax-5a gene is of great importance in the early diagnosis and prognosis of acute leukaemia. Herein, a label-free electrochemical sensing system was proposed for the detection of the acute leukaemia Pax-5a gene based on enzyme-assisted signal amplification to generate abundant G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme. The presence of Pax-5a can open the hairpin probe (HP), which acts as a template. Under the action of the restriction enzymes Nt.BbvCI and Klenow fragment polymerase, the target gene Pax-5a is cycled to open the HP; On the other hand, a large number of G-quadruplex sequences are produced. The resulting G-quadruplex sequence is capable of forming the G-quadruplex/hemin complex on the surface of the electrode in the presence of hemin. The ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical detection of Pax-5a can be realized via the G-quadruplex/hemin complex-catalysed reduction of H2O2, and the detection limit was estimated to be as low as 4.6 fM. In addition, the biosensor has good specificity and stability, and also has excellent detection capabilities in a complex substrate environment. Therefore, the sensor shows great potential in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.

AB Herein, by utilizing bipedal DNA walker as booster to adjust the distance of quencher ferrocene (Fc) and sensitizer methylene blue (MB) to photoactive material perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA), a novel "on-off-super on" photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of thrombin (TB). Firstly, the PTCA matrix on electrode could provide a high initial PEC signal assisted by depAu. Upon the Fc labeled on hairpin DNA 1 (H-1-Fc) proximate to PTCA, the PEC signal could obviously decrease to reduce the background signal. Interestingly, the target TB-related bipedal DNA walker implemented the opening of H-1-Fc for the departure of Fc toward PTCA, which achieved the recovery of PEC signal and exposed the prelocked toehold domain for the hybridization with hairpin DNA 2 labeled with MB (H-2-MB), thereby making the MB approach to PTCA for achieving the "super on" signal. As a result, this proposed strategy showed a wide linear range from 0.5 fM to 100 nM with a low detection limit down to 0.17 fM for TB detection, providing an efficient and available avenue for sensitive detection of biomolecules in bioanalysis and disease diagnosis.

AB Exosomes, lipid bilayer membrane vesicles, can guide various pathological and physiological processes. However, reliable, convenient and sensitive methods for exosome determination for early cancer diagnosis are still technically challenging. Herein, an electrochemical aptasensor based on click chemistry and the DNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for signal amplification has been developed for the ultrasensitive detection of tumor exosomes. CD63 aptamer was first immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode for capturing exosomes, and 4-oxo-2-nonenal alkyne (alkynyl-4-ONE) molecules, functionalized lipid electrophiles, were conjugated to the exosomes via the reaction of amino and aldehyde groups. Azide-labeled DNA probe as an anchor was then connected to the exosomes by copper (I)-catalyzed click chemistry. Signal amplification was achieved by HCR, and the numerous linked horseradish peroxidase (HRP) molecules could catalyze the reaction of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and H2O2. The concentration of exosomes could be quantified by monitoring the electrochemical reduction current of 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Under the optimal conditions, this method allowed the sensitive detection of exosomes in the range of 1.12 x 10(2) to 1.12 x 10(8) particles/mu L with a limit of detection (LOD) of 96 particles/mu L. Furthermore, the present assay enabled sensitive and accurate quantification of exosomes in human serum, and it has high potential for exosome analysis in clinical samples.

AB Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne, single positive-stranded RNA virus that spread human being through infected female Aedes mosquito bite and causes dengue fever. The demand for early detection of this virus has increased to control the widespread of infectious diseases and protect humankind from its harmful effects. Recently, biosensors are found to the potential tool to detect and quantify the virus with fast detection, relatively cost-effective, high sensitivity and selectivity than the conventional diagnostic methods such as immunological and molecular techniques. Mostly, the biosensors employ electrochemical detection technique with transducers, owing to its easy construction, low-cost, ease of use, and portability. Here, we review the current trends and advancement in the electrochemical diagnosis of dengue virus and discussed various types of electrochemical biosensing techniques such as; amperometric, potentiometric, impedometric, and voltammetric sensing. Apart from these, we discussed the role of biorecognition molecules such as nucleic acid, antibodies, and lectins in electrochemical sensing of dengue virus. In addition, the review highlighted the benefits of the electrochemical approach in comparison with traditional diagnostic methods. We expect that these dengue virus diagnostic techniques will continue to evolve and grow in future, with exciting new possibilities stemming from advancement in the rational design of electrochemical biosensors.

AB We investigated sequence-specific and simultaneous microRNA (miRNA) detections by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging measurements on SPR chips possessing an Au spot array modified with probe DNAs based on a miRNA-detection-selective SPR signal amplification method. MiRNAs were detected with the detection limit of the attomole level by SPR imaging measurements for different miRNA concentrations on a single chip. SPR signals were enhanced based on a combination process of sequence-specific hybridization of the miRNA to the probe DNAs, extension reaction of polyadenine (poly(A)) tails by poly(A) polymerase, binding of a ternary complex of T-30-biotin/horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-biotin/streptavidin to the poly(A) tails, and the oxidation reaction of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) on the HRP by providing a blue precipitate on the surface. This process sequence-specifically and dramatically amplified the SPR signals. This is a simple, cost-effective, and feasible signal amplification method based on the organic compound TMB instead of metal nanoparticles.

AB Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (also called electrochemiluminescence and abbreviated ECL) has attracted much attention in various fields of analysis due to the potential remarkably high sensitivity, extremely wide dynamic range and excellent controllability. Electrochemiluminescence biosensor, by taking the advantage of the selectivity of the biological recognition elements and the high sensitivity of ECL technique was applied as a powerful analytical device for ultrasensitive detection of biomolecule. In this review, we summarize the latest sensing applications of ECL bioanalysis in the field of bio affinity ECL sensors including aptasensors, immunoassays and DNA analysis, cytosensor, molecularly imprinted sensors, ECL resonance energy transfer and ratiometric biosensors and give future perspectives for new developments in ECL analytical technology.

AB Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicle (EV) long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in lung cancer may be clinically useful biomarkers for early diagnosis using liquid biopsy. However, the extremely low quantities of EV-lncRNAs in peripheral blood are a major challenge for multi-target detection. In this study, we developed a new multi-colour fluorescence digital PCR EV-lncRNA (miDER) analysis chip, and then demonstrated its ability to quickly and accurately analyse the levels of two target genes and one reference gene from peripheral blood. Under the miDER assay, the limit of detection of the target gene from peripheral blood was 10 copies/4. Based on multiplex assay, the expression levels of two lung cancer-related genes (SLC9A3-AS1 and PCAT6) in patients with lung cancer (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 30) showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001; two-tailed t-test). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the discrimination ability of these lncRNAs. The combination of two lncRNAs in the miDER assay yielded a higher area under curve (AUC) value of 0.811 (95% CI = 0.705-0.918). Moreover, to determine the absolute quantitation capacity of the miDER assay, we compared the results to those obtained by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), demonstrating that the miDER assay is more sensitive than qPCR. The multiplex assay based on the miDER could provide a new solution for the multi-index combined detection of trace EV-lncRNAs in body fluids and demonstrate the use of EV-lncRNAs as biomarkers for lung tumour biopsy.

AB A signal-off type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor based on Ru(hpy)(3)(2+) and Bi2S3 co-sensitized ZnTiO3/TiO2 polyhedra as matrix and SiO2 /PDA-Au as the label of second antibody was proposed for the ultrasensitive detection of procalcitonin (PCT). The hollow ZnTiO3/TiO2 polyhedra called zinc titanium composite hollow structures (ZTCHS) was prepared by hydrothermal method to enhance the utilization of visible light comparing with pure ZnTiO3 or TiO2 . The unique structure endowed large specific surface areas and satisfying load capacity to ZTCHS. Ru(hpy)(3)(2+) and Bi2S3 were utilized to co-sensitize ZTCHS to further strengthen the PEC performance of ZTCHS. It was interesting that the dual-inhibition effects of SiO2 /PDA-Au further enhanced the sensitivity of proposed PEC immunosensor. On the one hand, the steric hindrance of SiO2 /PDA effectively restricted electron transfer. On the other hand, Au nanoparticles could absorb visible light to compete with the matrix material. Based on the above aspects, the proposed signal-off type PEC immunosensor possessed a wide linear range from 0.0001 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) and low detection limit (about 0.03 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3), demonstrating the promising application of PEC immunosensor in analysis fields.

AB Superbugs such as infectious bacteria pose a great threat to humanity due to an increase in bacterial mortality leading to clinical treatment failure, lengthy hospital stay, intravenous therapy and accretion of bacteraemia. These disease-causing bacteria gain resistance to drugs over time which further complicates the treatment. Monitoring of antibiotic resistance is therefore necessary so that bacterial infectious diseases can be diagnosed rapidly. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) provides valuable information on the efficacy of antibiotic agents and their dosages for treatment against bacterial infections. In clinical laboratories, most widely used AST methods are disk diffusion, gradient diffusion, broth dilution, or commercially available semi-automated systems. Though these methods are cost-effective and accurate, they are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and require skilled manpower. Recently much attention has been on developing rapid AST techniques to avoid misuse of antibiotics and provide effective treatment. In this review, we have discussed emerging engineering AST techniques with special emphasis on phenotypic AST. These techniques include fluorescence imaging along with computational image processing, surface plasmon resonance, Raman spectra, and laser tweezer as well as micro/nanotechnology-based device such as microfluidics, microdroplets, and microchamber. The mechanical and electrical behaviour of single bacterial cell and bacterial suspension for the study of AST is also discussed.

AB The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), along with other cranial nerves, has in recent years become a popular target for bioelectric medicine due to its direct access to neuromodulatory centers. Trigeminal nerve stimulation is currently being evaluated as an adjunctive treatment for various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases despite the mechanism of action being in question. In this work, we describe the development and validation of a novel neural interface for the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve utilizing a thin film (TF) nerve cuff containing multiple electrode sites allowing for more selective stimulation of the nerve. We characterized the properties of the device using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, voltage excursions, and in vivo testing. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the platinum-based electrodes possess a capacitive charge carrying mechanism suitable for stimulation of biological tissue with a safe charge injection limit of 73.13 mu C/cm(2). In vivo stimulation experiments show that the IT cuff can reliably stimulate nerve targets eliciting cortical responses similar to a silicone cuff electrode. Furthermore, selecting different pairs of stimulation electrodes on the TF cuff modulated the magnitude and/or spatial pattern of cortical responses suggesting that the device may be able to selectively stimulate different parts of the nerve. These results suggest that the TF cuff is a viable neural interface for stimulation of the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve that enables future research examining the therapeutic mechanisms of trigeminal nerve stimulation.

AB Implantable medical devices have been used for real-time monitoring of physical parameters (temperature, pressure and biopotentials), sustained drug release, cardiovascular and pulmonary stents and other clinical applications. Several biocompatible materials (titanium and its alloys, aluminium, cobalt-alloys, stainless steel, poly-ethylene, polyurethanes, polyglycolide and polylactides) have been commercially used for fabricating implantable devices. However, these devices require retrieval operations after a certain period. Bioresorbable materials disintegrate gradually in vivo and their derivatives get absorbed completely in the body fluid with no residue and with minimal toxic effects, thus, eliminating the need for retrieval operations. In this article, state-ofthe-art advances in materials, fabrication techniques and clinical applications of bioresorbable implantable devices are reviewed. We first discuss the bioresorbable materials (e.g., magnesium, molybdenum, tungsten, silicon, germanium, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silk and synthetic polymers) used in the fabrication of implantable devices. Later, an overview of processes to fabricate pressure, temperature, electrical and chemical sensors are discussed, followed by their applications as implantable devices in biomedical engineering.

AB A facile method to prepare hollow molecularly imprinted polymers (HMIPs) for specific recognition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from biological samples was proposed in this paper. The HMIPs was prepared using silica nanoparticles as the sacrificial matrix and dopamine as functional monomer. The thickness of polydopamine shells can be easily modulated by tuning the mass ratio of silica matrix and dopamine. The polymerization conditions and recognition behaviors of the HMIPs were investigated systematically. The results suggested that the hollow structure endowed the HMIPs with fast adsorption kinetics of 25 min, high binding capacity of 172.1 mg/g, and reusability of no less than four adsorption-regeneration cycles without apparent deterioration. Meanwhile, excellent binding specificity towards HRP was presented in the selectivity studies. Moreover, enriching of HRP from human serum sample by the obtained HMIPs was conducted. The HMIPs displayed satisfactory binding specificity to HRP, in spite of the complex composition of the human serum.

AB According to the combination of colloidal crystals and molecular imprinting techniques, a novel close-packed imprinted colloidal array (CPICA) for naked-eye horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection at physiological pH was proposed. The CPICA was fabricated by self-assemble of monodispersed HRP imprinted particles. The HRP imprinted particles were prepared based on surface imprinting technique and immobilized template strategy using 2,4-difluoro-3-formylphenylboronic acid (DFFPBA) as functional monomer which allowed the material binding of HRP at physiological pH (denoted as SiO2@DFFPBA/MIPs). The adsorption capacity of the SiO2@ DFFPBA/MIPs for HRP was 1.16 mu mol/g, and reached saturated adsorption within 25 min. The limit of detection (LOD) of the CPICA was 3.0 x 10(-13) mol/mL. In addition, the adsorption of HRP on the CPICA could be directly transferred into visible color changes and readable optical signals through the reflection peak shifts. The structure color of the CPICA changed from brilliant blue to dark red with an maximum red shift of 87 nm when the HRP concentration increased from 2.5 to 20.0 mu mol/L. Moreover, the CPICA could be used to detect HRP from human serum sample, which demonstrated the promising application prospects in colorimetric sensors.

AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death nowadays, and its under-diagnosis is still a great challenge. More effective diagnosis method is in urgent need since the traditional spirometry has many limitations in the practical application. The electrochemical (EC) detection methods have their unique advantages of high accuracy, short response time and easy integration of the system. In this review, recent works on the EC methods for COPD biomarkers including interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and Creactive protein (CRP) are summarized. Five types of EC methods are highlighted in this study, as enzyme-labelled immunosensors, nanoparticle-labelled immunosensors, capacitive or impedimetric immunosensors, magnetoimmunosensors, and field effect transistor (FET) immunosensors. To date, EC immunosensors have been exhibiting high analytical performance with a detection limit that can achieve several pg/mL or even lower. The simplicity of EC immunosensors makes them a perfect solution for a future point-of-care device to use in settings for COPD diagnosis and follow-up. Nevertheless, more efforts need to be paid on the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers, a demand for the clinical diagnosis, and processes of assay simplification towards achieving one-step detection.

AB The excellent conductivity matching of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanomaterials (e.g. MoS2) with cancer cell plays an important role in ultrasensitive label-free impedimetric detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) ( < 1 cell/mL). Firstly, 2D semiconductor materials (e.g. 2D MoS2) exfoliated by folic acid (FA) is used to construct MoS2/FA-modified gold electrode (AuE/MoS2/FA). Then, the fabricated electrode is applied for HeLa cell detection in a linear range from 1 to 10(5) cell/mL with a detection limit of 0.43 cell/mL (S/N = 3). The detection mechanism of high sensitivity might be owing to the electric conductivity matching of MoS2 (0.14 S/m) to cancer cell (0.13-0.23 S/m). A negligible conductivity change induced by cancer cell will produce a large impedance change of semiconductor electrode. Furthermore, HeLa cells dispersed in healthy blood samples are detected by suggested cytosensor in a linear range from 50 to 10(5) cell/mL with a detection limit of 52.24 cell/mL (S/N = 2). Finally, we demonstrate that the cytosensor is capable of differentiating patients of cervical and liver cancers by the real CTC analysis from healthy control.

AB Excessive use of herbicide and insecticide causes bioaccumulation in the environment and increases potential toxicity for people and animals. Portable systems for rapid assays of herbicide and insecticide residues have attracted prominent interests. Here, we developed a two-dimensional (2D) Pt-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets (NSs) amplified two-way lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) with a smartphone-based readout for simultaneous detection of acetochlor and fenpropathrin. The 2D Pt-Ni(OH)(2) NSs were synthesized and used as the enhanced signal label in the immunoassay due to their high peroxidase-like activity and low migration speed. The two-way LFI was designed to eliminate potential cross-reaction between two targets. Portable detection system was developed based on a smartphone-based readout, which scans the LFI and provides the accurate testing result. The universal use of smartphones makes the developed platform suitable for cheap and on-site applications. Using the integrated platform, detection of acetochlor and fenpropathrin simultaneously was successfully achieved with the detection limits of 0.63 ng/mL and 0.24 ng/mL, respectively. To confirm the performance of the on-site application, we detected 10 non-spiked samples and 3 spiked samples. The obtained detection results were consistent with the data from gas chromatography analysis. The estimated recoveries ranged from 97.12% to 111.46%, indicating the practical reliability of our developed assay. The developed smartphone-based platform exhibits enhanced sensitivity, which provides a promising technique for on-site, multiplex, highly sensitive detection of pesticides.

AB In this study, we demonstrate a novel affinity peptide-incorporated electrochemical biosensor for the detection of acute kidney injury and the diabetic biomarker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Biopanning of the M13 phage display library over immobilized NGAL led to the rapid identification of unique affinity peptide with an amino acid sequence of DRWVARDPASIF, and the peptide-displayed phage particles were found to be specific affinities for NGAL. To address the development of peptide-based electrochemical sensor, a series of synthetic peptides away from phage particles was rationally designed, chemically synthesized, and immobilized to a gold sensor layer. Among five synthetic peptide derivatives tested, NGAL BP1 was selected as most promising recognition receptor, and its binding affinity was monitored by SWV and EIS. Using EIS, the limit of detection (LOD) was 1.74 ng/mL, while SWV had a LOD of 3.93 ng/mL. The detection performance of the peptide-incorporated sensor was comparable to commercially available ELISA NGAL detection kits. In addition, the validation of the peptide sensor was also confirmed with plasma from patients, and it was observed that the sensitivity of the peptide sensor showed a statistically significant difference. Our results show that the phage and peptide sensor system could detect NGAL with high sensitivity and selectivity, and this suggests its potential use as a biosensing platform for monitoring NGAL in a miniaturized electrochemical biosensor.

AB Almost no analytical assays, either colorimetric or fluorescence assays, for generic microplate readers is capable of dynamic measurements of protein-protein binding or the quantification of kinetic association and dissociation constants of protein interactions. On the other hand, protein binding kinetics quantification can be uniquely done on special expensive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing equipment. Here we report the integration of coupled plasmonic-photonic resonance nanosensors in standard 96-well plate format and by using which, for the very first time, the demonstration of label-free dynamic SPR-like protein binding measurement and kinetics quantification in a generic microplate reader. Our low-cost label-free nanosensor plate enables very sensitive detection of immobilized protein interactions based on the transmission optical density (OD) value changes at specific wavelengths measured in a generic microplate reader. The relative end-point OD value changes show a good linear response with protein concentrations (from 0.05 to 50 mu g/ml). And the protein quantification in serum results are consistent with the concurrent hospital lab tests. Most importantly, the kinetic association and dissociation constants of protein interactions in our sensor plate wells are determined by time-lapse dynamic OD value measurement in the generic microplate reader. Enabled by our unique nanosensor plate, SPR-like measurement of protein binding kinetics is now available using generic microplate reader ubiquitous in many chemistry and biomedical research labs.

AB Microcystins are the most worldwide extended and common toxins produced by cyanobacteria in freshwater. Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR), associated with the most toxic incidents involving microcystins, are within the cyanobacteria (intracellular) until released into the surrounding waters (extracellular) during cell lysis. Therefore, the relationship between intracellular and extracellular cyanotoxins will allow a comprehensive risk of cyanobacteria-containing waters, preventing disease and improving human safety. In this work, we present the development of a novel portable microfluidic sensing platform for the simultaneous detection of free (extracellular) and total MC-LR (intracellular and extracellular). The integrated system contains the sample processing and detection modules capable of performing the chemical lysis, filtration, sample mixing with antibodies, and electrochemical detection of MC-LR based on an indirect strategy. The performance of the immunosensors was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, showing a linear dynamic range between 3.3 x 10(-4) and 10(-7) g L-1 and a limit of detection of 5.7 x 10(-7) g L-1. The results demonstrate the potential of the developed portable biosensor platform and its suitable application for the analysis of MC-LR at regulated levels for drinking water. Finally, the integrated system was able to simultaneously detect the free and total MC-LR on a Microcystis aeruginosa culture. To the best of our knowledge this is the first described system that can differentiate between intracellular and extracellular concentration of MC-LR. This novel electrochemical sensing platform avoids the multiple processing steps typically needed for standard MC-LR analysis in the laboratory and provides an early warning system for MC-LR remote monitoring in water.

AB Solid-state nanochannels have great potentials in the vibrant field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis. This work herein demonstrates the innovative use of DNA-decorated nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) nanochannels for sensitive PEC bioanalysis of telomerase (TE) activity. Specifically, telomerase primer sequences (TS) were initially immobilized within the NAA nanochannels and then extended by TE in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). The as formed single-strand DNA was then directed to hybrid with many partially matched single-strand assisting DNA (aDNA), leading to the formation of multiple DNAzymes by the unmatched parts and the subsequent DNAzyme-stimulated biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) within the nanochannels. Because the inhibited signals of the photoelectrode could be correlated with TE-enabled TS extension, an innovative nanochannels PEC bioanalysis could be realized for probing TE activity. This work features the ingenious use of DNA-associated nanochannels for PEC bioanalysis of TE activity. Given the versatile functions of DNA molecules, the extension of this strategy easily allows for addressing numerous other targets of interest. Also, we envision this work could inspire more interest for the further development of nanochannels PEC bioanalysis.

AB Nowadays, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has become a formidable danger to human health, and its early diagnosis is urgent need with the increasing quantity of patients around the world. Herein, we first synthesized beta-cyclodextrin-functionalized CdS nanorods (beta-CD@CdS NRs) with high stability and desirable photo-electricity activity, and served as easy-to-assemble building modules to design a novel photoelectrochemical biosensor for human immune deficiency virus (HIV) DNA detection by coupling with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA)-mediated biocatalytic precipitation and the host-guest interaction between adamantine (ADA) and beta-CD. In the presence of HIV DNA, CHA process was triggered with the aid of hairpin DNA1 and ADA-labelled hairpin DNA2, and then generated large amounts of G-quadruplex, which could be formed hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme to catalyze 4-chloro-1-naphthol to generate insoluble precipitation on photoelectrode surface, followed by the decreased photocurrent response due to the corresponding stereo-hindrance effect. Under optimized conditions, this biosensor exhibited wide linear dynamic range (10 fM - 1 nM) and low detection limit of 1.16 fM, as well as high sensitivity, excellent stability, and satisfactory feasibility in human-serum samples. Moreover, the prepared beta-CD@CdS NRs could be applied to the construction of other advanced sensing platform, showing great prospect in clinical diagnostics.

AB An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analytical platform was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of amyloid-beta proteins (A beta) based on the ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET). In this work, gold nanoparticles-functionalized graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4@Au NPs) and palladium nanoparticles-coated Metal organic framework (Pd NPs@NH2-MIL-53) were synthesized, which were as ECL donor and ECL acceptor respectively. A strong cathode ECL emission was obtained from the g-C3N4@Au NPs when used K2S2O8 as its co-reactant. Here, Au NPs not only was used as an accelerator to enhance and stabilize the ECL signal, but also a connector for attaching A beta antibody. In addition, NH2-MIL-53(Al) was selected as a label material for supporting Pd NPs to synergistically increase the intensity and range of UV-visible absorption. The ECL signal of g-C3N4@Au NPs was intensely decreased when the ECL acceptor probe Pd NPs@NH2-MIL-53 was incubated onto the modified GCE by way of the specific recognition. Under the optimal condition, a wide detection range from 10 fg/mL to 50 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 3.4 fg/mL (S/N = 3) were obtained. In consideration of favorable specificity, stability and reproducibility, the proposed method was successfully applied for A beta detection in actual human serum samples and could be a potential analytical tool for sensitive molecular trace detection in clinical analysis.

AB A novel electrochemical sensor based on nitrogen and sulfur doped hollow Mo2C/C spheres (N, S-Mo2C) and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was proposed for carbendazim (CBD) determination. The N, S-Mo2C were prepared by first nitrogen and sulfur doping via one-pot method and subsequent carbonization at high temperature. A film of MIP was then fabricated in situ on the N, S-Mo2C surface by electropolymerization, with CBD acting as template molecule and o-phenylenediamine as functional monomer. The N, S-Mo2C were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and electrochemical behaviors of CBD on differently modified electrodes were explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under the optimal conditions, a calibration curve of current shift versus the logarithm of CBD concentration was obtained in the range of 1 x 10(-12) similar to 8 x 10(-9) M with a detection limit of 6.7 x 10(-13) M (S/N =3). Moreover, the proposed sensor exhibited favorable stability and selectivity, and was applied to analyze pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables with decent accuracy.

AB The wide cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops has raised concerns on the risks to humans and the environment. 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase isolated from Agrobacterium species strain CP4 (CP4-EPSPS) protein is most widely present in these crops. Therefore the measurement of CP4-EPSPS sensitively in a point-of-care testing (POCT) manner for the screening of transgenic plants is demanded. To date the development of quantitative POCT system has not yet been reported. In presented study, an electrochemical immunosensor towards CP4-EPSPS has been fabricated by integrating a portable bioanalytical device with a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) for POCT of GM crops. The dual-functionalized AuNPs were used as nanoprobes and prepared by simultaneously tagging horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and antibody on AuNPs with an exceptionally simple protocol. The sensitivity of the developed nanoprobe-based immunosensor was 62.5-fold higher than that using HRP-labeled antibody. As a result, the proposed immunosensor using SPCE could detect CP4-EPSPS down to 0.050 ng mL(-)(1) with the linear range of 0.10-10 ng mL(-1) within 65 min. In addition, the developed method has been validated with genuine GM crops and the results show a good correlation coefficient of 0.9909 compared with those of a commercial ELISA kit. Therefore, this portable electrochemical immunosensor is suitable for rapid and sensitive detection and provides a convenient and reliable platform for POCT assay.

AB Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a widely used biomarker, is involved in many diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and rheumatoid arthritis, and it is often over-expressed in human malignant tumors. Therefore, sensitive, specific and efficient detection methods for CTGF are needed for the early diagnosis and assessment of prognosis. In this study, an aptamer, APT1, that specifically binds to CTGF was obtained by SELEX technology. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that APT1 formed interconvertible parallel and antiparallel G-quadruplexes. Mutation and truncation strategies optimized APT1 and improved its functions, yielding APT1M6T, which folded into an antiparallel G-quadruplex with higher targeting affinity. A stable APT1M6T-CTGF complex model was established by molecular simulation, which helped elucidate the molecular recognition mechanism of APT1M6T and CTGF and also provided experimental guidance for rational site-directed modification of APT1M6T. A locked nucleic acid sequence was then integrated into APT1M6T to generate APT1M6TL, which had higher structural stability. A BLI-based enzyme-linked aptamer sandwich assay (BLI-ELASA) was successfully developed. The method exhibited a broad detection range from 0.05 to 50 nM with a low detection limit of 0.02 nM. The method showed high selectivity, reproducibility, and stability for analysis of CTGF in spiked serum and urine samples. This developed BLI-ELASA is promising and enables real-time, sensitive and rapid detection of the disease-specific biomarker CTGF.

AB Rolling circle amplification (RCA) combined with padlock probe recognition of a DNA target is attractive for on-chip nucleic acid testing due to its high specificity and isothermal reaction conditions. However, the integration of RCA on an automated chip platform is challenging due to the different reagents needed for the reaction steps and the temperature sensitivity of the phi29 polymerase. Here, we describe the integration of an RCA assay on a single-use polymer chip platform where magnetic microbeads are used as solid support to transport the DNA target between three connected reaction chambers for (i) padlock probe annealing and ligation, (ii) RCA, and (iii) optomagnetic detection of RCA products. The three chambers were loaded with reagents by sequential filling combined with passive microfluidic structures. After loading, the on-chip assay steps were automated. For an assay in which all steps but the padlock probe annealing on the target were performed on-chip, we found a limit of detection (LOD) for a synthetic influenza target of 2 pM after 45 min of RCA, which is comparable to the corresponding laboratory assay. The entire assay, including padlock probe annealing, could be performed on-chip with an LOD of 20 pM after 45 min of RCA. This LOD can likely be reduced by further optimizing the microbead mixing. The results present important steps towards the integration and automation of RCA and potentially also other complex multi-step assays on a single-use polymer chip for molecular analysis.

AB Early stage detection of prostate cancer, one of the main causes of mortality among men, is of great importance for better treatment of the patients. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein which has been considered as the most potential serological biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer. Among the various techniques employed for PSA detection, aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) have achieved notable attention because of their unique features and great potentials as diagnostic tools. A variety of strategies such as integration of nanomaterials (NMs) into the structure of aptasensors have also been applied for enhancing the sensitivity of PSA detection. This article reviews recent advances in various optical and electrochemical aptasensors used for PSA detection.

AB Bioelectrochemical systems comprise of several types of cells, from basic microbial fuel cells (MFC) to photosynthetic MFCs and from plant MFCs to biophotovoltaics. All these cells employ bio entities at anode to produce bioenergy by catalysing organic substrates while some systems convert solar irradiation to energy. The current review epitomizes the above-mentioned fuel cell systems and elucidates their electrical performances. Microbial fuel cells have advantages over conventional fuel cells in terms of being sustainable whilst producing impressive power efficiencies without any net carbon emissions. They can be utilized for several environmentally friendly applications including wastewater treatment and bio-hydrogen generation, apart from producing clean and green electricity. Multifarious heterotrophic and autotrophic microbes and plants have been studied for their potential as imperative components of fuel cell technology. MFCs also display some interesting applications, such as integration of plant MFCs into architecture to produce "green" cities. Biophotovoltaic technology is the current hot cake in this field, which aspires to achieve significant electrical efficiencies by light-induced water splitting mechanisms. Furthermore, the utilization of BPVs in space renders it a technology for the future. Compared with other fuel cell systems, this technology is still in its inception and requires further efforts to endeavour its use on commercial or industrial level.

AB Nitrite ions (NO2-) have been widely used in the food and drink industry as preservatives. However, the NO2- discharged into the environment is harmful to the ecosystem and human health. Due to its potential toxicity, selective and sensitive detection of nitrite is important. In this work, a rose-like Au nanoparticles/MoS2 nanoflower/graphene (AuNPs/MoS2/GN) composite was fabricated using a one-pot hydrothermal method without the addition of any extra reductant for use in nitrite detection. Graphene acts as an efficient matrix for the growth of MoS2 nanoflower (NF), and the edges of the MoS2NF subsequently load AuNPs. The obtained AuNPs/MoS2/GN composite exhibits excellent electrooxidative activity toward nitrite ions, which is attributable to its large specific surface area, good conductivity, and the synergistic catalysis of each component. Accordingly, we propose a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective electrochemical method for nitrite detection, which achieved a linear dynamic range of 5.0 mu M to 5.0 mM with a detection limit of 1.0 mu M. The present work provides not only a general one-pot synthesis method for a variety of noble-transition metal dichalcogenides nanohybrids, but also an example of the fabrication of an electrochemical nitrite sensor using a nanohybrid as an enhanced material, an approach that can easily be extended to other sensors.

AB Separation and detection of hemoglobin (Hb) and glycated hemoglobin fractions (HbA1c, HbAld(1+2), HbAle, HbAld3a, HbAl(a+b), HbA2, and HbAld3b) was performed using an electrochemical AC field modulated separation channel (EMSC) coupled with a sensor probe. The sensor was fabricated based on immobilization of a redox mediator on the poly(2,2':5',5 ''-terthiophene-3'-p-benzoic acid, pTTBA) and N,S-doped porous carbon (NSPC) nanocomposite. The different types of catalytic redox mediators such as Nile Blue (NB), toluidine blue O (TBO), and Neutral Red (NR) were evaluated to achieve the efficient detection. Of these, the NB-based sensor showed the best analytical signal for Hb and HbA1c, thus it was characterized using various electrochemical and surface analysis methods. After that, the sensor was coupled with the EMSC to achieve the separation detection of the Hb family, The frequency and amplitude of the AC electrical field applied onto the EMSC walls were the main driving forces for the separation and sensitive detection of the analytes. Under optimized conditions, linear dynamic ranges for Hb and HbA1c among their fractions were obtained between 1.0 x 10(-6) to 3.5 mM and 3.0 x 10(-6) to 0.6 mM with the detection limit of 8.1 x 10(-7) +/- 3.0 x 10(-8 )and 9.2 x 10(-7 )+/- 5 x 10(-8) mM, respectively. Interference effects of other biomolecules were also investigated and the clinical applicability of the device was evaluated by the determination of total Hb and % HbA1c in real human blood samples.

AB Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are important members in the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials. The large surface-to-volume ratio, combined with the fascinating tunable electronic and optical properties, low toxicity, unique van der Waals layered structure, and engineerable surface structure, renders 2D TMDs highly valuable for next-generation biosensing applications. Herein, the recent progress in the development of 2D TMDs-based biosensors is comprehensively reviewed, with special focus on the implementation of the structural, electronic and optical properties of 2D TMDs in the realization of high-performance biosensors with different configurations for a wide spectrum of bioanalytes and bio-species. In addition, the comparison on biosensing performances with graphene as the currently most studied 2D candidate is critically discussed.

AB Maduramicin (MD) is a type of monoglycoside polyether ionophore antibiotic that can effectively treat coccidiosis and facilitate animal growth. However, its extensive and excessive use brings potential risk to human health. Herein, an electrochemical immunosensor based on indirect competitive format was fabricated for analysis of MD residue in eggs by a multiple signal amplification system. Initially, Au nanoparticles were deposited onto glassy carbon electrode surface to load the coating antigen MD-BSA and to improve conductivity. Then the signal amplification platform was constructed by encapsulating hemin into Fe-MIL-88 NH2 metal-organic frameworks (hemin@MOFs), and then the obtained composites were decorated with AuPt nanoparticles. The synthesized hemin@MOFs/AuPt was not only used as a signal amplification mediator, but also utilized as a carrier for immobilization of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated affinipure goat anti-mouse antibody (Ab(2)-HRP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The constructed hemin@MOFs/AuPt-Ab(2)-HRP bioconjugates could effectively amplify the current signal since hemin@MOFs, AuPt and HRP all exhibited high catalytic activity towards the hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the established immunosensor showed high sensitivity and stability during the detection procedure. With the synergistic catalytic effect of hemin@MOFs, AuPt and HRP, a wide detection range of 0.1-50 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.045 ng mL(-1) were achieved (S/N = 3), respectively. Ultimately, the developed method displayed excellent performance in practical applications, providing a promising probability to detect other veterinary drug residues to guarantee food safety.

AB We report a novel anode electrocatalyst, iron carbide nanoparticles dispersed in porous graphitized carbon (Nano-Fe3C@PGC), which is synthesized by facile approach involving a direct pyrolysis of ferrous gluconate and a following removal of free iron, but provides microbial fuel cells with superior performances. The physical characterizations confirm the unique configuration of iron carbide nanoparticles with porous graphitized carbon. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the as-synthesized Nano-Fe3C@PGC exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the charge transfer between bacteria and anode. Equipped with NanoFe(3)C@PGC, the microbial fuel cells based on a mixed bacterium culture yields a power density of 1856 mW m(-2). The resulting excellent performance is attributed to the large electrochemical active area and the high electronic conductivity that porous graphitized carbon provides and the enriched electrochemically active microorganisms and enhanced activity towards the redox reactions in microorganisms by Fe3C nanoparticles.

AB Albumin is a significant prognostic marker in diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. In this work, we developed a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive method for albumin detection based on the polydopamine (PDA) bi-functionalized glass chip and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tag. Anti-albumin antibodies were encapsulated on the glass chip and SERS tag through dopamine self-polymerization in alkaline conditions and the immunoaffinity was highly maintained to form the sandwich structure with the addition of target microalbuminuria. Under the optimum experimental conditions, this SERS immunoassay showed the wide linear range of 10-300 mg/L with the limit of detection of 0.2 mg/L. High specificity and selectivity of this SERS method were demonstrated by performing with some common proteins include human hemoglobin protein (Hgb) and human immunoglobulin G (IgG) in urine. This method was also applied to detect albumin in urine samples from 17 patients and 5 healthy control and the results were highly consistent with those obtained from clinical standard immunoturbidimetric method. The volume requirement of urine samples is only 2 mu L. Compared with traditional dipstick and immunoturbidimetric methods used in clinic, SERS-based method has higher accuracy, lower sensitivity and less sample consumption.

AB Leptospirosis is a critical human health problem in the tropical area, thus, a precise technique that can be used for point-of-care analysis is greatly required. This is the first report on electrochemical immunosensor based on gold-labeled monoclonal anti-LipL32 for rapid, simple and sensitive determination of LipL32. The sensor consisted of two LipL32-specific antibodies: an unlabeled capture primary antibody (Anti-1 degrees Ab) and an electrochemically detectable gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Au-2 degrees Ab). The Anti-1 degrees Ab was immobilized onto the modified screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) to form the anti-LipL32 surface. The electrochemical signal response was determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the presence of LipL32, the sensor displayed a significant increase in current response in a concentration-dependent manner, but no observable signal was detected in the absence of LipL32. The linearity between LipL32 concentration and the measured current was found in a range of 1-100 ng/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) (3SD(blank)/Slope) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (10SD(blank)/Slope) were found to be 0.28 and 0.93 ng/mL, respectively. This sensor was successfully applied to detect pathogenic Leptospira whole cell lysates samples with the satisfactory results. The promissing results suggested that this immunosensor might be an alternative tool for diagnosis of leptospirosis.

AB Up to today, in vivo studies are the gold standard for testing of new therapeutics for cutaneous wound healing. Alternative in vitro studies are mostly limited to two-dimensional cell cultures and thus only poorly reflect the complex physiological wound situation. Here we present a new three-dimensional wound model based on a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE). We introduce impedance spectroscopy as a time-resolved test method to determine the efficacy of wound healing non-destructively by focusing on the barrier function of the RHE as a main feature of intact skin. We assessed the skin barrier quantitatively and qualitatively by calculating the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), by fitting an equivalent circuit and by analyzing the single characteristic frequency. Upon wounding using a 2 mm biopsy punch, the impedance dropped significantly to 3.5% of the initial value. Impedance spectroscopy thereby proved to be a sensitive tool to distinguish between wounds of different sizes. The glucose and lactate concentration in the medium revealed an acute stress reaction of the wounded RHE (wRHE) in the first days after wounding. During monitoring of reepithelialization over fourteen days, the barrier fully recovered. Microscopy and histology images correlate well with these findings, revealing an active wound closure mostly completed by day seven after wounding. These wounded epidermal models can now be applied in therapeutic screenings and with the help of rapid screening by impedance spectroscopy, expensive and time-consuming imaging and histological methods as well as the use of animal models can be reduced.

AB Efficient manipulation of micro biological cells has always been a very important task in healthcare sector for which a Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) based impedance flow cytometry has been proven to be a promising technique. This technique utilise the advantage of dielectrophoresis (DEP) force which is generated by non-uniform electric field in a microfluidic channel using an appropriate external AC supply at certain frequency range. The DEP forces generated in micro-channel depend upon various biological and physical parameters of cell and suspending medium. Apart from that design parameters of microfluidic channel and dimension of electrodes used for generating DEP action also plays major role in micro cell/bead manipulation. This article give remarks on the operating parameters which affects the cell manipulation and interrogates the currently accepted various electrode orientations in microfluidic MEMS flow cytometer technologies for effective manipulation of micro entities like healthy human cells (T-lymphocytes, B- lymphocytes, Monocytes, Leukocytes erythrocytes and human kidney cells HEK293), animal cells (neuroblastoma N115 and sheep red blood cells), cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-435 and CD34(+)), yeast cells (saccharomyces cerevisiae, listeria innocua and E. cob) and micro particles (polystyrene beads) based on their dielectric properties using DEP action. Article focuses on the key electrode orientations for generation of non-uniform electric field in microfluidic flow cytometer like tapered electrodes, trapezoidal electrode arrays, Interdigitated electrodes, curved microelectrode and 3D electrode orientations and give remarks on their advantages and limitations. The cell manipulation with current MEMS impedance flow cytometry orientations targeting possibilities of implementation of the lab-on-chip devices has been discussed.

AB Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA are sensitive prognostic tools for monitoring disease status in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Herein, we introduce a novel and low-cost platform for capturing CTCs, the Si nanowires/microscale pyramids (NWs/MPs) hierarchical substrate, which could capture NPC cells in vitro and also detect EBV DNA at very low concentrations. In this study, Si NWs/MPs hierarchical substrates with varying wire length were fabricated using a metal-assisted chemical etching method. Anti-EpCAM antibodies were further conjugated on the substrate for capturing NPC CTCs in vitro. Capture efficiency was evaluated using immunofluorescence and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was utilized to understand cell morphology. The Si NWs/MPs substrate was also transformed into a Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate by coating with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for detection of EBV DNA by Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that Si NWs/MPs with 20 min of etch time had the best capturing performance. Additionally, SEM observations revealed good contact of CTCs with Si NWs/MPs substrates. Moreover, the AgNPs-coated NWs/MPs substrate was shown to be a sensitive EBV DNA detector, by which the DNA detection limit can reach up to 10(-13)M. In conclusion, the Si NWs/MPs platform not only exhibits superior cell capturing ability, but also can sensitively detect EBV DNA at very low concentrations. This platform has great potential to become a promising diagnostic tool for monitoring disease status and prognostication of NPC patients.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness that affects the elderly population worldwide. The definite diagnosis of AD still depends on post-mortem pathological examination of amyloid plaques consisting of amyliod-beta peptides (A beta) fibrils in the brain so far. However, these fibrils are not closely linked to the development of the disease. Alternatively, soluble A beta are believed to be more reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we report a simple approach to quantitative detection of soluble A beta species using N-(6-(benzothiazol-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamide (BPNS) as a ratiometric fluorescence Zn2+ probe. This ratiometric fluorescence assay is based on the competition of soluble A beta with BPNS for Zn2+, that is, soluble A beta species with higher chelation affinity can capture Zn2+ from BPNS-Zn2+ adduct, thereby reactivating the ratiometric fluorescence response of BPNS. BPNS exhibited perfect linear relationship (R-2 = 0.998) in accordance with the concentration of soluble A beta in the presence of Zn (2+). The assay possesses strong anti-interference capacity against exogenous agent or the other proteins, thanks to the high selectivity for soluble A beta species. Importantly, this assay can quantitatively detect soluble A beta species from different types of biological fluids, such as artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), serum, and plasma in half an hour. This assay provides a low-cost, fast, sensitive, and simple approach for quantitative detection of soluble A beta species and may serve as a potential tool for early-stage AD diagnosis.

AB We propose herein an immobilization-free, split-mode cathodic photoelectrochemical (PEC) strategy coupled with a cascaded amplification for versatile biosensing. Taking DNA and microRNA (miRNA) as the model targets, the hybridization between the targets and the hairpin probe triggers the digestion of the probe DNA by T7 exonuclease (T7 Exo), thus to generate G-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences, and then the released targets (DNA or miRNA) initiate the subsequent cycling processes and generate a large amount of G4 forming sequences. Subsequently, the formed G4 sequences associate with hemin to form the G4/hemin DNAzyme, which catalytically produces 1,4-bezoquinone (BQ) for conjugating onto the surface of the chitosan (CS) deposited BiOI/ITO photocathode via the quinone-chitosan conjugation chemistry (QCCC). Under photo excitation, the covalently attached quinones can act as electron acceptors of bismuth oxyiodine (BiOI), promoting the photocurrent generation and thus allowing the elegant and "signal-on" mode for probing targets of interest. Highly sensitive and selective PEC bioassays are readily realized, with the detection limits down to 2.2 fM (for DNA) and 0.2 fM (for miRNA). Since no labeling and no electrode modification processes are needed, this split-mode PEC biosensing strategy is amenable to convenient, time/labor saving, and high-throughput detections. More significantly, it provides a novel concept to design immobilization-free and label-free cathodic PEC biosensing systems, and showcases promise in general and versatile bioanalysis research.

AB In this paper, a novel label-free electrochemical impedance aptasensor for highly sensitive detection of IFN-gamma based on target-induced exonuclease inhibition was constructed. For this purpose, we designed a DNA hairpin modified on the gold electrode whose loop was the aptamer of the IFN-gamma, and the stem was 5'-thiol-modified. In the absence of IFN-gamma, Exonuclease III (Exo III) and Exonuclease I (Exo I) digested the double-stranded and single-stranded strands of the hairpin DNA, respectively, causing smaller impedance value on the surface of the electrode. In the presence of IFN-gamma, the function of Exo III was greatly inhibited by the binding of the aptamer with the target, and it stopped after cutting three bases of the hairpin DNA. Forming a major target-bound aptamer digestion product, it could not be digested by Exo I, so there was larger impedance on the electrode surface. The calibration curve for IFN-gamma was linear in the range of 1 pM-50 nM with the detection limit (LOD) of 0.7 pM. The proposed aptasensor proved good selectivity and reproducibility, and low cost. In addition, the biosensor was able to detect IFN-gamma in serum samples successfully, which is expected to provide an efficient method for TB diagnosis at early stages.

AB In this work, a metallic composite with strong electrocatalytic property was designed by uniformly decorating Pt and Sn nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 nanorods (Pt-Sn@TiO2). A detection scheme was then developed based on a dual signal amplification strategy involving the Pt-Sn@TiO2 composite and exonuclease assisted target recycling. The Pt-Sn@TiO2 composite exhibited an enhanced oxygen reduction current owing to the synergistic effect between Pt and Sn, as well as high exposure of Pt (111) crystal face. Initially, a Pt-Sn@TiO2 modified glassy carbon electrode produced an amplified electrochemical signal for the reduction of dissolved oxygen in the analyte solution. Next, a DNA with a complementary sequence to a streptomycin aptamer (cDNA) was immobilised on the Pt-Sn@TiO2 modified electrode, followed by the streptomycin aptamer that hybridised with cDNA. The corresponding oxygen reduction current was diminished by 51% attributable to the hindrance from the biomolecules. After a mixture of streptomycin and RecJ(f )exonuclease was introduced, both the streptomycin-aptamer complex and the cDNA were cleaved from the electrode, making the Pt-Sn and Pt (111) surface available for oxygen reduction. RecJ(f) would also release streptomycin from the streptomycin-aptamer complex, allowing it to complex again with aptamers on the electrode. This has then promoted a cyclic amplification of the oxygen reduction current by 85%, which is quantitatively related to streptomycin. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor exhibited a linear range of 0.05-1500 nM and a limit of detection of 0.02 +/- 0.0045 nM streptomycin. The sensor was then used in the real-life sample detection of streptomycin to demonstrate its potential applications to bioanalysis.

AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing has emerged as a simple and practical method for the analysis and detection, its separated optical signal and detection electrical signal give it the advantages of reduced background noise and outstanding sensitivity. Here, we synthesized a Ti3C2/Cu2O composite through simple oil bath heating process, whose excellent PEC performance and sensitive photoelectric response to glucose make it a propitious substitution to glucose oxidase. On this basis, we construct a PEC non-enzymatic sensor based on the Ti3C2/Cu2O heterostructure for the detection of glucose. Under the optimal conditions, the photocurrent of Ti3C2/Cu2O is linear with the logarithm value of glucose concentration in the wide range of 0.5 nM to 0.5 mM with a detection limit of 0.17 nM. Furthermore, the successful detection of glucose in standard samples and human serum by the proposed Ti3C2/Cu2O based PEC non-enzymatic sensor demonstrates the application prospect of heterostructure material in PEC sensor, which provides a new thought for the design and construction of PEC non-enzymatic sensing platform.

AB The monitoring of transcription factors (TFs) is critical for understanding the regulation of gene transcriptions. Here, by programming nucleic acid sequence-based and cascaded recycling amplifications, we developed a sensitive and non-label electrochemical biosensor for detecting TFs from tumor cell extracts. The binding of the target nuclear factor-kappa B p50 (NF-kappa B p50) with the dsDNA probes protects them from being digested by exonuclease III for subsequent initiation of three cascaded recycling cycles, which causes the generation of tremendous free G-quadruplex special sequences on the sensing electrode. Such G-quadruplexes can specifically bind and confine hemin within the vicinity of the sensor, generating substantially enhanced reduction current to achieve determination of NF-kappa B p50 within the range from 0.5 pM to 5 nM with the detection limit down to 0.13 pM. The proposed sensing system also has high selectivity and it can be used to interrogate the presence of NF-kappa B p50 in tumor cell extracts, demonstrating its potential for disease diagnosis and gene transcription-related studies.

AB This work reported a ternary quenching strategy based on electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) between luminol/H(2)O(2 )system and MnO2 capped carbon nanospheres (MnO2@C) and Mn2+ released from the reduction of MnO2 and ascorbic acid (AA) consumed superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) for detection of insulin. To improve the ECL behavior of luminol, AuPdPt hybrid nanoparticles decorated MoS2 nanosheet-coated TiO2 nanobelt (AuPdPt-MoS2@TiO2) were applied to combine with luminol and primary antibodies via covalent linkage which exhibited perfectly catalysis for the electroreduction of H2O2. In order to sensitively detect insulin, labels Mn0 2 @C were used to anchor secondary antibodies via electrostatic interaction and inhibit the ECL intensity of luminol. The perfect overlap of the ECL spectrum of luminol with the absorption spectrum of MnO2 allowed the ECL-RET to decrease ECL signals of luminol. Specifically, AA was introduced not only to inhibit the ECL of luminol, but also to reduce MnO2 producing Mn2+ which can be reacted with O-2(center dot-) to further quench the ECL reaction between luminol and H2O2. On the basis of the dual quenching effect of luminol, the sandwich immunosensor was prepared to determine insulin with wide linear range from 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 60 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.13 pg mL(-1) (S/N =3).

AB Telomerase has been regarded as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis as well as the clinical treatment and the reliable detection of intracellular telomerase activity is of great significance. By developing a telomere elongation-based DNA-catalytic amplification strategy, a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method is proposed for the assay of telomerase activity. In the presence of telomerase and nucleotide mixture dNTPs, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer extended and generated a long single-strand DNA (ssDNA) containing the telomere repeat units (TTAGGG)n, which could catalyze the entropy-driven circuit reaction (EDCR). One of the products of EDCR was ingeniously used as the catalyst of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) occured on magnetic beads (MBs). As a result, a large amount of ROX-labeled Raman probes could be anchored on the surface of MBs and used for SERS detection. Using this strategy, the assay can detect telomerase activity from cell extracts equivalent down to single HeLa cell.

AB In this work, an antifouling electrochemiluminescent (ECL) ratiometric biosensor is designed for the accurate, selective and sensitive detection of DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity based on a dual-signaling strategy. Briefly, an ITO electrode is used to construct the anti-fouling interfaces with the modification of polyaniline (PANI), AuNPs and peptide. Hairpin DNA molecules containing the symmetric sequence of 5'-CATC-3' are attached onto the modified ITO electrode and the ds-DNA can be cut off in the presence of Dam MTase and DpnI. The residual DNA and two hairpin DNA could lead to the extension of ds-DNA due to the Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR). ECL signal is amplified significantly with the insertion of PTC-NH2 molecules into the dsDNA grooves. The ECLPTC-NH2/ECLAu@Luminol is found in a logarithmic linear relation with the concentration of Dam MTase. Moreover, owing to the presence of antifouling peptide on the sensing interface, the ECL biosensor was capable of sensing MTase activity in complex biological media, such as FBS samples and human serum with significantly reduced nonspecific adsorption effect. Assaying Dam MTase in complex sample mixture containing 5% calf serum and 5% human serum further proved the feasibility of this ECL biosensor for early clinical diagnosis.

AB Abnormal expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in living organisms is closely associated with tumor-igenesis. However, few reported fluorescence probes can specifically respond to abnormal concentration of GGT. Here, by functionalizing triarylboron moiety with three GGT-specific substrate (GSH) units, a novel fluorescence probe, TAB-3-GSH, was developed for detecting GGT. The results showed that TAB-3-GSH selectively responds to abnormally high levels of GGT (100-1000 U/L) rather than to normal GGT levels ( < 100 U/L) with ratiometric readout, since the amide linkage can be further hydrolyzed under high GGT levels. TAB-3-GSH was also capable of differentiating GGT-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells from normal cells, because of an improvement in the probe's cell membrane permeability upon reaction with GGT. Moreover, the probe could achieve selective imaging of SKOV-3 tumor site in xenograft mice model. Thus, TAB-3-GSH is a promising probe for tumor targeting in vivo.

AB Electrochemical detection of specific nucleic acid sequence remains a hot topic in current bioanalytical research. Here, a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensor based on Exo III-assisted recycling amplification and graphene-modified electrode was fabricated for quantitative detection of trinucleotide repeat sequence d(CAG)(n). The double-signals used are the hairpin DNAs labeled with ferrocene and methylene blue respectively as report DNAs, which can hybridize to target DNA. The hybridized DNA was digested by Exo III, resulting in the release of target and report fragments. The graphene-modified electrode can selectively adsorb the released report fragments to generate double electrochemical signals. The signal ratio (F/M) of ferrocene and methylene blue was used to determine the repeat length accurately: a linear relationship was found between F/M and numbers of repeats (n), F/M = 0.061 n + 1.97, with a correlation coefficient of 0.992. Moreover, any electrochemical signal can be used to test repeat concentration with detection limit of 0.22 pM. Therefore, this novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensor provided a reliable and efficient method for the analysis of d(CAG)(n) trinucleotide repeat and a potential simplified clinical tool for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB Saccharide sensors represent a broad research area in the scope of sensing devices and their involvement in the medical diagnosis field is particularly relevant for cancer detection at early stage. In that context, we present a non-enzymatic optical fiber-based sensor that makes use of plasmon-assisted tilted fiber Bragg gratings (TFBGs) functionalized for D-glucose biosensing through polydopamine (PDA)-immobilized concanavalin A (Con A). Our probe allows a live and accurate monitoring of the PDA layer deposition leading improved surface biochemistry. The SPR shift observed was assessed to 3.83 +/- 0.05 nm within 20 min for a 2 mg/mL dopamine solution. Tests performed in different D-Glucose solutions have revealed a limit of detection close to 10(-7) M with the highest sensitivity in the 10(-6) to 10(-4) M range. This configuration has the capability to overcome the limitations of current enzyme-based solutions.

AB In this protocol, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor based on methylene blue (MB) sensitized fullerene (C-60) was designed for ultrasensitive DNA detection. First, C-60 nanoparticles (C-60 NPs) as photoactive material was modified on the electrode surface to obtain an initial photocurrent signal. Additionally, the nicking endonuclease (Nb.BvCI enzyme)-assisted signal amplification strategy was implemented to transform limited target to plenty of products, which hybridized with DNA2 to form plentiful DNA duplex for immobilizing numerous MB as the sensitizer, thus accomplishing the effective sensitization toward C-60 NPs and achieving an enhanced photo-current for quantitatively detecting target DNA. This established PEC strategy realized the target DNA detection with the detection limit down to 3.3 fM, which paved a new avenue for DNA determination and exhibited huge application potential for other biomarkers in clinical analysis and disease diagnosis.

AB Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is a typical initiator for base excision repair (BER) process. Since aberrant expression of UDG is relevant to a variety of cancers, analysis of UDG activity with high sensitivity and accuracy is of great importance. We reported herein a sensitive and reliable dual-signal bioassay for UDG activity by coupling photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) strategies in one probe electrode. The Au/TiO2 hybrid was used as a matrix to immobilize substrate DNA (sDNA), which modified with AgInS2 quantum dot (AIS QD) on the terminal. When UDG exist, the base of uracil was eliminated from the sDNA, and the produced apyrimidinic (AP) site could be cleaved by endonuclease IV (Endo. IV) immediately. Under this situation, the PEC labels of AIS QDs were detached from the electrode, resulting in a "signal-off" trend for PEC signal. After assistant DNA (aDNA) was then assembled, the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was triggered, and EC labels of ferrocene molecules were introduced, producing a "signal-on" trend for EC signal. Besides, as the produced long double-stranded DNA by the HCR had evident steric hindrance, the PEC signal further decreased. Based on this meticulous design, the dual-signal bioassay for UDG activity showed low detection limits of 4.3 x 10(-5) and 1.9 x 10(-4) U/mL with PEC and EC detection, and accurate analysis of UDG activity in living cells was realized. By just changing the recognition site, this sensitive and reliable dual-signal strategy can be extended to diagnose other DNA repair-related enzymes in the real samples.

AB Medically, the dynamic change of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration has been an important indicator for monitoring and diagnosing tumors. The sensitive and early detection of CEA plays a momentous role in the prevention and diagnosis of cancer and the evaluation of treatment efficiency. In this work, a sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for the quantitative detection of CEA. The trimetallic yolk-shell Au@AgPt nanocubes (Au@AgPt YNCs) loaded on amino-functionalized MoS2 nanoflowers (MoS2 NFs/Au@AgPt YNCs) were used as the labels to conjugate with secondary antibodies. The Au@AgPt YNCs with internal space and permeable shell improved catalytic active surface area. The nanosheet-based MoS2 NFs with good catalytic activity were used as carriers to load Au@AgPt YNCs effectively. Due to the biphasic synergistic catalysis, MoS2 NFs/Au@AgPt YNCs catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 effectually to amplify the current signal. Besides, Au triangular nanoprisms (Au TNPs) were used as substrate material to increase the effective contact areas with the surface of electrode and accelerate the interface electron transfer. Under the optimal conditions, a broad linear range from 10 fg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1 )with low detection limit of 3.09 fg mL(-1)(S/N = 3) for detecting CEA was obtained. Moreover, the detection results of the human serum samples were satisfactory, indicating the fabricated immunosensor had potential application values in the early clinical analysis.

AB Abnormal level of serotonin (ST) in body fluids is related to various clinical conditions including behavioral and psychotic disorders; hence its fast detection in clinically relevant ranges have tremendous importance in medical science. In view of this, we have developed a novel biosensor for ST detection using Au-nanorattles (AuNRTs)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite coated on to the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) deposited glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The nanocomposite/sensor probe was characterized using UV-Vis, TEM, SAED, EDX, AFM, and electrochemical techniques including LSV and EIS. Thereafter, the suitability of fabricated GCE/AuNPs/AuNRTs-rGO-Naf sensor probe was applied for ST determination which showed a linear dynamic range (LDR) of 3 x 10(-6) - 1 x 10(-3) M and the detection limit (DL) of 3.87 ( +/- 0.02) x 10(-7) (RSD < 4.2%) M, which falls in the ranges of normal as well as various abnormal pathophysiological conditions. The designed sensor is successfully applied to detect ST in various real matrices viz. urine, blood serum, and in vitro model to show its direct clinical/practical applicability. Interferences due to the coexisting molecules were assessed and the long-term stability of the designed sensor was also examined which was found to be 8 weeks.

AB In this work, a modification procedure for the functionalization of silicon nanowire (SiNW) is applied in biological field effect transistor (BioFET) system. The proposed method precedes the silanization reaction in a manner that the only SiNW and not its SiO2 substrate is functionalized by (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) initiators. This method has an effective role in increasing the sensitivity of BioFET sensors and can be applied in commercial ones. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient computational technique to estimate unknown senor parameters. To that end, Bayesian inversion is used to determine the number of PSA target molecules bound to the receptors in both selective and nonselective SiNWs. The approach is coupled with the Poisson-Boltzmann-drift-diffusion (PBDD) equations to provide a comprehensive system to model all biosensor interactions.

AB Recent developments in microfluidics enable the lab-on-a-chip-based molecular diagnosis. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases is critical for preventing the transmission of the disease. Here, we characterize a Lamb wave-based device using various parameters including the contact angle and viscosity of the sample droplet, the applied voltage, and the temperature increase. Additionally, we demonstrate the functionality of the Lamb wave-based device in clinical application. Optimal temperature for rolling circle amplification (RCA) process is 30 degrees C, and it was achieved by Lamb wave generation at 17 V. Gene amplification due to RCA process could be detected by viscosity increase due to DNA hydrogel formation in a sample droplet, which induced the acoustic streaming velocity of suspended particles to be decreased. In our Lamb wave-based device, isothermal amplification of target nucleic acids could be successfully detected within 30 min using 10 mu L of sessile droplet, and was validated by comparing that of commercial real-time fluorescence analysis. Our device enables simple and low-cost molecular diagnosis, which can be applied to resource-limited clinical settings.

AB Some of microorganisms are potential pathogens that can be infectious agents under some circumstances, and development of new detection methods of the pathogens is of high interest. In the present study, an Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) DNA biosensor (ef-biosensor) was fabricated to quantify the bacterium genome. A specific E. faecalis DNA probe was selected from 16S rRNA sequence of E. faecalis and immobilized on a gold electrode surface in an optimized time to fabricate the ef-biosensor. The ef-biosensor detected a synthetic target of the probe with a detection limit of 3.3 amol L-1 and with a nice selectivity to resolve from one-, two- and three-base mismatched sequences. In addition, the bacterium genomic DNA was quantified with a detection limit of 7.1 x 10(-9) ng mL(-1) a concentration range of 1.1 x 10(-7) to 1.1 ng mL(-1). The ef-biosensor had a long time stability, good fabrication reproducibility and good regeneration ability. The ef-biosensor was successfully applied for E. faecalis detection in human samples.

AB Due to robustness, easy large-scale preparation and low cost, nanomaterials with enzyme-like characteristics (defined as 'nanozymes') are attracting increasing interest for various applications. However, most of currently developed nanozymes show much lower activity in comparison with natural enzymes, and the deficiency greatly hinders their use in sensing and biomedicine. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer the unique feature of maximum atomic utilization, providing a potential pathway to improve the catalytic activity of nanozymes. Herein, we propose a Fe-N-C single-atom nanozyme (SAN) that exhibits unprecedented peroxidase-mimicking activity. The SAN consists of atomically dispersed Fe-N-x moieties hosted by metal-organic frameworks (MOF) derived porous carbon. Thanks to the 100% single-atom active Fe dispersion and the large surface area of the porous support, the Fe-N-C SAN provided a specific activity of 57.76 U mg(-1), which was almost at the same level as natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Attractively, the SAN presented much better storage stability and robustness against harsh environments. As a proof-of-concept application, highly sensitive biosensing of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity using the Fe-N-C SAN as a substitute for natural HRP was further verified.

Comparing the intensities between two neighboring wavelength bands near the SPR wavelength, the signal-to-noise ratio for biosensing applications obtained using the proposed method is found to be ten times higher than that obtained by conventional intensity analysis and 1.6 times better than that obtained by peak-wavelength fitting. The dynamic range and linearity of the refractive index are comparable to the peak-wavelength shift measurement. Based on the detection method, a spectral modulation system for the optical microscope is developed, combined with a gold-capped nanowire array, to measure the biointeractions in microfluidic devices. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtained multiple detections with a detection limit of 1.04 x 10(-5) refractive index units. Two types of analysis methods for SPR images are used to study the protein-antibody interactions. The region-of-interest analysis supports multiplexing detections in a compact microfluidic sensor. The effective pixel analysis eliminates low-response pixels and enhances the signalto-noise ratios for sensitive label-free detection.

AB We demonstrate a bionanoelectronic platform for a supported lipid bilayer formed on an MoS(2 )film for biosensing, biomolecule recognition, and bioelectronic applications. A large-area MoS2  film was synthesized on a sapphire substrate and treated with O-2 plasma or Al2O3 deposition to change the surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Measurements of fluorescence and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching confirmed the physical properties of the lipid bilayer on the treated surfaces. We fabricated an electronic device using the treated MoS(2 )film and characterized the influence of the lipid bilayer on its electrical properties. Furthermore, transmembrane ion channels peptide (gramicidin A) were incorporated into the lipid bilayer and modulations of the electrical properties of the device under various pH conditions and calcium ion were observed. This sensitive and stable platform has strong potential for housing artificial channels and transmembrane ion channels for advanced bioapplications.

AB The present work reports cocoon silk fibroin (SF)as a unique precursor for the in-situ fabrication of well-engineered, stable and leach free gold nanoparticle doped carbonaceous materials (AuNPs@NSC). In principle, at the molecular level, SF has a singular structure that can be converted to a N-doped aromatic carbon structure by heat treatment. The electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposite were examined by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. A flexible three electrode sensor system with AuNPs@NSC-modified working electrodes has been developed, to achieve easy operation and quick and accurate responses. The electrochemical results showed that the sensor made by the AuNPs@NSC-modified working electrode demonstrated high sensitivity for the detection of rutin, which is attributed to the good distribution of the AuNPs on the carbon matrix. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the AuNPs@NSC electrode was found to have a linear response in the range of 0.11-250 mu M and a comparably low limit of detection of 0.02 mu M (S/N = 3). To ensure the accuracy and applicability of the sensors, the concentration of rutin in the commodity (rutin capsule, 10 mg/capsule) was examined, and the sensor provided high precision with a minimum relative error (RE) of 3.3%. These findings suggest that AuNPs@NSC can be considered to be a potential electrode material for the development of electrochemical devices and has great potential in extending their application to the flexible sensor field.

AB We report the fabrication of polyaniline nanofiber (PANI)-modified screen-printed electrode (PANI/SPE) incorporated in a poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel for the detection of circulating tumor cells. We employed this device to detect melanoma skin cancer cells through specific immunogenic binding of cell surface biomarker melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) to anti-MC1R antibody. The antibody-functionalized PANI/SPE was used in batch-continuous flow-through fashion. An aqueous cell suspension of ferri/ferrocyanide at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min was passed over the immunosensor, which allowed for continuous electrochemical measurements. The sensor performed exceptionally well affording an ultralow limit of quantification of 1 melanoma cell/mL, both in buffer and when mixed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the response was log-linear over the range of 10-9000 melanoma cells/10 mL.

AB In this work, we provided a novel strategy of antibody-free biomarker analysis by in-situ synthesized molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) on movable valve microfluidic paper-based electrochemical device (Bio-MIP-ePADs) for clinical detection of biomarkers. The newly movable valves on the device enable continuous and convenient delivery of fluid, which guarantee the performance for fabricating MIPs structure during long time electro-polymerization. Moreover, this strategy can directly detect antigens by taking advantage of molecular imprinting on paper-based device, which greatly decreases the cost during clinical testing, reduces the tedious washing procedure and does not need to consider the preservation of the antibody in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This feature makes the chip suitable for the on-site family treatment or commercial products. To further validate the applicability of this proposed method for clinical diagnostic testing, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was applied as prototyping model target for the clinical analysis. The proposed Bio-MIP-ePADs were cheap, easy to prepare, disposable and provided reliable analysis by comparing with ELISA. We hope the application of this technology will open up a new avenue to the point-of-care testing (POCT).

AB The development of real-time online warning system for toxicity materials is important to ensure the safety of water supply. This study for the first time constructs luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) biofilm to deliver both electrical and optical real-time response for Cu(II) toxic shock in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) sensor. Compared to biocathode, bioanode was more suitable as sensitive elements. With three tested concentrations of Cu(II), i.e., 1 mg/L, 3 mg/L and 6 mg/L, electrical signals were raised. But optical signal failed to respond to the lowest concentration, suggesting that electrical signal then was produced by chemical reaction of Cu(II) on the electrode surface. For 3 mg/L and 6 mg/L Cu(II) shock, more rapid optical signals were observed than electrical signal, indicating that both the biofilm's surface and inner was affected. In addition, high concentration of Cu(II) toxic as 6 mg/L caused irreversible damage in the biosensor as there were great fluctuation in the recovery curve and large recovery ratio up to -10.39% for optical signal. These results provided a comparison between optical and electrical signals simultaneously produced by a biosensor and visual evidences for better understanding of the toxicity process in the biosensor.

AB DNA polymerase catalyzes the replication of DNA, one of the key steps in cell division. The control and understanding of this reaction owns great potential for the fundamental study of DNA-enzyme interactions. In this context, we developed a label-free microfluidic biosensor platform based on the principle of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to detect the DNA-polymerase reaction in real-time. Our microfluidic LSPR chip integrates a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel bonded with a nanoplasmonic substrate, which consists of densely packed mushroom-like nanostructures with silicon dioxide stems ((similar to)40 nm) and gold caps ((similar to)22 nm), with an average spacing of 19 nm. The LSPR chip was functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template (T30), spaced with hexanedithiol (HDT) in a molar ratio of 1:1. The DNA primer (P8) was then attached to T30, and the second strand was subsequently elongated by DNA polymerase assembling nucleotides from the surrounding fluid. All reaction steps were detected in-situ inside the microfluidic LSPR chip, at room temperature, in real-time, and label-free. In addition, the sensor response was successfully correlated with the amount of DNA and HDT molecules immobilized on the LSPR sensor surface.

AB A label-free, non-dispruptive, and real-time analytical device to monitor the dynamic features of biomolecules and their interactions with neighboring molecules is an essential prerequisite for biochip- and diagonostic assays. To explore one of the central questions on the lipid-lipid interactions in the course of the liquid-ordered (l(o)) domain formation, called rafts, we developed a method of reconstituting continuous but spatially heterogeneous lipid membrane platforms with molayer-bilayer juntions (MBJs) that enable to form the l(o) domains in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. This allows us to detect the time-lapse dynamics of the lipid-lipid interactions during raft formation and resultant membrane phase changes together with the raft-associated receptor-ligand binding through the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). For cross-validation, using epifluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated the underlying mechanisms for raft formations that the infiltration of cholesterols into the sphingolipid-enriched domains plays a crucial roles in the membrane phase-separation. Our membrane platform, being capable of monitoring dynamic interactions among lipids and performing the systematic optical analysis, will unveil physiological roles of cholesterols in a variety of biological events.

AB Monitoring cell viability and proliferation in real-time provides a more comprehensive picture of the changes cells undergo during their lifecycle than can be achieved using traditional end-point assays. Particularly for drug screening applications, high-temporal resolution cell viability data could inform decisions on drug application protocols that might lead to better treatment outcomes. We describe a CMOS biosensor that monitors cell viability through high-resolution capacitance measurements of cell adhesion quality. The system consists of a 3 x 3 mm(2) chip with an array of 16 sensors, on-chip digitization, and serial data output that can be interfaced with inexpensive off-the-shelf components. An imaging system was developed to provide ground-truth data of cell coverage concurrently with data recordings. Results showed the sensor's ability to detect single-cell binding events, track cell morphology changes, and monitor cell motility. A chemotherapeutic assay was conducted to examine dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cell lines. Concentrations higher than 5 mu M elicited cytotoxic effects on both cell lines, while a dose of 1 mu M allowed discrimination of the two cell types. The system demonstrates the use of real-time capacitance measurements as a proof-of-concept tool that has potential to hasten the drug development process.

AB The development of cost-effective and rapid assays for the accurate counting of CD4 cells has remained prime focus for disease management. The lack of such assays has severely affected people living in resource-limited disease prevalent areas. CD4 count information plays a vital role in the effective management of HIV disease. There is an unmet need to develop rapid, cost-effective, portable and user-friendly point-of-care (POC) disease diagnostic platform technology for CD4(+) T cell counting. Here, we have developed a flow-free magnetic actuation platform that uses antibody-coated magnetic beads to efficiently capture CD4(+) T cells from a 30 mu L drop of whole blood. On-chip cell lysate electrical impedance spectroscopy has been utilized to quantify the isolated CD4 cells. The developed assay has a limit of detection of 25 cells per mu L and provides accurate CD4 counts in the range of 25-800 cells per mu L. The whole immunoassay along with the enumeration process is very rapid and provides CD4 quantification results within 5 min time frame. The assay does not require off-chip sample preparation steps and minimizes human involvement to a greater extent. The developed impedance-based immunoassay has potential to significantly improve the CD4 enumeration process especially for POC settings.

AB The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) causes several infections acquired in a healthcare setting. During initial stages of infection, Pa produces redox-active phenazine metabolites, including pyocyanin (PYO), 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MCA), and 1-hydroxyphenazine (OHPHZ), which have toxic effects on surrounding host cells and/or other microbes. Rapid and sensitive detection of these metabolites provides important evidence about the onset of Pa infections. Herein, we investigate differences in Pa phenazine production and dynamics in polymicrobial communities. Specifically, Pa was co-cultured with two pathogens of clinical relevance, Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Escherichia coli (Ec), which typically populate infection sites with Pa. Phenazine production rates and biosynthesis dynamics were electrochemically monitored during a 48-h period using recently developed transparent carbon ultramicroelectrode arrays (T-CUAs). Moreover, the effect on phenazine production rates and dynamics was explored in two growth media, lysogeny broth (LB) and tryptic soy broth (TSB). The concentrations of PYO and highly reactive 5-MCA were determined in different polymicrobial culture samples in both media. The results demonstrate that other bacterial pathogens noticeably influence Pa phenazine production and dynamics. In particular, Sa caused a decrease in phenazine production in TSB. However, the presence of Ec in polymicrobial samples drastically inhibited phenazine production rates in both LB and TSB. Conclusively, the media type significantly influences phenazine product distribution, especially in polymicrobial co-cultures, signifying the need for analytical standardization of simulation media in the study of polymicrobial communities.

AB A novel photoelectrochemical biosensor was fabricated for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) detection based on the photocurrent inhibition effect of ZnO on MoS2/C3N4 heterojunction. Firstly, the ITO electrode was modified successively with MoS2 and g-C3N4 as photoelectric materials to deliver a strong photocurrent response. Next, the 5-hydroxymethyl group (-CH2 OH) of 5hmC was oxidized by KRuO4 to produce an aldehyde group (-CHO), where 5hmC was converted into 5-formylcytosine (5fC). Based on the covalent reaction with between -CHO of 5fC and -NH2 groups of g-C3N4, 5fC can be captured on electrode surface. Finally, the ZnO-PAMAM composite was covalently attached to the phosphate group of the immobilized 5fC, which could decrease the electron transfer amount of g-C(3)N(4 )to MoS2, absorption of light and consumption of electron donors thereby resulting the decrease of photocurrent. Under optimal conditions, the photocurrent shows a linear relationship with the logarithm value of 5hmC concentration from 0.01-200 nM with a low detection limit of 2.6 pM. Moreover, this method was selective and allowed to discriminate between 5hmC and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA. Finally, the photoelectrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to investigate the effect of heavy metal ion and phytohormones on 5hmC expression in rice seedlings leaves.

AB The sensitive and accurate detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is critical for myocardial infarction diagnosis. In this work, a dual-aptamer-based electrochemical (EC) biosensor was designed for cTnI detection based on the DNA nanotetrahedron (NTH) capture probes and multifunctional hybrid nanoprobes. First, the NTH-based Tro4 aptamer probes were anchored on a screen printed gold electrode (SPGE) surface through the Au-S bond, providing an enhanced spatial dimension and accessibility for capturing cTnI. Then, the hybrid nanoprobes were fabricated by using magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as nanocarriers to load a large amount of cTnl-specific Tro6 aptamer, natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), HRP-mimicking Au@Pt nanozymes and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme. This signaling nanoprobes are capable of specifically recognizing the target cTnI based on the Tro6 aptamer and amplifying the signals to improve the detection sensitivity via enzymatic processes. We found the remarkable enhanced effect of EC signal to be attributed to the co-catalysis effect of hybrid nanozymes, HRP and DNAzyme. The target cTnI was sandwiched between the two types of aptamers (Tro4 and Tro6) on the electrode interface. Finally, this EC aptasensing platform exhibited great analytical performance with a wide dynamic range of 0.01-100 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 7.5 pg mL(-1) for cTnI. The high selectivity, sensitivity and reliability of EC aptasensor can provide great potential in the clinic disease diagnostics.

AB This work presents a novel hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of diazinon (DZN) with excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency. It was the first time that h-BN based materials were applied to PEC aptasensor, in which the construction of Z-scheme heterojunction of h-BN and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) via doping sulfur into h-BN was innovatively proposed. Meanwhile, Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were utilized for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and the formation of new recombination centers. The charge transfer mechanism was expounded and verified by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trap technique. The proposed PEC aptasensor for determination of DZN exhibited a wide linear range from 0.01 to 10000 nM and a low detection limit of 6.8 pM with superb selectivity and remarkable stability. Moreover, the constructed PEC aptasensor performed well with excellent recoveries in three different real samples. This work illustrated that PEC aptasensor is a promising alternative to conventional analytical technologies for the detection of DZN and other organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The designing ideas of the proposed h-BN based material can provide a foothold for the innovative construction of photoactive materials for PEC bioanalysis.

AB Nowadays, nanomaterials with enzymatic properties have aroused wide interest because of their special advantages, such as catalytic activity, simple preparation method and high stability. We introduced new nanoenzymes to a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) detection. In this study, PtPd nanocubes@MoS2 nanoenzymes (PtPd NCs@MoS2) were prepared by loading PtPd nanocubes (PtPd NCs) on molybdenum disulfide nano-sheet (MoS2) through in situ redox polymerization. The prepared nanoenzymes exhibited enhanced peroxidase-like activity than separate MoS2 and PtPd NCs. The catalytic process of PtPd NCs@MoS2 is in agreement with the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation. PtPd NCs@MoS2 were used for sensitive detection of HBs Ag, which is ascribed to their superior peroxidase activity, good conductivity and high specific surface area and synergistic amplification for current signals. Compared with the detection limit of colorimetric method (3.3 pg/mL), the electrochemical method (10.2 fg/mL) shows a lower detection limit and a wider linear range from 32 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL, so it is more suitable for quantitative analysis of Hepatitis B. In summary, the prepared immunosensor provides a better opportunity for early diagnosis of Hepatitis B and also has further applications in biosensing and medical diagnostics.

AB Lowering the limit of detection is key to the design of sensors. Conventional transducers generate a signal proportional to the concentration of the molecule, but low concentrations are still difficult to detect with confidence.
   Here we present an inverse sensor that induces a signal that is larger when the target molecule is less concentrated. Each sensor consists of a micro-pot reactor with an inner volume for storing the reactants and the cage walls, over which many silver hotspots are spread, working as optical antenna to produce amplification of the signal.
   The aim is to attain inverse sensitivity during the enzymatic reaction, where reduction of the silver occurs.
   We demonstrate the sensitivity and robustness of this approach by detecting glucose concentrations down to 10(-12) M.

AB C-reactive protein (CRP) is considered a promising biomarker for the rapid and high-throughput real-time monitoring of cardiovascular disease and inflammation in unprocessed clinical samples. Implementation of this monitoring would enable various transformative biomedical applications. We have fabricated a highly specific sensor chip to detect CRP with a detection limit of 2.25 fg/mL. The protein was immobilized on top of a gold (Au) wire/polycarbonate (PC) substrate using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxy succinimide-activated 3-mercaptoproponic acid (MPA) as a self-assembled monolayer agent and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a blocking agent. In contrast to the bare PC substrate, the CRP/BSA/anti-CRP/MPA/Au substrate exhibited a considerably high electrochemical signal toward CRP. The influence of the experimental parameters on CRP detection was assessed via various analysis methods, and these parameters were then optimized. The linear dynamic range of the CRP was 5-220 fg/mL for voltammetric and impedance analysis. Morever, the strategy exhibited high selectivity against various potential interfering species and was capable of directly probing trace amounts of the target CRP in human serum with excellent selectivity. The analytical assay based on the CRP/BSA/anti-CRP/MPA/Au substrate could be exploited as a potentially useful tool for detecting CRP in clinical samples.

AB The rapid and reliable measurement of procalcitonin (PCT) level exerts a prominent impact on controlling infections and preventing septicemia. This work presents a "signal on-off" electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for ultrasensitive PCT detection based on the double quenching effects of Fe3O4@PDA-CuxO towards a self-enhanced Ru (bpy)(3)(2+)-functionalized metal organic framework (MOF). Specifically, mesoporous and hollow MIL-101(Al)-NH2 is first applied in ECL system to load Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) abundantly and stably. Poly (ethylenimine), as the coreactant, is covalently linked with MIL-101(Al)-NH2 to prevent the leakage of Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) and form a self-enhanced Ru complex, thus strong and stable ECL signals are obtained initially. To achieve high-efficiency quenching of "signal on" state, Fe3O4@PDA-CuxO-Ab(2) is synthesized tactfully as the quenching probe by which catechol or benzoquinone units in PDA and Cu2+ adsorbed by PDA quench the excited states of Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) via electron transfer and resonance energy transfer. In this way, a rapid and robust signal-quenched type ECL immunosensor is developed for PCT measurement with a detection limit of 0.18 pg(-1) and a dynamic range from 0.0005 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1). Given desirable selectivity, stability and reproducibility, the elaborated ECL immunoassay based on luminescence-functionalized MOF prefigures its great promise in bioanalysis of PCT and other biomarkers.

AB The use of new functional two-dimensional nanomaterials for construction of advanced biosensors has attracted great attention. Herein, we report an electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) biosensor to detect gliotoxin based on DNA nanostructure-modified MXene (Ti3C2) nanosheets. Tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) were facilely immobilized onto the surface of MXene nanosheets through coordination interactions between the phosphate groups on DNA and titanium, which avoids cumbersome and expensive modification of DNA probes. MXene nanosheets possess large surface area to modify a large number of DNA probes and excellent conductivity to facilitate the electron transfer between electrochemical species and the underlying electrode surface. Meanwhile, the unique configuration of TDN enables efficient and rapid binding of target molecules onto electrode surface, thereby producing amplified electrochemical signals. Through combining the merits of the two nanomaterials, the proposed sensor exhibits a wide detection range from 5 pM to 10 nM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 5 pM. We believe that this work opens a new avenue for development of MXene-based E-DNA biosensors and could be further extended to detect other mycotoxins.

AB A delicate dual-readout immunosensor based on tetraphenylporphyrin-polymer dots (TPP-Pdots) with brilliant photoelectrochemical and photothermal performance was first successfully fabricated for the ultrasensitive detection of sialic acid (SA). Herein, TPP-Pdots with good biocompatibility, extraordinary light-harvesting ability and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was used to capture SA antibody as dual-functional bioprobe for generating photocurrent and temperature signal. Furthermore, the large surface and morphology-mediated of rutile-TiO2 (R-TiO2) was beneficial to load amounts of TPP-Pdots for improved PEC signal and photothermal signal. Importantly, the temperature readout resulted from the variation of target concentration could be easily obtained by a universal thermometer which was time-saving and cost-saving. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the photocurrent densities and temperature changes proportionally increased with the increasing of SA concentrations from 3.5 x 10(-5) ng/mL to 35 ng/mL (R = 0.996). Impressively, the dual-readout approach proposed here not only featured with good accuracy and high sensitivity for SA detection, but also paved the way for the development of a dual-readout immunoassay based on PEC biosensor.

AB A novel nonsemiconductor photoelectrochemical biosensor was first constructed using the unique plasmonic AuNi nanodendrite arrays. The AuNi nanodendrite arrays were rapidly prepared by a one-step electrodeposition method using the porous anodic aluminum templates. Owing to its hierarchical structure with abundant active sites, the synergistic catalytic of Au and Ni can be better exploited. These plasmonic AuNi nanodendrite arrays display exceptional photoelectrocatalytic activities for glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction under visible light illumination. Specifically, the detection sensitivity for glucose (3.7277 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)) under illumination is about 3.3 folds improvement than in the dark (1.1287 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)), together with high accuracy and low detection limit of 3 mu M. The markedly enhanced performance of AuNi nanodendrite arrays can be attributed to its hierarchical structure with abundant active sites and plasmonic effect of Au with strong absorption band in visible region. Such a newly developed method via the facile and low-cost route is of great significance in designing the plasmon-aided photoelectrochemical biosensors.

AB Combining different metal - organic frameworks (MOFs) into a conjugate material can integrate the properties of each MOF component and further lead to emergent properties from the synergistic heterostructured units. In this work, two kinds of bimetallic TbFe-MOFs have been designed by MOF-on-MOF strategy and utilized as a platform for anchoring carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) aptamer to detect CA125 and living michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. Although the integrated MOF-on-MOF architectures show similar chemical and structural features to that of the top layer, the Fe-MOF-on-Tb-MOF and Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF have different surface nanostructures to their parent MOFs. The developed aptasensor based on Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF displays higher stability of the formed G-quadruplex between aptamer and CA125 than that based on Fe-MOF-on-TbMOF, owing to stronger immobilization behavior of the aptamer for the Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF composite. The developed aptasensor provides an extremely low detection limit of 58 mu U.mL(-1) towards CA125 within a wide linear range from 100 mu U.mL(-1) to 200 U.mL(-1), which is significantly lower than those of all reported sensors. This aptasensor also has high selectivity, good stability, acceptable reproducibility, and excellent applicability in human serum. Moreover, the Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF nanoarchitecture demonstrates superior biocompatibility and good endocytosis. As a result, the developed aptasensor illustrates high sensitivity for detection of MCF-7 cells with an extremely low detection limit of 19 cell.mL(-1). Therefore, the proposed aptasensor based on Tb-MOF-on-Fe-MOF exhibits great potentials for early diagnosis of tumors.

AB Rhinophore, a bio-chemical sensory organ with soft and stretchable/retractable features in many marine molluscs species, exhibits tunable chemosensory abilities in terms of far/near-field chemical detection and molecules' source orientation. However, existing artificial bio-chemical sensors cannot provide tunable modality sensing. Inspired by the anatomical units (folded sensory epithelium) and the functions of a rhinophore, this work introduces a stretchable electrochemical sensor that offers a programmable electro-catalytic performance towards glucose based on the fold/unfold regulation of the gold nanomembrane on an elastic fiber. Geometrical design rationale and covalent bonding strategy are used to realize the robust mechanical and electrical stability of this stretchable bionic sensor. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the sensitivities of the as-prepared bionic sensor exhibit a linear relationship with its strain states from 0% to 150%. Bio-inspired sensory functions are tested by regulating the strain of the bionic sensor. The sensor achieves a sensitivity of 195.4 mu A mM(-1) in a low glucose concentration range of 8-206 mu M at 150% strain for potentially far-field chemical detection, and a sensitivity of 14.2 mu A mM(-1) in a high concentration range of 10-100 mM at 0% strain for near-field chemical detection. Moreover, the bionic sensor performs the detection while extending its length can largely enhance the response signal, which is used to distinguish the molecules' source direction. This proposed bionic sensor can be useful in wearable devices, robotics and bionics applications which require diverse modality sensing and smart chemical tracking system.

AB CuCo2O4 nanoparticles modified with nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CuCo2O4/N-CNTs) have high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity. Herein, a novel electrochemical sensor based on CuCo2O4/N-CNTs loaded molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is proposed for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of metronidazole (MNZ). The composite of CuCo2O4/N-CNTs with MIP significantly enhances the electrical signal. The electrochemical polymerization was performed with MNZ as template and aniline as functional monomer by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to detect MNZ. Factors that affect sensor response were optimized. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the DPV current response shows two linearity ranges for MNZ in the range of 0.005-0.1 mu M and 0.1-100 mu M with very low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.48 nM (S/N = 3). This electrochemical sensing system has high sensitivity, selectivity, excellent reproducibility, repeatability and stability. The recovery (95.9%-100.9%) and reasonable relative standard deviation (RSD) (3.2%-4.8%) for determination of real samples indicate the practicality of the sensing system. This sensing system has high potential for rapid determination of MNZ in samples such as metronidazole tablets, human serum and urine.

AB Metal-organic framework nanocrystal (Zn-MOF) was synthesized by using 3,3'-{(propane-1,3-diyl)bis[1-(4-carboxybenzyl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium]} hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid as the functional monomer and Zn( )(2+)as the central metal ion under hydrothermal conditions. Spatially confined gold nanoparticles (Au-NP) were prepared by in-situ reduction of chloroauric acid in the nanopores of Zn-MOF using acetic acid as the reducing agent to fabricate Au-NP@Zn-MOF nanocomposites. Au-NPs@Zn-MOF was further functionalized with 1H-imidazolium-1,3-bis(2-aminoethyl)bromide ionic liquid (IBABr) to prepare IBABr-Au@Zn-MOF nanocomposites. All abovementioned nanomaterials were thoroughly characterized by TEM, SEM, XPS, FTIR, and nitrogen-adsorption surface area analysis. IBABr-Au@Zn-MOFnanocomposites were then deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode and used as the photoactive element to fabricate a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor by immobilizing anti-squamous cell carcinoma antigen (anti-SCCA). The PEC sensing principle is based on the photocurrent decline due to the blocking effect of SCCA on the electron and mass transfer after binding SCCA to anti-SCCA. The photocurrent variation related to the specific recognition of SCCA shows a linear relationship to the logarithm of SCCA concentration in the range of 5.0 pg mL(-1) to 15.0 ng mL(-1). The detection limit is as low as 2.34 pg mL(-1). Such a signal-off PEC immunosensor is highly selective, sensitive, stable, and reproducible towards SCCA detection. Its performance is comparable to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from the studies on clinical samples. This immunosensor is promising for the label-free determining SCCA in clinical human serum samples.

AB Incorporation of new readout methods with established analytical devices allows methodological innovations in analytical sciences. Herein, we present a new sensing platform by combining an ultrasensitive element analyzer, namely the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a lateral flow strip (LFS). AgxAuy bimetallic nanoparticles (Ag(x)Au(y)BNPs) are selected as the labels to deliver the optimal quantitative performance by analyzing the Ag (I) signal from the test (T) line of LFS. For prototypical application in pathogen detection, the LIBS-LFS sensor can achieve a detection limit of 1.6 cfu mL(-1) of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) within 10 min, which is superior to conventional methods. Importantly, the signals of Ag(x)Au(y)BNPs for visual and LIBS analysis are stable and still readable after the detection is finished and the test strip is stored for up to 13 days, suggesting a potential for long-term data preservation. This combination of LIBS with LFS provides a new concept toward integrated nano/analytical devices that can benefit various application scenarios.

AB Glucose sensing is of vital importance due to the growing number of diabetes. In this study, we developed a visual detecting approach for glucose sensing based on a smart hydrogel system, by assembling of a photo-crosslinkable hydrogel and a pH-responsive nanogel, respectively. The hydrogel system showed fast response and high sensitivity to glucose in the physiological ranges, and enabled a visual detection of glucose both in vitro in glucose solutions and in vivo in diabetic mouse models. In normoglycemic state, the hydrogels showed large swelling, resulting in a large shape but with weak color or fluorescence intensity of the hydrogels. In hyperglycemic state, the hydrogels exhibited less swelling, resulting in a small shape but with strong color or fluorescence intensity of the hydrogels. Based on the observation of the size change and intensity change of the hydrogels, we can visual the glucose levels by either colorimetry or fluorescence imaging. This hydrogel system provides a novel means for visual detection of glucose. Our study broadens the current applications of hydrogels, extending their potentials in clinical diagnosis of diabetes or glucose-related analysis.

AB Fast and accurate detection of S. aureus and effectively kill S. aureus in the bloodstream in low doses acted as key roles in medicine and microbiology studies. In this work, sufonated-hyaluronic acid (S-HA) terminated magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MMSNs) loaded with vancomycin was successfully prepared, and S. aureus antibody was further modified on the surface of MMSNs (Ab@S-HA@MMSNs) by amidation reaction. The result showed that Ab@S-HA@MMSNs were 240 nm-sized spheres with worm-like mesoporous channels. With the aid of magnetic interaction, Ab@S-HA@MMSNs were modified on the surface of magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE). This prepared immunosensor exhibited an excellent detection limit and linear range, and possessed good selectivity, stability and reproducibility. Besides, since the S-HA terminated MMSNs have anticoagulant property, the Ab@S-HA@MMSNs/MGCE showed antiadhesion property, which ensure that it can be directly applied to detect the amount of S. aureus in whole blood. What's more, with an increasing amount of S. aureus arriving at MGCE, the capping Ab@S-HA@MMSNs were degraded by Hyal which was secreted by S. aureus, and the packaged vancomycin was subsequently released. Ultimately, S. aureus can be effectively killed. Therefore, this integrated platform would be a promising multifunctional platform for achieving accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment of S. aureus bloodstream infection.

AB Herein, a highly efficient dual-quenching biosensor based on electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) is designed utilizing Ru-In2S3 as ECL acceptor and alpha-MoO3-Au as ECL donor. Compared alpha-MoO3-Au with pure alpha-MoO3, the overlapping peak area between ECL emission of Ru-In2S3 and UV-vis spectra of alpha-MoO3-Au is increased, indicated better quenching effect is obtained. Hollow In2S3 and alpha-MoO3-Au both have huge specific surface area to host a large amount of luminophores and antibodies. Moreover, HWRGWVC (H7) as specific capturer is adopted to achieve site-oriented antibody immobilization, which not only maintain antibody activity, but greatly improve the incubation process of antibodies, thus promoting the sensitivity of the biosensor. It's worth mentioning that the effect of over-potential on protein activity was proved in this work. The proposed biosensor obtained sensitive response by using PCT as a target with wide linear range from 0.0001 to 50 ng/mL and low detection limit of 12.49 fg/mL (S/N = 3), indicating its potential in the detection of biomarkers. Importantly, a novel ECL-RET pair of Ru-In2S3(donor)/alpha-MoO3-Au (acceptor) is firstly developed, which opened an efficient way for highly sensitive detection of antibody in disease clinical and diagnosis analysis.

AB Rapid and efficient detection of microRNA (miRNA) of breast cancer 1 gene mutation (BRCA1) at their earliest stages is one of the crucial challenges in cancer diagnostics. In this study, a highly-sensitive electrochemical DNA biosensor was fabricated by double signal amplification (DSA) strategy for the detection of ultra-trace miRNA of BRCA1. In the presence of target miRNA of BRCA1, the well-matched RNA-DNA duplexes were specifically recognized by double-strand specific nuclease (DSN), and the DNA part of the duplexes were then cleaved and miRNAs were released to trigger another following cycle, which produced a primarily amplified signal by such a cyclic enzymatic signal amplification (CESA). Then triple-CdTe quantum dot labelled DNA nanocomposites (3QD@DNA NC) was selectively hybridized with the cleaved DNA probe on the electrode and produced multiply amplified signals. The biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity for the detection of miRNA of BRCA1 in concentrations ranging from 5 aM to 5 fM, and its detection limit of 1.2 aM was obtained, which is two or three orders of magnitude lower than those by single signal amplification strategy such as CESA or QD-labeled DNA probes. The as-prepared biosensor was successfully used to detect the miRNA of BRCA1 in human serum samples with acceptable stability, good reproducibility, and good recovery. The proposed DNA biosensor based on double signal amplification strategy provided a feasible, rapid, and sensitive platform for early clinical diagnosis and practical applications.

AB With the aim of providing a powerful analytical tool for early diagnostics of procalcitonin (PCT), an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed based on a 3D well-ordered sensing interface and biocompatible signal indicator. Polyaniline nanorod arrays grafted reduced graphene oxide (PANI NRs/rGO) was hybridized with gold nanoparticles (PANI NRs/rGO-Au) as sensing substrate. To improve the specificity, HWRGWVC heptapeptide (HWR) as specific capture-antibody (Ab(1)) immobilizer was introduced to construct a PANI NRs/rGO-Au-HWR sensing interface. Due to their synergistic effect, the proposed interface improved the incubation efficiency of antibody on substrate with faster electron-transfer for remarkable ECL enhancement. Then, ferritin (Ft) with superiority of biocompatibility was utilized to crosslink with ECL luminophore of N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI-Ft) as signal indicator. ABEI-Ft exhibited high ECL efficiency and could capture detection-antibody (Ab(2)) via amine reaction. Due to the enzyme-mimic property of ferric nanocore inside of Ft, abundant reactive oxygen species (ROSs) were produced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which further enhanced the ECL signals. On the basis, a novel biosensor was developed using PANI NRs/rGO-Au-HWR as specific sensing interface and ABEI-Ft as signal label, which performed sensitive response to PCT concentration with a wide linear range of 100 fg/mL- 50 ng/mL and a detection limit of 54 fg/mL.

AB This work designed a MgIn2S4-TiONA heterojunction by growing MgIn2S4 nanoplates on TiO2 nanowire array (TiONA) for preparation of visible light photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing platform. The heterojunction exhibited strong absorption of visible light, large surface area and high loading of biomolecules, leading to high sensing sensitivity. Using adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a marker of cell vitality, as the target model, a PEC sandwich aptasensor was constructed by immobilizing capture DNA(1) on MgIn2S4 surface. In the presence of ATP and signal DNA(2) with terminal ferrocene as the electron donor, a sandwiched DNA(1)-ATP-DNA(2) complex could be formed on the PEC aptasensor. The aptasensor showed excellent performance with a wide linear range from 50 fM to 100 nM and a detection limit of 20 fM.

AB Antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) is regarded as one of the most important circulating autoantibodies for anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs). Hence, it is crucial for highly sensitive detection of anti-MPO to monitor efficacy of AAVs in clinical diagnosis. Herein, a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for anti-MPO detection was constructed by combining reduced graphene oxide-supported PtCo nanocubes hybrids (PtCo@rGO) with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) as signal amplification. Multiple ECL luminophores (Dox-ABEI) prepared by cross-linking of N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI) and doxorubicin (Dox) were intercalated into dsDNA products of HCR, achieving the effective immobilization of ECL luminophores to obtain strong ECL emission. Benefiting from the efficient catalytic activity of PtCo@rGO toward H2O2, the massive the superoxide radical (O-2(center dot)-) were generated to further react with ABEI for ECL emission. Thus, the designed ECL immunoassay for anti-MPO detection exhibited excellent sensitivity of a concentration variation from 50 fg/mL to 1 ng/mL and a detection limit of 15.68 fg/mL. Importantly, this work proposed an enzyme-free ECL immunoassay with high sensitivity, excellent specificity for protein detection in clinical diagnosis.

AB Cell free diagnosis of cancer is one of the crucial fields in new generation of medical technology. In this regard, cancer detection based on coastal fluids secreted from the tissues (named as secretome) has attracted a lot of attention. Lipids are important macromolecules could be found with much higher concentrations in secretome of cancer tissues vs. normal ones. On the other hand, lipids are the main dielectric components of the secretome with respect to proteins and ions. Here for the first time we introduced an electrochemical lipidomics based on electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the secretomes to detect the cancerous samples due to the lipidic content of their secretions. The EIS sensor was fabricated by multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) arrays as conductive and super hydrophobic materials to have great interactive surface with the lipidic content of the solution. Results of the tests on the secretions of more than 100 human biopsied breast tissues showed the promising match between the charge transfer resistance (R-CT) of samples' secretions and pathological states of the tissues with meaningful boundary (up to 8 k Omega for normal and more than 13 k Omega for cancer samples). Mass spectroscopic analyses confirmed the higher content of lipids in cancer secretomes. Electrical lipidomics of the secretome shed new lights in cell free cancer diagnosis and could be applied as a complementary clinical approach in all of biopsy based diagnoses in future.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is one of the most intractable multidrug-resistant bacteria of nosocomial infections. The conventional detection methods for P. aeruginosa are time-consuming or low detection sensitivity. Here, a novel enzyme-free electrochemical biosensor was constructed to detect P. aeruginosa rapidly and sensitively. Firstly, the ZrMOF with large surface area was synthesized, which offers excellent adsorption. Further, it was connected with a specific amount of Cu2+ to synthesize Cu-ZrMOF with high catalytic activity. Then the Cu-ZrMOF@Aptamer@DNA nanocomposite was composed and served as the signal probe to catalyse the decomposition of H2O2. Moreover, high conductive Super P was introduced to increase the electron transfer for satisfactory detection sensitivity. The proposed biosensor was constructed and used to quantify P. aeruginosa with a wide linearity range of 10-10(6) CFU and a low limit of detection of 2 CFU mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Compared with conventional methods, the new method of present biosensor is more sensitive, and less time-consuming (only within 120 min). The analytical performance evaluation indicated that the biosensor exhibits good reproducibility and specificity. Finally, the biosensor was successfully applied to quantify P. aeruginosa in spiked urine samples. These results show that the proposed electrochemical biosensor might be a potential laboratory tool for detecting P. aeruginosa in the clinic.

AB Enzyme-mediated cascade reaction is applied to amplify signal and decrease the background because enzyme can catalyze inactive substrates into active substrates to generate the signal. In this work, Au nanoparticles, as signal probe, are used to load DNA probe and ALP for dual signal amplification. Based on enzyme-mediated cascade reaction, a homogeneous biosensor is constructed for bioassay by employing thrombin as target molecule. When the target is present in the solution, ALP catalyzes the PPi into Pi and then reacts with molybdate in conjunction with Pi in the DNA backbone to produce redox precipitates on the surface of the reduced graphene oxide modified electrode with the help of magnetic separation. Compared with the conventional heterogeneous biosensor, the immobilization-free strategy, proposed in this homogeneous biosensor, improves the sensitivity because of its lower steric hindrance. As a result, this biosensor displayed a great sensitivity with a wide linear range from 1 fM to 10 nM and a detection limit of 0.26 fM, providing a promise and easy operating method for various proteins detection.

AB To develop a specific method for the detection of S. aureus, chicken anti-protein A IgY was adopted for specifically capturing S. aureus, depending on the specific recognition of staphylococcal protein A (SPA) by chicken anti-protein A IgY, which can eliminate the interference from protein G-producing Streptococcus. HRP labeled IgG, Fc region of which has a high affinity towards SPA, was paired with IgY for the colorimeter analysis of the system. By optimizing the system, a super-low detection limit of 11 CFU of S. aureus in 100 mu L PBS without enrichment, with a linear range from 5.0 x 10(2) CFU mL(-)(1) to 5.0 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1) was obtained. The entire assay was accomplished in less than 90 min and no cross-reactivity with the other tested bacterial species was observed. Moreover, the developed assay has been applied for the detection of S. aureus in three different types of real samples (sodium chloride injection, apple juice and human urine) with satisfactory results. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to report using chicken anti-protein A IgY and any IgG to detect S. aureus based on the dual-recognition mode of SPA. The novel method opened up a way for monitoring S. aureus in food samples with high sensitivity, specificity and simple operation.

AB The extracellular electron transfer of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (MR-1) has been extensively studied due to the importance of the biosensors and energy applications of bioelectrochemical systems. However, the oxidation of metal compounds by MR-1, which represents the inward extracellular electron transfer from extracellular electron donors into the microbe, is barely understood. In this study, MR-1 immobilized on an electrode electrocatalyzes the oxidation of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) efficiently and selectively. The selectivity depends on midpoint potential and overall charge(s) of redox molecules. Among 12 investigated redox molecules, the negatively charged molecules with high midpoint potentials, i.e., [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) and [Fe(CN)(6)](4-), show strong electrocatalysis. Neither reference bacteria (Escherichia colt K-12 nor Streptococcus mutans) electrocatalyze the oxidation of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-). The electrocatalysis decays when MR-1 is covered with palladium nanoparticles presumptively involved with cytochromes c. However, cytochromes c MtrC and OmcA on MR-1 do not play an essential role in this process. The results support a model that [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) donor electrons to MR-1 by interacting with undiscovered active sites and the electrons are subsequently transferred to the electrode through the mediating effect of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-). The selective electron uptake by MR-1 provides valuable and fundamental insights of the applications of bioelectrochemical systems and the detection of specific redox molecules.

AB Food allergies are recognized as a growing public health concern, with an estimated 3% of adults and 6-8% of children affected by food allergy disorders. Hence, food allergen detection, labeling, and management have become significant priorities within the food industry, and there is an urgent requirement for reliable, sensitive, and user-friendly technologies to trace food allergens in food products. In this critical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the principles and applications of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors in the identification and quantification of food allergens (milk, egg, peanut, and seafood), including fiber-optic surface plasmon resonance (FOSPR), surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and transmission surface plasmon resonance (TSPR). Moreover, the characteristics and fitness-for-purpose of each reviewed SPR biosensor is discussed, and the potential of newly developed SPR biosensors for multi-allergen real-time detection in a complex food system is highlighted. Such SPR biosensors are also required to facilitate the reliable, high-throughput, and real-time detection of food allergens by the food control industry and food safety control officials to easily monitor cross-contamination during food processing.

AB A novel electrochemical biosensing method that can take into account both immunoassay and enzyme activity analysis was reported in this work for determination of the enzymatically active human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). The basic principle is to design and construct a DNA catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) triggered by APE1 catalysis in enzyme activity analysis, and the assembled DNAs are labeled with electrochemically active CdS and PbS quantum dots to output electrochemical signals. In this system, the signal generation needs to satisfy both the conditions of immunological recognition and enzymatic catalysis, providing a basis for accurate analysis of active APE1. Results show that this method can reflect the regulation of the enzyme activity and can also distinguish APE1 from its isozymes with the same enzyme activity. The concept and successful implementation of this integrated system will contribute to the research and application of APE1 in biomedicine, and provide a reference for the accurate analysis of other enzymes.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a class of mycotoxin mainly produced by the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. OTA can cause various forms of kidney, liver and brain diseases in both humans and animals although trace amount of OTA is normally present in food. Therefore, development of fast and sensitive detection technique is essential for accurate diagnosis of OTA. Currently, the most commonly used detection methods are enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays (ELISA) and chromatographic techniques. These techniques are sensitive but time consuming, and require expensive equipment, highly trained operators, as well as extensive preparation steps. These drawbacks limit their wide application in OTA detection. On the contrary, biosensors hold a great potential for OTA detection at for both research and industry because they are less expensive, rapid, sensitive, specific, simple and portable. This paper aims to provide an extensive overview on biosensors for OTA detection by highlighting the main biosensing recognition elements for OTA, the most commonly used nanomaterials for fabricating the sensing interface, and their applications in different read-out types of biosensors. Current challenges and future perspectives are discussed as well.

AB Recently, nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes have expected abundant consideration because of cheap, accessibility, and respectable stability. In this study, we report a Th-MOF artificial peroxidase, which can oxidize 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine by hydrogen peroxide to yield a blue product. The catalytic behavior of Th-MOF tracked Michaelis-Menten equation and the affinity of this nanozyme to the substrate was higher than horseradish peroxidase as a natural enzyme. The absorbance value of oxidized TMB is linearly associated with the hydrogen peroxide concentration. Since, hydrogen peroxide is the oxidative end product of uric acid (UA) by uricase, an efficient and sensitive approach for uric acid determination was also established. Results showed that Km value of Th-MOF with TMB as a substrate is much lower than that of other mentioned catalysts. The linear regression equations for uric acid substrate was stated as A = 0.0039C + 0.0519 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9955. The linear range for uric acid was from 4.0 to 70 mu M, and the LOD was measured as 1.15 mu M. Furthermore the absorbance of assay reaction was approximately constant in the following four cycles, demonstrating that Th-MOF catalyst has outstanding stability. Results showed that the public interfering substances had no obvious absorbance values and it was less than 0.1. Results indicated that the recoveries for UA in serum fluids were between 93.10% and 99.04%. The relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 3) at each concentration value was less than 4.3%. UA determination in serum fluids has been confirmed through a comparison between the recommended technique and tedious clinical approaches. Good recovery and accuracy of UA measurement indicated that this established colorimetric sensing system is appropriate for UA revealing in actual experimental samples.

AB Surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI) is a powerful label-free imaging modality for the analysis of morphological dynamics in cell monolayers. However, classical plasmonic imaging systems have relatively poor spatial resolution along one axis due to the plasmon mode attenuation distance (tens of mu m, typically), which significantly limits their ability to resolve subcellular structures. We address this limitation by adding an array of nanostructures onto the metal sensing surface (25 nm thick, 200 nm width, 400 nm period grating) to couple localized plasmons with propagating plasmons, thereby reducing attenuation length and commensurately increasing spatial imaging resolution, without significant loss of sensitivity or image contrast. In this work, experimental results obtained with both conventional unstructured and nanostructured gold film SPRI sensor chips show a clear gain in spatial resolution achieved with surface nanostructuring. The work demonstrates the ability of the nanostructured SPRI chips to resolve fine morphological detail (intercellular gaps) in experiments monitoring changes in endothelial cell monolayer integrity following the activation of the cell surface proteaseactivated receptor 1 (PAR1) by thrombin. In particular, the nanostructured chips reveal the persistence of small intercellular gaps ( < 5 mu m(2)) well after apparent recovery of cell monolayer integrity as determined by conventional unstructured surface based SPRI. This new high spatial resolution plasmonic imaging technique uses low-cost and reusable patterned substrates and is likely to find applications in cell biology and pharmacology by allowing label-free quantification of minute cell morphological activities associated with receptor dependent intracellular signaling activity.

AB TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs) were fabricated by using polystyrene template. TiO2 IOPCs based photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was fabricated for the precise and stable detection of Heme without external irradiation. Then, the sensitization of TiO2 IOPCs was fulfilled with CdS quantum dots (QDs) by SILAR method to form ITO-TiO2 IOPCs-CdS:Mn electrode, which in turn was used to construct a PEC biosensor. The uniform porous structure of IOPCs with a large surface area is conducive to the excellent electronic transmission and QDs deposition. Also, the energy level matching between the conduction bands of CdS QDs and TiO2 IOPCs widened the range of light absorption, allowing for electron injection from excited CdS QDs to TiO2 upon luminol chemiluminescence, which enhanced the photocurrent. Furthermore, when the red edge of the photonic stop band of TiO2 IOPCs overlapped with the band gap of TiO2, and chemiluminescence emission of luminol, a substantial photocurrent increment was observed due in part to the slow light effect. The biosensor possesses a large linear detection range of 0.063-4 mM with a LOD of 19 mu M for H2O2. Also, xanthine oxidase activity was determined with a linear measurement range of 0.01-15 mU/mL. Our strategy opens a new horizon to IOPCs based and QDs sensitized PEC sensing, which could be more sensitive, convenient and inexpensive for clinical and biological analysis. As far as we know, the largest photocurrent generation by luminol chemiluminescence was observed thanks to the use of semiconducting hybrid IOPCs material even at 0 V.

AB Nowadays, exosomes that carry abundant information have attracted increasing attention as potent biomarkers of liquid biopsy and ideal candidates for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. In this work, we propose a "principle-of-proof" biosensing method for amplified electrochemical detection of exosomes by using HepG2-derived exosomes as models. Specifically, target exosomes are enriched on anti-CD63-functionalized immunobeads and then recognized by a DNA chain containing CD63 aptamer region, which subsequently initiates a catalytic molecule machine that relies on cascade toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. Benefiting from high efficiency of the molecule machine, the method shows a linear range from 1 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(7) particles/mL and a detection limit of 1.72 x 10(4) particles/mL toward target exosomes, better than most existing detection methods. Moreover, the method demonstrates a high specificity even in serum samples and suggests a potential use in clinic, which may provide sufficient information for disease diagnosis, especially early detection and prognosis monitoring of tumors.

AB With increasing economic globalization, food safety is becoming the most serious concern in the food production and distribution system. Food safety hazard factors (FSHFs) can be categorized into chemical hazards, biological hazards and physical hazards, with the detection of the former two having fascinated interdisciplinary research areas spanning chemistry, material science and biological science. Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) -based sensors overcome many limitations of traditional detection methods and provide opportunities for efficient, sensitive and low-cost detection using smart miniaturized equipment. With highly specific molecular recognition capacity and high stability in harsh chemical and physical conditions, MIPs have been used in sensing platforms such as electrochemical, optical and mass-sensitive sensors as promising alternatives to bio-receptors for food analysis. In this systemic review, we summarize recent advances of MIPs and MIP-based sensors, such as popular monomers, usual polymerization strategies, fresh modification materials and advanced sensing mechanisms. The applications of MIP-based sensors in FSHF detection are discussed according to sensing mechanisms, including electrochemistry, optics and mass-sensitivity. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are discussed.

   DESIGN
AB Mode volume overlap factor is one of the parameters determining the sensitivity of a sensor. In past decades, many approaches have been proposed to increase the mode volume overlap. As the increased mode volume overlap factor results in reduced mode confinement, the maximum value is ultimately determined by the microand nano-structure of the refractive index distribution of the sensing devices. Due to the asymmetric index profile along the vertical direction on silicon-on-insulator platform, further increasing the sensitivity of subwavelength grating metamaterial (SGM) waveguide based sensors is challenging. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate pedestaled SGM which reduces the asymmetricity and thus allows further increasing the interaction between optical field and analytes. The pedestal structure can be readily formed by a controlled undercut etching. Both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration show a significant improvement of sensitivity. The bulk sensitivity and surface sensitivity are improved by 28.8% and 1000 times, respectively. The detection of streptavidin at a low concentration of 0.1 ng/mL (similar to 1.67 pM) is also demonstrated through real- time monitoring of the resonance shift. A similar to 400 fM streptavidin limit of detection is expected with a 0.01nm resolution spectrum analyzer based on the real-time measurement of streptavidin detection results from two-site binding model fitting.

AB Porphyrinic Metal-Organic Frameworks (porph-MOFs) are attracting attention due to the redox activity in the porphyrin subunit. Herein, we report the design of a novel core-shell structure hybrid material with a sea-cucumber morphology, namely PMeTh, containing the poly(3-methythiophene) conducting polymer coated on the surface of iron-based porph-MOFs PCN-222(Fe) via in-situ oxidative chemical polymerization. The porous PCN-222(Fe) serves as the electrocatalytic sites, while the poly(3-methythiophene) conducting polymer functions as the charge collector to facilitate the charge transport to the redox active sites. The resulting PMeTh composite demonstrates an excellent electrochemical response towards the levodopa detection. The sensitivity towards the L-dopa detection is estimated to be 1.868 mu A . mu M-1. cm(-2) in the linear concentration of 0.05-7.0 mu mol . L-1 and 0.778 mu A . mu M-1 . cm(-2) in the linear concentration of 7.00-100 mu mol . L-1, respectively. Additionally, the levodopa sensor exhibits a low detection limit of 2 nmol L-1 as well as excellent stability after 120 cycles in 10 mu mol L-1 levodopa. The feasibility of this novel L-dopa sensor was evaluated in human urine samples by standard addition. The satisfactory recoveries were in the range of 97.0-104.5% with the R.S.D. value lower than 4.4%. The method of intergrating porph-MOFs and conducting polymers can efficiently expand the porph-MOFs based composites in bioanalysis.

AB While glucose monitoring technology is widely available, the continued prevalence of diabetes around the world coupled with its debilitating effects continues to grow. The significant limitations which exist in the current technology, instils the need for materials capable of non-invasive glucose detection. In this study a unique nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor was developed, utilising a gold honeycomb-like framework upon which sharp Co3O4 needles are anchored. This composite nanomaterial demonstrates excellent sensing performance in glucose concentrations ranging between 20 mu M and 4 mM, exceeding the range required for noninvasive glucose sensing. In conjunction with this high sensitivity (2.014 mA mM(-1).cm(-2)), the material possesses excellent selectivity towards glucose for commonly interfering physiological species such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. Glucose detection in synthetic saliva was then performed showing excellent capability in the low concentration range (20 mu M-1 mM) for non-invasive sensing performance. Further tests showed good selectivity of the sensor in physiological contaminants commonly found in saliva such as cortisol and dopamine. This development provides excellent scope to create next-generation non-invasive diabetes monitoring platforms, with excellent performance when detecting low glucose concentrations in complex solutions such as saliva.

AB A stable and sensitive electrochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor for detection of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) was developed by doping Au nanorods (AuNRs)@mesoporous SiO2 (MS) core-shell nanoparticles into CS/TiO2-CS (CS denotes for chitosan) immobilization matrix. AuNRs@MS core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized. The doping and the biosensor fabrication process were probed and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemistry techniques. The doping conditions were optimized. The matrix both before and after AChE immobilization had a mesoporous nanostructure. The nanoparticles dispersed homogeneously within the matrix. The doping significantly enhanced the electroconductivity of the TiO2-CS hydrogel, and dramatically improved the bioelectrocatalytic activity and OPs detection sensitivity of the AChE immobilized matrix. The detection linear ranges for both dichlovos (DDVP) and fenthion were from 0.018 mu M (4.0 ppb) to 13.6 mu M, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 5.3 nM (1.2 ppb) and 1.3 nM (0.36 ppb), respectively. The biosensor exhibited high reproducibility and accuracy in detecting OPs spiked vegetable juice samples. In addition, it exhibited very high detection stability and storage stability. The developed AChE biosensor was provided to be a promisingly applicable tool for OPs detection with high reliability, simplicity, and rapidness.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a potential material in the diverse fields of biomedical applications due to their numerous advantageous properties including fluorescence, water solubility, biocompatibility, low toxicity, small size and ease of modification, inexpensive scale-up production, and versatile conjugation with other nanoparticles. Thus, CQDs became a preferable choice in various biomedical applications such as nanocarriers for drugs, therapeutic genes, photosensitizers, and antibacterial molecules. Further, their potentials have also been verified in multifunctional diagnostic platforms, cellular and bacterial bio-imaging, development of theranostics nanomedicine, etc. This review provides a concise insight into the progress and evolution in the field of CQD research with respect to methods/materials available in bio-imaging, theranostics, cancer/gene therapy, diagnostics, etc. Further, our discussion is extended to explore the role of CQDs in nanomedicine which is considered to be the future of biomedicine. This study will thus help biomedical researchers in tapping the potential of CQDs to overcome various existing technological challenges.

AB A versatile, compact and low-cost analytical platform has been designed, tested and validated to be used in the point-of-care settings. This passive measurement system is powered and complemented by a standard smartphone including a programmed application for measurement configuration and data processing as well as wireless results sharing. Electrochemical and electrochemiluminescence analytical techniques can be configured and realized by this platform that employs standard screen-printed electrodes for the sample managing and offthe-shelf electronic components. The power, electrical and optical signal processing have been studied in depth. The system can harvest energy up to 22.5 mW, set up a voltage in the range of +/- 1.15 V, and measure potentials in a range of 600 mV with an uncertainty of 1 mV, and current from 2 mu A to 0.75 mA with a resolution of 1.1 mu A. Moreover, standard tests have been performed to the platform consisting of amperometric, potentiometric, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemiluminescent analytical techniques, showing excellent agreement with a reference instrument. Finally, our design has also been applied to glucose, pH and H2O2 determinations, providing the full analytical parameters which are in very good agreement with the reference instrument results. Ranges (0.065-0.75 M, 0.62-100 mM and 3-9 pH units for glucose, H2O2 and pH, respectively) and limits of detection (0.024 M and 0.03 mM for glucose and H2O2, respectively) make this low-cost platform ( < US$8) suitable for analytical applications.

AB Piezoresistive sensors become increasingly important in wearable devices, specifically sensors printed with piezoresistive inks. The electrical viscosity of these sensors causes phenomena such as stress relaxation, creep and hysteresis. This compromises sensor calibration and leads to inaccurate results. When subjecting a sensor to loading and unloading, the subsequent calculation of the fractional time derivative of the conductance leads to the elimination of the hysteresis. The order of the fractional derivative equals the magnitude of the sensor's viscosity. In our study, the viscosity of several pressure sensors was determined with a material testing machine and ranged from 0.55% to 22.35%. We found that shunt-mode sensors are less viscous than through-mode sensors. In addition, if a viscous material is placed on top of the sensor, then its viscosity increases. This is important as some calibration devices for pressure sensor arrays use rubber bladders which are viscous. From the perspective of manufacturing, the variation of the viscosity across a sensor array accounts for the quality of the pressure sensor mat and should be kept to a minimum. An industry standard is proposed that calculates and reports the sensor viscosity based on loading and unloading of the sensor and calculating the fractional time derivative of the conductance, whose fractional order reduces the pressure - conductance hysteresis to zero and thereby corresponds to the sensor's viscosity.

AB Existing at the interface of biology and electronics, living cells have been in use as biorecognition elements (bioreceptors) in biosensors since the early 1970s. They are an interesting choice of bioreceptors as they allow flexibility in determining the sensing strategy, are cheaper than purified enzymes and antibodies and make the fabrication relatively simple and cost-effective. And with advances in the field of synthetic biology, microfluidics and lithography, many exciting developments have been made in the design of cell-based biosensors in the last about five years. 3D cell culture systems integrated with electrodes are now providing new insights into disease pathogenesis and physiology, while cardiomyocyte-integrated microelectrode array (MEA) technology is set to be standardized for the assessment of drug-induced cardiac toxicity. From cell microarrays for high-throughput applications to plasmonic devices for anti-microbial susceptibility testing and advent of microbial fuel cell biosensors, cell-based biosensors have evolved from being mere tools for detection of specific analytes to multiparametric devices for real time monitoring and assessment. However, despite these advancements, challenges such as regeneration and storage life, heterogeneity in cell populations, high interference and high costs due to accessory instrumentation need to be addressed before the full potential of cell-based biosensors can be realized at a larger scale. This review summarizes results of the studies that have been conducted in the last five years toward the fabrication of cell-based biosensors for different applications with a comprehensive discussion on the challenges, future trends, and potential inputs needed for improving them.

AB The bio-sensory organs of living creatures have evolved to have the best sensing performance. They have 3-dimensional protrusions that have large surface areas to accommodate a large number of membrane proteins such as ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity to target molecules. From the perspective of mimicking this system, BLM, which has been used extensively as a platform for a single nanopore-based sensing systems, has some limitations, i.e., some residual solvent, low mechanical stability, small surface area for appropriate stability, and difficulty in high-throughput fabrication. Herein, to eliminate these limitations, a solvent-free, size-controllable, 3-dimensional free-standing lipid bilayer (3DFLB) structure array with high stability (similar to 130 h) and high density (similar to 300,000 cm(-2)) is proposed, and its structural advantages for efficient and rapid protein reconstitution, compared to BLM, is demonstrated by human 5-HT3A receptor assay as well as alpha-hemolysin assay. A continuous process of 3DFLB array fabrication, 5-HT3A reconstitution, and 5-HT detections in a microfluidic channel proves the applicability of the proposed structures as a highly-sensitive sensing platform mimicking bio-sensory organs.

AB In this work, an electrochemical aptasensor was developed for sensitive detection of MUC1 based on metalorganic framework-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Cu-MOF-RGO). Cu- MOF-RGO appeared to be suitable as a platform for immobilization of MUC1 aptamer, and also as an electrochemical probe, which exhibited well-defined peaks with good stability and reproducibility. Cu-MOF-graphene oxide (Cu-MOP-GO) nanocomposite was prepared and cast on the electrode surface, then in order to increase the conductivity of the electrode, GO was electrochemically reduced to RGO. In the presence of MUC1, the peak current of Cu in the nanocomposite decreased, which could be explained based on the formation of MUC1-aptamer complexes on the electrode, and consequence blocking the electron transfer of Cu at the electrode surface. Under optimum experimental conditions, a linear calibration curve was obtained by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range of 0.1 pM-10 nM (25 pg(-1) - 2500 ng mL(-1)) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.033 pM (7.5 pg(-1)) of MUC1. The proposed aptasensor offers acceptable selectivity, stability, and reproducibility in the determination of MUC1 spiked to human blood serum samples.

AB Since the emergence of the lab-on-a-chip technology in 1979, a variety of microfluidic devices have been developed and utilized for chemical and biological applications. Among the microfluidic devices, the centrifugal microfluidic device or lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) has advanced remarkably due to simple operation by the rotation, total integration, and high-throughput capability. Moreover, the centrifugal microdevices do not need complex tubing and pumping systems, which render them ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) system. Owing to these characteristics, the centrifugal microdevices have been extensively used for bio-diagnostics. In particular, molecular diagnostics, which are regarded as an essential method for definite determination of the targets related with diseases, have been widely applied on the LOAD. In this review paper, we focus on the molecular diagnostics on the LOAD. The steps for the molecular diagnostics such as cell lysis, genome purification, gene amplification, amplicon detection, and data analysis can be performed individually or totally on the LOAD. Future directions of the LOAD in the fields of bio-diagnostics is to realize POCT for U-healthcare monitoring. In this context, the latest LOAD strategies for molecular diagnostics are summarized in this review paper, which would provide an insight for future POCT platform.

AB Reactive oxygen species are highly reactive molecules that as well as being ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, are also known to be involved in many diseases and disorders including bacterial infection. Current technology has limited success in the accurate detection and identification of specific reactive oxygen species. To combat this, we have developed an electrochemical biosensor that is constructed from single walled carbon nanotubes that have been immobilised on an indium tin oxide surface functionalised with osmium-based compound. This sensor was integrated within mouse macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) with multiple serotypes of bacteria used to initiate an immune response. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide was then measured in response to the interaction of the lipopolysaccharides, present on the outer wall of Gram-negative bacteria, with the Toll-like Receptor 4. Additional controls of n-acetylcysteine and sodium pyruvate were implemented to prove the specificity of the sensor towards hydrogen peroxide. The sensors were found to have a lower limit of detection of 368 nM hydrogen peroxide. An increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide was detected within 3 seconds of interaction of the bacteria with the macrophage cells. This low limit of detection combined with the rapid response of the sensor resulted in the unprecedented detection of hydrogen peroxide on a temporal level not previously seen in response to a bacterial threat. From the three serotypes of Gram-negative bacteria that were tested, there were distinct differences in hydrogen peroxide production. This proves that the innate immune system has the ability to respond dynamically and rapidly, after infection prior to the activation of the adaptive immune system.

AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods have recently witnessed ever expanding application in bioanalysis, but it is still desirable to further simplify the sensing procedures and develop simple and reliable PEC biosensing approaches. Herein, we proposed a truly label-free and immobilization-free PEC sensing platform, utilizing solution-phase methylene blue (MB) as the signal probe, and bare indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as the photoelectrode. Based on the diffusivity difference between free MB molecules and MB intercalated in DNA G-quadruplex, the activity and inhibition of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam), a proof-of-concept methyltransferase (MTase), is quantitatively analyzed. By taking advantage of the endonuclease-catalyzed cleavage of the Dam-methylated hairpin DNA probe, as well as the KF polymerase/Nt.AlwI endonuclease-aided signal amplification, highly sensitive and specific PEC detection of Dam activity has been achieved. Moreover, this approach can be easily extended to assay other types of MTase by choosing the appropriate methylation-sensitive endonucleases. The as-proposed strategy has also been successfully applied to analyze Dam spiked in human serum samples and to assess the inhibitory effects of antibiotics on Dam activity. More importantly, this label-free and truly immobilization-free PEC biosensing strategy shows additional merits of simplicity and satisfactory repeatability, due to the elimination of both labelling and immobilization procedures, making it a promising candidate for the application in highly sensitive, facile and reliable bioanalysis and drug screening.

AB Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), is a highly contagious virus due to its ease of transmission. FMDV has seven genetically distinguished serotypes with many subtypes within each serotype. The traditional diagnostic methods of FMDV have demonstrated many drawbacks related to sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity. In the current study, a new viral imprinted polymer (VIP)-based biosensor was designed and fabricated for the rapid and selective detection of the FMDV. The bio-recognition components were formed via electrochemical polymerization of the oxidized O-aminophenol (O-AP) film imprinted with FMDV serotype O on a gold screen-printed electrode (SPE). The overall changes in the design template have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Optimal conditions were achieved through investigating the capturing efficiency, binding stability, selectivity and life-time of the developed biosensor. The results depicted a high selectivity of the biosensor to the serotype O over all other genus serotypes A, SAT2 and Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), as well as, the inactivated serotype O. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were around 2 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL, respectively, in addition to the tested repeatability and reproducibility values with a variance coefficient of 1.0% and 3.6%, respectively. In comparison with the reference methods (ELISA and PCR), the analysis of saliva real samples using the developed affordable biosensor offered 50 folds lower LOD with the possibility of an on-line monitoring in the field with no prior sample treatment.

AB Accurate analysis of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) with portable devices remain an elusive goal that have received widespread investigative attention in the areas of environmental contamination and disease prevention. Herein, using all-in-one enzyme-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers (ACC-HNFs) to fabricate high-performance artificial enzyme cascade system, we established a sensitive and affordable lab-on-paper biosensor. This biosensor incorporated disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and colorimetric test strips, which enabled the dual-modal readout (electrochemical and colorimetric signal) for on-site monitoring of OPs, achieving an "ondemand" tuning of the detection performance. Using paraoxon as a model analyte, the ACC-HNFs-based lab-onpaper platform could reach a limit of detection down to the femtogram/mL level (6 fg mL(-1)). Meticulous design of ACC-HNFs provided a versatile approach for constructing artificial enzyme as a recognizer and amplifier to fill the gap in constructing robust artificial enzyme systems which can be used for on-site contamination monitoring and biological diagnosis.

AB The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is an RNA-guided DNA-nuclease that is part of the bacterial adaptive immune system. CRISPR/Cas9 RNP has been adapted for targeted genome editing within cells and whole organisms with new applications vastly outpacing detection and quantification of gene-editing reagents. Detection of the CRISPR/Cas9 RNP within biological samples is critical for assessing gene-editing reagent delivery efficiency, retention, persistence, and distribution within living organisms. Conventional detection methods are effective, yet the expense and lack of scalability for antibody-based affinity reagents limit these techniques for clinical and/or field settings. This necessitates the development of low cost, scalable CRISPR/Cas9 RNP affinity reagents as alternatives or augments to antibodies. Herein, we report the development of the Streptococcus pyogenes antiCRISPR/Cas9 protein, AcrIIA4, as a novel affinity reagent. An engineered cysteine linker enables covalent immobilization of AcrIIA4 onto glassy carbon electrodes functionalized via aryl diazonium chemistry for detection of CRISPR/Cas9 RNP by electrochemical, fluorescent, and colorimetric methods. Electrochemical measurements achieve a detection of 280 pM RNP in reaction buffer and 8 nM RNP in biologically representative conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability of anti-CRISPR proteins to serve as robust, specific, flexible, and economical recognition elements in biosensing/quantification devices for CRISPR/Cas9 RNP.

AB The steady increase in commercialization of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) demands low-cost, rapid and portable GMO-detection methods that are technically and economically sustainable. Traditional nucleic acid detection platforms are still expensive, immobile and generate complex read-outs to be analyzed by experienced personal. Herein, we report the development of a portable, rapid and user-friendly GMO-detection biosensor, DaimonDNA. The system specifically amplifies the target DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and provides real-time, naked-eye detection with Hydroxynaphthol blue reagent in less than 30 min. The construction of the platform relies on 3D printing and off-the-shelf electronic components that makes it extremely low-cost (< 25 Euro), light weight (108 g), mobile (6 x 6 x 3 cm) and suitable for field deployment. We present the detection of the soybean lectin gene as a species control, and P35S as a transgene element found in many GMO varieties. We confirmed specificity of the DaimonDNA biosensor using" RoundUp Ready (RRS)" and MON89788 soybean genomic DNA with P35S and lectin primer sets. We characterized sensitivity of our system using 76.92, 769.2 and 7692 copies of RRS soybean genomic DNA in a non-GMO background. We benchmarked the DNA amplification and detection efficiency of our system against a thermocycling machine by quantifying the images obtained from gel electrophoresis and showed that our system is comparable to most other reported isothermal amplification techniques. This system can also be used for widespread point-of-care or field-based testing that is infrequently performed due to the lack of rapid, inexpensive, user-friendly and portable methods.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures developed with living cells and scaffolds have demonstrated outstanding potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. However, no suitable tools are available to monitor dynamically variable cell behavior in such a complex microenvironment. In particular, simultaneously assessing cell behavior, cell secretion, and the general state of a 3D culture system is of a really challenging task. This paper presents our development of a dual-transduction-integrated biosensing system that assesses electrical impedance in conjunction with imaging techniques to simultaneously investigate the 3D cell-culture for bone regeneration. First, we created models to mimic the dynamic deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in 3D culture, which underwent osteogenesis by incorporating different amounts of bone-ECM components (collagen, hydroxyapatite [HAp], and hyaluronic acid [HA]) into alginate-based hydrogels. The formed models were investigated by means of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with the results showing that the impedances increased linearly with collagen and hyaluronan, but changed in a more complex manner with HAp. Thereafter, we created two models that consisted of primary osteoblast cells (OBs), which expressed the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and 4T1 cells, which secreted the EGFP-HA, in the alginate hydrogel. We found the capacitance (associated with impedance and measured by EIS) increased with the increases in initial embedded OBs, and also confirmed the cell proliferation over 3 days with the EGFP signal as monitored by the fluorescent imaging component in our system. Interestingly, the change in capacitance is found to be associated with OB migration following stimulation. Also, we show higher capacitance in 4T1 cells that secret HA when compared to control 4T1 cells after a 3-day culture. Taken together, we demonstrate that our biosensing system is able to investigate the dynamic process of 3D culture in a non-invasive and real-time manner.

AB Over the last decade, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were an indispensable methodology for diagnosing cancers, viral and bacterial infections owing to their high sensitivity and specificity. Because the NAATs can recognize and discriminate even a few copies of nucleic acid (NA) and species-specific NA sequences, NAATs have become the gold standard in a wide range of applications. However, limitations of NAAT approaches have recently become more apparent by reason of their lengthy run time, large reaction volume, and complex protocol. To meet the current demands of clinicians and biomedical researchers, new NAATs have developed to achieve ultrafast sample-to-answer protocols for the point-of-care testing (POCT). In this review, ultrafast NA-POCT platforms are discussed, outlining their NA amplification principles as well as delineating recent advances in ultrafast NAAT applications. The main focus is to provide an overview of NA-POCT platforms in regard to sample preparation of NA, NA amplification, NA detection process, interpretation of the analysis, and evaluation of the platform design. Increasing importance will be given to innovative, ultrafast amplification methods and tools which incorporate artificial intelligence (AI)-associated data analysis processes and mobile-healthcare networks. The future prospects of NA POCT platforms are promising as they allow absolute quantitation of NA in individuals which is essential to precision medicine.

AB In this work, a double-layered three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) with high resolution temporally resolved chemiluminescence (CL) emissions were designed for multiplexed CL analysis. The temporally resolved CL emissions were obtained by virtue of the 3D branched microfluidic channel design, which create time delays for luminol transported from one detection zone to another. The peak intensity and peak shape of the temporally resolved CL emissions were quite stable and base-line separated with resolution as high as 21.2-24.4. Then, the fabricated mu PAD was applied to multiplexed determination of glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and choline as model analytes. The sample was added to four detection zone modified with CL catalyst cobalt ion and different oxidase by virtue of chitosan. When luminol flowed to mu PAD, four temporally resolved CL peaks were successively generated from the cobalt ion catalyzed CL reactions between luminol and generated H2O2 from the specific enzymatic reactions between the oxidase and the analytes. The generated four CL emission peaks in the CL kinetic curve increased in proportion to the concentrations of glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and choline, respectively. Finally, four linear calibration curves were obtained for the detection of glucose (0.01-1.0 mmol/L), lactate (0.02-5.0 mmol/L), cholesterol (0.01-0.4 mmol/L), and choline (0.001-1.0 mmol/L). The detection limits were as low as 8 mu mol/L, 15 mu mol/L, 6 mu mol/L, and 0.07 mu mol/L for glucose, lactate, choline, and cholesterol detection, respectively. The present work provides a new strategy for the fabrication of simple and sensitive 3D mu PAD with high resolution temporally resolved CL emissions for multiplexed CL analysis, which holds great application potential for point-of-care diagnosis.

AB Thrombus formation is quantitatively measured and evaluated by the electrical impedance spectroscopy method in this study, which confirms the possibility for the application of a promising non-invasive thrombus detection method. The impedance parameter Z*(t) of blood from the electrical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to elaborate the impedance performance of blood during thrombus formation process. Experimental results indicate that the impedance Z*(t) of blood has regular variations under the formation of thrombus, which could be divided into three stages. Modified Hanai equation is proposed to quantitatively expound the three stages of impedance Z*(t) variation. The amount of fibrin and thrombus clot is founded to be accounted for the impedance variation of blood, which confirms the feasibility and theoretical basis of the non-invasive and on-line thrombus bio-detection technology for patients with serious cardiovascular disease.

AB Traditional electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assays all indispensably require the immobilization of enzyme or nanomaterials on electrode surface. These complex electrode surface modifications are laborious and time-consuming. To overcome such limitations, we developed here a facile homogeneous electrochemical biosensor based on displacement reaction for detection of intracellular and extracellular H2O2 produced by living cells. Methylene blue-labeled short single-stranded DNA strand (DNA-MB) was ingeniously designed as the reporter, which was adsorbed on CeO2 nanoparticles to result in low electrochemical signal. In the presence of H2O2, DNA-MB was released from CeO2 nanoparticles, leading to the significant enhancement of current signal. Therefore, a simple homogeneous electrochemical H2O2 assay is successfully achieved. This strategy also displays excellent anti-interference capability and reproducibility for H2O2 determination. More importantly, this method was capable of conveniently realizing intracellular and extracellular H2O2 assay. Thus, with the excellent merits of simplicity, rapidness, good repeatability, high specific and sensitivity, the proposed strategy has great potential to be applied in exploring the roles of H2O2 in physiological and pathological processes.

AB In the present work, peptide-functionalized upconversion@silica nanoparticle (termed as UCNP@SiO2@Cy5-pep)-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing platform has been fabricated for the detection of caspase-9 activity in vitro and in vivo. A Cy5 labeled peptide containing specific motif LEHD for caspase-9 cleavage was designed and conjugated with UCNP@SiO2 through covalent attachment. The red upconversion luminescence (UCL) emission of UCNP@SiO2 can be quenched by Cy5 while the green UCL emission of UCNP@SiO2 remains undisturbed. After the cleavage of LEHD by caspase-9, the Cy5 departed from UCNP@SiO2 surface, resulting in recovery of red UCL emission of UCNP@SiO2. The UCNP@SiO2@Cy5-pep has been successfully used to monitoring the changes of caspase-9 activity levels in apoptotic cancerous cells (MG-63 and SW480) by cisplatin-induction. Under same experimental conditions, it is found that the intracellular caspase-9 activity level of cisplatin-treated MG-63 cells is higher than that of cisplatin-treated SW480. This result is consistent with that of commercial caspase-9 activity kits. The UCL signal intensity ratio of red emission to green emission of UCNP (termed as R/G) is linearly dependent on the amount of MG-63 cells within the range of 5 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(6) cells (i.e., 0.5-100 U mL(-1) caspase-9) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 675 cells (i.e., 0.068 U mL(-1) caspase-9). Furthermore, the practicability of UCNP@SiO2@Cy5-pep is demonstrated by detection of caspase-9 activities in tumor tissues in vivo, and satisfactory results are obtained.

AB Development of a very sensitive biosensor is accompanied with an inevitable shrinkage in the linear detection range. Here, we developed an electrochemical biosensor with a novel methodology to detect microRNA-21 (miR21) at an ultralow level and broad linear detection range. A three-way junction RNA structure was designed harboring (i) a methylene blue (MB)-modified hairpin structure at its one leg to function as the sensing moiety and (ii) the other two legs to be further hybridized with barcode gold nanoparticles (MB/barG) as the signal amplifiers. Addition of target miR21 resulted in opening the hairpin moiety and subsequent hybridization with DNA-modified gold nanoflower/platinum electrode (GNF@Pt) to form the MB-3 sensor. Inspired by the relayrace run, to extend the dynamic detection range and increase the sensitivity of the biosensor, MB/barG was added to form the second detection modality (MBG-3). The combined sensor required very low sample volume (4 mu L) and could identify 135 aM or 324 molecules of miR21 with the ability to operate within a wide linear range from 1 mu M down to 500 aM. The fabricated GNF@Pt showed a remarkable conductivity compared with the gold nanoparticle-modified electrode. Addition of MB/barG boosted the electrochemical signal of the MB by almost 230 times. Moreover, a new protocol was introduced by the authors to increase the efficiency of microRNA extraction from the total serum. Possessing a sound selectivity and specificity towards single base-pair mutations, the developed biosensor could profile cancer development stages of two patient serums.

AB Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is very useful, non-invasive tool for the analysis of surfaces pre-modified with biomolecules or by whole cells. This review focuses on the application of SECM technique for the analysis of surfaces pre-modified with enzymes (horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and glucose oxidase) or labelled with antibody-enzyme conjugates. The working principles and operating modes of SECM are outlined. The applicability of feedback, generation-collection and redox competition modes of SECM on surfaces modified by enzymes or labelled with antibody-enzyme conjugates is discussed. SECM is important in the development of miniaturized bioanalytical systems with enzymes, since it can provide information about the local enzyme activity. Technical challenges and advantages of SECM, experimental parameters, used enzymes and redox mediators, immunoassay formats and analytical parameters of enzymatic SECM sensors and immunosensors are reviewed.

AB Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an important oncomarker for the detection of breast cancer. For ultra-sensitive sensing of CEA with great specificity and accuracy, an innovative and reliable electrochemical immunosensor was developed using various nano-hybrids. A glassy carbon electrode (GC) was modified with thiolated graphene oxide (T-GO) to elevate the active surface area of the electrode. The streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used to increase the conductivity of the sensing area as well as the loading capacity of the biotinylated monoclonal antibody (mAb). A sandwich-on approach was developed to reach a low limit of detection (LOD). The biotinylated mAb, streptavidin coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), altogether, formed the signaling probe of the proposed immunosensor. The electrochemical signal was significantly enhanced in the presence of hydroquinone (HQ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Under the optimized conditions, the proposed immunosensor presented an excellent performance in a linear range of 100 fg/mL to 5 pg/mL with a low detection limit of 75 fg/mL. The engineered immunosensor displayed excellent specificity for the detection of CEA even in the real human serum, upon which it is proposed for the early detection and monitoring of CEA in the clinic.

AB The technological quest for flexible devices to be interfaced with the biological world has driven the recent reinvention of bioderived polymers as multifunctional active and passive constituent elements for electronic and photonic devices to use in the biomedical field. Keratin is one of the most important structural proteins in nature to be used as biomaterial platform in view of the recently reported advances in the extraction and processing from hair and wool fibers. In this article we report for the first time the simultaneous use of naturally extracted keratin as both active ionic electrolyte for water ions sensing and as bendable and insoluble substrate into the same multielectrode array-based device. We implemented the multifunctional system exclusively made by keratin as a bendable sensor for monitoring the humidity flow.
   The enhancement of the functional and structural properties of keratin such as bendability and insolubility were obtained by unprecedented selective chemical doping. The mechanisms at the basis of the sensing of humidity in the device were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and rationalized by reversible binding and extraction of water ions from the volume of the keratin active layer, while the figures of merit of the biopolymer such as the ionic conductivity and relaxation time were determined by means of electrical impedance and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. A reliable linear correlation between the controlled-humidity level and the amperometric output signal together with the assessment on measure variance are demonstrated. Collectively, the fine-tuned ionic-electrical characterization and the validation in controlled conditions of the free-standing insoluble all-keratin made microelectrode array ionic sensor pave the way for the effective use of keratin biopolymer in wearable or edible electronics where conformability, reliability and biocompatibility are key-enabling features.

AB A sensor for the determination of guanine (G) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is developed based on Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogues hollow nanocubes (Ni-Fe PBA HNCs) for the first time. As a remarkable redox probe towards G and H2O2 oxidation, Ni-Fe PBA HNCs exhibit a series of predominant sensing performances as follows: lower limit of detection, broader linear range and higher selectivity due to the homogeneous hollow structure, high specific surface and the enhanced electron transfer ability of Ni-Fe PBA HNCs. As a G sensor, it exhibits a wide linear range (0.05-4.0 mM) and a low detection limit of 0.0104 mu M (S/N = 3). As a H2O2 sensor, the Ni-Fe PBA HNCs show superior sensing performances with a low detection limit of 0.291 mu M (S/N = 3) and a wide detection range of 0.1-20 mM. By cause of these advantages, the real-time detection of G and H2O2 in human saliva are triumphantly accomplishment, indicating the applicability of Ni-Fe PBA HNCs.

AB Development of ultra-sensitive, high specific and cost-effective nucleic acids (NM) biosensors is critical for early diagnosis of cancer, genetic diseases and follows up response to treatment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sensing materials underwent significant development in recent years due to their unique merits, such as structural diversity, tunable pore scale, large surface area, remarkable adsorption affinities, and good thermal stability. MOFs have shown potential contribution in nucleic acids biosensors research. Herein, a comprehensive overview on NM biosensors state of the art based on MOFs has been discussed extensively, including different MOFs platforms sensing strategies (fluorescence, electrochemistry, electrochemiluminescence, and colorimetric techniques), their analytical performance and figures of merit in clinical diagnostics, with the future perspective in introducing MOFs in clinical laboratory diagnostics. Moreover, the different MOFs synthesis methods have been highlighted to serve as a guide for the researchers in selecting the appropriate platform that suits their research needs, and applications.

AB In this paper, a 3-coil inductive WPT system having circular shaped external coil and miniaturized spherical shaped implantable coil is designed and optimized at 13.56 MHz to overcome reduced PTE under misalignment conditions. The external coil is placed at a distance of 10 mm from the implantable coil. The proposed design is referred to as C-S WPT system. To evaluate the performance of the C-S WPT system, a 3-coil inductive WPT system having circular shaped external coil and circular shaped implantable coil is designed and is referred to as C-C WPT system. The impacts of perfect alignment, lateral and/or angular misalignments on the overall PTE of the systems are analyzed and compared. At perfect alignment, the PTE of C-C and C-S WPT systems are 59.8% and 52.6%, respectively. Though the PTE of C-C WPT system is slightly higher than C-S WPT system, there is a sharp decrease in PTE of C-C system for angles greater than 40 degrees. At 90 degrees of angular misalignment, the PTE's of C-C and C-S WPT systems are 0.4% and 5.6% respectively. When the coils are laterally displaced by a distance of 10 mm, the C-C and C-S WPT systems produce PTE of 33.4% and 27.1% respectively. The C-C and C-S WPT systems attain PTE of 1.6% and 5.5% respectively at 10 mm displacement and 50 degrees rotation. The simulated systems are fabricated to analyze the result in real-environment. The measurement results show that the C-S WPT system provides better PTE when compared to C-C WPT system under angular and a combination of angular and lateral misalignments.

AB We focused on the development of a hand-held pathogen-detection device using smartphone-embedded electronic elements combined with functionalized magnetic particles (MPs) and sepharose. To perform affinity chromatography for evaluating DNA amplicons, avidin-conjugated MPs and succinimide-linked sepharose were used with biotin-primers. To mimic the centrifugal-based affinity ligand chromatography, a smartphone-mountable low-power fan was plugged into the charging port of a smartphone. The charging port stably emitted electric current at 3.0 V, and the fan blades were modified for use as a portable rotor. Based on the binding variation of MPs with DNA amplicons, the position of MPs in sepharose changed significantly during centrifugation. The change in distance was optically analyzed using the illumination sensor of the smartphone with respect to the altered transmittance due to the MPs. Amplified genes from Escherichia. coli O157:H7 samples ranging from 1.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(6) colony-forming units could be rapidly and immediately detected by the naked eye using a simple smartphone-based optical device. The results indicated that this novel biosensing technique is suitable for use as a point-of-care testing device in both industrial and clinical fields.

AB Development of a simple, cost-effective and sensitive biosensing strategy is highly desirable to advance the applications in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a simple, label-free and signal-on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor for the detection of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide using luminol as ECL emitter and in-situ generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as coreactant via catalytic reaction between Cu2+-A beta and the dissolved O-2 in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). A beta(16), the binding site of Cu2+ in the monomeric full-length A beta, was used as a model in present study. As a result, this signal-on ECL aptasensor has exhibited favorable analytical performance for A beta(16) monomer with a linear range of 1.0 x 10(-13) mol/L-1.0 x 10(-8) mol/L and a limit of detection of 3.5 x 10(-14) mol/L (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the proposed biosensor was also able to detect the full length A beta(40) not only in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution but also in human serum. The presented biosensor represents a promising, simple, turn-on and label-free diagnostic tool for blood analysis.

AB Lateral flow paper-based biosensors merge as powerful tools in point-of-care diagnostics since they are cheap, portable, robust, selective, fast and easy to use. However, the sensitivity of this type of biosensors is not always as high as required, often not permitting a clear quantification. To improve the colorimetric response of standard lateral flow strips (LFs), we have applied a new enhancement strategy that increases the sensitivity of LFs based on the use of cellulose nanofibers (CNF). CNF penetrate inside the pores of LFs nitrocellulose paper, compacting the pore size only in the test line, particularly near the surface of the strip. This modification retains the bioreceptors (antibodies) close to the surface of the strips, and thus further increasing the density of selectively attached gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the top part of the membrane, in the test line area, only when the sample is positive. This effect boosts in average a 36.6% the sensitivity of the LFs. The optical measurements of the LFs were carried out with a mobile phone camera whose imaging resolution was improved by attaching microscopic lens on the camera objective. The characterization of CNF into paper and their effect was analyzed using atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging techniques.

AB The pragmatic outcome of a lung cancer diagnosis is closely interrelated in reducing the number of fatal death caused by the world's top cancerous disease. Regardless of the advancement made in understanding lung tumor, and its multimodal treatment, in general the percentage of survival remain low. Late diagnosis of a cancerous cell in patients is the major hurdle for the above circumstances. In the new era of a lung cancer diagnosis with low cost, portable and non-invasive clinical sampling, nanotechnology is at its inflection point where current researches focus on the implementation of biosensor conjugated nanomaterials for the generation of the ideal sensing. The present review encloses the superiority of nanomaterials from zero to three-dimensional nanostructures in its discrete and nanocomposites nanotopography on sensing lung cancer biomarkers. Recent researches conducted on definitive nanomaterials and nanocomposites at multiple dimension with distinctive physiochemical property were focused to subside the cases associated with lung cancer through the development of novel biosensors. The hurdles encountered in the recent research and future preference with prognostic clinical lung cancer diagnosis using multidimensional nanomaterials and its composites are presented.

AB An impedimetric biosensor was developed for the selective detection of the cancer-associated T antigen, using the lectin from Arachis hypogaea (peanut agglutinin, PNA) as the recognition element. The increase in the biosensor's impedance after sample incubation was indicative of lectin recognition and complex formation between PNA and glycoproteins containing T antigen. When using asialofetuin as model glycoprotein, a minimum amount of 100 ng of glycoprotein could be detected, generating an increase in impedance of 7.2%. Albumin did not cause interference in the detection of T-carrying glycoproteins up to a concentration of 0.01 mg ml(-1).
   The biosensor was used to evaluate the T-antigen expression in serum samples and was able to discriminate between control samples (of individuals without cancer) and case samples from patients with diverse types of carcinomas (skin, colon, breast, prostate, stomach, kidney, lung, liver and rectum) in which an increase in the expression of T antigen is well-known. The same samples were analyzed with a Vicia villosa agglutinin biosensor that has specificity for the cancer-associated Tn antigen, to compare the expression of both antigens in the diverse carcinomas. The results were different for both biosensors, confirming that the use of different lectins allows to monitor different antigen expression. Furthermore, combining different lectins, glycosylation profiles for each carcinoma type can be obtained.
   This work demonstrates the feasibility of employing PNA to selectively recognize the T epitope in glycoproteins and the proposed biosensor could be used for high-throughput, label-free profiling of the cancer-associated T antigen in serum samples.

AB Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrochemical immunosensor has been developed for rapid detection of urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) - a biomarker for cancer. uPAR is a GPI-anchored cell membrane receptor that shows increased expression in many types of human cancers which include breast, prostate, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, a novel ultrasensitive FTO graphene nanosheets based electrode was used as a working probe to analyze the interaction between urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and monoclonal uPAR antibody (Ab). Graphene nanosheets (GNS) exhibited high conductivity, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the immunochemical assay. GNS were coupled with uPAR-Ab via carbodiimide activation chemistry with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as a heterobifunctional crosslinker. The confirmation of immobilization events was done by biophysical methods such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), differential pulse (DPV), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The immobilization conditions were optimized in accordance with the best sensor response. Under optimum conditions, the proposed sensor displayed wide linear detection range (1 fM to 1 mu M) with a detection limit of 4.8 fM in standard. The developed sensor was profitably engaged to detect uPA in spiked serum samples up to 9.2 pM. Furthermore, the developed uPAR immunosensor showed good reproducibility, repeatability, and storage stability (75% of initial activity observed up to 4 weeks). FTO/GNS/uPAR-Ab/uPA-Ag immunosensor displayed acceptable performance for detection of uPA and exhibited low detection limit with high reproducibility. The proposed immunosensor is 'easy to use', highly specific, and can be used as a quantitative tool making it a tenable alternate for the detection of uPAR in cancer patients.

AB Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder lasting for the lifetime of a person. Glucose and insulin are the main indicators in the monitoring and control of this disease. Most often, various laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and control of diabetes. Among them, the estimation of blood glucose concentration is one of the main diagnostic criteria. Proper control of the blood glucose level can delay, and to a greater extent, prevent complications. Thus, blood glucose monitoring is a requisite tool in the management of diabetes mellitus. Insulin plays a major role in glucose metabolism and its determination is of great value in the diagnosis and control of diabetes. An uncountable number of biosensors have been developed based on various mechanisms which will make sure a continuous glucose as well as insulin monitoring. Biosensors became the most sophisticated tool for the detection of glucose and insulin and they are of different types. Enzymatic, non-enzymatic, electrochemical, optical, non-invasive, and continuous monitoring biosensors are discussed in this review. In recent years, there is progress towards the development of nanobiosensors using various nanomaterials. Here, we have reviewed the fabrication, modification, and recent approaches associated with insulin and glucose biosensors for the treatment of diabetes.

AB Flexible and wearable biosensors have great potential to interface with skin and noninvasively extract biofluids for real time and continuous monitoring of physiological status. Soft electronics is the prime factor in these wearables, regardless of sensing mechanism and fabrication technology. Wireless connectivity would be a valuable addition to enhance wearable biosensor's scope for remote and resource limited settings. These skin-adaptable, user-friendly, battery-free (although not all), and noninvasive devices continuously and simultaneously monitor wearer well-being and transfer data wirelessly. Thus, they have a great potential to improve quality of life with timely diagnostics and hence early treatments. However, they remain in the early stages, with relatively conventional sensing modalities, battery requirements, soft electronics fabrication limitations, and practicable size restrictions to retain skin compatibility. We classify wearable biosensors by sensing functionality, such as skin temperature, pH, heart rate, sweat glucose, uric acid, sweat electrolyte, cerebrospinal shunt flow, and toxic chemicals, and discuss challenges and prospects for these biosensors.

AB Abnormal protein concentration levels in human body fluids, such as urine, serum etc., are considered to associate with disease states, providing essential information for the pre-clinical diagnosis. This paper presents a wireless immunoglobulin-coated magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor for fast, cost-effective detections of human serum albumin (HSA) with small sample volumes at a microliter scale. This is the first portable resonant sensor based on magnetostrictive effect that can monitor different molecular states of HSA. Anti-HSA Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was immobilized on the surface of the ME sensor to selectively capture HSA. The rapid conjugation between the antibody and antigen changed the sensor surface states and thus induced resonance frequency shifts (RFS), which were monitored in real time for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of HSA. This paper brings forward a System on Chip (SoC)-based system architecture to realize the function of RFS sampling. The performance of the portable device was validated to be comparable to that of the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) AV3620 using different concentrations of HSA solution. The RFS were linearly proportional to the HSA concentrations in the range from 0.1 to 100 mu g/mL with a linearity up to 0.998, a sensitivity of 8.70 Hz/mu g.mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.039 mu g/mL, indicating good feasibility of this method. Meanwhile, the response of this portable ME biosensor was quick and specific to HSA targets. This ME biosensor shows high potential to be used in diagnosing abnormal HSA.

AB A highly sensitive and selective sensor was fabricated based on Hydroxyapatite-ZnO-Pd NPs modified carbon paste electrode (HAP- ZnO-Pd NPs/CPE) for simultaneous determination of Arbutin (AT) and vitamin C (VC) for the first time. Characterization was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The modified electrode was studied by different methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The HAP- ZnO-Pd NPs/CPE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidations of AT and VC in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) and the corresponding electrochemical signals have appeared as two well resolved oxidation peaks with significant peak potential differences of 0.23 V. Kinetic parameters such as charge transfer coefficient (0.52 and 0.44 for AT and VC respectively), standard heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (0.336 s(-1) and 0.590 s(-1) for AT and VC respectively), and other electrochemical parameters were calculated via voltammetry techniques. Differential pulse voltammetry was used for simultaneous determination of AT and VC using the HAP- ZnO-Pd NPs/CPE electrode. At the optimum conditions, for simultaneous determination by synchronous change of the analyte concentrations, the linear response ranges were between 0.12-56 mu M for AT and 0.12-55.36 mu M for VC with detection limits of 85.7 and 19.4 mu M respectively while sensitivity of proposed sensor for AT and VC was 0.98 mu A/mu M and 0.94 mu A/mu M. Reproducibility (intra-; 1.16% and 1.16% for AT and VC respectively and inter-electrode reproducibility of 2.03% and 3.28 for AT and VC respectively), and response time about 3.5 min were obtained. Furthermore, HAP- ZnO-Pd NPs/CPE was successfully applied for the independent determination of VC in fruit juice as well as the simultaneous determination of AT and VC in lightening cream samples.

AB We report on facile synthesis and characterization of phosphate-functionalized polymer dots (PDs) by doping tributyl phosphate (TBP) in a semiconducting polymer poly[9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-1,4-benzo-{2,103}-thiadiazole)] (PFBT). Then, the prepared TBP@PFBT PDs were used to develop a very high sensitive probe for detection Fe3+, Cu2+ ions and Cytochrome c based on aggregation induced fluorescence off mechanism. The PDs exhibited a linear dynamic range for Fe3+ from 0.1 to 2 nM with a detection limit of 30 pM and for Cu2+ from 2.0 to 50.0 nM with a detection limit of 0.35 nM. Meanwhile, this probe showed a linear dynamic range for Cyt c from 175 to 1750 pM with a detection limit of 32.7 pM. The TBP@PFBT PDs is a simple, one-step, fast, noninvasive, label-free, and inexpensive probe that is capable of online apoptosis monitoring response to drugs with an ever-present opportunity to contribute in a variety of in-vitro and in-vivo biological applications. We also obtained sharp, specific 2D and 3D imaging results for early stage apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Moreover, this technique possesses the advantage of rapid determination of Fe3+ ion in biological or environmental samples. Importantly, this label-free assay provides short determination time of only a few min, easy operation and very low LOD allowing 100-4000 times increased in sensitivity over previously reported probes, together with high selectivity without need to using biorecognition elements like enzymes, antibodys and/or aptamers. Such excellent features make the TBP@PFBT PDs an excellent probe for successful apoptosis imaging in live cells.

AB Fascinating properties of ZnO nanostructures have created much interest due to their importance in health care and environmental monitoring. Current worldwide production and their wide range of applications signify ZnO to be a representative of multi-functional oxide material. Recent nanotechnological developments have stimulated the production of various forms of ZnO nanostructures such as nano-layers, nanoparticles, nanowires, etc. Due to their enhanced sensing properties, improved binding ability with biomolecules as well as biological activities have enabled them as suitable candidates for the fabrication of biosensor devices in the biomedical arena. In this review, the synthesis of ZnO nanostructures, mechanism of their interaction with biomolecules and their applications as sensors in health care area are discussed considering the biosensors for molecules with small molecular weight, infectious diseases, and pharmaceutical compounds.

AB A main challenge for biomimetic non-enzyme biosensors is to achieve high selectivity. Herein, an innovative biomimetic non-enzyme sensor for electrochemical detection of uric acid (UA) with high selectivity and sensitivity is realized by growing Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-doped CNTs). The enhancement mechanism of the biomimetic UA sensor is proposed to be atomically matched active sites between two reaction sites (oxygen atoms of 2, 8-trione, 6.9 angstrom) of UA molecule and two redox centers (Fe-II on the diagonal, 7.2 angstrom) of PB. Such an atomically matching manner not only promotes strong adsorption of UA on PB but also selectively enhances electron transfer between reaction sites of UA and active Fe-II centers of PB. This biomimetic UA sensor can offer great selectivity to avoid interferences from other oxidative and reductive species, showing excellent selectivity. An electrochemical biomimetic sensor based on PB/N-doped CNTs was applied to in situ detect UA in human serum, delivering a wide dynamic detection range (0.001-1 mM) and a low detection limit (0.26 mu M). This work provides a high-performance UA sensor while shedding a scientific light on using atomic matching catalysis to fabricate highly sensitive and selective biomimetic sensors.

AB The molecular imprinting techniques with interferometric platform are promising for next-generation optical sensors for online and remote biosensing and device applications. This technique has shown a tremendous potential to provide a highly specific detection of target analyte/molecule with artificial complementary scaffolds in the polymeric nanostructures relay with tunable aspect ratio, low cost synthesis procedure and applicability in harsh environment. To date, no molecular imprinted nanoparticles has been integrated with optical microwire platform in the literature. Here, we report the synthesis of a molecularly imprinted nanocarrier using hydrothermal process that act as receptors and combines optical microwire as transducing support. The detailed sensing process for one of the widely used pesticides (parathion methyl) in the detection range of 10(-12) to 10(-4) M with hyper-sensitivity and detection limit of 1.30 x 10(12) nm/M and 79.43 fM respectively have been achieved. The compact sensing probe tested with real water samples collected from various sources show percentage recovery of around 100%. We strongly believe that the process for probe development will open a new gateway for next generation selective biosensing for biomedical research applications.

AB This work reports a new paper-based sensing platform and its application in a label-free potentiometric immunosensor for Salmonella typhimurium detection based on the blocking surface principle. A paper-based strip electrode was integrated with a filter paper pad which acted as a reservoir of the internal solution. The design offers a convenient platform for antibody immobilization and sampling, proving also that is a simple and affordable methodology to control an ionic flux through a polymer membrane.
   Two different immunosensing interfaces were assembled on the developed paper-strip electrode. The simplest interface relied on direct conjugation of the antibody to the polymer membrane and the second one resorted to an intermediate layer of a polyamidoamine dendrimer, with an ethylenediamine core from the fourth generation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to assess the successive interface modification steps and the resulting analytical performance of both immunosensors was compared. For such, the potential shift derived from the blocking effect of the ionic flux caused by antigen-antibody conjugation was correlated with the logarithm of the Salmonella typhimurium concentration in the sample. In optimized conditions, a limit of detection of 5 cells mL(-1) was achieved. As a proof-of-concept, the proposed method was applied to apple juice samples, demonstrating to be a suitable prototype to be used in real scenarios in useful time ( < 1 h assay).

AB Using an external redox-active molecule as a DNA hybridization indicator is still a popular strategy in electrochemical DNA biosensors because it is label-free and the multi-site binding can enhance the response signal. A planar and uncharged transition metal complex, Cu(PA)(2) (PA = picolinic acid) with excellent electrochemical activity has been synthesized and its interaction with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is studied by experimental electrochemical methods and theoretical molecular docking technology. The experimental results reveal that the copper complex interacts with dsDNA via specific intercalation, which is verified by the molecular docking result. The surface-based voltammetric analysis demonstrates that the planar Cu(PA)(2) can effectively accumulate within the electrode-confined hybridized duplex DNA rather than the single-stranded probe DNA. Based on this phenomenon, the Cu(PA)(2) is utilized as an electrochemical hybridization indicator for the detection of oligo-nucleotides. The sensing assays show that upon incubation in Cu(PA)(2) solution, the probe electrode does not display any Faraday signal, but the hybridized one has a pair of strong redox peaks corresponding to the electrochemistry of Cu(PA)(2), showing excellent hybridization indicating function of Cu(PA)(2) without background interference. The signal intensity of Cu(PA)(2) is dependent on the concentrations of the target oligonucleotide ranging from 1 fM to 100 nM with an experimental detection limit of 1.0 fM. Due to the specific intercalation of Cu(PA)(2) with dsDNA, the biosensor also exhibits good ability to recognize oligonucleotide with different base mismatching degree.

AB This study describes the construction of highly-sensitive photo-electrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for the detection of neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The biosensing platform is comprised of photo-active NiWO4 nanostructures, in-situ-grown over a conductive substrate (indium tin oxide) using a low-temperature template-based co-precipitation approach. The discussed approach enables the formation of discrete, yet morphologically-analogous, nanostructures with complete coverage (pinhole-free) of the electrode surface. The in-situ-grown nanostructure possess dense population with sharp saw-blade like morphological features that can support substantial immobilisation of anti-NSE agent. The constructed platform demonstrated excellent photo-catalytic activity towards uric acid (UA) which served as the base for the Electrochemical -mechanism (EC) based PEC inhibition sensing. The detection of NSE, relied on its obstruction in analytical signal observed for the photo-oxidation of UA after binding to the electrode surface via protein-antibody interaction. The constructed PEC immunosensor exhibits signal sensitivity up to 0.12 ng mL(-1) of NSE with excellent signal reproducibility and electrode replicability. Moreover, the constructed platform was successfully used for NSE determination in human serum samples.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently become a global health challenge due to its rapid geographical expansion, since it is associated with serious neurological anomalies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. Currently, the techniques for ZIKV diagnosis require labor-intensive, expensive and lengthy tests using sophisticated equipment. Moreover, false-positive or false-negative results can occur. In the present work, a DNA biosensor to detect ZIKV in real human serum samples was developed using an oxidized glassy carbon electrode (ox-GCE) modified with silsesquioxane-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-SiPy). This nanohybrid was characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, DLS, and XRD. The conditions for the immobilization of a ZIKV ssDNA probe on the electrode surface (ox-GCE-[AuNPs-SiPy]) were optimized by univariate and multivariate analysis. The optimized biosensor was characterized by CV, EIS and AFM experiments. The ZIKV target recognition was based on the variation of the charge transfer resistance (Delta R-ct) of the redox marker ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-)) used and the roughness (R-q) of the electrode surface. The proposed biosensor presented a LOD of 0.82 pmol L-1, with a linear range of 1.0 x10(-12) - 1.0 x10(-6) mol L-1. Moreover, the reported device showed a suitable stability and satisfactory sensitivity and selectivity to quantify ZIKV in human serum samples, which suggests its promising clinical applications for the early diagnosis of ZIKV-associated pathologies.

AB Enhancing the efficiency of antibody protein immobilized on a silicon nanowire-based chip for their antigens detection is reported. An external electric field (EEF) is applied to direct the orientation of antibodies during their immobilization on a chip. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the binding forces between immobilized antibody and targeting antigen under the influence of EEF at different angles. The maximum binding force under a specific angle (optimal angle; oa) of EEF (maxEEFoa) implies the optimal orientation of the antibodies on the chip. In this report, two different cancer carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules 5 (CEACAMS) & 1 (CEACAM1) were used for the examples of disease antigen detection. maxEEFoa of anti-CEACAM5 or anti-CEACAM1 immobilized on a general chip was firstly determined. Spectroscopy of AFM revealed that both binding forces were the largest ones with their antigens when maxEEFoa was applied as compared with no or other angles of EEF. These antibody proteins accompanied with the application of EEF were secondly immobilized on silicon-nanowires (n = 1000) and the field effects were measured (AI) as their target antigens were approached. Results showed that Delta I was the largest,ones when (max)EEF(oa)s (225 degrees/270 degrees and 135 degrees/180 degrees for anti-CEACAM5 and anti-CEACAM1, respectively) were applied as compared with other angles of EEF. These observations imply that the silicon nanowires together with the application of maxEEFoa as detection tools could be applied for the cancer diagnostics in the future.

AB The surface modifying linker molecules can directly influence the performance and longevity of biosensors. They must allow the attachment of biological recognition layer on the sensor surface, as well as the protection of the surface from fouling effects. Recent advances in this field identified several key factors that can increase the efficiency, stability and the anti-fouling effect of a layer formed by surface modifying linker molecules. Herein, this work presents a simple synthetic procedure, characterization, and application of a novel thiolated-PEG surface modifying molecule (DSPEG2) that could act as a multi-purpose linker for gold surfaces. The analyses of the molecular spatial distribution of DSPEG2 on gold surfaces were performed using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS). The immobilization of DSPEG2 on gold surfaces was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our preliminary results demonstrated that DSPEG2 is a promising novel linker molecule that can be applied in a wide range of biosensors based on gold surfaces.

AB Atrazine, a class 3a carcinogen, is a pesticide of chloro triazine family and is known to severely affect the human endocrine system upon consumption. The toxic effects of atrazine cause damage not only to the humans but also to animals and plants. In lieu of the detrimental effects of atrazine on environment, it is essential to develop a sensor platform capable of its detection in water. Here, we propose ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of atrazine using electrospun SnO2 nanofibers. In this study, the nanofibers have been characterized using Field Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Using a label-free transduction, we have detected atrazine in fairly low concentrations, with the limit of detection being 0.9 zM and the sensitivity being 4.11 (mu A/mu M)/cm(2), in a wide dynamic detection range varying from 1 zM to 1 mu M. Furthermore, we have reported atrazine detection in trace levels in spiked real time water samples, which is an essential step in ensuring that the sensing platform can be deployed for practical applications. In addition to this, the sensor exhibits excellent selectivity, reasonable stability (when stored at 4 degrees C), and good interference-resistance.

AB DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are key epigenetic processes involved in normal cellular function and tumorigenesis. Therapeutic strategies based on DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are currently in use and under development for the treatment of cancers. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling has been proposed for use in disease diagnosis, and histone modification profiling for disease stratification will follow suit. However, whether epigenome sequencing technologies will be feasible for rapid clinic diagnosis and patient treatment monitoring remains to be seen, and alternative detection technologies will almost certainly be needed. Here we used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) employing a graphene-based screen-printed electrode system to directly measure global DNA methylation and histone H3 acetylation to compare non-cancer and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that whilst global methylation was not useful as a differential marker in the cellular systems tested, histone H3 acetylation was effective at higher chromatin levels. Using breast and endometrial cancer cell models, EIS was then used to monitor cellular responses to the DNMT and HDAC inhibitors 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in vitro, and proved very effective at detecting global cellular responses to either treatment, indicating that this approach could be useful in following treatment response to epigenetic drugs. Moreover, this work reports the first combined analysis of two epigenetic markers using a unified graphene-based biosensor platform, demonstrating the potential for multiplex analysis of both methylation and acetylation on the same sample.

AB We report on a novel solution immersed silicon (SIS) sensor modified with bio-receptor to detect toluene. To perform this approach, bio-receptor PAS1 which specifically interacts with toluene was chosen as a capture agent for SIS ellipsometric sensing. We constructed wild PAS1 and mutant PAS1 (F46A and F79Y) which are toluene binding-defective. Especially, we utilized an easily accessible capturing approach based on silica binding peptide (SBP) for direct immobilization of PAS1 on the SiO2 surfaces. After the immobilization of SBP-tagged PAS1 to the sensing layers, PAS1-based SIS sensor was evaluated for its ability to recognize toluene. As a result, a significant up-shift in Psi (Psi) was clearly observed with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 mu M, when treated with toluene on wild PAS1-surface, but not on mutant PAS1-sensing layers, indicating the selective interactions between PAS1 and toluene molecule. The PAS1-SIS sensor showed no changes in Psi (Psi), if any, negligible, when exposed to benzene, phenol, xylene and 4-nitrophenol as negative controls, thereby demonstrating the specificity of interaction between PAS1 and toluene. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that PAS1-modified ellipsometry sensor can provide a high fidelity system for the accurate and selective detection of toluene.

AB A novel label-free photocathodic immunosensor was constructed by introducing a direct Z-scheme I-BiOCl/CdS cathodic material as highly effective photocatalyst for the selective detection of carcino embryonic antigen (CEA). The Z-scheme photocatalyst could promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and showed a more negative conduction band potential. In addition, the I-BiOCl with abundant oxygen vacancies could activate electron acceptors (i.e. O-2 and H2O2 ) and made them reduce more completely, thus the sensitivity of the photocathodic immunosensor was significantly improved. Afterward, CEA antibody (Ab) was employed for the selective recognition of CEA target, which was covalently bonded to the substrate material. The formation of immune complexes hindered the diffusion of electron acceptors, thus the photocurrent decreased. Under the optimized conditions, the photocathodic immunosensor displayed abroad linear range (0.01-40.0 ng/mL) and a low detection limit (0.002 ng/mL) for CEA detection. Furthermore, acceptable reproducibility, excellent selectivity and high anti-interference ability were achieved. This work provides a new horizon for the design and development of Z-scheme cathodic materials as photoactive material for photocathodic biosensing.

AB Amperometric enzyme biosensors are some of the simplest and cheapest types of medical devices used in the rapid detection of biomarkers that have been developed in the past fifty years. When the concentrations of biomarkers are at micromoles per liter, such as for sarcosine, which was recently discovered as a biomarker for prostate cancer, the response signal of the interferences is huge, and the biosensor is hard to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. In this manuscript, we describe a strategy for synthesizing a surface electronegative organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous material, which could reduce the interference signal much better than Nafion and Chitosan. We verify that the surface potential of the carrier nanomaterial plays an important role in excluding anionic interferences. We also prepare a sensitive (16.35 mu A mM(-1)), low LOD (0.13 mu M) and wide linear range (1-70 mu M) amperometric sarcosine biosensor with excellent anti-interference properties. This mesoporous material provides a bio-composite platform for the development of simple amperometric biosensors for detecting micromoles per liter of analytes in serum or urine.

AB The low-potential electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensors based on cathodic light emission of luminol have caused more and more concerns due to their good stability and reproducibility. In this work, highly porous platinum (Pt) nanostructures on ionic liquid functionalized graphene film (GR-IL/pPt) were prepared as platform to construct a label-free ECL sensor for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Due to their good biocompatibility, excellent electrocatalytic activity and highly porous structure, the as-prepared GR-IL/pPt composites benefited amplified cathodic ECL signal of luminol and high loading density of the CEA antibody. After CEA was incubated with the CEA antibody, the cathodic ECL signal of luminol decreased thanks to the less conductive immunocomplex. The proposed ECL immunosensor realized high sensitivity for CEA detection with a wide linear range from 0.001 fg mL(-1) to 1 ng mL(-1) and an extremely low detection limit of 0.0003 fg mL(-1)(S/N = 3). Moreover, the sensor showed good specificity, stability and reproducibility, indicating that the provided strategy had a promising potential in clinical detection.

AB Detection of a very low amount of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) in clinical fluids such as blood is important in biomedical research and clinical applications. A surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based lateral flow assay (LFA) is developed for the quantitative analysis of IL-6. The Raman reporter 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) on gold nano shell with a silica core was employed as the SERS tags. They are shown to perform much better than colloidal gold in LF strips. The IL-6 protein can be detected by this method with very low detection limits by monitoring the intensity of the characteristic Raman peak of the IL-6-conjugated SERS tags at 1332 cm(-1). Under optimized conditions, the assay works in the 1 pg/mL to 1 mu g/mL IL-6 concentration range, and the detection limit is as low as 1 pg/mL in PBS, 5 pg/mL in unprocessed whole blood. This is lower by a factor of 3 compared to colorimetric or fluorimetric methods. The performance of SERS LFA was demonstrated by detection of IL-6 in unprocessed whole blood with comparable performance of the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

AB Lung cancer is primary cancer threatening human life worldwide with the highest mortality rate. The early detection of lung cancer plays a critical role in the early diagnosis and subsequent treatment. However, the conventional methodologies limit the applications due to the low sensitivity, being expensive, and invasive procedure. Tumor markers as biochemical parameters can reflect cancer occurrence and progression, which show sensitivity, convenience, and low cost in developing biosensors, and act as good candidates for fabricating biosensors of detecting lung cancer. This review describes various biosensors (2013-2019) for detection of lung cancer biomarkers. Firstly, the various reported tumor markers of lung cancer are briefly described. Then, the advancements of designing biosensors for sensitive, stable, and selective identification of lung cancer biomarkers are systematically provided, with a specific focus on the main clinical biomarkers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1). Finally, the recent challenges and further opportunities for developing effective biosensors for early diagnosis of lung cancer are discussed.

AB Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) possess a great potential for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery. Rational construction of electrode materials could significantly improve the BESs performance. Three-dimensional macroporous electrode interface with high conductivity is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we report a hierarchically nanostructured reduced graphene oxide nanosheets-polypyrrole (rGO@PPy) electrode via one-step electrodeposition technique. The prepared electrode was comprehensively studied by scanning/transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and electrochemical measurements, which showed that the rGO@PPy possessed a three-dimensional macroporous interconnecting scaffold with superior conductivity. The rGO@PPy electrode was utilized in Geobacter sulfurreducens inoculated BESs, and the maximum current density was 4.10 +/- 0.02 mA cm(-2), which is 8-fold higher than that of a rGO electrode (0.51 +/- 0.03 mA cm(-2)), and is among the best performance reported for two-dimensional electrodes. The improved performance is ascribed to ultrahigh biomass concentration induced by "best match scale" between rGO@PPy and microbes, excellent extracellular electron transfer, as well as enhanced microbial affinity through the adequate exposure of biocompatible PPy layers. This work demonstrated a synergistic effect between rGO and PPy for the BESs performance improvement, and provided a new insight to design and fabricate a high-performance bioelectrode.

AB The high stability of redox signal is one of the most crucial factors in construction of electrochemical immunosensors. However, the redox-active species usually show low stability and poor conductivity, which inhibits their application in electrochemical immunosensors. In this work, we report that the conductive polymer poly(indole-5-carboxylic acid) (PIn-5-COOH) possesses ultra-high redox stability. The redox signal of PIn-5-COOH could remain 96.03% after 500 cyclic voltammery (CV) cycles in buffer solution with pH of 6.2, while the redox signals in most of the previous reports only remained less than 90% after 50 CV cycles. Our mechanism investigation indicated that the ultra-high redox stability of PIn-5-COOH should be attributed to its stable structure. The electrochemical immunosensors fabricated with PIn-5-COOH/MWCNTs-COOH nanocomposite showed a wide linear range from 0.001 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.33 pg mL(-1) for the detection of alpha fetoprotein. This study opens up a new avenue for the construction of electrochemical immunosensors with ultra-stable redox signal.

AB Wearable biofuel cells with flexible enzyme/carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers were designed on a cotton textile cloth by integrating two components: bioanode fibers for glucose oxidation and O-2-diffusion biocathode fibers for oxygen reduction. The anode and cathode fibers were prepared through modification with glucose dehydrogenase and bilirubin oxidase, respectively, on multi-walled carbon nanotube-coated carbon fibers. Both biofibers woven on the cloth generated a power density of 48 mu W/cm(2) at 0.24 V from 0.1 mM glucose (human sweat amount), and of 216 mu W/cm(2) at 0.36 V, when glucose was supplied from a hydrogel tank containing 200 mM glucose. Our fiber-based biofuel cell deformed to an S-shape without a significant loss in cell performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated a series-connection involving the tying of biofibers on a cloth with batik-based ionic isolation. The booster four cells generate power at 1.9 V that illuminated an LED on the cloth.

AB The ability of influenza viruses to rapidly evolve has caused significant challenges in viral surveillance, diagnosis, and therapeutic development. Molecular sequencing methods, though powerful tools for monitoring influenza evolution at the genetic level, are not able to fully characterize the antigenic properties of influenza viruses. Understanding influenza virus antigenicity is critical to vaccine development and disease prevention. Traditional immunoassays which have been widely used for evaluating influenza antigenicity have limited throughput. To alleviate these problems, new bioanalytical tools to investigate influenza antigenicity by measuring antibody-antigen binding are an active area of research. Herein, we review immunosensor technologies from the aspects of various sensing principles, while highlighting recent developments in multiplex, label-free detection strategies. Highlighted technologies include electrochemical immunosensors relying on impedimetric detection; these demonstrate simple design and cost effectiveness for mass production. Antibody arrays implemented on an optical interferometric sensor system allow systematic characterization of influenza antigenicity. Quartz microbalance immunosensors are highly sensitive but have yet to be explored for multiplex sensing. Immunosensors made on lateral flow strips have shown promise in rapid diagnosis of influenza subtypes. We anticipate that these and other technologies discussed in the review will facilitate advances in the study of influenza, and other viral pathogens.

AB Phenol contains an exchangeable hydroxyl proton resonant at 4.8 ppm from the resonance frequency of water in the H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectrum, enabling itself to be detected at sub-mM concentration by either chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI) or exchange-based T-2 relaxation enhancement (T-2ex) effect under acidic and basic conditions, respectively. We recently investigated the T-2e(x) effects of phenol and its derivatives, but the CEST characteristics of phenols are unknown in detail, and no study on using the natural CEST MRI effects of phenol for detecting enzymatic activity has been conducted. Herein, on the basis of the inherent CEST MR property of phenol, namely phenolCEST, we developed the first MRI approach to detect acid phosphatase (AcP) enzymatic activity. Upon the activity of AcP at pH = 5.0, non-CEST-detectable enzyme substrate phenyl phosphate was converted to CEST-detectable phenol, providing a simple way to quantify AcP activity directly without the need for a second signalling probe. We showed the application of this phenolCEST biosensor for measuring AcP activity in both enzyme solutions and cell lysates of prostate cells. This work opens a door for the utilization of phenolCEST MRI technique in sensor design and development.

AB The development of ultrasensitive and specific methods for facile detection of trace nucleic acids is of great significance to human health and safety. In the present work, an ultrasensitive SERS-based strategy for detecting nucleic acids was proposed by integrating the SERS-active AgNRs array with double signal amplifications, i.e. the primary target-triggered enzyme-free amplification recycling and the secondary signal enhancement of multiple-reporter. By comparing two SERS sensing routes, i.e. solid interface recycling (Route A) and solution recycling (Route B), the superior solution recycling was determined first, and then the sensing strategy was optimized by investigating the immobilization time, surface blocking, and number of reporters utilized in the SERS sensing. The experimental results indicate that an ultrasensitive SERS strategy can be achieved via the primary amplification of target-triggered enzyme-free recycling and additional enhancement by the usage of multiple reporters. Under the optimal conditions, the SERS sensing showed good specificity and uniformity, and a linear calibration curve of DNAs in human serum solution, ranging from 1 mu M to 1 fM, was obtained with LOD as low as 40.4 aM, and the following recovery rate measurements confirmed that the proposed SERS sensing had good repeatability and reliability, which shows great potential for facile detecting trace DNAs, especially disease-related nucleic acids in the liquid biopsy of early-stage cancer detection.

AB Herein, carbon brush cylindrical microbial fuel cell is constructed to decrease internal resistance and increase electricity production. The application of cylindrical single-chamber microbial fuel cell gives full play to the role of anode carbon brush and increases contact with surrounding oxygen by enlarging the surface area of the cathode. Both cylindrical design and P. aeruginosa inoculation in anode have positive effects on power output of microbial fuel cells. Changing the configuration from cubic to cylindrical resulted in a substantial reduction in internal resistance from 127.21 Omega to 49.66 Omega. Meanwhile, the cylindrical microbial fuel cell inoculated with mixed anaerobic bacteria exhibits power overshoot, and the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte is raised. Thus, we also select P. aeruginosa inoculation in cylindrical reactor, where the maximum power density is increased to 3322 +/- 38 mW m(- 2) and internal resistance is reduced to 34.0 +/- 1.1 Omega, and then power overshoot is improved. Thus, P. aeruginosa showed better electrogenic performance than anaerobic mixtures. In addition, chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies (about one cycle) of the three microbial fuel cells are similar, but the cylindrical cell handles about 0.7 times of sewage more than the cubic cell showing that cylindrical microbial fuel cell has a higher capacity of sewage treatment.

AB We herein report the first attempt to engineer a coaxial-sensing 3D amplifier able to achieve dynamic self-assembly in response to a mutated-ctDNA target. A bio-nanofiber is firstly manufactured via an ingenious double-channel electrostatic spinning and DNA rolling circle replication (RCR) technology, which offered an ideal scaffold for assembly of 3D amplifier activated by target recognition. The coaxial-controllable signal amplifier presented several advantages. (1) Given its "coaxial sensing effect", the proposed bio-amplifier played the coaxial transduction for signal enrichment to vastly increase sensitivity, capable of discriminating a single-base mismatched sequence from the perfectly complementary one, using ctDNA-134A as a model analyte. (2) Due to "covalent bridges lock effect" in an identifying chip with locked nucleic acid beacons, this 3D amplifier expressed high specificity and biostability toward seven different mutated-ctDNAs. (3) Profiting from special configuration of bioactive nanofibers and DNA replication programming, this catalytic bio-amplifier possessed "signal enrichment effect", which enhanced dynamic range toward ctDNA-134A detection and hybridized without any external indicators. This innovative bio-amplifier has a detection limit of 5.1 aM for ctDNA-134A with superior specificity, excellent sensitivity, and good performance. This pioneered method was further applied for broadly differentiate cells and evaluate changes in the expression levels of intracellular mutated-ctDNAs.

AB B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a short peptide that is considered to be an important heart failure (HF)-related biomarker. Due to its low concentration in the blood and short half-life, the sensitive detection of BNP is a bottleneck for diagnosing patients at early stages of HF. In this paper, we report a facile surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor to measure BNP; the sensor is based on aptamer-functionalized Au nanoparticles (GNPsApt) and antibody-modified magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles (MNPs-Ab) to enable dual screening of BNP in complex environments. During sensing, BNP forms MNP-Ab/BNP/GNP-Apt nanoconjugates that can be rapidly separated from the complex sample by a magnet to avoid degradation within the analyte's half-life. The developed SPR biosensor shows high selectivity, a wide dynamic response range of BNP concentrations from 100 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL, and a low detection limit of 28.2 fg/mL (S/N = 3). Using the proposed sensor, BNP was successfully detected in clinical samples. Thus, the designed SPR biosensor provides a novel and sensitive sensing platform for BNP detection with potential applications in clinical practice.

AB Core-shell plasmonic metal nanoparticles with interior nanogaps are superior nanostructures owing to their large signal enhancement for Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Herein, we incorporated Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed DNA in the preparation of core-shell nanostructures for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) cells. The elongated products-homo-nucleotides-composed of long single DNA strands (hn-D) are used not only to induce tunable-size nanogaps but also as Raman reporters with consistent and uniform signal enhancement. Using this synthetic process of hn-D-embedded core-shell nanoparticles (hn-DENPs), we found that the length of hn-D strands affects the size of the nanogap. In addition, performances of the specific Raman imaging of E. coli O157:H7, high detection sensitivity of 2 CFU/mL, and the recovery of 98.1%-105.2% measured in the real food samples, make hn-DENP a biosensor that will be widely used in biological detection.

AB Nanozymes have fascinated increasing attention in the field of artificial enzyme. Designing an ideal nanozyme usually requires a synergic advantage of reasonable nanostructures and large specific surface area for ensuring excellent mimicking-enzyme catalytic activity. Here we report a CuS nanozyme with hollow nanocube structure (h-CuS NCs), which has a large surface area of 57.84 m(2) g(-1), and thus realizes excellent mimicking-enzyme catalytic activity. Expectedly, our directed design of h-CuS NCs nanozymes has an affinity for H2O2 of 0.94 mM, which is outstanding among the state-of-the-art Cu-based nanozymes. Furthermore, this nanozyme acts as a multifunctional catalyst to induce luminol chemiluminescence and oxide 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2, and displays distinguished electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. More intriguingly, the nanozyme can produce a promising photothermal effect under the illumination of near-infrared light. This work will provide a prototype for rational design of distinct nanostructures as multifunctional nanozymes in the area of electrochemical sensing, mimicking-enzyme catalytic biosening and cancer therapy.

AB The development of versatile platforms to construct novel and sensitive immunosensors is nowadays an intense research field. Nanomaterials and polymers are often combined to fabricate new platforms to immobilize capture antibodies. Here we evaluate for the first time the co-electropolymerization of dopamine (DA) and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) on carbon nano-onion (CNO) modified electrodes as versatile platform to develop electrochemical immunosensors. Mixtures of DA and L-DOPA at different molar rations were co-electropolymerized on CNO-modified glassy carbon electrodes to form a poly(L-DOPA/DA) film. Immobilization of aminoferrocene was used to estimate the number of accessible carboxylic acid groups on the surface (11.3 nmol/cm(2)), a value comparable to three-dimensional matrices. This platform was applied to the electrochemical detection of IgA antibodies using both a HRP-based sandwich type assay and label-free detection based on [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) signal blocking. The sandwich and the label-free assays showed a wide linear response with LOD of 19 and 48 ng/mL, respectively, allowing the detection of serum IgA deficiency. Most remarkably, the incorporation of CNO layer led to a significant improvement (three-orders of magnitude) of the analytical performance of these immunosensors due to a combination of high surface area and increased electron transfer rates provided by the CNO layer.

AB Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides have been used widely as agricultural and household pest control agents for almost five decades and persist in our water resources, fruits, vegetables and processed food as health and environmental hazardous compounds. Thus, detection of these harmful OP pesticides at an ease with high sensitivity and selectivity is the need of hour. Bio-sensing technology meet these requirements and has been employed at a large scale for detection. The present review is aimed mainly to provide the overview of the past and recent advances occurred in the field of biosensor technology employed for the detection of these OP compounds. The review describes the principle and strategy of various OP biosensors including electrochemical (amperometric, potentiometric), thermal, piezoelectric, optical (fluorescence, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)), microbial and DNA biosensors in detail. The electrochemical biosensors are generally, based on inhibition of enzyme, acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), butyryl cholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase and alkaline phosphatase or enzyme (organophosphorus hydrolase, OPH)) catalyzed reaction. The detection limits and linearity range of various OP biosensors have also been compared. AChE inhibition based amperometric OP biosensors exhibited the lowest detection limit of 1 x 10(-11) mu M with a linearity range of 1.0 x 10(-11) -1.0 x 10(-2) mu M.

AB Monitoring of food quality, in particular, milk quality, is critical in order to maintain food safety and human health. To guarantee quality and safety of milk products and at the same time deliver those as soon as possible, rapid analysis methods as well as sensitive, reliable, cost-effective, easy-to-use devices and systems for process control and milk spoilage detection are needed. In this paper, we review different rapid methods, sensors and commercial systems for milk spoilage and microorganism detection. The main focus lies on chemical sensors and biosensors for detection/monitoring of the well-known indicators associated with bacterial growth and milk spoilage such as changes in pH value, conductivity/impedance, adenosine triphosphate level, concentration of dissolved oxygen and produced CO2. These sensors offer several advantages, like high sensitivity, fast response time, minimal sample preparation, miniaturization and ability for real-time monitoring of milk spoilage. In addition, electronic-nose- and electronic-tongue systems for the detection of characteristic volatile and nonvolatile compounds related to microbial growth and milk spoilage are described. Finally, wireless sensors and color indicators for intelligent packaging are discussed.

AB Herein, we propose a facile chemical reduction method to synthesize the molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles and its application for the electrochemical detection of folic acid (FA) through imprinting technique. Raman scattering, photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques were employed to study the properties of Mo2C nanoparticles. FA imprinting was carried out in the presence of pyrrole monomer over Mo2C modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The proposed sensor showed the detection behavior for wide range of FA concentrations from 0.01 mu M to 120 mu M with an excellent LOD value of 4 nM and good selectivity toward FA as compared to other co-existing species in real samples. The fabricated MIP-Mo2C/GCE sensors were able to be replicated with similar to 1.9% RSD, and their reproduced sensor offered good repeatability (RSD; 1.6%) and stability.

AB Salicylic acid (SA) is a phytohormone regulating immune responses against pathogens. SA and its derivatives can be found in diverse food products, medicines, cosmetics and preservatives. While salicylates have potential disease-preventative activity, they can also cause health problems to people who are hypersensitive. The current SA detection methods are costly, labor-intensive and require bulky instruments. In this study, a structure-switching aptamer-based nanopore thin film sensor was developed for cost-effective, rapid, sensitive and simple detection of SA in both buffer and plant extracts. SA is a challenging target for aptamer selection using conventional systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) due to its small size and scarcity of reactive groups for immobilization. By immobilizing the SELEX library instead of SA and screening the library using a structure-switching SELEX approach, a high affinity SA aptamer was identified. The nanopore thin film sensor platform can detect as low as 0.1 mu M SA. This is much better than the sensitivity of antibody-based detection method. This nanosensor also exhibited good selectivity among SA and its common metabolites and can detect SA in Arabidopsis and rice using only about 1 mu l plant extracts within less than 30 min. The integration of SA aptamer and nanopore thin film sensor provides a promising solution for low-cost, rapid, sensitive on-site detection of SA.

AB Developing a facile and reliable approach for tumor marker detection is crucial in early diagnosis of cancer. Here, a multicolor and photothermal dual signal readout immunosensor was proposed based on a nanoparticle-mediated transformation strategy and used for sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). To construct such a platform, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) -functionalized graphene oxide was modified with partially complementary DNA and served as the signal probes. In the absence of PSA, the signal probes were captured via hybridization reaction between DNA and PSA aptamer. Subsequently, Fe3O4 NPs anchored on the probes were transformed into a photothermal agent, Prussian blue NPs, which converted biological signal into heat via the near-infrared laser irradiation, and thus sensitive quantitative detection of PSA was realized by using a thermometer with a lower detection limit of 0.31 ng/mL. Meanwhile, Prussian blue NPs displayed multiply colors by mixing with potassium ferricyanide, and rapid qualitative detection by naked eyes was realized. The two sets of data mutually validate each other, which greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of PSA detection. More strikingly, graphene oxide as the enrichment carrier of Fe(3)O(4 )NPs significantly enhanced the accumulation of Prussian blue NPs in situ, and thus the signal amplification was effectively accomplished. Besides, the sensing strategy avoided the use of enzyme and simplified analysis process. Such a cost-effective and sensitive dual-readout visual protocol opens up new perspectives for personalized diagnosis and on-site detection.

AB Due to the serious symptoms of brittle bones and endocrine disorders, the common disease fluorosis diminishes quality of life. With the aim of developing probes for both laboratory and household fluorosis diagnosis, in this study we rationally designed a novel dual-functional gallic acid-Fe(III) complex-modified upconversion nanoprobe (DF-UCNP) with simultaneous upconversion luminescence (UCL) and photothermal (PT) conversion capacities. The nanoprobe was feasible for UCL fluorine (F-) detection with a low detection limit of similar to 20 nM and a broad linear range of 0-50 mu M, as well as UCL fluorosis diagnosis both in vitro and in vivo for lab-use. Furthermore, by utilizing gathered solar irradiation as a PT excitation source and a digital thermometer as a signal reader, the nanoprobe possessed outstanding PT detection capacities for F- with a detection limit of similar to 100 nM. Based on this nanoprobe and an accessional self-developed Android application, a household PT kit for fluorosis diagnosis was also constructed. This work provides a new method for rapid laboratory fluorosis diagnosis without a cumbersome determination process as well as household fluorosis diagnosis without requiring specific instruments.

AB Here, electrochemiluminescent nanoneedles of Ru(II) complex were synthesized to fabricate an "off-on" electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor in assistance with target Pb2+ induced dual signal amplification. Firstly, new needle-like nanostructures of luminous Ru(II) complex (RuNDs) different from the previous ones were prepared through solvent evaporation induced self-assembly on the electrode, which processed high ECL efficiency due to massive Ru(II) complexes in those structures, giving a strong initial ECL signal. To further improve the stability of the RuNDs film, silver nanowires (AgNWs) with excellent electric-conductivity dispersed in Nafion solution were modified by film formation, which was also convenient for subsequent modification. Through Ag-S bond, the DNA duplex formed by ssDNA with -SH (S1) and ssDNA modified with ferrocene (S2-Fc) was immobilized, leading to an obvious decrease of the ECL signal because of the effective quenching effect of Fc (off state). With the presence of target Pb2+, G-quadruplex structure was formed owing to the high specific affinity between S1 and Pb2+, making S2-Fc fall off from the electrode. Interestingly, the ECL signal not only could be recovered due to the abscission of Fc, but also improved by the generation of Pb2+-G-quadruplex (on state). Based on the effective dual signal amplification, a sensitive ECL biosensor was constructed for Pb2+ determination with a low estimated detection limit down to 0.33 pM. The strategy using luminous Ru(II) complex as precursor to directly prepare needle-like nanostructure was a convenient and effective way to enhance the ECL efficiency. Meanwhile, the simple and efficient target Pb2+ induced dual signal amplification would provide new thought for signal enhancement in the fabrication of biosensors.

AB Early screening of foodbome pathogens is a key to ensure food safety. In this study, we developed a microfluidic biosensor for online and sensitive detection of Salmonella based on immunomagnetic separation, fluorescence labeling and smartphone video processing. First, the immune magnetic nanoparticles were used to specifically separate and efficiently concentrate the target bacteria and the magnetic bacteria were formed. Then, the magnetic bacteria were labeled with the immune fluorescent microspheres and the fluorescent bacteria were formed. Finally, the fluorescent bacteria were continuously injected into the microfluidic chip on the smartphone-based fluorescent microscopic system, and the fluorescent spots were online counted using the smartphone App based on inter-frame difference algorithm to obtain the amount of the target bacteria. Under the optimal conditions, this proposed biosensor was able to quantitatively detect Salmonella typhimurium ranging from 1.4 x 10(2) to 1.4 x 10(6) CFU/mL, and its lower detection limit was 58 CFU/mL. This biosensor could be extended for detection of multiple foodbome pathogens using different fluorescent materials.

AB Ultrasensitive detection of cancer biomarkers has shown great promise for precision medicine. Here, a triple signal amplification strategy was developed for analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by using MoS2-based nanocomposites. Gold nanoparticles-decorated molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite (MoS2-AuNPs) was used to construct the modified electrode and nanoprobe, which could efficiently amplify electrochemical signal due to its large surface area and high catalytic ability. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled carcinoembryonic monoclonal antibody (anti-CEA) and HRP were used to co-construct the MoS2-based nanoprobe, which could further amplify the electrochemical signal by catalyzing o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Expectedly, an excellent analytical performance for CEA detection was obtained, such as wide detection range (10 fg mL(-1)-1 ng mL(-1)), ultralow detection limit (1.2 fg mL(-1)), high selectivity and good stability, suggesting this immunosensor could detect CEA in real samples.

AB The need for flexible biosensors has increased because of their potential applications for point-of-care diagnosis and wearable biosensors. However, flexible biosensors have low sensitivity due to the flexibility of the electrode, and their fabrication involves complex processes. To overcome these limitations, a flexible electrochemical enzyme biosensor was developed in this study by immobilizing an enzyme on the flexible polymer electrode modified with a gold/MoS2/gold nanofilm. The fabrication process involved sputter deposition of gold, spin coating of MoS2, and sputter deposition of gold on the flexible polymer electrode (commercially available Kapton polyimide film). The flexible glucose biosensor was made by immobilization of glucose oxidase on a flexible electrode by using a chemical linker. The detection limit for glucose was estimated to be 10 nM, which indicates more sensitivity as compared with a previously reported flexible glucose sensor. This sensitivity is due to the facilitation of electron transfer by MoS2. The flexure extension of this biosensor was estimated at 3.48 mm, which is much higher than that of the rigid sensor using a gold-coated silicon electrode (0.09 mm), according to measurements with a micro-fatigue tester. The proposed flexible biosensor composed of the enzyme/gold/MoS2/gold nanofilm on the polymer electrode can be used as a flexible sensing platform for developing wearable biosensing systems because of its high sensitivity, high flexibility, and simple fabrication process.

AB Herein, a home-build fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (FO-SPR) biosensing platform has been developed for highly sensitive detection of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) based aptamer-functionalized AuNPs for signal enhancement. In this biosensor, the PDGF-BB aptamer was used to specifically capture PDGF-BB, and the antifouling peptide demonstrated great ability for resisting non-specific adsorption. After a sandwich reaction, the aptamer, PDGF-BB and aptamer-functionalized AuNPs complexes were formed on the fiber optic (FO) probe surface to significantly amplify FO-SPR signal. This method exhibited a broad detection range from 1 to 1000 pM of PDGF-BB and a low detection limit of 0.35 pM. Moreover, this biosensor was successfully applied to the detection of PDGF-BB in 10% human serum samples without suffering from serious interference owing to the excellent antifouling property of the peptide. Thus, this developed FO-SPR biosensor could be a potential alternative device for proteins determination, even as a point-of-care diagnostic tool (POCT) in clinical application.

AB In this report, enhanced organic-inorganic heterojunction of polypyrrole@Bi2WO6 was fabricated and applied for sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). Specifically, heterostructured polypyrrole@Bi2WO6 photoelectrode was prepared and sandwich immunorecognition were integrated for the CK-MB immunoassay. In the detection, with the aid of alkaline phosphate (ALP)-induced biocatalytic precipitation (BCP), the precipitation-dependent suppression of the photocurrent can be recorded due to the impediment of the interfacial mass and electron transfer. On the basis of target-controlled BCP formation, a novel PEC immunoassay could be developed for the sensitive and specific CK-MB detection. This work manifested the great potential of polypyrrole@Bi2WO6 heterojunction as a novel platform for PEC bioanalysis development and also a PEC method for CK-MB detection. This work is expected to stimulate more interest in the design and implementation of numerous other organic-inorganic heterojunction for advanced PEC bioanalysis development.

AB This work describes a novel and disruptive electrochemical biosensing device that is self-powered by light and self-signalled by an optical readout. Electrical energy requirements are ensured by a photovoltaic cell that is a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), in which one of the electrodes is the biosensing unit. The readout converts electrical energy into colour by an electrochromic cell and signals the concentration dependent event. This device was designed to target a cancer biomarker, cancinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
   In brief, the sensing unit was assembled on a conductive glass substrate with a highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer, using a molecularly-imprinted polymer of polypyrrol (PPy) as biorecognition element. This sensing unit acted as the counter electrode (CE) of the DSSC, generating a hybrid device with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.45% for a photoanode area of 0.7 cm(2). The hybrid DSSC/biosensor had an electrical output that was CEA concentration dependent from 100 ng/mL to 100 mu g/mL, with a limit detection of 0.14 ng/mL in human urine samples. The electrochromic cell consisted of a PEDOT-based material and showed a colour gradient change for CEA concentrations, ranging from 0.1 ng/mL to 100 mu g/mL.
   Overall, this self-powered and self-signalled set-up is equipment free and particularly suitable for point-of-care analysis (POC), being able to screen CEA in real samples and differentiating critical concentrations for establishing a diagnosis. It holds the potential to provide clinical relevant data anywhere, in a fully independent manner.

AB Effective detection of biomarkers for tumor cells has been the focus of attention. In this work, we have successfully fabricated a highly sensitive sensor based on solution-gated graphene transistors (SGGT) for detecting lactic acid content accumulated in tumor cells through their glycolysis metabolism. The sensing mechanism of the lactic acid sensor is attributed to electrochemical catalysis of H2O2 produced by the oxidation of lactic acid by lactate oxidase near the gate electrode. The key component of the sensor is the functionalization of porous carbon loaded with ceria nanoparticles derived from a novel one step in situ pyrolysis of pretreated Jerusalem artichoke stalk, which significantly improved the sensor sensitivity, i.e. a detection limit as low as 300 mu M and linear range from 3 mu M to 300 mu M. The optimized lactic acid sensor has successfully applied to the detection of lactic acid in practical cell culture samples with high credibility. The SGGT-based lactic acid biosensor shows great potential for the application in tumor microenvironment due to its superior biocompatibility and accuracy.

AB Atrazine (ATZ) is one of the most widely used and highly toxic triazine herbicides in the world. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is an attractive and sensitive alternate for ATZ. However, for conventional PEC sensors, recognition elements usually need to immobilize on electrode surface, where a complex procedure is unavoidable and the reproducibility of sensors fabrication is usually poor. Therefore, we herein proposed a new and feasible strategy for developing a signal-on immobilization-free PEC aptasensor to ATZ. Aptamer for ATZ is combined with graphene to obtain APT-GN complex, serving as the recognition element in solution. TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) electrode deposited with Au nanoparticles (NPs) is used as the substrate electrode. After further self-assembled with 1-Mercaptooctane (MCT), the photo-generated carriers transfer between the resultant electrode and the electrolyte will be blocked, leading to a signal-off of the photocurrent. But when sensing ATZ, aptamers on APT-GN will be grasped by ATZ, leaving free graphene to assemble onto MCT/Au NPs/TiO2 NTs, which will largely "turn on" the photocurrent response of the substrate electrode due to the efficient carrier transport efficiency of graphene. Meanwhile, simultaneous addition of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) can bring about further cycling amplification of the signal enhancement. The as-designed PEC aptasensor exhibits a linear range from 50.0 fM to 0.3 nM with detection limit of 12.0 fM for ATZ. Since the reaction of recognition elements and targets ATZ occurs in homogeneous solution rather than on the photoelectrode surface, this PEC aptasensor exhibits advantages of high stability, anti-interference ability, reproducibility, and wide pH and ion strength feasibility range. A promising immobilization-free aptasensing platform has thus been provided not only for ATZ but also for other kinds of environmental pollutants.

AB Microliter-scale photosynthetic microbial fuel cells (micro-PMFC) can be the most suitable power source for unattended environmental sensors because the technique can continuously generate electricity from microbial photosynthesis and respiration through day-night cycles, offering a clean and renewable power source with self-sustaining potential. However, the promise of this technology has not been translated into practical applications because of its relatively low performance. By creating an innovative supercapacitive micro-PMFC device with maximized bacterial photoelectrochemical activities in a well-controlled, tightly enclosed micro-chamber, this work established innovative strategies to revolutionize micro-PMFC performance to attain stable high power and current density (38 mu W/cm(2) and 120 mu A/cm(2)) that then potentially provides a practical and sustainable power supply for the environmental sensing applications. The proposed technique is based on a 3-D double-functional bio-anode concurrently exhibiting bio-electrocatalytic energy harvesting and charge storing. It offers the high-energy harvesting functionality of micro-PMFCs with the high-power operation of an internal supercapacitor for charging and discharging. The performance of the supercapacitive micro-PMFC improved significantly through miniaturizing innovative device architectures and connecting multiple miniature devices in series.

AB Lab-on-chip platforms, such as microfluidic chips and micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) are powerful tools that allow us to manipulate and study neurons in vitro. Microfluidic chips provide a controlled extracellular environment that structures neural networks and facilitates isolation and manipulation at a sub-cellular level. Furthermore, MEAs enable measurement of extracellular electrophysiological activity from single neurons to entire networks. Here, we demonstrate the design, fabrication and application of a 3-nodal microfluidic chip integrated with MEAs as a versatile study platform for neurobiology and pathophysiology. In this work, we evaluate the use of the microfluidic chip to structure a neural network into three separate nodes, interconnected through tunnels that isolate and guide axons into a channel, thus facilitating synaptic contacts between neurons originating from opposite nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the MEA for monitoring developing activity and intra-/inter nodal connectivity of the structured neural network. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of the platform in two separate experiments. First, we demonstrate the ability to measure intra- and internodal dynamic responses to a fluidically isolated chemical stimulation. Then, we demonstrate the feature of the microfluidic chip enabling the disruption of functional connectivity between nodes and examination of the immediate activity response of the neural network. The platform enables in vitro modelling of neural networks to study their functional connectomes in the context of neurodegenerative disease and CNS trauma, including spinal cord injury.

AB The generation of physiologically relevant in-vitro models of biological barriers can play a key role in understanding human diseases and in the development of more predictive methods for assessing toxicity and drug or nutrient absorption. Here, we present an advanced cell culture system able to mimic the dynamic environment of biological barriers while monitoring cell behaviour through real-time impedance measurements and imaging. It consists of a fluidic device with an apical and a basal flow compartment separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The main features of the device are the integration of sensing through transepithelial electrical impedance (TEED measurements and transparent windows for optical monitoring within a dual flow system.
   Caco-2 cells were cultured in the TEEI bioreactor under both flow and static conditions. Although no differences in the expression of peripheral actin and occludin were visible, the cells in dynamic conditions developed higher impedance values at low frequencies, indicative of a higher paracellular electrical impedance with respect to the static cultures. TEEI measurements at high frequency also enabled monitoring monolayer formation, which can be correlated with the observation of an RC behaviour in the impedance spectra. In particular, the cells subject to flow showed accelerated barrier formation and increased vitality with respect to the static controls, again highlighting the importance of dynamic conditions for epithelial cells.

AB Self-propelled particles are revolutionizing sensing applications thanks to a unique motion-based signal generation mechanism in which biorecognition reactions are detected as changes in the velocity of the colloids. Here a new family of self-propelled multifunctional Janus particles is introduced that enables detecting changes in particle motion colorimetrically. The particles consist of an iron oxide core that provides color and magnetism, and a Janus coating that provides biospecific recognition and locomotive properties. In this approach, biomolecular interactions trigger changes in particle motion that are detected as variations in color when spotted on a piece of paper. These variations in color are then read and quantified with a custom-made smartphone app. The high surface area and magnetism of the particles makes them ideal building blocks for developing biosensors because they allow for the rapid capture of a target molecule and the removal of non-specific interactions. Biosensors engineered with the proposed multifunctional particles were able to detect the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin at clinically relevant concentrations within 13 min in whole blood, which is faster than other approaches requiring hour-long incubation steps under controlled conditions to detect the same biomarker in purified serum. The short assay time along with the point-of-need design makes these biosensors suitable for stratifying patients according to their sepsis risk level during triage independently of resource constraints.

AB Evaluation of cellular thermodynamics has recently received a high interest because of its implication in many mechanisms related with function, structure and health of cells. Recent literature reported significant efforts to provide affordable intracellular thermal components of absorption, such as thermal conductivity, to overcome the lack of experimental data.
   Herein, we provide lines of evidence towards the fabrication of an electronic system, using a rapid thermoelectric technique based on infrared-induced pyroelectric effect for in-vitro cell model characterization.
   Results demonstrated that the assessment of the average single cell thermal conductivity, sample concentration, and information on cell viability is possible over a wide concentration range.

AB Sensitivity amplification strategies in electrochemical immunoassays are mainly limited by redox signal leaking, degradation of catalytic activity caused by layers of decoration and the large hindrance effect caused by immunoprobes. Herein, we developed an innovative sensitivity amplification strategy based on the self-sacrificial label-assisted electroactivity conversion of a sensing interface, utilizing Fe-3(+)-loaded polydopamine (Fe3+-PDA) nanoparticles as the self-sacrificial labels, which can be decomposed under acidic conditions and release Fe3+. When the assembled sensing interface was immersed in a prussian blue (PB) precursor solution (a mixed solution of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1M HCl and 1 mM K3Fe(CN)(6)), the as-formed sandwich-type structure was destroyed due to the decomposition of Fe3+-PDA caused by HCl in PB precursor solution, resulting in the reduce of interface resistance. The released Fe3+ reacted with the PB precursor solution and triggered the growth of electroactive PB nanoparticles (PB NPs) on the sensing interface. Assisted by self-sacrificial Fe3+-PDA, the sensing interface was converted from electrochemically inactive to electroactive with a strong redox signal, high catalytic activity, and decreased interface resistance. The PB NPs can catalyse H2O2 to amplify the redox signal, thus improving sensitivity. The redox signal and catalysts were generated in the final assembly step, which can avoid signal leaking and decreases of catalytic activity caused by layers of decoration. The decomposition of Fe3+-PDA can eliminate the large hindrance effect of the immunoprobe. Ultrasensitive quantification of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125) was realized with a detection range from 0.00001 to 1000 U mL(-1) and detection limit of 0.25 x 10(-6) U mL(-1).

AB Nanometer-sized copper sulfide has remarkable properties such as metal like electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. In this work, ultrathin copper sulfide nanosheets (CuS NS) were synthesized and employed to modify on surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) combining with chitosan (CS) and acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the shape of CuS NS was hexagon with side length of 13.33 +/- 0.67 nm and thickness of 4.50 +/- 0.58 nm. The electrochemical characteristics of different nanocomposite modified electrodes were examined by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), indicating that the modified electrode of CuS NS-CS/F-MWCNTs/GCE possessed good electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of L-tyrosine (L-Tyr). Under the optimal condition, the modified electrode exhibited a wide linear response range for L-Tyr (0.08-1.0 mu M) with a detection limit of 4.9 nM. No obvious interferences from coexisted two-fold of L-tryptophan and 50-fold of other amino acids could be observed, indicating its relatively good selectivity. The electrode also had good repeatability, reproducibility and stability. Compared with a commercial instrument analytical method, HPLC, the electrode can be successfully applied to the determination of L-Tyr in pig serums with a recovery rate of 95.7%-102.6%, and its test results are in good agreement with that of HPLC, showing its promising application value.

AB A novel signal on-off type photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing system was designed for sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on tin disulfide nanosheets loaded on reduced graphene cxide (SnS2-GR) as the photoactive material and gold nanoparticles coated on reduced graphene oxide-functionalized copper sulfide (Au@CuS-GR) for signal amplification. It's the first time for SnS2-GR was exploited as a sensing matrix. Here, the photocurrent signals of SnS2 were amplified attributed to the sensitization effect of graphene. As signal amplifier, Au@CuS-GR could quench the photocurrents of SnS2-GR not only through the p-n type semiconductor quenching effect as well as the steric hindrance effect, but also as peroxidase mimetics to catalyze the oxidation of 4-Chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN) to produce insoluble product on the electrode surface. Based on the multiple signal amplification ability of Au@CuS-GR, CEA was detected sensitively with a linear range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and limit of detection down to 59.9 fg mL(-1)(S/N = 3). Meanwhile, the PEC biosensor displayed excellent performance in the assay of human serum sample, showing good application prospects for various target analysis.

AB Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) methodology has been adopted to unravel important factors contributing to the "cluster glycoside effect" observed in carbohydrate-lectin interactions. Well-defined, glycosylated nanostructures of precise sizes, geometries and functionalization patterns were designed and synthesized, and applied to analysis of the interaction kinetics and thermodynamics with immobilized lectins. The nanostructures were based on Borromean rings, dodecaamine cages, and fullerenes, each of which carrying a defined number of carbohydrate ligands at precise locations. The synthesis of the Borromeates and dodecaamine cages was easily adjustable due to the modular assembly of the structures, resulting in variations in presentation mode. The binding properties of the glycosylated nanoplatforms were evaluated using flow-through QCM technology, as well as hemagglutination inhibition assays, and compared with dodecaglycosylated fullerenes and a monovalent reference. With the QCM setup, the association and dissociation rate constants and the associated equilibrium constants of the interactions could be estimated, and the results used to delineate the multivalency effects of the lectin-nanostructure interactions.

AB Herein, a novel one step synthesis of multicomponent three dimensional polyacrylic acid (PAA) based conducting hydrogel (CH) incorporated with iron phthalocyanine functionalised graphene nanoplatelets (GPL-FePc) is reported. An amperometric glucose biosensor was fabricated by the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) onto the synthesised PAA-VS-PANI/GPL-FePc-CH (where VS-PANI is vinyl substituted polyaniline). Scanning electron microscopy reveals the presence of three dimensional microporous structure with estimated pore size of 19 mu m. The 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-mercaptopyridine substitution onto FePc enabled the solubility of FePc in water and controls the aggregation of GPL-FePc in the synthesised CH. A sharp peak around 699 nm in UV-visible spectra confirms the presence of incorporated GPL-FePc into CH. Cyclic voltammogram of the synthesised CH biosensor exhibited well defined redox peaks with a Delta E-p value of 0.26 V in Fe(CN) 6 (3-/4-) bench mark solution. The fabricated PAA-VS-PANI/GPL-FePc/GO(x)-CH amperometric biosensor resulted in remarkable detection sensitivity of 18.11 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with an average response time of similar to 1 s, linearity from 1 to 20 mM, and low detection limit of 6.4 mu M for the determination of glucose.

AB Applying biosensors for evaluation of the extracellular acidification of microorganisms in various biotechnological fermentation processes is on demand. An early stage detection of disturbances in the production line would avoid costly interventions related to metabolically inactive microorganisms. Furthermore, the determination of the number of living cells through cell plating procedure after cultivations is known as time- and material-consuming. In this work, a differential light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) system was developed to monitor the metabolic activity of Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum ATCC13032) as typical microorganism in fermentation processes. In this context, the number of living cells in suspensions was directly determined utilizing the read-out principle of the LAPS system. The planar sensor surface of the LAPS design allows to fixate 3D-printed multi-chamber structures, which enables differential measurements. In this way, undesirable external influences such as pH variations of the medium and sensor signal drift can be compensated.

AB In view of their critical function in metastasis, characterization of single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide important clinical information to monitor tumor progression and guide personal therapy. Single-cell genetic analysis methods based on microfluidics have some inherent shortcomings such as complicated operation, low throughput, and expensive equipment requirements. To overcome these barriers, we developed a simple and open micro-well array containing 26,208 units for either nuclear acids or single-cell genetic analysis. Through modification of the polydimethylsiloxane surface and optimization of chip packaging, we addressed protein adsorption and solution evaporation for PCR amplification on a chip. In the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon gene 21, this micro-well array demonstrated good linear correlation at a DNA concentration from 1 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(5) copies/mu L (R-2 = 0.9877). We then successfully integrated cell capture, lysis, PCR amplification, and signal read-out on the micro-well array, enabling the rapid and simple genetic analysis of single cells. This device was used to detect duplex EGFR mutation genes of lung cancer cell lines (H1975 and A549 cells) and normal leukocytes, demonstrating the ability to perform high-throughput, massively parallel duplex gene analysis at the single-cell level. Different types of point mutations (EGFR-L858R mutation or EGFR-T790M mutation) were detected in single H1975 cells, further validating the significance of single-cell level gene detection. In addition, this method showed a good performance in the heterogeneity detection of individual CTCs from lung cancer patients, required for micro-invasive cancer monitoring and treatment selection.

AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for highly sensitive detection of breast cancer biomarker human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is reported utilizing a dual signal amplification strategy. The biosensor was prepared based on tungsten sulfide nanowire array on Ti mesh (WS2 NW/TM). Such WS2 NW/TM electrode can generate photoelectric signal under visible light excitation. The HER2 aptamer was wrapped onto the nanowire array surface for specific binding with HER2 molecules, and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) that modified with glucose oxidase (GOx) and HER2 binding peptide was utilized for signal amplification. The H2O2 that generated by GOx catalyzed glucose reaction and localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs can both enhance the PEC current intensity of the biosensor, leading to dual signal amplification. The PEC current intensity is enhanced linearly with HER2 concentration in the 0.5-10 ng/mL range with limit of detection of 0.36 ng/mL. Such biosensor was applied for the detection of HER2 in breast cancer serum samples with detection results in good agreement with commercial ELISA results.

AB Micro/Nano robots have shown enormous potential for diverse biomedical applications, such as targeted delivery, in vivo biosensing, minimally invasive surgery and cell manipulation through extending their area of operation to various previously inaccessible locations. The motion of these small-scale robots can be either self-propelled or remotely controlled by some external power sources. However, in order to use them for biomedical applications, optimization of biocompatible propulsion and precise controllability are highly desirable. In this article, the recent progress about the biocompatible propulsion (e.g. self-propulsion, external stimuli based propulsion and bio-hybrid propulsion) techniques for these micro/nano robotic devices are summarized along with their applications, with a special focus on the advantages and disadvantages of different propulsion techniques. The current challenges and future perspectives of these small-scale devices are discussed in the final section.

AB The abundant functional groups on guanosine monophosphate (GMP) make it possible to interact with various metal ions. The subtle difference in the structure of GMP and deoxy-guanosine monophosphate (dGMP) coupled with Tb3+ can be readily exploited to form two coordination polymers, which have been unveiled as two time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) sensing reporters (Tb-GMP and Tb-dGMP) in our study. Based on this finding, herein, we have proposed a novel TRF orthogonal sensing array (Tb-GMP/dGMP) for pattern-recognition-based sensing of various metal ions. In addition, upon integration of some thiol-affinity metal ions, Tb-GMP/dGMP can be further extended to construct two metal ion-involved pattern-recognition-based sensor arrays (Tb-GMP/ dGMP-Cu, Tb-GMP/dGMP-Ag) for the TRF sensing different levels of disease-relevant biothiols in biofluids, illustrating the powerful and multifunctional capabilities of the Tb-GMP/dGMP system and would inspire simpler and more widespread designs of chemical nose/tongue-based applications.

AB The sensitivity, selectivity, and stability of an electrochemical sensor for detecting small biomolecules can be significantly upgraded through properly controlling the morphology and chemical structure of electrocatalyst. Herein, we fabricated a unique hierarchical nanostructure based on Cu@CuxO nanowires (NWs) array uniformly depositing with a layer of gold nanoparticles (2-3 nm) through a simple electroless deposition process. The Au-Cu@CuxO NWs hybrid was successfully applied as a novel binder-free self-supported biosensor towards L-cysteine detection with low limit of detection (1.25 mu M), wide linear detection range (1.25 mu M-1.94 mM), long-term stability (four weeks), and excellent selectivity. In addition, the hybrid-based sensor accurately detected L-cysteine in real samples. It was found that the obtained nanostructure with the formation of strong interaction between Au and Cu phase produces synergistic effects, which improve exposed electroactive site number, accelerate charge transfer rate, and increase surface area, thereby boosting the sensing performance. The results open a potential way to develop electrochemical sensor for efficiently detecting not only L-cysteine but also other small molecules with high sensitivity, accuracy, stability, and cost-effectiveness in health care and disease diagnosis.

AB A dual selection/recognition effect is described for cobalt (II) ions (Co2+). It is based on bovine serum albuminmetal-Co2+ coordination (BSA-Co2+) and the use of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). An electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) switch sensor was designed for detecting nanomolar levels of Co2+. The BSA-Co2+ coordination complex was chosen as a template to prepare a MIP modified switch sensor. The coordination reaction between BSA and Co2+ provides the first step in recognition, and MIP provides the second step for Co2+. This leads to a strong improvement in selectivity of the sensor. A multi-walled carbon nanotube/Cu nanoparticles/carbon quantum dots nanocomposite (MWCNT/Cu/C-dots) acts as an ECL device, and the BSA-Co2+ complex quenches the ECL signal. Therefore, the elution and resorption of BSA Co2+ can be used as a switch to control ECL. Additionally, a method was established to detect Co2+, with the detection limit as low as 3.07 x 10(-10) mol/L. The method was applied to the analysis of spiked environmental water, soil samples, and agricultural products. The recovery rates of the method were in the range of 87.5-111.3%.

AB Biopotential signals contain essential information for assessing functionality of organs and diagnosing diseases. We present a flexible sensor, capable of measuring biopotentials, in real time, in wireless and fully-passive manner. The flexible sensor collects and transmits biopotentials to an external reader without wire, battery, or harvesting/regulating element. The sensor is fabricated on a 90 gm-thick polyimide substrate with footprint of 18 x 15 x 0.5 mm(3). The wireless fully-passive acquisition of biopotentials is enabled by the RF (Radio Frequency) microwave backscattering effect where the biopotentials are modulated by an array of varactors with incoming RF carrier that is backscattered to the external reader. The flexile sensor is verified and validated by emulated signal and Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyogram (EMG), and Electrooculogram (EOG), respectively. A deep learning algorithm analyzes the signal quality of wirelessly acquired data, along with the data from commercially-available wired sensor counterparts. Wired and wireless data shows < 3% discrepancy in deep learning testing accuracy for ECG and EMG up to the wireless distance of 240 mm. Wireless acquisition of EOG further demonstrates accurate tracking of horizontal eye movement with deep learning training and testing accuracy reaching up to 93.6% and 92.2%, respectively, indicating successful detection of biopotentials signal as low as 250 mu V-PP. These findings support that the real-time wireless fully-passive acquisition of on-body biopotentials is indeed feasible and may find various uses for future clinical research.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) offers exceptional advantages such as label-free, in-situ and real-time measurement ability that facilitates the study of molecular or chemical binding events. Besides, SPR lacks in the detection of various binding events, particularly involving low molecular weight molecules. This drawback ultimately resulted in the development of several sensitivity enhancement methodologies and their application in the various area. Among graphene materials, graphene-based nanocomposites stands out owing to its significant properties such as strong adsorption of molecules, signal amplification by optical, high carrier mobility, electronic bridging, ease of fabrication and therefore, have established as an important sensitivity enhancement substrate for SPR. Also, graphene-based nanocomposites could amplify the signal generated by plasmon material and increase the sensitivity of molecular detection up to femto to atto molar level. This review focuses on the current important developments made in the potential research avenue of SPR and fiber optics based SPR for chemical and biological sensing. Latest trends and challenges in engineering and applications of graphene-based nanocomposites enhanced sensors for detecting minute and low concentration biological and chemical analytes are reviewed comprehensively. This review may aid in futuristic designing approaches and application of grapheneous sensor platforms for sensitive plasmonic nano-sensors.

AB A novel microfluidic chip employing power-free polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) femtoliter-sized arrays was developed for the detection of low concentrations of protein biomakers by isolating individual paramagnetic beads in single wells. Arrays of femtoliter-sized wells were fabricated with PDMS using well-developed molding techniques. Paramagnetic beads were functionalized with specific antibodies to capture the antigens. These antigens were labeled with enzymes via conventional multistep immunosandwich approach. After suspending in aqueous solutions of enzyme substrate, the solutions were delivered to the arrays using a conventional micropipette. The aqueous solutions were introduced into the microwells by capillarity and the beads were loaded into microwells by gravity. A fluorocarbon oil was then flowed into the chip to remove excess beads from the surface of the array and meanwhile isolated the femtoliter-sized wells. All processes were achieved by conventional micropipette, without external pumping systems and valves. Finally, the arrays were imaged using standard fluorescence imaging after incubation 30 min for digital counting enzyme molecules. It was demonstrated that the chip platform possessed the performance of digital counting with a linear dynamic range from 1 aM to 1 fM for the detection of biotinylated beta-galactosidase (B beta G), achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 930 zM. Using this chip, a digital immunoassay to detect Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF - alpha) was developed. Since the chip fabrication is low-cost and circumvents the surface modification, we expect it can become a new chip-based digital immunoassay platform for ultrasensitive diagnostic of biomarkers.

AB In this work, an ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was proposed to detect nucleic acids on the basis of cascaded photoactive materials and triple-helix molecular switch. DNA sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was chosen as the target DNA (T-DNA). Cascaded photoactive structure was formed via different sizes of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) sensitized ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs), which was employed as a cascaded photoactive interface to amplify the photocurrent signal. A hairpin structure DNA (H-DNA) as capture probe was conjugated onto the photoactive interface through amide bond, and then a single-stranded DNA modified with gold nanoparticles labeled alkaline phosphatase (ALP-Au NPs-DNA) at each end was introduced to hybridize with the H-DNA to form a triple-helix conformation. The T-DNA detection was based on the photocurrent response change resulted from conformation change of the triple-helix molecule after hybridization with T-DNA. In the absence of T-DNA, the triple-helix molecule was in a closed state and the ALP of ALP-Au NPs-DNA could specifically catalyze the ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) to generate ascorbic acid (AA) as electron donors, which resulted in a significant photocurrent response due to the rapid electron transfer process. However, in the presence of T-DNA, the T-DNA hybridized with the ALP-Au NPs-DNA molecule, which caused triple-helix molecule in an opened state and compelled ALP-Au NPs-DNA away from the electrode surface, resulting in the absence of ALP which could catalyze AAP to generate AA. Subsequently, the photocurrent response significantly decreased. The proposed PEC biosensor not only had a wide detection range of 1fM-1nM and low detection limit (0.65 fM), but also showed excellent reproducibility, specificity and stability, which had great application prospect and opened up a new research method in the early clinical diagnosis and cancer research.

AB Autoantibodies produced by the patients' own immune systems in response to foreign substances are emerging as an attractive biomarker for early detection of cancer. These serum immunobiomarkers are produced in large quantities despite the presence of very less amount of the corresponding antigens, and thus presenting themselves as a novel class of stable and minimally invasive disease biomarkers especially for cancer diagnosis. Although a plethora of research, including conventional molecular biology-based as well as cutting-edge optical and electrochemical strategies (biosensor), have been conducted to detect autoantibodies, most of these strategies are yet to be readily applicable in the off-laboratory settings at clinics. Herein, we detail the biogenesis, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential of autoantibodies as cancer biomarkers. With the particular emphasis on cutting-edge advances in electrochemistry, optical (surface plasmon resonance) and microfluidics techniques, this review entrusts the unmet needs and challenges of autoantibody detection approaches and provides a future perspective of the presented strategies. We believe this review can potentially guide the researchers towards the development of robust, reliable and sensitive detection strategies for tumor-associated autoantibodies and translation of these biomarkers to real clinical settings for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

AB Remarkable research efforts have been devoted to replicate the tactile sensitivity of human skin. Unfortunately, so far flexible pressure sensors reported barely fit the tactile requirements for fingertips, which could endure a pressure over 100 kPa and also can sense a gentle touch, It is vital to develop flexible pressure sensors which can ensure high sensitivity and wide operation range simultaneously, to satisfy the demands of mimicking the pressure sensing function of fingertips. In this work, a mini-size, light-weight but high-performance graphene film based pressure sensor is presented. Owing to the advanced structure with fluctuations on surface and fluffy-layered structure in cross-section of the graphene film, this pressure sensor shows an extraordinary performance of high sensitivity of 10.39 kPa(-l) (0-2 kPa), ultra-wide operation range up to 200 kPa, impressively stable repeatability, high working frequency, rapid response and recovery time. Moreover, the demonstrated results of the detection of traditional Chinese medicine wrist-pulse waveform and the bionic fingertip tactile sensors, suggest the great application potential of the obtain device in biomedical field and bionic skins field.

AB A ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was constructed to detect telomerase activity based on electrocatalysis of cerium-based metal-organic frameworks (CeMOFs) and conformation switch of hairpin DNA. First, the CeMOFs were synthesized using Ce as nodes and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid as linker in a green method, and then functionalized with gold nanoparticles. The resulted Au@CeMOF tags demonstrated an excellent electrocatalysis toward hydroquinone oxidation. Meanwhile, a methylene blue (MB) modified hairpin probe was designed with telomerase primer (TP) hybridized "stem" and immobilized on the electrode surface via Au-S chemistry. In the presence of the dNTPs and telomerase, the extended TP can open the hairpin DNA and keep the MB away from the electrode surface, resulting in a decrease of electrochemical signal. In the meantime, the TP-extended part could capture the Au@CeMOF-cDNA tags on the electrode surface via hybridization, leading to the increase electrochemical signal of hydroquinone oxidation catalyzed by Au@CeMOF-cDNA tags. Thus, a ratio metric signal output mode was developed for the electrochemical detection of telomerase activity. This biosensor showed wide dynamic correlation of telomerase activity from 2 x 10(2) to 2 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) with the limit of detection of 27 cells mL(-1), and was applied to evaluate telomerase activity in single cell. The ratiometric electrochemical strategy based on the catalysis of MOFs provides a new avenue on signal transduction in telomerase detection.

AB The early detection of bacterium plays a significant role in addressing serious public health issues. In this paper, a supersensitive multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) sensor of bacterium based on 16S rRNA and "DNA-RNA switch" was constructed. The fragment in specific region of 16S rRNA was used as the biomarker of bacterium to ensure high specificity and to achieve the accurate judgment of microbial vitality. "DNA-RNA switch" was designed to conduct two electrodes by switching insulated "gene-link" into conductive "silver-link", which achieved the super-sensitivity of MSPQC to bacteria. To demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy, a proof-of-concept method for Escherichia coli (E. coli) assay was designed. The detection limit was down to 2 cfu/mL. Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not interfere with the detection results. Proposed method was highly sensitive, and specific for bacterium detection, which might find widely use in early detection of bacterium in the field of public safety monitoring and clinical diagnosis.

AB We present an enhanced version of our previously engineered MyoRobot system for reliable, versatile and automated investigations of skeletal muscle or linear polymer material (bio)mechanics. That previous version already replaced strenuous manual protocols to characterize muscle biomechanics properties and offered automated data analysis. Here, the system was further improved for precise control over experimental temperature and muscle single fiber sarcomere length. Moreover, it also now features the calculation of fiber cross-sectional area via on-the fly optical diameter measurements using custom-engineered microscope optics. With this optical systems integration, the MyoRobot 2.0 allows to tailor a wealth of recordings for relevant physiological parameters to be sequentially executed in living single myofibers. Research questions include assessing temperature dependent performance of active or passive biomechanics, or automated control over length-tension or length velocity relations. The automatically obtained passive stress-strain relationships and elasticity modules are important parameters in (bio)material science. From the plethora of possible applications, we validated the improved MyoRobot 2.0 by assessing temperature-dependent myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, passive axial compliance and Young's modulus. We report a Ca2+ desensitization and a narrowed dynamic range at higher temperatures in murine M. extensor digitorum longus single fibers. In addition, an increased axial mechanical compliance in single muscle fibers with Young's moduli between 40-60 kPa was found, compatible with reported physiological ranges. These applications demonstrate the robustness of our MyoRobot 2.0 for facilitated single muscle fiber biomechanics assessment.

AB Herein, an innovative coreactant modifier-based amplified ECL sensing method was developed to provide a convenient and effective amplified ECL emission. Firstly, nitrogen-rich quantum dots (N-dots) were prepared. N dots have much nitrogen functional groups, which provide more reactive sites on the surface in the ECL reaction. Furthermore, we investigated the action mechanism of H2O2 as coreactant modifier to promote the generation of more oxidant of coreactant in the N-dot/K2S2O8 coreactant ECL pathway. The coreactant modifier can generate ca. 40- and 7.7-times intensity over that of H2O2 or K2S2O8 as an individual coreactant, respectively. Finally, the proposed biosensor was designed to accurately quantify galactose (GA) from 0.5 mol L-1 to 15 mmol L-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.16 molL(-1). This coreactant modifier-based amplified ECL sensing method significantly improved the sensitivity and accuracy of enzyme sensors. And it was applied in spiked human serum samples with satisfactory results. Moreover, the change of the ECL signal can be easily imaged and observed with the help of a smartphone camera, which satisfied the needs of point-of-care test of GA.

AB In this work, we detail the progress of a novel electrochemical disposable device, which has a relatively low cost and easy production, with a novel conductive ink, that consists of graphite and automotive varnish mixture, deposited over a self-adhesive paper, granting an easy production with relatively low cost. The electrode surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and Fourier transforms infrared and Raman, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. In addition, the proposed electrode was applied for individual electrochemical determination of dopamine and serotonin. The device achieved a linear response between 30 and 800 mol L-1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.13 mu mol L-1, by square wave voltammetry for dopamine and a linear range from 6.0 to 100 mu mol L-1, with a LOD of 0.39 mol L-1, by differential pulse voltammetry for serotonin. Later, the working electrode was modified with glucose oxidase and dihexadecyl phosphate film in order to obtain a biosensor. At this stage, CV was applied to detect glucose in the range of 1.0-10 mu mol L-1 and LOD of 0.21 mol L-1. By three different techniques and analytes, the sensoring and biosensoring processes presented high reproducibility. The proposed adhesive electrode is easy to prepare, disposable, within non-restrictive nature, which allows an approach of a new device for electrochemical sensing and biosensing.

AB A novel electrochemical sensor with inherent redox activity mediated by ferrocene for Cystatin C (CysC), an early kidney failure biomarker, is described. The current response was mediated by graphene oxide-ferrocene nanofilm with redox-activity coming from electroactive species surface-confined. Anti-CysC antibodies were immobilized by their Fc portions on the drop-casting polyethyleneimine (PEI) film for improving the sensitivity and reproducibility. Stepwise modifications of the nanostructured surface were characterized by electrochemical techniques, FT-IR and AFM. FT-IR confirmed the formation of the Fc-GO nanocomposite and PEI deposition on the electrode surface. The AFM micrographs confirmed a nanometric film of Fc-GO and PEI. The sensor platform showed a response from 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL and lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 ng/mL of CysC, with good accuracy, specificity and it was successfully applied for CysC detection. Advantages of this immunosensor include rapid testing with minimal steps by the simple use of an intrinsic redox probe, working in a reduction potential, which avoids potential interferences. This proposal attempts to circumvent amperometric detection limitations and provides a promising candidate for future point-of-care diagnostics without redox probe additional solutions for measurements.

AB Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), as an original tumor marker, has aroused wide attention in recent years. However, only a few researches have been done for PARP-1 activity detection because PARP-1 is lack of optical or electrochemical property. In this work, a label-free and high-sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for PARP-1 activity detection based on poly[9,9-bis(6'-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl]fluorenylene phenylene (PFP) has been designed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that PEC has been used to monitor PARP-1 activity. PARP-1 were activated under the function of activated dsDNA, as a result, branched polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) with plentiful negative charge were formed in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Subsequently, positively charged PFP with good photoelectrochemical properties, were absorbed on PAR via electrostatic interaction. High photocurrent was produced under light induction, which was depended on the PARP-1 activity. The biosensor has a wide linear range from 0.01 to 2 U with a detection limit of 0.007 U. The strategy has been applied in breast and ovarian cancer cells to detection PARP-1 activity with approving results, which signifies that it is a promising tool for clinical diagnosis.

AB A low-cost, effective and enzyme-free sensing strategy for ultrasensitive microRNA (miRNA) detection was developed based on dynamic light scattering (DLS) coupled with strand displacement reaction (SDR). The combination of DLS and SDR was used to assess the size changes of core-satellites nanoassembly. This strategy realized the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.24 pM (S/N = 3) and the detection range of 5 pM-150 pM, which might urge this strategy as an ideal candidate for the sensitive detection of miRNA in the future. In addition, the proposed strategy could be successfully used to analyze target miRNA in various cancer cells, indicating that the developed SDR-DLS strategy has promising clinical implications for rapid and early diagnosis of cancer-related diseases.

AB Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains one of the most serious infectious diseases all over the world. The key to reduce the spread and mortality rate of tuberculosis is to develop faster and more sensitive approaches for detection of M. tuberculosis. However, current detection methods can not meet the requirements of rapid clinical M. tuberculosis detection in terms of detection time. Herein, a new 16S rDNA multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) sensor based on Exonuclease III (Exo III)-aided target recycling has been developed for rapid detection of M. tuberculosis. The specific 16S rDNA fragment of M. tuberculosis was used as biomarker, DNA capture probes complementary to the biomarker were designed and modified on the surface of AuNPs. The Exo III which could recognise hybrid duplexes and selectively digest DNA capture probe was used to assist digestion cycle by digesting DNA capture probe and releasing the intact target fragment. After all DNA probes loading on the surface of AuNPs were removed, the surface of AuNPs was exposed and conductive connection was formed between the nanogap network electrode by self-catalytic growth of exposed AuNPs in the glucose and HAuC14 solution. This resulted in sensitive response of M. tuberculosis sensor and M. tuberculosis was detected by recording this response. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was 20 CFU/mL and the detection time was less than 3 h. It was expected to be widely used in detection methods of M. tuberculosis.

AB Early diagnosis and therapy of cancer metastasis are of great importance for disease outcome. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) offer the ability for noninvasive tumor profiling in real time. However, simply capturing and counting tumor cells are inadequate to provide valuable information about tumor. Efficiently releasing the captured cells is necessary for the downstream characterization. Herein, we describe a mild electrochemical strategy to effectively isolate CTCs from the bloodstream and rapidly release the captured cells in 2 min for downstream molecular characterization, as realized on a conductive poly(aminophenylboronic acid) derivatized electrode. The boronic ester linkage between dopamine (DA) and boronic acids-functionalized electrode is stable, and only upon the application of a weak potential perturbation does the boronic ester dissociate and release cells without compromising cell viability. This platform is reusable after acid treatment and has the potential to be the next-generation platform for cell capture and release, realizing the clinical value of CTCs as biomarkers.

AB Efficient signal amplification strategies are crucial for ultrasensitive detection of tumor markers. Herein, a new signal amplification strategy by coupling cascade catalysis-initiated radical polymerization with impedimetric immunoassay was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3). Copper-based metal-organic framework nanoparticles (Cu-MOF), as peroxidase mimics, combined with CA15-3 antibody (Ab(2)) and glucose oxidase (GOx) were employed as immunoprobes to initiate radical polymerization by cascade catalysis. In this work, the oxidation of glucose was catalyzed by GOx to generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which reacted with acetylacetone (ACAC) via Cu-MOF catalysis to yield ACAC radicals for the polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM). The polymer, poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), was generated in situ from the radical polymerization. As resistance enhancer, PNIPAM was covered on electrode surface to amplify resistance value by its poor conductivity. With the help of polymerization-based amplification, the resistance differences caused by target were improved significantly. Under optimum conditions, the designed biosensor showed wide detection ranges from 10 mu U/mL to 10 mU/mL and 10 mU/mL to 100 U/mL, with ultralow detection limit of 5.06 mu U/mL for CA15-3. Such an approach opened a new avenue for signal amplification, thus offering an ultrasensitive detection platform for a broad range of tumor markers.

AB In this paper, we report on an integrated nanorod array as a novel sieving matrix for high-resolution separation of biomolecules. A wide size range of DNA (100 bp-166 kbp) and proteins (11.4 kDa-205 kDa) are resolved into sharp peaks within several minutes using devices with various pore apertures, either in a reptation mode or Ogston mechanism. The device delivers notable performance with the minimum resolvable size difference 10 bp for 100 bp and 150 bp DNA fragments, 15.9 kbp for 48 kbp and 166 kbp DNA chains, and 7.9 kDa for 11.4 and 68 kDa proteins, where the separation efficiency is higher than or comparable to other micro/nanofabricated artificial sieving structures. The process utilizes localized oblique angle deposition (LOAD) to simply integrate densely packed nanorods onto steep sidewalls of microfluidic channels, which eliminates the requirement of advanced lithography tools routinely used in conventional artificial sieving structures. We further demonstrate the modulation of pore aperture that employs the sculptured sidewalls by a custom deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) recipe. Given the easy fabrication, excellent engineering control and outstanding sieving capability, this nanorod sieve device has great potentials to provide a simple and effective separation technique for biomolecule analysis.

AB Herein we report the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) together with electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques to develop and characterise a stable and uniformly reactive chemically modified platinum electrode for NADH electrocatalysis. In order to achieve this, a range of different approaches for thionine entrapment within an electropolymerised poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film were evaluated using SECM imaging in the presence of NADH, demonstrating the uniformity of the reactive layer towards NADH oxidation. The effect of electrolyte type and time scale employed during PEDOT electropolymerisation was examined with respect to thionine loading and the resulting charge transport diffusion coefficient (D-CT) estimated via chronoamperometry. These studies indicated a decrease in D-CT as thionine loading increased within the PEDOT film, suggesting that charge transport was diffusion limited within the film. Additionally, thionine functionalised nanotubes were formed, providing a stable support for lactate dehydrogenase entrapment while lowering the rate of thionine leaching, determined via SECM imaging. This enabled lactate determination at E-app = 0.0 V vs Ag/AgCl over the range 0.25-5 mM in the presence of 1 mM NAD(+).

AB Continuous glucose monitoring facilitates the stringent control of blood glucose concentration in diabetic and intensive care patients. Optical fibers have emerged as an attractive platform; however, their practical applications are hindered due to lack of biocompatible fiber materials, complex and non-practical readout approaches, slow response, and time-consuming fabrication processes. Here, we demonstrate the quantification of glucose by smartphone-integrated fiber optics that overcomes existing technical limitations. Simultaneously, a glucose-responsive hydrogel was imprinted with an asymmetric microlens array and was attached to a multimode silica fiber's tip during photopolymerization, and subsequent interrogated for glucose sensing under physiological conditions. A smartphone and an optical power meter were employed to record the output signals. The functionalized fiber showed a high sensitivity (2.6 mu W mM(-1)), rapid response, and a high glucose selectivity in the physiological glucose range. In addition, the fiber attained the glucose complexation equilibrium within 15 min. The lactate interference was also examined and it was found minimal similar to 0.1% in the physiological range. A biocompatible hydrogel made of polyethylene glycol diacrylate was utilized to fabricate a flexible hydrogel fiber to replace the silica fiber, and the fiber's tip was functionalized with the glucose-sensitive hydrogel during the ultraviolet light curing process. The biocompatible fiber was quickly fabricated by the molding, the readout approach was facile and practical, and the response to glucose was comparable to the functionalized silica fiber. The fabricated optical fiber sensors may have applications in wearable and implantable point-of-care and intensive-care continuous monitoring systems.

AB G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) transduce extracellular signals and activate intracellular pathways, usually through activating associated G proteins. Due to their involvement in many human diseases, they are recognized worldwide as valuable drug targets.
   Many experimental approaches help identify small molecules that target GPCRs, including in vitro cell-based reporter assays and binding studies. Most cell-based assays use one signaling pathway or reporter as an assay readout. Moreover, they often require cell labeling or the integration of reporter systems.
   Over the last decades, cell-based electrical impedance biosensors have been explored for drug discovery. This label-free method holds many advantages over other cellular assays in GPCR research. The technology requires no cell manipulation and offers real-time kinetic measurements of receptor-mediated cellular changes. Instead of measuring the activity of a single reporter, the impedance readout includes information on multiple signaling events. This is beneficial when screening for ligands targeting orphan GPCRs since the signaling cascade(s) of the majority of these receptors are unknown. Due to its sensitivity, the method also applies to cellular models more relevant to disease, including patient-derived cell cultures.
   Despite its advantages, remaining issues regarding data comparability and interpretability has limited implementation of cell-based electrical impedance (CEI) in drug discovery. Future optimization must include both full exploitation of CEI response data using various ways of analysis as well as further exploration of its potential to detect biased activities early on in drug discovery.
   Here, we review the contribution of CEI technology to GPCR research, discuss its comparative benefits, and provide recommendations.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regarded as a large variety of cancer-related biomarkers, and they have attracted wide attentions in recent years. In this work, a novel label-free strategy for the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-182 (a typical biomarker for lung cancer) based on MoS2/Ti3C2 nanohybrids was suggested. Firstly, modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with massive active sites and good electronic conductivity was prepared for biosensing. Then, based on this platform a descent signal in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak current could be observed with the addition of probe RNA with negative charge. Thereafter, with the hybridization of target miRNA-182 with immobilized probe RNA and the swelling-induced breakage of Au-S bonds between RNA and the electrode surface, the characteristic DPV signals increase were found. In particular, this biosensing platform for special miRNAs possessed a good linear detection window in a range from 1 fM to 0.1 nM with a detection limit of 0.43 fM.

AB Previously reported photoelectrochemical (PEC) cytosensing commonly relied on the use of photoelectrodes as both signaling sources and platforms to accommodate the biorecognition events. In such a design, the side reaction between photoelectrodes and potential reductive species in the biological media as well as the interplay between the photoelectrodes and biomolecules will inevitably impair the performance of the corresponding PEC cytosensors. Herein, we presented a facile and efficient PEC cytosensor by separating capture probe from the photoelectrode. The system is operated upon by using a ternary heterostructured photoanode to provide an evident and stable photocurrent signal, an aptamer-based biocathode for recognizing and capturing the target cells, and the corresponding signal reduction from the cell-induced steric hindrance effect. Exemplified by human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), the proposed system realizes the separation of the signaling photoanode and the sensing biocathode toward a sensitive and selective self-powered PEC MCF-7 cytosensor. This work reports a new PEC cytosensing protocol, and it is expected to attract more interest in the research of high-performance PEC cytosensing.

AB The development of biosensors for cancer biomarkers has recently been expanding rapidly, offering promising biomedical applications of these sensors as highly sensitive, selective, and inexpensive bioanalytical tools that can provide alternative methodology to that afforded by the advanced hyphenated-instrumental techniques. In this review, we focus particularly on the detection of a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, protein survivin (Sur), a ubiquitous re-organizer of the cell life cycle with the ability to inhibit the apoptosis and induce an enhanced proliferation leading to the unimpeded cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we critically evaluate the progress in the development of novel biosensing systems and biosensors for the detection of two survivin (Sur) biomarkers: the Sur protein and its messenger RNA (Sur mRNA), including immunosensors, electrochemical piezo- and impedance-sensors, electrochemi-luminescence biosensors, genosensors based on oligonucleotide molecular beacons (MBs) with fluorescent or electrochemical transduction, as well as the microfluidic and related analytical platforms based on solution chemistry. The in-situ applications of survivin biomarkers' detection technologies to equip nanocarriers of the controlled drug delivery systems with MB-based fluorescence imaging capability, apoptosis control, and mitigation of the acquired drug resistance are also presented and critically evaluated. Finally, we turn the attention to the application of biosensors for the analysis of Sur biomarkers in exosomes and circulating tumor cells for a non-invasive liquid biopsy. The prospect of a widespread screening for early cancers, based on inexpensive point-of-care testing using biosensors and multiplex biosensor arrays, as a means of reducing the high cancer fatality rate, is discussed.

AB This work describes further developments into the self-powered and self-signalled biosensing system that merges photovoltaic cells, plastic antibodies and electrochromic cells into a single target. Herein, the plasmonic effect is introduced to improve the photoanode features of the photovoltaic cell, a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), and better electrocatalytic features are introduced in the electrode containing the sensing element.
   In brief, the DSSC had a counter-electrode of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on an FTO glass modified by a plastic antibody of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and pyrrol. The photoanode had dye sensitized TiO2 modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to increase the cell efficiency, aiming to improve the sensitivity of the response of hybrid device for the target biomarker. The target biomarker was carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The response of the hybrid device evidenced a linear trend from 0.1 ng/mL to 10 mu g/mL, with an anionic slope of 0.1431 per decade concentration. The response of the plastic antibody for CEA revealed great selectivity against other tumour markers (CA 15-3 or CA 125). The colour response of the electrochromic cell was also CEA concentration dependent and more sensitive when the hybrid device was set-up with a photoanode with AuNPs. A more intense blue colour was obtained when higher concentrations of CEA were present.
   Overall, this improved version of the self-powered and self-signalled set-up has zero-requirements and is particularly suitable for point-of-care analysis (POC). It is capable of screening CEA in real samples and differentiating clinical levels of interest. This concept opens new horizons into the current cancer screening approaches.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing strategies have drawn substantial attention due to their advantages of label free, real time, and high performance, but complicated modification procedures and strict reaction conditions of amplification tags associated with current SPR biosensors hinder their potential utilizations. Herein, an in situ prepared AgNPs-based SPR biosensor for MicroRNA (miRNA) sensitive detection was developed based on hybridization chain reaction (HCR) without the biomodification on amplification tags. The target miRNA initiated the HCR of the hairpin probes to generate long double strand DNA (dsDNA) chains that were immobilized on SPR disk. Thus, with Ag+ intercalating into dsDNA chains, large numbers of AgNPs generated after NaBH4 reduction, resulting in the significantly elevated SPR angle. Further, the SPR angle is positively proportional to target miRNA concentrations. As a result, the in situ generated AgNPs-based SPR biosensor realized exceptional let-7a detection with linear range of 0.001-0.1 pM and detection limit (LOD) of 0.35 fM, lower than that of other SPR biosensors that used modifiable amplification tags. Featured with the modification-free characteristic and excellent performance, the proposed strategy provides new way for ultrasensitive detection of miRNA, and allows to detect other biomarkers by simply verifying the target responsive substances, and thus has a great potential for health and early disease diagnosis.

AB Leptin is a vital biomarker of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), and its evaluation of the concentration level in vivo is of great significance to NAFLD diagnosis. Therefore, it is pressing to develop a method for rapid and sensitive detection of leptin. This paper describes an environmentally friendly and label-free immunosensor based on porous graphene functionalized black phosphorus (PG-BP) composite to detect of leptin. The PG-BP was synthesized via strong coherent coupling between porous graphene (PG) surface plasmons and anisotropic black phosphorus (BP) localized surface plasmons, which made the electrochemical performance of PG and BP synergistic as well as increased the stability and conductive capability of BP material. The PG-BP modified electrodes was further prepared by gold nanoparticles, cysteamine, and glutaraldehyde in turn. Due to the cross-linking effect of glutaraldehyde, anti-leptin can be firmly fixed. These properties of the platform improved the conductive capability of the immunosensor and enhanced the load capacity of the proteins, thereby, the sensitivity of the immunosensor was significantly increased. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.150-2500 pg/mL with a low detection limit of 0.036 pg/mL. The leptin immunosensor displayed excellent selectivity and anti-interference ability, which could be used for early screening and diagnosis of clinical NALFD.

AB During the last decades, by virtue of their unique physicochemical properties and potential application in microelectronics, biosensing and biomedicine, metal nanomaterials (MNs) have attracted great research interest and been highly developed. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a particularly interesting ligand for templating bottom-up nanopreparation, by virtue of its excellent properties including nanosized geometry structure, programmable and artificial synthesis, DNA-metal ion interaction and powerful molecular recognition. DNA-ternplated copper nanoparticles (DNA-CuNPs) has been developed in recent years. Because of its advantages including simple and rapid preparation, high efficiency, MegaStokes shifting and low biological toxicity, DNA-CuNPs has been highly exploited for biochemical sensing from 2010, especially as a label-free detection manner, holding advantages in multiple analytical technologies including fluorescence, electrochemistry, surface plasmon resonance, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This review comprehensively tracks the preparation of DNA-CuNPs and its application in biosensing, and highlights the potential development and challenges regarding this field, aiming to promote the advance of this fertile research area.

AB How to in situ detect intracellular telomerase activity with high sensitivity still faces many challenges. This paper constructs a new fluorescence biosensing platform for the sensitive detection of intracellular telomerase activity via the combination of nanoflare and hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification on a single patchy gold/carbon nanosphere (PG/CNS), which has two or more distinct parts and allows hybridized-DNA (HS-DNA/Primer-DNA/Flare-DNA) and Hl/H2-DNA (a pair of cross complementary DNA hairpins) to bind onto their surfaces via Au-S bond and electrostatic interaction, respectively. In the presence of telomerase, Primer-DNA (telomerase primer) extends at its 3' end to produce a telomeric repeated sequence, resulting in the release of Flare-DNA followed by the recovery of the fluorescence. Subsequently, the released Flare-DNA further initiates cross hybridization of H1 and H2 DNA from mimic-HCR system to amplify the fluorescence signal. The in vivo confocal microscopy studies demonstrate that resulting sensor can enter into the cancer cells such as A549 cells, and lead to the increase in luminescence, which is stronger than the sensor without the HCR-based signal amplification system. A linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the amount of A549 cells is observed, and the limit of detection of the sensor reaches about 280 A549 cells.

AB The photosensitive protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) has been shown to be a promising material for optoelectronic applications, but it cannot effectively absorb and utilize light energy in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the optical spectrum. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have two-photon absorption cross-sections two orders of magnitude larger than those of bR and can effectively transfer the up-converted energy of two NIR photons to bR via the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we have engineered a photoelectrochemical cell based on a hybrid material consisting of QDs and bR-containing purple membranes (PMs) of Halobacterium salinarum and demonstrated that this cell can generate an electrical signal under the two-photon laser excitation. We have shown that the efficiency of light conversion by the PM-QD hybrid material under two-photon excitation is up to 4.3 times higher than the efficiency of conversion by PMs alone. The QD integration into the bR-containing PMs significantly improves the bR capacity for utilizing light upon two-photon laser excitation, thus paving the way to the engineering of biologically inspired hybrid NIR nonlinear optoelectronic elements. The nonlinear nature of two-photon excitation may provide considerable advantages, such as a sharp sensitivity threshold and the possibility of precise three-dimensional location of excitation in holography and optical computing.

AB Despite the fact that cancer research has experienced important advances and remarkable improvement in the curing processes during the last decades, this disease still occupies a leading position among the causes of death worldwide. It has been demonstrated that there is an interconnection between the overexpression of interleukin-6 cytokine and the tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance in several types of malignancies.
   Herein, a highly sensitive and selective aptasensor for quantitative detection of interleukin-6 was developed by using a glassy carbon electrode modified with p-aminobenzoic acid, p-aminothiophenol and gold nanoparticles. A thio-terminated aptamer specific for interleukin-6 was immobilized on the surface of the modified electrode via the formation of gold-sulfur bonds. This DNA oligonucleotide was then used as a detection probe to capture the target protein at the biosensor surface allowing label-free detection by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The developed aptasensor showed a good linear response from 5 pgmL(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1) with a detection limit of 1.6 pgmL(-1), within the range of physiological concentration of the protein. The biosensor exhibited high selectivity and has been successfully used to detect interleukin-6 in blood samples collected from patients suffering of colorectal cancer, with excellent recoveries after the addition of known amount of the target protein.

AB Restricted to single sensing mechanisms, most luminescent metal-organic framework (LMOF)-based sensors were constructed for detection of limited targets. Here, a new biosensor is described for screening acid phosphatase (ACP) activity via bifunctional NH2-MIL-101 MOFs acting as both fluorescent indicator and biomimetic catalyst. NH2-MIL-101 possesses an inherent fluorescence emission at 456 nm (F-456). As a peroxidase-like nanozyme, it catalyzes oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) by H2O2 to generate fluorescent 2,3-diaminophenazine with the maximum emission at 556 nm (F-556). Upon introducing NH2-MIL-101 into a mixture of OPD and H2O2, F-456 is quenched, while F-556 increases. The ACP sensing is based on pyrophosphate ion (PPi) mediated fluorescence tuning of the NH2-MIL-101/OPD/H2O2 system. PPi inhibits the NH2-MIL-101 catalytic ability by specific binding to its Fe center, while ACP addition recovers the activity by hydrolyzing PPi. Upon addition of PPi and ACP into the NH2-MIL-101/OPD/H2O2 system, a ratiometric luminescence signal (F-556/F-456) is obtained, and a ratiometric fluorescent sensor can be developed for the sensitive detection of PPi and for screening ACP activity. Plots of F-556/F-456 vs. ACP concentration were linear over 0.01-30 U/L, with a detection limit of 0.005 U/L. The proposed sensor was successfully used for ACP detection in serum samples. This ratiometric fluorescence assay will open new applications for LMOF-based biosensors.

AB We propose the first black phosphorus (BP) - fiber optic biosensor for ultrasensitive diagnosis of human neuron-specific enolase (NSE) cancer biomarkers. A novel optical-nano configuration has been exploited by integrating BP nanosheets with a largely tilted fiber grating (BP-TFG), where the BP is bio-functionalized by the poly-L-lysine acting as a critical cross-linker to facilitate bio-nano-photonic interface with extremely enhanced lightmatter interaction. BP nanosheets are synthesized by a liquid ultrasonication-based exfoliation and deposited on fiber device by an in-situ layer-by-layer method. The BP-induced optical modulation effects in terms of thickness-tunable feature, polarization-dependence and enhanced light-matter interaction are experimentally investigated. The anti-NSE immobilized BP-TFG biosensor has been implemented to detect NSE biomarkers demonstrating ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection down to 1.0 pg/mL, which is 4 orders magnitude lower than NSE cutoff value of small cell lung cancer. The enhanced sensitivity of BP-TFG is 100-fold higher than graphene oxide or AuNPs based biosensors. We believe that BP-fiber optic configuration opens a new bio-nano-photonic platform for the applications in healthcare, biomedical, food safety and environmental monitoring.

AB Herein, a ratiometric fluorescent method was developed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) detection based on near-infrared (NIR) Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) and calcein through the competitive approach. The system based on Ag2S QDs and calcein shows green (maximum emission at 512 nm from calcein) and near infrared (NIR) fluorescence (maximum 798 nm from Ag2S QDs) under the same excitation wavelength (468 nm). In the presence of Ce3+, the fluorescence intensity of calcein is decreased due to static quenching, while the fluorescence intensity of Ag2S QDs is enhanced through aggregation induced emission (ME). The p-nitrophenyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by ALP, and the yield phosphate ions bind with Ce3+ with higher affinity than these of Ag2S QDs and calcein. Therefore, the green fluorescence from calcein is recovered while NIR fluorescence from Ag2S QDs is decreased. On the basis of these findings, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the measurement of ALP activity. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 512 and 798 nm (F-512/F-798) was well associated with the ALP concentration ranging from 2 to 100 mU/mL with the detection limit of 1.28 mU/mL. The method was successfully applied for detecting ALP in human serum with an acceptable recovery and bioimaging intracellular ALP with good performance. In addition, the approach was also employed for the screening ALP inhibitor.

AB A variety of routine methods are available for the detection of silver (I) (Ag+) ions, but most of them rely on expensive, sophisticated and desktop instruments. Herein, a low-cost, instrument-free and portable Ag+ biosensor was described by initially designing a new class of 3D origami microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) into each of which one piece of reagent-loaded nanoporous membrane was integrated. It combines analyte-triggered self-growing of silver nanoparticles to block the membranes pores in situ for rapid yet efficient signal amplification with a handheld personal glucose meter for a portable and sensitive quantitative readout based on the biocatalytic reactions between the glucose oxidase and glucose. Its utility is well demonstrated with the specific detection of the analyte with a limit of detection as low as similar to 58.1 pM (3 sigma), which makes this new biosensing method one of the most sensitive Ag+ assays in comparison with many other typical methods recently reported. Moreover, the satisfactory recovery of analyzing several types of real water examples, i.e., tap water, drinking water, pond water and soil water, additionally validates its feasibility for practical applications.

AB We report on a wearable tear bioelectronic platform, integrating a microfluidic electrochemical detector into an eyeglasses nose-bridge pad, for non-invasive monitoring of key tear biomarkers. The alcohol-oxidase (AOx) biosensing fluidic system allowed real-time tear collection and direct alcohol measurements in stimulated tears, leading to the first wearable platform for tear alcohol monitoring. Placed outside the eye region this fully wearable tear-sensing platform addresses drawbacks of sensor systems involving direct contact with the eye as the contact lenses platform. Integrating the wireless electronic circuitry into the eyeglasses frame thus yielded a fully portable, convenient-to-use fashionable sensing device. The tear alcohol sensing concept was demonstrated for monitoring of alcohol intake in human subjects over multiple drinking courses, displaying good correlation to parallel BAC measurements. We also demonstrate for the first time the ability to monitor tear glucose outside the eye and the utility of wearable devices for monitoring vitamin nutrients in connection to enzymatic flow detector and rapid voltammetric scanning, respectively. These developments pave the way to build an effective eyeglasses system capable of chemical tear analysis.

AB A novel and disposable electrochemical biosensor for PCR-free and selective detection of Sola l 7, a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) found in tomato seeds associated to severe symptoms of tomato-allergic patients, is reported in this work. The methodology involves the formation of DNA/RNA heterohybrids by sandwich hybridization of a specific fragment of the Sola l 7 allergen coding sequence with appropriate RNA probes designed and described for the first time in this work. Labeling was carried out with commercial antibodies specific to the heteroduplexes and secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP onto the surface of magnetic beads. Amperometric transduction was performed upon magnetic capture of the resulting magnetic bioconjugates on screen-printed electrodes using the system H2O2/HQ. A comparison of the sandwich hybridization format with a direct approach as well as between different labeling strategies was performed. The LOD value achieved was 0.2 pM (5 amol in 25 mu L). The biosensor was successfully applied to the selective analysis of the targeted Sofa l 7 specific region directly in just 100 ng of non-fragmented denatured genomic DNA extracted from tomato seeds.

AB The nanomaterials with enzyme-like catalytic activity, named as nanozymes, have aroused wide research interest owing to their striking merits. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have showed great prospect in the construction of novel nanozymes. In this review, firstly, we summarize the most recent contributions in the design construction of the MOFs-based nanozymes. Then, we concentrate our attention on their applications in the fields of sensing and cancer therapies. According to the design strategies, we categorized MOFs-based nanozymes into four classes for review (i.e. pristine MOFs, MOFs with modification, MOFs-based nanocomposites, and MOF derivatives). Meanwhile, the emerging and fascinating 2D MOFs-based nanozymes were also reviewed. A variety of novel applications are also discussed, including nanozymes catalytic mediated signal amplification in sensing applications (e.g. colorimetric sensing, fluorescent sensing, chemiluminescent sensing, electrochemical sensing, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)), and nanozymes catalytic mediated cancer therapy (i.e. cancer-starvation therapy, enhancing photodynamic therapy, and cancer-starvation and PDT synergistic therapy). At the end of the article, future opportunities and challenges in this promising research area are tentatively proposed.

AB The use of mRNA in biotechnology has expanded with novel applications such as vaccines and therapeutic mRNA delivery recently demonstrated. For mRNA to be used in patients, quality control assays will need to be routinely established. Currently, there is a gap between the highly sophisticated RNA integrity tests available and broader application of mRNA-based products by non-specialist users, e.g. in mass vaccination campaigns. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a low-cost biosensor able to test the integrity of a mRNA molecule with low technological requirements and easy end-user application. The biosensor is based on a bi-functional fusion protein, composed by the lambda N peptide that recognizes its cognate aptamer encoded on the 5' end of the RNA under study and beta-lactamase, which is able to produce a colorimetric response through a simple test. We propose two different mechanisms for signal processing adapted to two levels of technological sophistication, one based on spectrophotometric measurements and other on visual inspection. We show that the proposed lambda N-beta Lac chimeric protein specifically targets its cognate RNA aptamer, boxB, using both gel shift and biolayer interferometry assays. More importantly, the results presented confirm the biosensor performs reliably, with a wide dynamic range and a proportional response at different percentages of full-length RNA, even when genesized mRNAs were used. Thus, the features of the proposed biosensor would allow to end-users of products such as mRNA vaccines to test the integrity of the product before its application in a low-cost fashion, enabling a more reliable application of these products.

AB The heparin contamination by oversulfated chondroitin (OSCS) was at the origin of one major sanitary problem of last decade. Here we propose a novel strategy to detect OSCS from heparin solution based on conical nanopore functionalized with poly-L-lysine deposition to ensure its re-usability. This sensor is an excellent to detect low heparin concentration (from 25 ng/ml to 3 mu g/ml) using the modification of ionic current rectification. It also allows following the kinetic of heparin degradation by heparinase with a good correlation with results obtained by classical methods. The sensor is sensitive to the inhibition of heparinase by OSCS until a concentration of 200 pg/l representing 0.01% in weight in a heparin. This resolution is one order of magnitude lower than the one obtained by chromatography. For the first time, it was reached without fluorescence labeling.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer with a high mortality rate. The early and accurate detection of PCa can significantly reduce mortality and saves lives. Hence, the nanomaterials based electrochemical nanobiosensors for PCa biomarkers will be the excellent alternative for diagnosis, detection and management of disease condition. In this review, we present a concise summary of the latest attainment and advancement in the use of nanoparticles for the diagnosis of PCa biomarkers. This review highlighted the importance of applying specific biomarkers along with nanomaterials like gold, magnetic, carbon nanotubes, and many other materials for developing electrochemical nanobiosensors in PCa detection. In addition to a summary on PCa detection, we further ensure future perspectives in PCa biomarkers detection, sensitivity, simplicity, rapidity, accuracy, cost-effectiveness and succeeding optimizations of novel technologies for more feasibility. Finally, closing remarks and an outlook conclude the review.

AB Electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) use extracellular electron transfer (EET) to exchange electron with extracellular acceptors. Previous studies regarding the measurement of EAB were based on either extracellular reduction or oxidation. In this work, we developed a simple electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay for the identification and detection of EAB. The results of this proposed method revealed that EET of EAB influenced the content of dissolved oxygen and the formation of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+center dot) thus leading to qualitative changes of the ECL signal. EAB with the ability of extracellular reduction (such as Shewanella oneidensis MR 1) gave enhanced signal on ECL emission while those displaying the ability of extracellular oxidation (i.e., Sulfobacillus acidophilus) showed the opposite effect on ECL emission, but non-EAB (i.e., Escherichia colt) did not. These changes in ECL intensity were also proportional to the cell density that could be quantitatively detected in the concentration range of (1.1 +/- 1) x 10(5)-212 +/- 2 CFU/mL (i.e. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1). Moreover, the measurement of the ability of EAB using this approach was in agreement with measurements using the dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction method. Compared to previous reports, this method displayed a continual and steady ECL signal that allowed accurate measurements of EAB. Most important, only a low cell density was needed in this Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) - based ECL method, which is beneficial for cell detection.

AB Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are the most promising candidates for recording biological signals due to improved interfacing properties with cells and the possibility of high-speed transduction of biochemical signals into detectable electrical responses. The recording of extracellular action potentials (APs) from cardiac cells is important for fundamental studies of AP propagation features reflecting cell activity and the influence of pharmacological substances on the signal. We applied a novel approach of using fabricated Si NW field-effect transistors (FETs) in combination with fluorescent marker techniques to evaluate the functional activity of cardiac cells. Extracellular AP signal recording from HL-1 cardiomyocytes was demonstrated. This method was supplemented by studies of the pharmacological effects of stimulations using noradrenaline (NorA) as a modulator of functional activity on a cellular and subcellular levels, which were also tested using fluorescent marker techniques. The role of calcium alteration and membrane potential were revealed using Fluo-4 AM and tetra-methylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM) fluorescent dyes. In addition, chemical treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solutions was tested. The results obtained demonstrate positive prospects for AP monitoring in different treatments for studies related to a wide range of myocardial diseases using lab-on-chip technology.

AB There is an increasing need for advanced and inexpensive preclinical models to accelerate the development of anticancer drugs. While costly animal models fail to predict human clinical outcomes, in vitro models such as microfluidic chips ('tumor-on-chip') are showing tremendous promise at predicting and providing meaningful preclinical drug screening outcomes. Research on 'tumor-on-chips' has grown enormously worldwide and is being widely accepted by pharmaceutical companies as a drug development tool. In light of this shift in philosophy, it is important to review the recent literature on microfluidic devices to determine how rapidly the technology has progressed as a promising model for drug screening and aiding cancer therapy. We review the past five years of successful developments and capabilities in microdevice technology (cancer models) for use in anticancer drug screening. Microfluidic devices that are being designed to address current challenges in chemotherapy, such as drug resistance, combinatorial drug therapy, personalized medicine, and cancer metastasis are also reviewed in detail. We provide a perspective on how personalized 'tumor-on-chip', as well as high throughput microfluidic platforms based on patient-specific tumor cells, can potentially replace the more expensive and 'non-human' animal models in preclinical anticancer drug development.

AB A suspended carbon nanotube (SCNT)-based field effective transistor (SCNT-FET), which was fabricated by utilizing the surface tension of liquid silver to suspend a CNT between two Pd electrodes, was proposed for the detection of DNA hybridization. Benefits from the separation between the CNT and the substrates could be observed; namely, the conductivity of a SCNT-FET was much higher (two orders of magnitude) than that of a FET based on an unsuspended CNT and about 50% sensing surface of CNT was freed from substrate. The Slater-Koster tight-binding method was adopted for geometry optimization and transport property calculation of the SCNT bound with DNA. The result showed that the conductance (G = 1/R) of the SCNT decreased in order with the binding of single-stranded DNA (SSDNA, probe DNA) and double-stranded DNA (DSDNA) and that the ability of DSDNA to weaken the conductivity of the SCNT was several times higher than that of SSDNA. SEM and Raman spectroscopy were used to demonstrate that DNA could be bound successfully onto the SCNT using a 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE) as a linkage. Ultra-high sensitivity detection of DNA [with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 10 aM] was obtained using such an SCNT-FET, which showed a lower value than that of a previously reported FET DNA biosensor whose sensing materials were in direct contact with the substrate.

AB In this work, a dynamic terminus-regulated fabric of DNA hydrogel was invented in debt to the reiterative catalysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). It extended free 3' - OH end to an overhang of homopolymeric adenosine base pair, and alternated with branching from the frayed complementary seed oligo T(20)G(5). The cycle of this template-independent and isothermal amplification resulted in a microscale dendritic DNA fractal at first, which then gelatinized into a cohesive and intricate 3D network. Details of the complex were elucidated with gel electrophoresis, confocal and atomic force microscopy. Its well hydrated inner space could further provide plenty of biocompatible chambers for enzymatic transducers fused along the elongation. Taking merits of this neat and flexible setup, an in situ hydrogelation strategy was developed and utilized in the signal cascade of a miRNA biomarker detector on an electrode microarray, thus accomplished an ultrasensitive, selective and high-throughput sensing even for real samples. This collective manipulation of DNA-protein hydrogel ensemble on interface demonstrates its potency as a general scheme of sensitization in bioanalytical applications.

AB To date, there are limited approaches for the direct and rapid visualization (on site) of tumor tissues for pathological assessment and for aiding cytoreductive surgery. Herein, we have designed FIT-PNAs (forced-intercalation-peptide nucleic acids) to detect two RNA cancer biomarkers. Firstly, a lncRNA (long noncoding RNA) termed CCAT1, has been shown as an oncogenic lncRNA over-expressed in a variety of cancers. The latter, an mRNA termed KRT20, has been shown to be over-expressed in metastases originating from colorectal cancer (CRC). To these FIT-PNAs, we have introduced the bis-quinoline (BisQ) cyanine dye that emits light in the red region (605-610 nm) of the visible spectrum. Most strikingly, spraying fresh human tissue taken from patients during cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal metastasis of colon cancer with an aqueous solution of CCAT1 FIT-PNA results in bright fluorescence in a matter of minutes. In fresh healthy tissue (from bariatric surgeries), no appreciable fluorescence is detected. In addition, a non-targeted FIT-PNA shows no fluorescent signal after spraying this FIT-PNA on fresh tumor tissue emphasizing the specificity of these molecular sensors. This study is the first to show on-site direct and immediate visualization of an RNA cancer biomarker on fresh human cancer tissues by topical application (spraying) of a molecular sensor.

AB It is well known that Alzheimer's disease is one of the global challenges for the 21st century. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a reliable biosensor for the detection of this disease. Here in, we have developed for the first time, an aptasensor based on interferometric reflectance spectroscopy (IRS) for the determination of amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers that is an Alzheimer's disease biomarker. For this purpose, the nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) was first fabricated. After that, the pore walls of the NAA were modified with (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (NAA-NH2). The amino-terminal aptamers probe were then attached to the pore walls of the NAA-NH2 by using glutaraldehyde (GA) as the cross-linking agent. Subsequently, methylene blue (MB) was immobilized into the aptamer as the photo-probe, generating the MB/G-quadruplex complex. Since MB has a high absorption coefficient, the intensity of the reflected white light to the charge-coupled device (CCD) detector decreased. In the presence of the A beta oligomers that have high affinity to the immobilized aptamer, the MB/quadruplex complex broke and MB washed away from the aptasensor. Therefore, the intensity of the reflected white light to the CCD detector increased. The increased signal intensity of the aptasensor has a logarithmic relationship with the concentration of A beta oligomers. The proposed aptasensor exhibited a good response to the concentration of A beta oligomers in the range of 0.5-50.0 mu g x mL(-1). The experimental detection limit was of 0.02 mu g x mL(-1) (at 3 sigma/S). The proposed optical aptasensor exhibited good selectivity, linear range, and stability.

AB Hypervalent tellurium compounds have a particular reactivity towards thiol compounds which are related to their biological properties. In this work, this property was assembled to tellurium-functionalized surfaces. These compounds were used as linkers in the immobilization process of thiolated biomolecules (such as DNA) on microcantilever surfaces. The telluride derivatives acted as reversible binding agents due to their redox properties, providing the regeneration of microcantilever surfaces and allowing their reuse for further biomolecules immobilizations, recycling the functional surface. Initially, we started from the synthesis of 4-((3-((4-methoxyphenyl) tellanyl) phenyl) amino)-4-oxobutanoic acid, a new compound, which was immobilized on a silicon surface. In nanomechanical systems, the detection involved a hybridization study of thiolated DNA sequences. Fluorescence microscopy technique was used to confirm the immobilization and removal of the telluride-DNA system and provided revealing results about the potentiality of applying redox properties to chalcogen derivatives at surfaces.

AB Peptide nucleic acids array technology is a method of greatly increasing the throughput of laboratory processes to efficiently perform large-scale genetic tests. Diethylene glycol-containing chiral gamma PNA (miniPEG-gamma PNA) is considered to be the best PNA derivative and one of the best candidates for gene detection, because it can hybridize DNA with greater affinity and sequence selectivity than DNA and ordinary aminoethylglycyl PNA (aegPNA). Herein, miniPEG-gamma PNA probes are synthesized by 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) in a mild condition, and a new biochip fabrication method "Film-Spotting" is invented, by which gamma PNA arrays with regular pattern, uniform luminance, and very low fluorescence background are obtained easily and cheaply. The miniPEG-gamma PNA array can effectively distinguish the full matched and mis-matched targets in SSarc buffer, serum and urine, and the detection limit of complementary DNA is less than 5.97 nM. A miniPEG-gamma PNA array for BRCA1 gene mutation (3099delT) detection is also fabricated with a very good detection performance. This work provides an effective avenue for the diagnosis of breast cancer biomarker and expands the application of miniPEG-gamma PNA in the field of biochip.

AB A sediment microbial fuel cell electro-Fenton (SMFC-E-Fenton) system was proposed in this study by utilizing the biological electrons produced from an SMFC to power an E-Fenton process. Antibiotics with different absorbability in both aqueous and solid phase can be removed by this system at room temperature and pressure condition, without external power or other chemical reagents. gamma-FeOOH graphene polyacrylamide carbonized aerogel (gamma-FeOOH GPCA) with high electrochemically active surface area (EASA), good conductivity and stable electrochemical activity were used as the cathode. After 40 h treatment, the total degradation rate of sulfa-methoxazole (SMX) and norfloxacin (NOR) were 97.4 +/- 2.9% and 96.1 +/- 3.0%, respectively. Compared with the sludge digestion system, the residual SMX and NOR in sludge declined from 10.2 +/- 1.5% to 1.1 +/- 1.2% and from 31.3 +/- 1.8% to 3.1 +/- 1.3%, respectively. The E-Fenton process can also promote electricity production and sludge reduction efficiency of SMFC, as the maximum power density SMFC-E-Fenton system reached 472.21 +/- 11.5 mW m(-2) and 431.39 +/- 15.6 mWm(-2), respectively. 6.2 +/- 0.3% and 5.7 +/- 0.8% of the initial sludge was reduced while treating SMX and NOR.

AB This article reports that a metastructure of polypeptides with the bound water can have high and stable electron conductivity without classic electron-conducting components. We used gelatin as the model protein since the peptide chains contain numerous sites capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The lack of redox sites and the trace amounts of aromatic amino acids also eliminate the possibility that the electron transfer is due to redox reactions or pi-stacking. Our Raman spectroscopy results show that the high electron-conductive metastructure is composed of bound water and unwound gelatin polypeptides. Further removal of bound water from the metastructure dramatically decreases the electron-conductivity, indicating that bound water is crucial to connect the polypeptide chains for the electron-conductivity. In addition, the ability to switch between the low-electron-conductive typical hydrogel state and the high-electron-conductive metastructure state of the gelatin hydrogel allows the gelatin hydrogel to exhibit rewritable nonvolatile resistive memory features. The high ON/OFF current ratio of 10(5) at a low reading voltage of 0.09 V is superior to that of conventional nonvolatile resistive memories by one order of magnitude. The discovered phenomenon of using bound water and flexible polypeptide structure for long-distance electron transfer could provide a new direction for designing highly biocompatible conducting materials or functional devices in bioelectronics.

AB In this study, we report a facile, reusable, and highly sensitive label-free impedance sensor for discriminating Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The impedance sensor was fabricated using gold interdigitated electrodes onto a tungsten oxide thin film. X-Ray diffraction confirmed the formation of polycrystalline tungsten oxide. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that tungsten oxide has a porous structure. Tungsten oxide was functionalized with vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic known to have a specific interaction with the peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria. Fourier transform infrared microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were employed to test the morphological coating of vancomycin on interdigitated electrodes/tungsten oxide sensor. The functionalized tungsten oxide sensor was highly efficient in the capture of Gram-positive bacteria. The impedance measurement was also sensitive to differentiate between viable and non-viable Gram-positive bacteria. Limit of detection 10(2) colony forming unit/ml, linear dynamic range 10(2)-10(7) colony forming unit/ml under physiological conditions and reusable nature of this vancomycin coated impedance sensor provide a label-free strategy for quick, sensitive and highly selective detection of Gram-positive bacteria.

AB DNA-based nanomachines have received increasing attention due to their great potential to mimic natural biological motors and create novel modes of motion. Here, we report a DNAzyme-based walking machine, which can operate in living cells after triggered by intracellular miRNA-21. The walking machine is constructed by assembling DNAzyme walking strands and FAM-labeled substrate strands on a single gold nanoparticle (AuNP). The DNAzyme walking strand is first silenced by a blocker strand. After cellular uptake, DNAzyme-based walker can be triggered by intracellular miRNA-21 and autonomously walk along the AuNP-based 3D track fueled by DNAzyme-catalyzed substrate cleavage. Each walking step results in the cleavage of a substrate strand and the release of a FAM-labeled DNA strand, allowing real-time monitoring of the operation of the machine. The DNAzyme-based walking machine has been successfully applied to image and monitor miRNA-21 expression levels in living cells with excellent specificity and reliability. This walking machine would hold great potential in the miRNA associated biological research and disease diagnostics.

AB At the point of care (POC), on-side clinical testing allows fast biomarkers determination even in resource-limited environments. Current POC systems rely on tests selective to a single analyte or complex multiplexed systems with important portability and performance limitations. Hence, there is a need for handheld POC devices enabling the detection of multiple analytes with accuracy and simplicity. Here we present a reconfigurable smartphone-interfaced electrochemical Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) with two working electrodes for dual analyte determination enabling biomarkers' selection in situ and on-demand. Biomarkers selection was achieved by the use of electrodepositable alginate hydrogels. Alginate membranes containing either glucose oxidase (GOx) or lactate oxidase (LOx) were selectively electrodeposited on the surface of each working electrode in around 4 min, completing sample measurement in less than 1 min. Glucose and lactate determination was performed simultaneously and without cross-talk in buffer, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and whole blood samples, the latter being possible by the size-exclusion filtration capacity of the hydrogels. At optimal conditions, glucose and lactate were determined in a wide linear range (0-12 mM and 0-5 mM, respectively) and with high sensitivities (0.24 and 0.54 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1), respectively), which allowed monitoring of Type-1 diabetic patients with a simple dual analysis system. After the measurement, membranes were removed by disaggregation with the calcium-chelator phosphate buffer. At this point, new membranes could be electrodeposited, this time being selective to the same or another analyte. This conferred the system with on-demand biomarkers' selection capacity. The versatility and flexibility of the current architecture is expected to impact in POC analysis in applications ranging from homecare to sanitary emergencies.

AB A combined thread-paper microfluidic device (mu TPAD) is presented for the determination of glucose in blood. The device is designed to include all the analytical operations needed: red blood cell separation, conditioning, enzymatic recognition, and colorimetric transduction. The signal is captured with a smartphone or tablet working in video mode and processed by custom Android-based software in real-time. The automatic detection of the region of interest on the thread allows for the use of either initial rate or equilibrium signal as analytical parameters. The time needed for analysis is 12 s using initial rate, and 100 s using the equilibrium measurement with a LOD of 48 mu M and 12 mu M, respectively, and a precision around 7%. The mu TPAD allows a rapid determination of glucose in real samples using only 3 mu L of whole blood.

AB The design and construction of high-performance photoelectrode with efficient visible-light absorption and fast charge transport rate are crucial to developing photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Herein, a well-aligned amorphous MoSx (a-MoSx)@ZnO core-shell nanorod arrays was uniformly grown on indium tin oxide (ITO) via a facile all-electrochemical strategy. Simultaneous boosted PEC performance and stability in the visible region were obtained. Those could be attributed to the collaboration effect of fast electron transfer path within the oriented ZnO nanorod and extended visible-light absorption upon combining a-MoSx, as well as favorable energy-band alignment between the two PEC materials. By employing tobramycin-binding aptamer as recognition element, a self-powered PEC aptasensor for tobramycin was successfully fabricated for the first time. The sensor exhibited a rapid response in a wide linear range of 0.010-50 ng/mL with good stability and reproducibility. The detection limit was as low as 5.7 pg/mL. Ultrasensitive and high-affinitive determination of tobramycin in serum samples was realized at 0 V (vs.SCE) with desired accuracy and satisfactory recovery. This work reveals the promising application of all-electrodeposited a-MoSx@ZnO NR arrays-based photoanode for self-powered PEC bioassay in the tobramycin-related disease diagnosis.

AB Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are very popular for point-of-care diagnostics, which provide a fast, cost-effective and possible multiplexed detection of a spectrum of molecules. They have been matching forward proudly to contribute to the modern analytical science and life science. Accompanying with their advantages and huge potentials, low detection sensitivity is continuing to challenge the application of PADs from bench to bedside. In order to improve the sensitivity and enhance the signal readout, variable signal amplification strategies have been investigated and applied for PADs. In this review, we have firstly classified formats of PADs according to the engineering design. Advances for improving sensitivity of PADs in recent five years are then summarised according to three popular types of signal amplification strategies (nanomaterial based, nucleic acid based, and engineering of PADs based). Pros and cons of each signal amplification approach have been discussed accordingly. Finally, the future perspectives of PADs are proposed.

The individual sensor is composed of a photolithographically-fabricated Au/Cr-based electrode modified with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes. The sensor array chips showed sequence-specific responses upon hybridization of the probes with target sequences complementary to the probes in contrast to mismatch versions. The target oligonucleotides have 15-22 mer sequences from messenger RNAs for estrogen-responsive genes and microRNAs for lung cancer biomarkers. The dependence on target concentrations of sensor responses was observed by using a single chip on which experiments for detection of several target concentrations proceeded simultaneously, with the detection limit of 7.33 x 10(-8) M. As more realistic samples, oligonucleotide samples amplified by PCR from a synthesized template sequence were applied to the chip. They showed sequence-specific responses, revealing the potential for fabricated sensor array chips to be utilized to analyze PCR samples. Unlike complicated and expensive chips that require nanofabrication, our sensor array chips based on glass coated with gold thin films are simple and can be fabricated from inexpensive and readily available materials.

AB Simultaneous detection of multiple tumor biomarkers in body fluids could facilitate early diagnosis of lung cancer, so as to provide scientific reference for clinical treatment. This paper depicted a multi-parameter paper based electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) in a clinical sample with high sensitivity and specificity. The paper-based device was fabricated through wax printing and screen-printing, which enabled functions of sample filtration and sample auto injection. Amino functional graphene (NG)-Thionin (THI)-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Prussian blue (PB)-poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-AuNPs nanocomposites were synthesized respectively. They were used to modify the working electrodes not only for promoting the electron transfer rate, but also for immobilization of the CEA and NSE aptamers. A label-free electrochemical method was adopted, enabling a rapid simple point-of-care testing. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-parameter aptasensor exhibited good linearity in ranges of 0.01-500 ng mL(-1) for CEA (R-2 = 0.989) and 0.05-500 ng mL(-1) for NSE (R-2 = 0.944), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2 pg mL(-1) for CEA and 10 pg mL(-1) for NSE. In addition, the device was evaluated using clinical serum samples and received a good correlation with large electrochemical luminescence (ECL) equipment, which would offer a new platform for early cancer diagnostics, especially in those resource-limit areas.

AB Highly sensitive and low-cost DNA detection are in great desire owing to the significant role of DNA molecules in detecting genetic damage and errors for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple diseases. Traditional detections of DNA mainly rely on large-scale instrument, which requires the complicated detection process and high cost. Solution-gated electrochemical transistors are widely studied due to high sensitivity and low cost. Here, we exploit a graphene electrochemical transistor for the efficient and sensitive DNA detection. The probe DNA is modified on the gate electrode to detect the target DNA molecules. A novel method is introduced to modify the gate electrode with the probe DNA to detect the different concentration of target DNA. Herein, in comparison with previous reported methods, our DNA sensors show a good limit of detection in the range of 1 fM - 5 mu M. The highly sensitive and selective validate the developed DNA sensor as a promising tool for routine use.

AB We report on a novel biomimetic sensor that allows sensitive and specific detection of Escherichia colt (E. coli) bacteria in a broad concentration range from 10(2) up to 10(6) CFU/mL in both buffer fluids and relevant food samples (i.e. apple juice). The receptors are surface-imprinted polyurethane layers deposited on stainless-steel chips. Regarding the transducer principle, the sensor measures the increase in thermal resistance between the chip and the liquid due to the presence of bacteria captured on the receptor surface. The low noise level that enables the low detection limit originates from a planar meander element that serves as both a heater and a temperature sensor. Furthermore, the experiments show that the presence of bacteria in a liquid enhances the thermal conductivity of the liquid itself. Reference tests with a set of other representative species of Enterobacteriaceae, closely related to E. coli, indicate a very low cross-sensitivity with a sensor response at or below the noise level.

AB Numerous studies reported that psychological fatigue is one of the main reasons leading fatal road crashes. In order to quantify fatigue level of each subject, we measured a concentration of salivary cortisol from 4 subjects (20-40 years of age) using the Smart Fatigue Phone, which consists of a lateral flow immunosensor and a smartphone-linked fluorescence signal reader, during 50-min driving session. Since the salivary cortisol needs to be measured below 1 ng/mL to distinguish the subjects from awaken-drivers, we have employed the fluorescence detection module (Limit of detection: 0.1 ng/mL). To validate correlation between fatigue status and salivary cortisol concentration measured by the Smart Fatigue Phone, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal was simultaneously obtained from the participants. As a result, alpha wave and concentration of cortisol over time was highly correlated, reflecting that quantification of salivary cortisol can be used for real-time monitoring of driver fatigue (p < 0.05). The Smart Fatigue Phone is expected to be a useful tool for drivers to recognize their fatigue status and subsequently to make a decision for driving a car. Thus, we assume that this fatigue detection system will consequently minimize road crashes by quantifying salivary cortisol in real time in the near future.

AB In this paper, we present a simple strategy to fabricate a sensitive fluorescence microfluidic sensor based on quantum dots (QDs) aerogel and acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) for organophosphate pesticides (OPs) detection The detection is based on the change of fluorescence intensity of QDs aerogel, which will be partly quenched as a consequence of the hydrolytic reaction of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) catalyzed by the AChE, and then the fluorescence of QDs aerogel is recovered due to decreasing of the enzymatic activity in the presence of OPs. The QDs-AChE aerogel based microfluidic arrays sensor provided good sensitivity for rapid detection of OPs with a detection limit of 0.38 pM, while the detection range is from 10(-5) to 10(-12) M. Due to the result of random orientations of AChE in the 3D porous aerogel nano-structure, the sensor presents similar calibration curves to difference pesticides, which promises the ability of the sensor to monitor total OPs of mixture. This determination sensor shows a low detection limit, wide linear range, and highly accurate determination of total OPs and carbamate content. Finally, we show the proposed sensor can be used to monitor of simple OPs and mixture in spiked fruit samples. This novel QDs-AChE aerogel sensor has an extremely high sensitivity and large detection range, it is a promising tool for accurate, rapid and cost-effective detection of various OP residues on agricultural products.

AB A simple, single-masked gold interdigitated triple-microelectrodes biosensor is presented by taking the advantage of an effective self-assembled monolayer (SAM) using an amino-silanization technique for the early detection of a prostate cancer's biomarker, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Unlike most interdigitated electrode biosensors, biorecognition happens in between the interdigitated electrodes, which enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection of the sensor. Using the Faradaic mode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique to quantify the PSA antigen, the developed sensing platform demonstrates a logarithmic detection of PSA ranging from 0.5 ng/ml to 5000 ng/ml, an estimated LOD down to 0.51 ng/ml in the serum, and a good sensor's reproducibility. The sensor's detection range covers the clinical threshold value at 4 ng/ml and the crucial diagnosis 'grey zone' of 4-10 ng/ml of PSA in serum for an accurate cancer diagnosis. The selectivity test revealed an excellent discrimination of other competing proteins, with a recorded detection signals at 5 ng/ml PSA as high as 7-fold increase versus the human serum albumin (HSA) and 8-fold increase versus the human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2). The stability test showed an acceptable stability of the aptasensor recorded at six (6) days before the detection signal started degrading below 10% of the peak detection value. The developed sensing scheme is proven to exhibit a great potential as a portable prostate cancer biosensor, also as a universal platform for bio-molecular sensing with the versatility to implement nanoparticles and other surface chemistry for various applications.

AB Liposomal photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis holds enormous potential for future sensitive PEC bioanalysis. With tyrosinase (Tyr) and TiO2 as representative enzyme and electrode, respectively, this communication reports the elegant use of Tyr-loaded liposomes (TLL) toward in situ sensitization of the electrode and thereby the realization of ultrasensitive PEC immunoassay. Specifically, Tyr-encapsulated and detection antibody-functionalized liposomes were first prepared and used as the signal probe. The subsequent sandwich immunobinding could confine the functional liposomes, which were then lysed with surfactant to release the encapsulated Tyr. The free Tyr could then initiate the transformation of tyrosine to dopa, the latter could bind with the under coordinated Ti sites, forming the stable dopa-Ti charge transfer complex and thus generating enhanced anodic photocurrent under visible light for signaling. Since different semiconductors and enzymes may be adapted into this format, this work is expected to stimulate more interest in the enzyme-induced activation of semiconductors for advanced liposomal PEC bioanalysis.

AB We present a fully integrated portable centrifugal microsystem for multiplex detection of food poisoning bacteria with a large volume of sample up to 1 mL. The microsystem consists of a portable genetic analyzer and a fully integrated centrifugal microdevice. The centrifugal microdevice is designed with two units: a 3D printed solution -loading cartridge and a centrifugal microfluidic disc. All the essential solutions for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction are stored inside the cartridge, and orderly released into centrifugal microdevice by a rotation program. Each unit of the device is designed with 20 reaction chambers for simultaneous detection of food-borne bacteria in one test. To increase the amount of a sample to 1 mL, we incorporated the super absorbent polymer (SAP) in the waste chamber to absorb the sample and the washing solution during the device operation. The whole process was automatically conducted including designated solution release, bead-based DNA extraction, isothermal gene amplification by Eriochrome Black (EBT)-mediated LAMP reaction, and colorimetric and UV visible detection of amplicons. The ratio between Abs(640nm), and Abs(570nm) was used as a criterion to confirm the positive result, and the result was positive upon the condition of Abs(640)/Abs(570) >= 1.0. To demonstrate the pathogenic bacteria detection on our proposed microsystem, we targeted three kinds of bacteria (Escherichia colt O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) for monoplex and multiplex detection. The whole process from sample to result was completed within 1 h with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10(2) cells/mL.

AB A paper-based electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) by screen-printing technique. The reduced graphene oxide/thionine/gold nanoparticles (rGO/Thi/AuNPs) nanocomposites were compounded and coated onto the working electrode of immunosensor for CA125 antibody (anti-CA125) immobilization and detection signal amplification. The detection principle was based on the fact that the immunocomplex formed by specify binding of CA125 antibody and antigen could reduce the current response of thionine, which was proportional to the corresponding concentration of CA125 antigen. The immunoassay results showed that the linear range of CA125 was from 0.1 U mL(-1) to 200 U mL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 U mL(-1) at signal to noise of 3. Quality control serum samples measured by our proposed immunosensor showed acceptable agreement with traditional ELISA method with the relative error less than 8.05%. The immunosensor exhibited good electrochemical performance with high reproducibility, reliability, stability and accuracy. The proposed immunosensor could be used for the determination of CA125 and had the potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) of other tumor marker.

AB In this work, the ZnO nanostars with excellent catalytic performance were firstly used as the coreaction accelerator of luminol-O-2 system to construct a biosensor for ultrasensitively detecting microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) in cancer cells. Specifically, ZnO nanostars could expedite the reduction of dissolved O-2, generating more reactive oxygen species (ROSs) to extremely promote electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminous efficiency of luminol. Thus luminol-functionalized Au NPs@ZnO (L-Au NPs@ZnO) nanomaterials were employed as signal probe to fabricate sensing nano-platform for achieving significant ECL emission as "signal on" state. Moreover, upon the addition of a tiny minority of target miRNA-21, massive ferrocene (Fc) could be immobilized on the sensing interface through hybridization chain reaction (HCR) triggered-DNA dendrimers self-assembly, in which Fc consumed dissolved O-2 for prominently quenching the ECL emission of signal probe and then reached a "signal off" state. As a result, the biosensor performed a good linearity in 100 aM - 100 pM and a low limit of detection (LOD) down to 18.6 aM. In general, this work utilized a new coreaction accelerator as an efficient amplification approach for ultrasensitively detecting target analyses, providing a promising approach in luminol-centric ECL bioanalysis fields.

AB Okadaic acid (OA) is one of the most prevalent and largely distributed bio-toxin in the world. Consumption of OA results in a series of digestive ailments such as nausea and diarrhea. This study demonstrates the preparation and functioning of an electrochemical microfluidic biochip for the detection of OA. The screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified by phosphorene-gold nanocomposite onto which an aptamer specific to OA was immobilized. BP-Au nanocomposites were synthesized by an in-situ, one-step method without the use of a reducing agent. Potassium ferro-ferri cyanide was used as a redox pair to quantify signal strength. To improve reaction time, increase sensitivity and portability, a microfluidic platform was designed and developed. This device comprised of channels identified for specific purposes such as sample mixing and incubation. Overall, the integrated system consisted of a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic chip housing an aptamer modified SPCE, as a single detection module for Okadaic acid. The nanomaterials and the microfluidic channels prepared were spectroscopically and electrochemically analyzed. Differential pulse voltammograms revealed a detection limit of 8 pM, while a linear range was found between 10 nM-250 nM. Selectivity studies were also performed with spiked mussel samples and other interfering species. This point-of-care device can be deployed to perform on-farm assays in fishing units.

AB A label-free electrochemical immunosensor was successfully developed for sensitively detecting carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as a cancer marker. To achieve this, a series of bimetallic cerium and ferric oxide nanoparticles embedded within the mesoporous carbon matrix (represented by CeO2/FeOx@mC) was obtained from the bimetallic CeFe-based metal organic framework (CeFe-MOF) by calcination at different high temperatures. The formed CeO2 or FeOx nanoparticles were uniformly distributed within the highly graphitized mesoporous carbon matrix at the calcination temperature of 500 degrees C (represented by CeO2/FeOx@mC(500)). However, the obtained nanoparticles were aggregated into large size when calcined at the temperatures of 700 and 900 degrees C. The CA 19-9 antibody can be anchored to the CeO2/FeOx@mC network through chemical absorption between carboxylic groups of antibody and CeO2 or FeOx by ester-like bridging. The CeO2/FeOx@mC(500)-based immunosensor displayed superior sensing performance to the pristine CeFe-MOF, CeO2/FeOx@mC(700)- and CeO2/FeOx@mC(900)-based ones. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results showed that the developed immunosensor exhibited an extremely low detection limit of 10 mu U.mL(-1) (S/N = 3) within a wide range from 0.1 mU.mL(-1) to 10 U.mL(-1) toward CA 19-9. It also illustrated excellent specificity, good reproducibility and stability, and acceptable application analysis in the human serum solution which was diluted 100-fold with 0.01 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) and spiked with different amounts of CA19-9. Consequently, the proposed electrochemical immunosensor is capable enough of determining CA 19-9 in clinical diagnostics.

AB An automated DNA hybridization transfer in a microflow reactor is demonstrated by moving paramagnetic beads between two spatially separate solutions with different pH values. The microbeads-based microfluidic platform is fully automated and programmable. It employs a robust chemical procedure for specific DNA hybridization transfer in microfluidic devices under isothermal conditions based on reversible pH alterations. The method takes advantage of high-speed DNA hybridization and denaturation on beads under flow conditions, high fidelity of DNA hybridization, and small sample volumes. The microfluidic platform presented is saleable and applicable to many areas of modern biotechnology such as DNA hybridization chip microarrays, molecular computation, on-chip selection of functional nucleic acids, high-throughput screening of chemical libraries for drug discovery, and DNA amplification and sequencing.

AB A novel One MoNomer dual imprinted graphene oxide/carbon black composite polymer was developed applying 'surface-grafting from' approach on the screen printed carbon electrode for the electrochemical sensing of dopamine and epinephrine. Acryloylated-graphene oxide/carbon black was synthesized for the first time. This served both as a crosslinker and monomer leading to the fast electron transfer from the redox centre to the electrode. The oxidation peak potentials of both the targets were found separated by 200 mV which enabled their simultaneous analysis in real world samples, without any cross reactivity, interferences, and false-positives. The detection limits realized by the proposed sensor, under optimized analytical conditions, were found to be as low as 0.028, 0.028,0.061 and 0.029 ng mL(-1) for dopamine and 0.017, 0.018, 0.019 and 0.020 ng mL(-1) for epinephrine (S/N = 3) in aqueous, blood serum, urine and pharmaceutical samples. Such sensor could be considered suitable for the primitive diagnosis of several chronic diseases, manifested at ultra-trace level.

AB A high-performance nonenzymatic glucose sensor was successfully prepared by a layer by layer strategy through electrodeposition assembling multilayer films of Cu-metal-organic frameworks/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Cu-MOF/MWNTs) modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). Different multilayer films of Cu-MOF/MWNTs modified GCE (Cu-MOF/MWNTs/GCE) were prepared by repeating the electrodeposition of MWNTs onto the GCE in an MWNTs solution (MWNTs/GCE) and electrodeposition of the Cu-MOF layer onto the MWNTs film surface to form a Cu-MOF/MWNTs composite layer in the crystallization solution of Cu-MOF. Results confirmed that this method to fabricate multilayer composite films on the GCE was fast and convenient, and that multilayer composite films were stable and unified. The electrode modified by the multilayer composite films could effectively increase the exposure of active sites and increase the surface area of reactive contact. The GCE modified by eight layers (four multilayers Cu-MOF/MWNTs films) showed the optimum catalytic performance in the oxidation of glucose. The novel glucose sensor exhibited a wider detection linear range of 0.5 mu M-11.84 mM, with a detection limit of 0.4 mu M and a sensitivity of 3878 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1). Moreover, the electrochemical response of the sensor on glucose was fast (within 0.3 s) and stable, exhibited good selectivity and was free of interference.

AB The use of intrinsically conducting polymers (CPs) in wound care and skin tissue engineering presents a novel opportunity for accelerated wound healing, enhanced antibacterial activity and the potential for controlled drug delivery. Through their increased electrical conductivity, CPs can facilitate the application of electrical stimulation directly to the wound area, which has been linked to faster wound healing. The release of drugs or biological agents to the wound site can likewise be modulated through the use of an external electrical stimuli. This review thus summarises the available literature regarding the use of CPs for wound healing and skin tissue engineering applications, in particular the most common CPs, polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTh) and their derivates, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Results indicated that PANI and PPy, two CPs that have been most extensively studied across a range of applications, including biological, were also most frequently used in wound dressings and hydrogels. PPy was most commonly applied to skin tissue scaffolds. CPs were also frequently combined with biomolecules or biocompatible polymers via doping, the formation of composites, co-polymerisation or blending in order to improve their biocompatibility and physical properties. Overall, CPs offer much potential in terms of promoting enhanced wound healing and in skin tissue engineering.

AB In this work, we present a multiplexed (eight simultaneous measurements) paper-based electrochemical device developed in a very simple way and using low-cost materials, such as paper, carbon ink and multifunctional connector headers. Meanwhile, we have also combined the paper-based electrochemical platform with a glass-fiber strip in order to integrate easily a sampling step. Both approaches, simultaneous measuring and sampling, have been applied to the determination of glucose using bienzymatic biosensors. They are fabricated by adsorbing the mixture of enzymes (glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase), as well as the ferrocyanide, mediator of the electron transfer, on the paper-based electrode. After drying, the measuring solution (containing either glucose standards or samples) is added and the eight corresponding chronoamperograms are recorded. In the case of the microfluidic approach for sampling purposes, the glass-fiber pad (sampler) is immersed in a container with the solution, which flows by capillarity until it reaches the working electrode. The integration of one more step of the analytical process advances towards real and useful lab-on-a-chip devices. With these designs, a linear range comprised between 0.5 and 15 mM was achieved for glucose determination, with an excellent precision. If the sampler is employed, it is not necessary to use micropipettes and, nevertheless, precise measurements are obtained. The RSD of the slopes obtained for different calibrations performed in different days, with different arrays of electrochemical cells and different solutions is ca. 1%. Accurate results are obtained in the determination of glucose in real samples (orange fruit and cola beverages).

AB Women diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer suffer a very high rate of mortality. Accordingly, it is imperative to detect and diagnose the disease as early as possible in its development. Achievement of this aim implies relatively large scale screening of women at an age of clinically significance through assay of biomarkers for disease present in blood or serum. Biosensor detection offers an attractive technology for the automated detection of such species. Among several biomarkers that have been identified that are present in patients with ovarian cancer, the only one that is commonly tested for in clinical use is cancer antigen 125, which is considered to be poor biomarker for the disease. Here, we describe alternative biomarkers which overcome many of the problems associated with cancer antigen 125 such as increased sensitivity and specificity especially in the early stages of the disease and which could be employed successfully in a biosensor format. In particular, we discuss the chemistry of probes for the biomarkers, heat shock protein 10 and lysophosphatidic acid. The challenges presented by the fabrication of biosensor devices for the detection of the cancer, and the limited number of biosensors that have been developed for this purpose are discussed.

AB Enzymatic blood glucose detection with selectivity is one of the most important conundrums, because human blood contains many components that can hinder enzyme-substrate reactions. Meanwhile, cancer cells express much higher levels of glucose transporter-1 on their cell membrane to selectively and excessively uptake more alpha-D-glucose than do normal cells. Inspired by such cellular permselectivity for glucose, herein we significantly improved the selectivity of a glucose sensor by using a breast cancer cell membrane (BCCM). The BCCM was extracted from MDA-MB-231 cells and coated onto an enzyme-deposited electrode via a vesicle fusion method. We investigated BCCM-coated sensors using ATR-FTIR, SEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. The exceptional permselectivity of BCCM-coated sensors was validated using glucose solutions containing various interfering molecules (e.g., D-( - )-fructose, D-( + )-xylose, D-( + )-maltose, L-cysteine, L-ascorbic acid, and uric acid) and human serum (4.35-7.35 mM of glucose), implying their high potential for practical use.

AB It is essential to develop a highly efficient detection platform for tetracycline (Tc). Herein, based on well-designed hierarchical MIL-68(In)-NH2/MWCNT/CdS composites as a highly efficient transducer, a label-free visible light driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was systematically fabricated. Characterization results indicate that the forming of MIL-68(In)-NH2/CdS heterojunction remarkable facilitated the transfer and inhibited the recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, the transfer properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) further improved the photoelectric conversion efficiency by adjusting electron transport routes. The aptamer as a biorecognition unit was grafted on the modified electrode by chemical bonding effect, and Tc molecules could be captured through the specific interaction of aptamer and Tc in solution. The concentration of Tc was detected by observing the fluctuation of photocurrent signals. Under optimized conditions, the proposed aptasensor showed the broad linear range from 0.1 nmol L(-1 )to 1 mu mol L-1 with a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.015 nmol L-1. Furthermore, the high sensitivity, excellent reproducibility and favorable stability of the PEC sensing platform indicated the potential applications for antibiotic residues detecting in environmental media.

AB This work utilized ultrathin metal-organic layer (MOL) to immobilize luminophores for effectively shortening the ion/electron-transport distance and relieving the diffusional constraints of ion/electron, which greatly enhanced the ECL efficiency and intensity. Moreover, the MOL's immobilization amount of luminophores should be higher than these of bulk MOFs because MOLs possess more accessible postmodification sites for the luminophores with minimal diffusion barriers. As expected, our proof-of-concept experiment indicated that the Hf-MOL's loading number of Ru(bpy)(2)(mcPbPy)(2+) was about 1.74 times that of a 3D mesoporous MOF (PCN-777), and the ECL efficiency and intensity of PEI@Ru-Hf-MOL were around 1.27 times and 14.5 times those of PEI@ Ru-PCN-777, respectively. In view of these merits, this work utilized the prepared PEI@Ru-Hf-MOL as a highly efficient sensing platform for simple, rapid and sensitive detection of mucin 1, which exhibited a broad linearity from 1 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 0.48 fg/mL. This work provided a practicable strategy to develop high-performance ECL materials, and therefore opened up a new avenue to design ultrasensitive ECL biosensors, which expanded the application potential of MOLs in ECL assays.

AB We present a plasmonic biosensor capable of detecting the presence of bisphenol A in ultra-low concentrations, yielding a wavelength shift of 0.15 +/- 0.01 nm in response to a solution of 1 fM concentration with limit of detection of 330 +/- 70 aM The biosensing device consists of an array of gold nano-antennae with a total length of 2.3 cm that generate coupled localised surface plasmons (cLSPs) and is covalently modified with an aptamer specific for bisphenol A recognition. The array of nano-antennae is fabricated on a lapped section of standard telecommunication optical fibre, allowing for potential multiplexing and its use in remote sensing applications. These results have been achieved without the use of enhancement techniques and therefore the approach allows the direct detection of bisphenol A, a low molecular weight (228 Da) target usually detectable only by indirect detection strategies. Its detection at such levels is a significant step forward in measuring small molecules at ultra-low concentrations. Furthermore, this new sensing platform paves the way for the development of portable systems for in-situ agricultural measurements capable of retrieving data on a substance of very high concern at ultra-low concentrations.

AB The detection of Cu2+ ion, one of the metal ions substantial in cerebral physiology, is critical in studying brain activities and understanding brain functions. However, repetitive measurements of Cu2+ in the progress of physiological and pathological events is still challenging, because lack of the platform for repetitive on-line detection-regeneration cycle. Herein we report the design of a regenerated electrochemical biosensor combined with the in vivo microdialysis system. In this biosensor, hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (hPEI) acts as a regenerated recognition unit for Cu2+. Just by a simple rinse of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt, the Cu2+ and Cu+ ions on the biosensor interface were chelated with EDTA disodium salt, thus achieving the regeneration of the biosensor. In addition, 6-(ferrocenyl)hexanethiol (FcHT) serves as the inner reference moiety to elevate the sensing accuracy over regeneration cycles. As a result, this ratiometric electrochemical biosensor not only revealed high sensitivity and selectivity, but also exhibited excellent stability during multiple regeneration processing. This biosensor was capable of determining Cu2+ with a linear range between 0.05 and 12 mu M and low detection limit (LOD) of 13 nM. Then, the platform has been successfully applied in repetitive Cu2+ analysis in rat brain under global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion events. The combination of results from 7 rats indicates global cerebral ischemia caused an obvious increase of the Cu(2+ )level, while reperfusion brought this level back to normal.

AB This study presents a slidable paper-embedded plastic microdevice fully integrated with DNA extraction, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and colorimetric detection functionalities. The developed microdevice consists of three layers that allow a sliding movement to mix the sample and reagents for DNA purification, amplification, and detection in a sequential manner. An FTA card was employed in the main chamber for DNA extraction and purification from intact bacterial cells. Subsequently, LAMP reagents and fuchsin-stored chambers were pulled toward the main chambers for DNA amplifications at 65 degrees C. After 30 min, the detection reagents-stored chambers were then moved to main chambers for result analysis. For the detection of LAMP amplicons, a novel colorimetric fuchsin-based method was employed. The wide applicability of the integrated microdevice was demonstrated by successfully screening three major foodborne pathogens, namely Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in food, enabling highly sensitive detection of 3.0 x 10(1) CFU/sample of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7) and 3.0 x 10(2) CFU/sample of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) within 75 min. The portable and integrated microdevice presented in this study holds significant promise for point-of-care applications to accurately and rapidly diagnose and control diseases.

AB Sensitive detection of cancerous exosomes is critical to early diseases diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, a sensitive aptasensor was demonstrated for exosomes detection by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with dual gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-assisted signal amplification. Dual nanoparticle amplification was achieved by controlled hybridization attachment of AuNPs resulting from electronic coupling between the Au film and AuNPs, as well as coupling effects in plasmonic nanostructures. By blocking the Au film surface with 11-Mercapto-1-undecanol (MCU), nonspecific adsorption of AuNPs onto the SPR chip surface was suppressed and regeneration of the SPR sensor was realized. This method was highly sensitive and we have achieved the limit of detection (LOD) down to 5 x 10(3) exosomes/mL, which showed a 10(4)-fold improvement in LOD compared to commercial ELISA. Moreover, the SPR sensor had the capability to differentiate the exosomes secreted by MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A normal breast cells. Furthermore, the SPR sensor could effectively detect the exosomes in 30% fetal bovine serum. The work provides a sensitive and efficient quantification approach to detect cancerous exosomes and offers an avenue toward future diagnosis and comprehensive studies of exosomes.

AB Foodborne illnesses are a major contributor to misery and health challenges in both rich and poor nations. Illnesses from pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts account for most of the cases of diarrhea in the world. Many standard methods exist for detecting these pathogens in water. However, these standard methods do not readily translate to the detection of the same pathogens in food. Detection techniques for pathogens in food are often inadequate, due to their inability to completely separate pathogens from food matrices. In this paper, we present a technique to separate and detect both Escherichia coli cells and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts that have been embedded in ground meat. We achieve this objective by combining enzymatic digestion of the meat, hydrodynamic cavitation to disassemble pathogens from the meat, immunomagnetic separation to purify meat samples and indirect electrochemical detection of the target pathogens. Our use of hydrodynamic cavitation to separate pathogens is compared against an industry standard separation technique. Results indicate that the use of hydrodynamic cavitation amplifies the detection capabilities of our sensing technique and is overall comparable to or better than conventional stomacher sample preparation.

AB Oxygen defect-engineered is an important strategy to improve the photoelectric activity of materials. Herein, a facile one-pot solvothermal method was utilized to synthesize visible light-responsive photoactive Bi(2)MoO(6 )nanoparticles anchored boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene (BNG) nanosheets nanocomposites with oxygen vacancy. The incorporation of BNG nanosheets increased the oxygen vacancies amounts on Bi2MoO6 remarkably, and the presences of oxygen vacancies can be beneficial to broaden the absorption range. The absorption edge of Bi2MoO6/BNG was widened from 500 nm to 550 nm compared to Bi2MoO6, and the charge transfer was accelerated to improve the photoactive of Bi2MoO6/BNG. Under visible light illumination, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) response of the as-prepared Bi2MoO6/BNG was 11.6-fold, 6.7-fold, 3.1-fold and 2.4-fold higher than that of pristine Bi2MoO6, Bi2MoO6/graphene, Bi2MoO6/nitrogen doped graphene and Bi2MoO6/boron doped graphene. Using Bi2MoO6/BNG nanocomposites with the superior PEC performance as photoactive materials in combination with specifically recognized lincomycin (LIN) aptamer, a highly efficient PEC aptasensor was successfully constructed for sensitive analysis of LIN. Under optimal conditions, the proposed PEC aptasensor exhibited excellent analytical performance for LIN with a wide linear response of 1 x 10(-)(11) to 1 x 10(-6) mol L-1 along with a low detection limit of 3.7 x 10(-12) mol L-1 (defined as S/N = 3). The as-prepared Bi2MoO6/BNG nanocomposites exhibit excellent visible light response and PEC performance, indicating its potential applications in PEC biosensor.

AB A novel and robust enzymatic biosensing platform with high sensitivity is developed based on facile one-step assembled bio-nanocomposites with enzymes-loaded polymeric nanoparticles decorating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). An amphiphilic copolymer PAVE containing photo-cross-linkable coumarin segments and carboxylic groups was co-assembled with MWCNTs in aqueous solution while encapsulating the model enzyme namely glucose oxidase (GOx) simultaneously, generating necklace-like bio-nanocomposites (GOx@PAVE-CNTs) with GOx-loading polymeric nanoparticles as nanobeads and MWCNTs as conducting micron-string. Then the GOx@PAVE-CNTs bio-nanocomposites were electro-deposited onto electrode surface and a robust biosensing complex film with porous network structure was formed after following photo-cross-linking. Consequently, an enzymatic glucose biosensor was successfully constructed. The biosensor exhibited ultrafast response ( < 3 s) to glucose with a considerably wide linear range (1.0 mu M similar to 5 mM) and a low detection limit (0.36 mu M) for glucose detection. High sensitivity and selectivity of the biosensor toward glucose were also well demonstrated. Furthermore, the biosensor showed exceptionally good stability and reproducibility. More importantly, the glucose biosensor was practically used for glucose detection from human urine and serum samples with satisfactory results. As a proof-of-concept strategy, this facile and effective strategy for biosensor fabrication is of considerable interest because of its versatility to be generalized to many other enzymatic biosensor systems, exhibiting promising and practical potential in bio-medical and life health applications.

AB In the present work, a double photoelectrode system has been constructed for photoelectrochemically driven enzymatic bioconversion and determination of nifedipine. In which, the TiO2 nanotube arrays in-situ assembled with g-C3N4 (TNA/g-C3N4) was used as a photoanode, and a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme was immobilized in the porous ITO/CuO films to fabricate an ITO/CuO/CYP3A4 photocathode. The constructed double photoelectrode system had a significant photocurrent response compared to the single ITO/CuO/CYP3A4 or TNA/g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. Under optimal conditions, the photocurrent of the double photoelectrode system had a high catalytic activity toward substrate nifedipine with k(cat) of 5.62 s(-1) and catalytic efficiency with k(cat)/k(m)(app) of 0.94 mu M-1 s(-1), and the bioconversion yield of nifedipine reached 22.1%. Furthermore, the constructed double photoelectrode system could be used to determine the nifedipine concentration with a high sensitivity of 2.46 mu A mu M-1 and a low detection limit of 0.015 mu M. Therefore, the proposed double photoelectrode system can be used well for study enzyme biocatalysis for target bioconversion, and also has a potential application for toxicity analysis.

AB DNAzyme-based fluorescent probes have provided valuable protocols for detecting uranium, one of the most common radioactive contaminants in the environment, with ultra-high selectivity and sensitivity. Designing novel DNAzyme beacons to update the mode of fluorescence reporting and/or quenching will continuously enhance "turn-on" sensing performance as well as promote actual application of the biological probes. In this work, we developed a novel quencher-free DNAzyme beacon by embedding fluorescent 2-aminopurine for rapid detection of uranyl ion. 2-aminopurine is able to substitute adenine and keep strong fluorescence in single-stranded DNA whereas being quenched in the hybridized double-stranded DNA by the base-stacking interaction. The combination of such trait of 2-aminopurine and cleavage reaction of DNAzyme in the presence of target co-factors possesses two main advantages for ion sensing: simplicity for avoidance of extra quencher groups and high performance because of superiority of DNAzyme essence. The experimental conditions including embedding site, pH and salt concentration of buffer solutions, and the amount ratio of enzyme strand to substrate strand used to form DNAzymes were systematically optimized to inspire the highest performance of the biological beacon. Thus, a detection limit of 9.6 nM, a wide linear range from 5 nM to 400 nM (R-2 = 0.997), and selectivity of more than 400 000-fold over other metal ions were achieved by the novel DNAzyme probes. The highly sensitive, selective and quencher-free DNAzyme probes accommodated a simple and cost-efficient alternative to current fluorescent counterparts, holding a great potential for further application in practical ion assay.

AB Fluorescent microsphere (FM) is widely used as probe in immunochromatographic assay (ICA). However, the performance of conventional FM is limited because of the aggregation-caused quenching effect. Herein, we compared a kind of conventional FM (DMFFM, loading DMF) with novel aggregation-induced emission FM (AIEFM, loading TCBPE). The fluorescence intensity of DMFFM initially increased and then decreased as the concentrations of the loading DMF increased. The fluorescence intensity of AIEFM increased as the concentrations of the loading TCBPE increased and retained a high value. AIEFM was compared with two commercial FMs purchased from Ocean (OFM) and Merk (MFM). The maximum fluorescence intensity and relative quantum yield of AIEFM was approximately 5 and 4.5 times higher than those of two commercial FMs. We used the novel AIEFM as a probe to improve the sensitivity of ICA. When Escherichia coli O157:H7 was detected as the target, the limit of detection of ICA based on AIEFM, OFM and MFM were 3.98 x 10(3) CFU/mL, 4.48 x 10(4) and 2.78 x 10(4) CFU/mL, respectively. The ICA of AIEFM had 11 and 7 times improvement in sensitivity compared with that of OFM and MFM. Our results could be used as a basis for novel probes in practical ICA applications.

AB Limited electrode size with high electrochemical performance and reliability of modified materials are two of the main concerns for flexible neural electrodes in recent years. Here, an effective fabrication method of enhanced micro-scale wrinkles based on oil-pretreated hyperelastic substrates (PDMS and Ecoflex) is proposed for the application of microelectrode biosensors. Compared to pre-stretching or compressing methods, this approach has better advantages including compatibility with MEMS processes on wafer and easy replication. Wrinkled gold microelectrodes exhibit superior electrochemical properties than the flat one, and no crack or delamination occurs after electroplating PEDOT:PSS and platinum black on wrinkled microelectrodes. Cyclic voitammetry (CV) scanning for 2500 times is performed to investigate adhesion and stability of modified materials. For the modified microelectrodes, no significant change is observed in charge storage capacity (CSC) and impedance at 1 kHz, whereas PEDOT:PSS coated flat microelectrodes appears delamination. Ultrasonication and cycling forces are also conducted on modified microelectrodes, which demonstrates little influence on the wrinkled ones. Flexible wrinkled microelectrodes are further verified by in-vivo ECoG recordings combined with optogenetics in mice. These results highlight the importance of micro-structure in neural electrode design and tremendous application potentials in flexible electronics.

AB Ni-SnOx, PANI and CuO nanoparticles were synthesized on cotton fabric through chemical methods to make a new flexible high-performance non-enzymatic glucose sensor. FESEM, XRD, XPS, EDS and ATR analysis were employed to characterize the structure and the morphology of the nanomaterials. The high electrochemical performance of nickel and copper oxide and hydroxide on a conductive template leads to fabrication of a wearable and flexible cotton electrode with an excellent electrocatalytic activity to oxidize glucose. This hybrid system on the fabric as an electrode indicates a detection limit of 130 nM with wide linear range of 0.001-10 mM. The sensitivity was measured to be 1625 and 1325 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) for the ranges of 0.001-1 and 1-10 mM, respectively. Long-term stability, appropriate selectivity and reusability for many times make possibility for utilizing the fabricated sensor in the practical applications. The fabric is a wide linear range electrode with low detection limit to sense glucose concentration in the body fluids as well as the human blood that can be presumably suggested for designing other similar flexible types of sensor.

AB This paper describes an integrated microfluidic SlipChip device for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bloodstream pathogens in positive blood cultures. Unlike conventional AST methods, which rely on an overnight subculture of positive blood cultures to obtain isolated colonies, this device enables direct extraction and enrichment of the bacteria from positive blood cultures by dielectrophoresis. SlipChip technology enables parallel inoculation of the extracted bacteria into nanoliter-scale broth droplets to perform multiplexed ASTs simultaneously. The nanoliter confinement in the droplets increases the effective inoculation amount of the bacteria, shortens the diffusion distance of nutrient elements and gases, and allows faster growth and proliferation rates. Entropy-based image analysis used for the characterization of bacterial susceptibility patterns eliminates the requirement for single-cell morphological analysis and fluorescence labeling. As a proof-of-concept, the susceptibility patterns of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p, and a positive blood culture containing Escherichia coli against several broad-spectrum antibiotics were determined by the SlipChip device. The on-chip AST results were well matched with those respectively reported by the broth microdilution method and a BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. Reliable AST results can be reported to clinicians within 3-8 h using this simple device after positive blood culture, allowing earlier proper administration of antimicrobial therapy.

AB A Eu-metal organic framework (Eu-MOF) probe with dual-emission was reported for the ratiometric fluorescence detection of H2O2 and glucose. Because of the special nucleophilic reaction between boric group and H2O2, Eu3+ and 5-boronobenzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (BBDC) were selected to synthesize the functional MOF probe via a simple one-pot solvothermal method. The Eu-MOF shows dual-emission at 370 and 623 nm with the single excitation at 270 nm due to the energy transfer efficiency change for antenna effect procedure. After addition of H2O2, the red emission of Eu-MOF weakened and the blue emission enhances immediately under 270 nm irradiation, so the ratiometric fluorescence detection is established. Moreover, the obvious color change for visual measuring of H2O2 and glucose is illustrated to reveal the merit of Eu-MOF probe. The proposed method was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective for H2O2 and glucose, with the low detection limits of 0.0335 and 0.0643 mu M, respectively. The established boric-acid-functional Eu-MOF sensing platform was proved as the powerful probe for H2O2 and the metabolites involved in H2O2-generating reaction.

AB Fibrinogen, which is a glycoprotein that circulates in the blood, plays various important biological roles, e.g., in blood coagulation, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Abnormal levels of fibrinogen in plasma have been identified as a key biomarker of a variety of disorders from cardiovascular diseases to hemophilia. Therefore, the development of a quantitative assay for fibrinogen in the blood has emerged as an important issue for the prevention and diagnosis of these diseases. Meanwhile, it is well known that erythrocytes can selectively capture fibrinogen because of the fibrinogen receptor expressed on their plasma membrane. Inspired by these biological interactions, herein, we devised an erythrocyte membrane (EM)-blanketed biosensor based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) for highly sensitive detection of fibrinogen. By placing the EM onto a nanoparticle-on-substrate, we enhanced the LSPR signal, achieving highly sensitive and selective detection of fibrinogen. We demonstrated that fibrinogen detection is possible over a wide concentration range, 0.001-5.000 mg/mL, which can cover normal and pathological blood fibrinogen levels. In addition, it was verified that the biosensor selectively detects fibrinogen in comparison with other human-blood-plasma components. The nanoplasmonic sensor blanketed with the EM opens up new opportunities for the development of a robust fibrinogen-sensing technology.

AB Dopamine (DA), as one of the central neurotransmitters, plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. Detection of DA is critical to diagnose and monitor some neurological diseases. In this work, a novel on-off ratiometric electrochemical sensor with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as target molecule recognizer has been developed for selective and accurate detection of DA. Nanoporous gold (NPG) was electrodeposited on bare gold electrode, which not only benefited the output signal amplification, but also provided enlarged surface for immobilization of polythionine (pThi) and MIPs. Oxidation of DA and pThi served as response signal and internal reference signal, respectively. The oxidation peak currents of DA at +0.12 V increased with increasing the concentration of DA, while the peak currents of pThi at -0.2 V decreased simultaneously. Due to the specificity from MIPs and the built-in correction from pThi, the fabricated sensor showed excellent performance in view of selectivity and reproducibility. It's worth to mention that even if the surface area and morphology of working electrode underwent huge variation deliberately, the assay deviation among these ratiometric sensors was largely reduced around 10 times. The proposed sensor demonstrated a broad dynamic range of 0.3-100 mu M as well as a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M (S/N = 3). Moreover, superior anti-interfering ability toward DA detection was obtained despite the presence of interferents at high concentration in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Therefore, this work is expected to provide an alternative pathway for constructing ratiometric electrochemical sensor and offer reliable determination of small molecules with high selectivity and stability.

AB An all-solid-state metal-mediated Z-scheme photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay was designed for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by using WO3-Au-CdS nanocomposite as photoactive material and copper ion (Cu2+) as an inhibitor. The Z-scheme PEC system comprising of CdS nanoparticle (photosystem I; PS I), WO3 nanorod (photosystem II; PS II) and gold nanoparticle (Au NP; solid electron mediator) was reasonably established by a simple and green synthetic method. As an important part of Z-scheme system, the sandwiched gold nanoparticles between electron donor materials and hole provider materials could accelerate electron transfer from positive conduction band (CB) of WO3 to negative valence band (VB) of CdS, thus resulting in high-efficient separation of the carriers. In the presence of target PSA, a sandwiched immunoreaction was executed between capture antibody-coated microplate and CuO nanoparticle-labeled detection antibody. Thereafter, CuO nano labels were dissolved into Cu2+ ions under acidic condition to decrease the photocurrent of Z-scheme WO3-Au-CdS thanks to the formation of exciton trapping center of CuxS (x = 1,2) on the surface. Under optimum conditions, Z-scheme PEC immunoassay exhibited good photocurrents toward target PSA within a linear range of 0.01-50 ng mL(-1) at a limit of detection of 1.8 pg mL(-1). Moreover, the Z-scheme PEC immunoassay had high selectivity and accuracy. Importantly, this method provides a new horizon for detection of disease-related biomarkers with high sensitivity.

AB We report here a new bimetallic ZrHf metal-organic framework (ZrHf-MOF) embedded with abundant carbon dots (CDs) (denoted as CDs@ZrHf-MOF), which exhibits strong fluorescence and rich-amino-functionalization. The CDs@ZrHf-MOF can be applied as the scaffold for anchoring aptamer strands to determine human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and living HER2-overexpressed MCF-7 cells. The basic characterizations reveal that the CDs are embedded within the interior cavities of ZrHf-MOF without varying the nanostructure, leading to good biocompatibility, strong fluorescence, and high electrochemical activity of CDs@ZrHf-MOF. As compared with the pristine ZrHf-MOF, the CDs@ZrHf-MOF-based electrochemical aptasensor displays better sensing performances toward both HER-2 and MCF-7 cells, giving an extremely low detection limit of 19 fg mL(-1) (HER2 concentration range: 0.001-10 ng mL(-1)) and 23 cell (cell concentration range: 1 x 10(2)similar to 1 x 10(5) cell mL(-1)), with good selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and acceptable applicability. The proposed strategy for developing CDs@ZrHf-MOF-based aptasensor is promising for the early and sensitive detection of cancer markers and living cancer cells.

AB Saliva has been reported to contain various cytokine biomarkers which are associated with some severe diseases such as cancers. Non-invasive saliva diagnosis using wearable or portable devices may pave a new avenue for monitoring conditions of the high risk population. Here, a graphene-based fully integrated portable nanosensing system, the entire size of which is smaller than a smart-phone and can be handheld, is presented for on-line detection of cytokine biomarkers in saliva. This miniaturized system employs an aptameric graphene-based field effect transistor (GFET) using a buried-gate geometry with HfO2 as the dielectric layer and on-line signal processing circuits to realize the transduction and processing of signals which reflect cytokine concentrations. The signal can be wirelessly transmitted to a smart-phone or cloud sever through the Wi-Fi connection for visualizing the trend of the cytokine concentration change. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is used as a representative to examine the sensing capability of the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the nanosensing system responds to the change of IL-6 concentration within 400s in saliva with a detection limit down to 12 pM. Therefore, this portable system offers the practicality to be potentially used for non-invasive saliva diagnosis of diseases at early stage.

AB Glucose oxidase mimicking nickel-based porous structures with organic anchors are developed as cheap and reliable electrochemical sensors for the quantitative detection of glucose. A series of sterically and electronically modulated, air- and moisture-stable half-sandwich nickel(II) NHC complexes were prepared and characterized. Under the optimized electrocatalytic conditions, the nickel complex immobilized glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) displayed high sensitivity (0.663, 1.280, 1.990 and 0.182 mu A/mu M) towards glucose detection, which is much higher than that of 3D porous nickel networks. The limit of detection of modified GCEs is found in the range 1.56-2.09 mu M with much wider linear sensing range, and having a catalytic rate constant of 0.273 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1). Finally, the selectivity of the modified GCEs towards glucose in presence of other blood constituents was also evaluated.

AB Metal-organic gels (MOGs), a kind of soft materials, were reported as a brand new category of novel solid coreactants for enhancing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) and derivatives. In this work, silver based MOGs (Ag-MOGs) prepared by a one-step mixing and heating approach were demonstrated as novel efficient solid-state coreactants which differ from the previous research on ECL coreactant nanomaterials. It was discussed that the possible enhancement mechanism was due to the amino-rich groups and the electro-catalytic effect of Ag-MOGs, endowing them promising coreactants for the enhancement of Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) ECL. Interestingly, Ag-MOGs can also enhance the ECL signal of Ru (phen)(3)(2+), a derivative of Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) that can specifically insert into double strand DNA, further manifesting the as-prepared Ag-MOGs can be served as ideal coreactant materials. Based on the Ru (phen)(3)(2+)/Ag-MOGs system, a label-free signal-on ECL biosensor for detecting of target DNA was constructed to illustrate the potential application of Ag-MOGs. This research presents an effective coreactant for Ru luminophore-based ECL systems, which not only broadens the potential application of MOGs, but also offers a unique insight into the coreactant materials.

AB Split aptamer strategy was often used to improve the sensitivity of aptasensor. However, traditional split aptamer strategy can not be directly used to improve the label-free aptamer based Thioflavin T (ThT) displacement assay for ATP because the split ATP aptamer display much lower enhancement effects on the fluorescence of ThT than intact aptamer. In order to address this issue, this is the first report using G-rich DNA sequence to enhance the affinity of the two split ATP aptamer halves to ThT and offer lower limit of detection (LOD), wider linear range and higher selectivity through the enhanced molecular recognition. Compared to the intact aptamer/ThT complex, the ensemble of two G-rich split ATP aptamer fragments/ThT are higher fluorescent. Consequently, G-rich sequences would improve the fluorescent signal and thus the sensing performance of the proposed assay. In the optimized conditions, the LOD of the proposed fluorescent ATP aptasensor is 2 nM, which is lower than the reported ThT/ATP aptamer based methods. Additionally, our aptasensor has a wider dynamic linear range (0.1 mu M - 120 mu M) and higher selectivity. The proposed aptasensor has been successfully applied to detect ATP in 15% human serum. More importantly, the current study not only provides a novel method for ATP assay but also presents a way to construct a label-free split aptamer based fluorescent sensor for other species where aptamer can be generated.

AB A simple "signal-on" photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor is constructed for Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) detection based on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide/poly(5-formylindole)/Au (erGO/P5FIn/Au) nanocomposites. The nanocomposites are synthesized by simple electrochemical deposition method and show good photoelectrochemical performance. Poly(5-formylindole) (P5FIn) can generate electron-hole pairs under light irradiation, leading to the formation of robust cathode photocurrent. Au can be acted as signal amplifier due to the high conductivity. The erGO is used to immobilize AFB1 aptamer chain by pi-pi stacking interaction between the carbon six-membered ring in graphene and the C-N heterocyclic ring in nucleobases of ssDNA. After the insulating AFB1 aptamer chain is fixed to the electrode, the signal of PEC sensor is "OFF". In the process of AFB1 detection, the aptamer chain detaches from the surface of erGO, which results in "ON" of the sensor signal. Based on this design, this constructed PEC aptasensor shows a high sensitivity for AFB1 with a wide linear detection range (LDR) from 0.01 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1). The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.002 ng mL(-1). This PEC sensor also exhibits good stability, selectivity, specificity, and satisfactory practical sample analysis ability. This work may provide a new promising PEC platform for AFB1 detection as well as some other small molecules analysis.

AB The accurate detection of biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) plays an important role in clinical diagnosis and management process. In this work, we developed an electrochemical biosensor by using magnetic metal organic framework (MMOF) nanocatalysts and DNA nanotetrahedron (NTH) based dual-aptamer probes for nonenzymatic detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a gold standard biomarker for the early diagnosis of AMI. Firstly, the NTH-assisted dual-aptamer (Tro4 and Tro6) capture probes were immobilized on the screen-printed gold electrode (SPGE) for the highly enhanced capture the target cTnI with steady support and optimized interface density. Then, the MMOF Fe3O4@UiO-66 nanozymes were decorated by bimetallic Cu@Au nanoparticles and two kinds of aptamer. This fabricated nonenzymatic nanoprobe1 (NP1) can be applied for recognizing the cTnI specifically and amplifying the current signal by catalyzing the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to benzoquinone (BQ) with H2O2. The target proteins were captured to fabricate a supersandwich-like structure on a SPGE interface. Furthermore, the nanoprobe2 (NP2) of Cu@Au nanozymes labeled with dual-complementary DNA (cDNA) to the dual-aptamer, were anchored on the NP1 through DNA hybridization, leading to the formation of cluster-based nanoprobes for further enhancing detection sensitivity. Finally, this enzyme-free electrochemical aptasensor exhibited great analytical performance with a dynamic range of 0.05-100 ng/mL, a low detection limit of 16 pg/mL, high selectivity and good repeatability. The fabricated aptasensor has great potential development in the field of clinic disease diagnostics for AMI.

AB The development of portable nucleic acid diagnostic devices has the potential to expand the availability of molecular diagnostics into low-resource settings. One of the promising solutions for rapid and simple DNA amplification is the use of Rayleigh-Bernard natural convection which is caused by a buoyancy-driven thermal gradient of liquid when heated from below. This natural convection avoids the use of the complex and sophisticated hardware that is required for precise maintenance of temperature cycles in conventional PCR. We have developed a stand-alone convective PCR (cPCR) device linked to a smartphone for rapid detection of nucleic acids using natural convection heating. The device amplifies multiple DNA samples simultaneously using a custom-made heat block controlled by Bluetooth wireless communication. The entire device is highly portable, user-friendly, battery-operated and can provide target DNA amplification in less than 30 min. A detection limit of 2.8 x 10(3) copies of a segment of lambda DNA was obtained when the two different fluorescently-tagged amplicons were collected magnetically and detected using the smartphone fluorescence reader. Thus, the combination of cPCR and multiplex fluorescence-based detection on a smartphone provides new opportunities for the development of affordable and portable molecular diagnostic devices for point-of-care situations or remote clinical settings.

AB An electrochemical genosensor for the detection and quantification of Karlodinium armiger is presented. The genosensor exploits tailed primers and ferrocene labelled dATP analogue to produce PCR products that can be directly hybridised on a gold electrode array and quantitatively measured using square wave voltammetry. Tailed primers consist of a sequence specific for the target, followed by a carbon spacer and a sequence specifically designed not to bind to genomic DNA, resulting in a duplex flanked by single stranded binding primers. The incorporation of the 7-(ferrocenylethynyl)-7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate was optimised in terms of a compromise between maximum PCR efficiency and the limit of detection and sensitivity attainable using electrochemical detection via hybridisation of the tailed, ferrocene labelled PCR product. A limit of detection of 277aM with a linear range from 315aM to 10 fM starting DNA concentration and a sensitivity of 122 nA decade(-1) was achieved. The system was successfully applied to the detection of genomic DNA in real seawater samples.

AB Biosensors that incorporate nanomaterials and nanofabrication techniques enable molecular detection of chemical and biological macromolecules with a high degree of specificity and ultrasensitivity. Here, we present a novel fabrication process that yields a nanostructure capable of detecting biological macromolecules. The extended core nanocoax (ECC) structure builds on a previously reported nanocoaxial-based sensor. The fabrication of the device incorporates an extended inner pillar, with controllable extension above the annulus and into the surrounding solution. This new design eliminates structural constraints inherent in the original nanocoax architecture. We also provide results demonstrating improvement in biosensing capability. Specifically, we show the capability of the new architecture to detect the B subunit of the Vibrio cholerae toxin at improved sensitivity (100 pg/ml) in comparison to optical enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (1 ng/ml) and previously reported coaxial nanostructures (2 ng/ml).

AB Mercury is a diversely bioaccumulating heavy metal pollutant toxic to all life forms. In this work, an optical biosensor has been developed and calibrated for universal detection and quantification of mercuric ions, in the range 0.1-540 parts per billion, in biological and environmental samples. Chitosan capped gold nanoparticles on bovine serum albumin are proposed as an ultrasensitive plasmonic mercury receptor on U-bend optical fiber platform. The sensor was calibrated and tested with tap water, sewage contaminated water, marine water, long lived sea fish tissue, fossil fuel fly ash contaminated soil and vegetable samples. The sensor performance was validated with real samples inherently containing mercury. Overall standard error of less than 15% and a coefficient of variation less than 12% (n = 3) was found across all samples, indicating good fitness for diverse usage. Experimentally determined limit of detection of mercuric ions was 0.1 parts per billion in tap water (twenty times lesser than the Environment protection agency limit of 2 parts per billion in drinking water) and 0.2 parts per billion in sea fish and vegetable samples with negligible cross sensitivity towards other metal ions.

AB In the last decades, there is a growing search for analytical strategies to ensure clinical analysis without the need of laboratory set-up and skilled personnel. Indeed, user-friendly and low-cost devices are highly valued in the era of sustainability for their capability to be applied in low-resource contexts, such as developing countries. To address this issue, herein we report a 96-well paper-based and laboratory setup-free optical platform for the detection of butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) activity in human serum. We used chromatographic paper to realize a novel analytical tool exploiting its porous structure for reagentless synthesize Prussian Blue Nanoparticles (the sensing element), as well to load all the reagents required for the measurement. The principle of BChE activity detection relies on the reaction between the enzymatic product thiocholine and Prussian Blue, giving the Prussian White with subsequently Prussian Blue's fading, detected by a common office scanner supported by ImageJ software. Using this novel paper-based optical platform, BChE activity was linearly detected in the 2-15 U/mL range with a detection limit down to 0.8 U/mL. The accuracy was successfully demonstrated by recovery study with spiked serum and by comparing the data with the gold standard method.

AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) DNA bioanalysis has been drawing more attention in recent years due to the advantages of PEC technique and the vital importance of DNA biomolecules. DNAzymes are unique catalytic nucleic acid molecules that are capable of catalyzing specific biochemical reactions. Using the target-binding induced conformation change of hairpin DNA probe to hemin/G-quadruplex-based DNAzyme and a plasmonic Au@Ag nanoparticles (NPs)/TiO2 nanorods (NRs)/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) heterostructured photoelectrode, this work reported a novel and sensitive PEC DNA analysis on the basis of a DNAzyme-stimulated biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) strategy. In such a design, the BCP-induced decrease of plasmonic photocurrent can be related to the target-responsive formation of DNAzymes and thus be monitored to assay the target DNA from 0.1 and 100 nM. In brief, with a plasmonic photoelectrode and a hairpin probe, this work reported a general plasmonic DNAzyme-based PEC DNA analysis, which could also be easily extended to aptasensing toward numerous targets of interest.

AB In this work, a dual-signal-amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was proposed for the first time to detect microRNAs (miRNAs) based on cyclic enzyme and seeded-watermelon-like mesoporous nanospheres (mSiO(2)@CdTe@SiO2, mSQS NSs). mSQS NSs were successfully fabricated by inlaying the CdTe quantum dots (QDs) into the mesoporous silica (mSiO(2)) and future coating the surface with the silica layer. The obtained mSQS NSs contained tens of QDs and exhibited much stronger ECL signal than single QDs. The ECL biosensor achieved firstly signal amplification by using mSQS NSs to label the functional oligonudeotide probe (DNA-F) as enhanced ECL signal probes. Well-dispersed Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles were prepared as immobilization matrices to load hairpin-structured DNA probe (DNA-P). When the target miRNAs were present, hairpin DNA undertook conformation changes. Meanwhile, RNA/DNA duplexes was formed which cleaved by duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) to release miRNAs. Target miRNAs were cycled to hybridize with hairpin DNA, which achieved secondly signal amplification of the ECL biosensor. Thereafter, the complementarily parts between DNA-F and the rest DNA-P generated conjugates. The obtained conjugates would be collected on the surface of the electrode by effecting of magnet. Under the optimal conditions, the developed biosensor showed a wide linear range from 0.1 pM to 100 pM with a low detection limit of 33 fM (S/N = 3). The results of detection for the stability, specificity and reproducibility of ECL biosensor were outstanding. Simultaneously, the potential application of ECL biosensor was verified by using biosensor in serum sample.

AB DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (MTase) and concerned with many biological processes including pathogenesis of various human diseases. The monitoring of MTase activity is thus of great significance in disease diagnosis and drug screening. Herein, we developed a facile way to synthesize biocompatible invertase enzyme modified metal-organic framework (Invertase/MOF) materials, and explored its application in constructing a dual-response Dam MTase sensor for the first time. By using them as signal probes, in which high density of metal sites could be electrochemically detected and invertase could hydrolyze sucrose into glucose for generation of glucometer signal output, dual-response for accurate detection of Dam MTase was realized. In the presence of Dam MTase, the methylation of hairpin probe 1 (HP1) occurred and thus caused the cleavage of HP1 assisted by a restriction endonuclease (Dpnl) to produce the binding sequences. The binding sequences then hybridized with the electrode-assembled HP2 to expose their sticky termini which sequentially hybridized with the Invertase/MOFs-tethered capture probes. Finally, the electrodes were incubated with a sucrose solution, followed by the separate electrochemical and glucometer detection. The present assay brought good performance which could detect Dam MTase activity as low as 0.001 U mL(-1) with wide linear range and good selectivity against other cytosine MTase (M.SssI MTase). Moreover, it also owns ability to be potentially applied for the inhibitors screening by utilization of 5-fluorouracil as an inhibitor model. The results imply that our proposed method provides a convenient platform for early cancer diagnosis and therapeutic applications.

AB We report a selection of a cognate pair of aptamers for whole avian influenza virus particles of H5N2 by using graphene-oxide based systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (GO-SELEX), and the application of a pair of sandwich-type binding aptamers on the lateral flow strips. The aptamers were characterized by GO FRET assay, and Kd values of the selected aptamers were estimated to be from 6.913 x 10(5) to 1.27 x 10(6) EID50/ml (EID50/ml: 50% egg infective dose). Based on the evidence from confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis, the aptamers, J(3)APT and JH(4)APT, were found to be working as a cognate pair that binds to the target virus at the different sites simultaneously. This cognate pair of aptamers then was successfully applied on the lateral flow strips, clearly showing sandwich-type binding images with the presence of the certain numbers of H5N2 virus particles. On the newly developed lateral flow strips, the target virus was detectable down to 6 x 10(5) EID50/ml in the buffer and 1.2 x 10(6) EID50/ml in the ducks feces, respectively, by the naked eye. By using the ImageJ software, the LOD was found to be 1.27 x 10(5) EID50/ml in the buffer and 2.09 x 10(5) EID50/ml in the ducks feces, respectively. Interestingly, on the lateral flow strips, enhanced specificity towards the target virus (H5N2) appeared over other subtypes of HSNx. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the application of the cognate pair of aptamers for the detection of influenza virus on the lateral flow strips. This study shows the promising perspective of a cognate pair of aptamers for the on-site detection system which could be useful for rapid detection of avian influenza viruses for preventing the pandemic influenza viruses from spreading.

AB This work reports a microfluidic paper-based photoelectrochemical (mu-PEC) sensing platform for thrombin (TB) detection with electron-transfer tunneling distance regulation (ETTDR) and aptamer target-triggering nicking enzyme signaling amplification (NESA) dual strategies. Specifically, paper-based TiO2 nanosheets (PTNs) were prepared with an efficient hydrothermal process, serving as the direct pathway for the charge carriers transfer. When CeO2-labeled hairpin DNA 3 (HP3) was closely located at the PTNs, the CeO2-PTNs heterostructure was formed, which could great facilitate the photogenerated carries separation of CeO2. In addition, with the aid of aptamer target-triggering NESA strategy, the input TB could be transducted to numerous output target of DNA (tDNA), achieving the goal of desirable signal amplification. In the presence of TB, the output tDNA could be further hybridized with HP3 and unfold its hairpin loop, which forced the CeO2 away from the surface of PTNs and vanished the CeO2-PTNs heterostructure, resulting in the obviously reducing of photocurrent signal. The as designed sensing platform exhibited a linear range from 0.02 pM to 100 pM with a detection limit of 6.7 fM. Importantly, this mu-PEC sensing platform could not only realize the highly efficient TB detection, but also pave a luciferous way for the detection of other protein in bioanalysis.

AB In this work we discussed a label-free biosensing application of long-period gratings (LPGs) optimized in refractive index (RI) sensitivity by deposition of thin tantalum oxide (TaOx) overlays. Comparing to other thin film and materials already applied for maximizing the RI sensitivity, TaOx offers good chemical and mechanical stability during its surface functionalization and other biosensing experiments. It was shown theoretically and experimentally that when RI of the overlay is as high as 2 in IR spectral range, for obtaining LPGs ultrasensitive to RI, the overlay's thickness must be determined with subnanometer precision. In this experiment the TaOx overlays were deposited using Atomic Layer Deposition method that allowed for achieving overlays with exceptionally well-defined thickness and optical properties. The TaOx nano-coated LPGs show RI sensitivity determined for a single resonance exceeding 11,500 nm/RIU in RI range n(D) = 1.335-1.345 RIU, as expected for label-free biosensing applications. Capability for detection of various in size biological targets, i.e., proteins (avidin) and bacteria (Escherichia con), with TaOx-coated LPGs was verified using biotin and bacteriophage adhesin as recognition elements, respectively. It has been shown that functionalization process, as well as type of recognition elements and target analyte must be taken into consideration when the LPG sensitivity is optimized. In this work optimized approach made possible detection of small in size biological targets such as proteins with sensitivity reaching 10.21 nm/log(ng/ml).

AB Precise measurement of mechanical and electrical properties of single cells can yield useful information on the physiological and pathological state of cells. In this work, we develop a differential multiconstriction microfluidic device with self-aligned 3D electrodes to simultaneously characterize the deformability, electrical impedance and relaxation index of single cells at a high throughput manner ( > 430 cell/min). Cells are pressure driven to flow through a series of sequential microfluidic constrictions, during which deformability, electrical impedance and relaxation index of single cells are extracted simultaneously from impedance spectroscopy measurements. Mechanical and electrical phenotyping of untreated, Cytochalasin B treated and N-Ethylmaleimide treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrate the ability of our system to distinguish different cell populations purely based on these biophysical properties. In addition, we quantify the classification of different cell types using a back propagation neural network. The trained neural network yields the classification accuracy of 87.8% (electrical impedance), 70.1% (deformability), 42.7% (relaxation index) and 93.3% (combination of electrical impedance, deformability and relaxation index) with high sensitivity (93.3%) and specificity (93.3%) for the test group. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the cell classification of a cell mixture using the presented biophysical phenotyping technique with the trained neural network, which is in quantitative agreement with the flow cytometric analysis using fluorescent labels. The developed concurrent electrical and mechanical phenotyping provide great potential for high-throughput and label-free single cell analysis.

AB Chemiresistive platforms are best suited for developing DNA hybridization detection systems, owing to their ease of fabrication, simple detection methodology and amenability towards electronics. In this work, we report development of a generic, robust, electrospun nanofiber based interdigitated chemiresistive platform for DNA hybridization detection. The platform comprises of interdigitated metal electrodes decorated with electrospun nanofibers on the top. Two approaches viz., drop casting of graphene doped Mn2O3 nanofibers (GMnO) and direct electrospinning of polyaniline/polyethylene oxide (PANi/PEO) composite nanofibers, have been utilized to decorate these electrodes. In both approaches, inter-device variability, a key challenge for converting this proof-of-concept into a tangible prototype/product, has been addressed using a shadow masking technique. Consequently, the relative standard deviation for multiple PANi/PEO nanofiber based chemiresistors has been brought down from 17.82% (without shadow masking) to 4.41% (with shadow masking). The nanofibers are further modified with single-stranded probe DNAs, to capture a desired hybridization event. To establish the generic nature of the platform, detection of multiple target DNAs has been successfully demonstrated. These targets include dengue virus specific consensus primer (DENVCP) and four DNAs corresponding to Staphylococcus aureus specific genes, namely nuc, mecA, vanA and protein A. The chemiresistive detection of DENVCP has been performed in the concentration range of 10 fM - 1 mu M, whereas the detection of the other targets has been carried out in the range of 1 pM - 1 mu M. Using a 3 sigma method, we have estimated the limit of detection for the chemiresistive detection of DENVCP to be 1.9 fM.

AB Inspired by the design of folding greeting cards and tissue drawing covers, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) lab-on-paper device with a controllable fluid separator, producing both reaction zone and detection zone, was explored for ultrasensitive detection of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) via mimic peroxidase-transfer enhancement of photocurrent response. To realize it, the DNA1, aptamer, and DNA2 as well as the mimic peroxidase of G-quadruplex/hemin modified Au nanocubes were linked on the graphene oxide-functionalized reaction zone via the DNA hybridization. Meanwhile, three-dimensional CuO nanoflowers (CuO NFs) as a photoactive material with outstanding electron transfer ability and absorption of light were grown in situ on the detection zone, providing a PEC active interface. Besides, an innovative fluid separator was elaborately designed by assembling a strip of paper with a hydrophilic channel, providing an effective way to bridge the gap between the two zones with a controllable drawing way, which could successfully avoid the signal interference caused by modifying biomolecules layer by layer on photosensitive materials. In the presence of ATP, the G-quadruplex/hemin modified in the reaction zone was dissociated due to the specific recognition of ATP with aptamer and released into the detection zone with the assistance of controllable fluid separator. The free G-quadruplex/hemin could catalyze hydrogen peroxide to generate oxygen for the consumption of photo-induced electrons from CuO NFs, which could further promote the electron-hole carriers separation efficiency, and eventually resulting in the enhancement of PEC signal. The proposed PEC lab-on-paper device could be employed for specific detection of ATP in the range from 5.0 to 3.0 x 10(3) nM with a detection limit of 2.1 nM.

AB Rates of cellular oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification (ECAR) are widely used proxies for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolytic rate in cell metabolism studies. However, ECAR can result from both oxidative metabolism (carbonic acid formation) and glycolysis (lactate release), potentially leading to erroneous conclusions about metabolic substrate utilization. Co-measurement of extra cellular glucose and lactate flux along with OCR and ECAR can improve the accuracy and provide better insight into cellular metabolic processes but is currently not feasible with any commercially available instrumentation. Herein, we present a miniaturized multi-sensor platform capable of real-time monitoring of OCR and ECAR along with extracellular lactate and glucose flux for small biological samples such as single equine embryos. This multiplexed approach enables validation of ECAR resulting from OXPHOS versus glycolysis, and expression of metabolic flux ratios that provide further insight into cellular substrate utilization. We demonstrate expected shifts in embryo metabolism during development and in response to OXPHOS inhibition as a model system for monitoring metabolic plasticity in very small biological samples. Furthermore, we also present a preliminary interference analysis of the multi-sensor platform to allow better understanding of sensor interference in the proposed multi-sensor platform. The capability of the platform is illustrated with measurements of multi-metabolites of single-cell equine embryos for assisted reproduction technologies. However, this platform has a wide potential utility for analyzing small biological samples such as single cells and tumor biopsies for immunology and cancer research applications.

AB Carbon dots have been extensively used for the development of fluorescent based molecular affinity sensors. However, label free DNA sensing by electrochemical method is not reported so far. Herein, we report carbon dots stabilized silver nanoparticles (CD-AgNPs) lipid nano hybrids as a sensitive and selective platform for label free electrochemical DNA sensing. The CD-AgNPs were synthesized by wet chemical method and then characterized by UV-visible, Fourier-transform Infra-red (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) techniques. These CD-AgNPs were used for decorating the binary lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP) surface (named as lipid) and tethered on self-assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) (MPA-lipid-CD-AgNPs). The formation of array of MPA-lipid-CD-AgNPs on Au electrode was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrochemical behavior of MPA- lipid-CD-AgNPs was monitored in the presence of 1 mM potassium ferri/ferrocyanide (K-3/K-4 [Fe(CN)(6)]). The formation of layer-by-layer MPA-lipid-CD-AgNPs is indicated by increased anodic and cathodic peak (Delta E-p) separation with decreased redox peak current of K-3/K-4 [Fe(CN)(6)]. Short chain DNA (30 mer oligonucleotide, representing the lung cancer) was used as a model system for label free DNA sensing. Un-hybridized (single stranded DNA), hybridized (complementary hybridized), single, double and triple base mismatched target DNA hybridized surfaces were efficiently discriminated at 1 mu M target DNA concentration at the Au/MPA-lipid-CD-AgNPs electrode by change in the charge transfer resistance from impedance technique. Further, the modified electrode was successfully used to determine target DNA in a wide linear range from 10(-16) to 10(-11) M. The present work open doors for the utilization of CDs in molecular affinity based electrochemical sensor design and development.

AB A bimetallic NiCo-based metal-organic framework (NiCo-MOF) was pyrolyzed into a novel composite comprising NiCo2O4 spinel, CoO, and metallic Co/Ni nanoparticles embedded with carbon nanotubes at high temperature 700 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere (represented by NiCo2O4/CoO@CNTs), whereas organic ligands were almost decomposed in H-2 atmosphere, leading to absence of carbon nanotubes (denoted by NiCo2O4/CoO). The feasibility of using the composite as efficient bioplatform for immobilizing the probe DNA of human immune deficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in the electrochemical detection of the HIV-1 DNA was explored. Compared with the pristine NiCo-MOF and NiCo2O4/CoO, the NiCo2O4/CoO@CNTs composite exhibited high electrochemical activity, good biocompatibility, and strong bioaffinity toward the probe DNA. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the NiCo2O4/CoO@CNTs-based bioassay displayed superior sensing performances, giving an ultralow detection limit of 16.7 fM toward HIV-1 DNA over the linear range of 0.1 pM to 20 nM; possessing high selectivity even against noncomplementary and two-base mismatch sequences; exhibiting good stability, reproducibility, repeatability and applicability in the application of detecting human serum samples. Thus, the present strategy can broaden the application of MOFs and their derivatives in various fields of biosensing.

AB The complicated interactions that occur in mixed-species biotechnologies, including biosensors, hinder chemical detection specificity. This lack of specificity limits applications in which biosensors may be deployed, such as those where an unknown feed substrate must be determined. The application of genomic data and well-developed data mining technologies can overcome these limitations and advance engineering development. In the present study, 69 samples with three different substrate types (acetate, carbohydrates and wastewater) collected from various laboratory environments were evaluated to determine the ability to identify feed substrates from the resultant microbial communities. Six machine learning algorithms with four different input variables were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict feed substrate from genomic datasets. The highest accuracies of 93 +/- 6% and 92 +/- 5% were obtained using NNET trained on datasets classified at the phylum and family taxonomic level, respectively. These accuracies corresponded to kappa values of 0.87 +/- 0.10, 0.86 +/- 0.09, respectively. Four out of six of the algorithms used maintained accuracies above 80% and kappa values higher than 0.66. Different sequencing method (Roche 454 or Illumina sequencing) did not affect the accuracies of all algorithms, except SVM at the phylum level. All algorithms trained on NMDS-compressed datasets obtained accuracies over 80%, while models trained on PCoA-compressed datasets presented a 10-30% reduction in accuracy. These results suggest that incorporating microbial community data with machine learning algorithms can be used for the prediction of feed substrate and for the potential improvement of MFC-based biosensor signal specificity, providing a new use of machine learning techniques that has substantial practical applications in biotechnological fields.

AB A sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was established by employing Au@Pt core-shell multi-branched nanoparticles, and thionin functionalized nitrogen/sulfur co-doped graphene oxide (N/S-cGO/L-lys/Au@Pt MBs/Thi) as a double signal label to detect cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this work, Au nanorods functionalized polydopamine (Au NR@PDA) with high adsorption capacity and superior electroconductivity can provide an efficient substrate for immobilizing primary antibodies (Ab(1)). In the proposed N/S-cGO/L-lys/Au@Pt MBs/Thi, an electrochemically active molecule, Thi was covalently bonded in the N/S-cGO/L-lys/Au@Pt MBs. It presented a strong differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current signal without electron transfer mediators, and showed a high electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 reduction by using amperometric i-t (i-t). Impressively, with the synergistic effect of N/S-cGO/t-lys/Au@Pt MBs/Thi and Au NR@PDA, the developed dual-mode electrochemical immunosensor for cTnI detection showed a wide linear concentration range (50 fg/mL to 250 ng/mL, 750 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL) and a low detection limit (16.7 fg/mL, 250 fg/mL) via i-t and DPV, respectively. Furthermore, this immunosensor exhibited acceptable reproducibility, high sensitivity and good stability under optimal conditions. More importantly, the satisfactory results were obtained in detection of cTnI-spiked human serum samples, and the presented method may be a promising application in clinical bioanalysis.

AB We investigated the suitability of immuno-SERS (iSERS) microscopy for imaging of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerotic plaques. Localization of SMCs is achieved by using SERS-labelled antibodies direct against alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA). The staining quality of the false-colour iSERS images obtained by confocal Raman microscopy with point mapping is compared with wide-field immunofluorescence images. Both direct (labelled primary antibody) and indirect iSERS staining (unlabelled primary and labelled secondary antibody) techniques were employed. Direct iSERS staining yields results comparable to indirect IF staining, demonstrating the suitability of iSERS in research on atherosclerosis and paving the way for future multiplexed imaging experiments.

AB Pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (pACC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy of high occurrence in Southern Brazil. pACC is characterized by the usual overproduction of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), whose detection in serum or plasma can be effective to the early diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, the present paper reports, for the first time, the construction and application of a label-free impedimetric immunosensor to detect DHEAS, which was based on the modification of an oxidized glassy carbon electrode with arginine-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-ARG) and anti-DHEA IgM antibodies (ox-GCE/AuNPs-ARG/IgM). AuNPs-ARG was synthesized by a green route, and characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, FTIR, TEM, DLS, and XRD. The construction of ox-GCE/AuNPs-ARG/IgM was optimized through factorial design and response surface methodology. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were employed to characterize the optimized immunosensor. The DHEAS detection principle was based on the variation of charge transfer resistance (Delta R-ct) relative to the Fe(CN)(6)(4-/3-) electrochemical probe after immunoassays in the presence of the biomarker. A linear relationship between Delta R-ct and DHEAS concentration was verified in the range from 10.0 to 110.0 mu g dL(-1), with a LOD of 7.4 mu g dL(-1). Besides the good sensitivity, the immunosensor displayed accuracy, stability, and specificity to detect DHEAS. The promising analytical performance of ox-GCE/AuNPs-ARG/IgM was confirmed by quantifying DHEAS in real patient plasma samples, with results that were comparable to the reference chemiluminescence assay. Our results suggest that the presented immunosensor can find clinical applications in the early diagnosis of pACC and to monitor DHEAS levels in other adrenal pathologies.

AB Protein-inorganic nanoflowers have been extensively used for sensing and biosensing applications by virtue of the signal enhancement of protein component-enzyme. Can the inorganic component of protein-inorganic nanoflowers be employed to amplify signal transducing for enzyme-free detection? In this work, a new kind of BSA-antibodies-copper phosphate hybrid nanoflowers (BSA-Abe-Cu-3(PO4)(2)) has been prepared by one-pot biomimetic mineralization process as signal enhancer for enzyme-free electrochemical immunoassay. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been chosen as a model biomarker. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial using the inorganic component-phosphate ions of BSA-Ab(2)-Cu-3(PO4)(2) for transducing electrochemical readout, which features the following advantages: (1) the three-dimensional hierarchical porous nanoflower morphology with a high specific surface area could load more antibodies, and BSA for blocking non-specific sites, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the fabricated immunosensors, (2) the Cu-3(PO4)(2) hybrid nanoflowers can supply a huge amount of phosphate anions to react with molybdate yielding molybdophosphate precipitates and generating redox currents for more robust enzyme-free electrochemical signal readout. The fabricated immunosensor has exhibited good detection performance with a linear range of 5 pg/mL-1 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 1.26 pg/mL. Moreover, our method has presented good feasibility for clinical sample analysis.

AB Herein a versatile photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis platform for sensitive and specific screening of low abundance antibiotics (kanamycin, Kana, used in this case) was innovatively designed using rGO-Bi2WO6-Au as photoactive matrix and target-induced branched hybridization chain reaction (t-bHCR) for efficient signal amplification. To realize the high-performance of our PEC bioanalysis system, rational introduction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) greatly accelerated the electron transfer and enhances photoactivity. As expected, the ternary nanocomposite (i.e., rGO-Bi2WO6-Au) system with cascade energy level exhibited intense PEC signal responses thanks to multistep electron-transfer (MET) mechanism. Upon sensing the target Kana, t-bHCR is readily implemented, thus resulting in the assembly of numerous CuS nanoparticle (CuS NP). As a result, the loading CuS NPs from hyper-branched structure boosted the electron donors (ascorbic acid) consumption and enhanced the steric hindrance, synergistically decrease the photoelectric response. Under the optimized testing conditions, the t-bHCR-based PEC bioanalysis exhibited superior analytical performance with a linear range of 1 pM to 5 nM target Kana and limit of detection down to 0.78 pM. Additionally, favorable stability, great anti-interference ability and satisfactory accuracy for the analysis of actual samples were acquired. Impressively, the concept of t-bHCR-mediated provides an alternative to construct PEC bioanalysis and inspire more interest in the design of advanced PEC bioanalysis through nucleic acid-related signal amplification.

AB Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one among the supreme metabolic issues observed in history since 3000 BCE and has gained much interest recently due to the increasing number of diabetic cases every year. Glucose is considered as the most iconic biomarker for diabetes detection, and fluctuations in its levels are related to different stages of DM. However, methylglyoxal (MG) is evolving as a diabetes marker since it plays a significant role in biological processes Apart from DM, MG causes several metabolic irregularities like hypertension, neuropathy, nephropathy, oxidative stress. Besides, MG is a predominant precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which result in protein dysfunction, glycation of vascular tissues and aging. In this background, detection of MG has much importance, and the design of smart models is desirable. MG formation, detoxification, and its glycation effects have paved the way for the development of detection strategies which are described in detail here. The direct and indirect methods of MG measurement have been established in the past. At present, techniques like high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, capillary electrophoresis, electrochemical biosensors have been used to quantify MG present in the samples. Here, we have tried to correlate the function of MG and detection strategies to explain the major challenges posed towards implementation of easy, efficient and accurate standardization.

AB Herein, novel photoactive materials, MOF-derived porous hollow carbon nanobubbles@ZnCdS multi-shelled dodecahedral cages (C@ZnCdS MSDCs), were synthesized via continuous chemical etching, sulfurization, cation-exchange and calcination strategies. Due to the synergistic effect between the porous shells and the carbon-layer coating, C@ZnCdS MSDCs displayed superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The synthesized C@ZnCdS MSDCs were assembled onto TiO2 modified ITO electrodes to form a type-II heterostructures. Then, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on the surface of ITO/TiO2/C@ZnCdS MSDCs. Benefiting from the unique structure and performance merits of photoactive materials, a label-free PEC sensing platform based on ITO/TiO2/C@ZnCdS MSDCs/Au was successfully constructed for CEA detection. Under optimal conditions, the PEC biosensor exhibited a wide linear range (0.00005-500 ng mL(-1)) and low detection limit (2.28 fg mL(-1)) The proposed PEC biosensor also showed good stability, specificity, reproducibility and acceptability in human serum. The prepared C@ZnCdS MSDCs would be a promising photoactive material for PEC biosensors. Most importantly, this work opens up new horizons for the application of MOFs-derived hollow carbon materials in sensing.

AB Monitoring superoxide anions in living cells have attracted much academic and biomedical interest due to their important role in metabolic processes. Herein, we confined ultra-small nano-Mn-3(PO4)(2) in chitosan and designed a unique puffy woven sphere consisted by nanowires. Further constructed an effective in situ detection chip using the as-synthesized nano-Mn-3(PO4)(2)-chitosan for electrochemical sensing of superoxide anions from murine breast tumor cells (4T1). The excellent biocompatibility of chitosan and large size of the Mn-3(PO4)(2)-chitosan spheres greatly reduced the damage and toxicity of the detection interface to the living cells, while the ultra-small nano-Mn-3(PO4)(2) in chitosan could effectively catalyze the superoxide anions released from cells. The nanoMn(3)(PO4)(2)-chitosan-based sensor exhibited high sensitivity (1.6 mu A mu M-1), low detection limit (9.4 nM at S/N = 3) and good selectivity for O-2(center dot-). After cell culture on the surface of nano-Mn-3(PO4)(2)-chitosan based electrode. As a miniature analytical and sensing platform, results further suggest that the prepared chip offers a more sensitive detective superoxide anions (O-2(center dot-)) released from 4T1 cell lines than traditional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis.

AB Natural ion channels on cell membrane can gate the transport of ions and molecules by the conformational alteration of transmembrane proteins to regulate the normal physiological activities of cells. Inspired by the similarity of the conformation change under specific stimuli, here we introduce an ion channel gating model on a single nanoelectrode by anchoring DNA-gated switches on the very nanotip of gold nanoelectrode to mimic the response-to-stimulus behaviors of ion channels on bio-membranes. The surface-tethered DNA ion channels can be switched on by the Watson-Crick base pairing, which can alter the conformation of the tethered DNA from lying state to upright state. And these conformational alterations of the anchored DNA switches can effectively gate the transport of potassium ferricyanide onto the electrode interface. By continuously initiating the gates with DNA of different concentrations, we achieved the stepping gating of ion channels on a single nanoelectrode. Further, we demonstrated that the ion gating system on nanoelectrode showed excellent sensing performance. For example, the response kinetic was very fast with the signal saturation time of similar to 1 min, the reproducibility of the OFF/ON switch was robust enough to sustain for two cycles, and simultaneously, the specificity was high enough to distinguish complementary DNA and non-complementary DNA. When used for label-free DNA detection, the limit of detection can be as low as 10 pM. This study provides a promising avenue to achieve label free and real-time detection of multiple biomolecules.

AB Highly sensitive long-period fiber gratings (LPFG) was developed for label-free and rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Specifically, the LPFG was functionalized with antibody and nanopitted polyelectrolyte coatings to facilitate bacterial adhesion and thus enhance the sensitivity of bacteria detection. The kinetics of S. aureus adhesion on functional coatings were tracked by surface morphology evolution and time-resolved resonance wavelength shift of the coated LPFG at a flow rate of 30 mu l/ml and 37 degrees C in the concentration range of 10(4)-10(8) colony forming unit (CFU)/ml. S. aureus detection at concentrations as low as 224 CFU/ml can be achieved within a short time span of 30 min. The LPFG-based biosensor can be readily adapted to a variety of biophotonic platforms, for applications such as food safety inspection, environmental monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and medical applications.

AB In this work, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was constructed using poly-L-lysine (PLL) as a novel co-reactant of luminol and poly(luminol/aniline) nanorods loaded reduced graphene oxide (PLA@rGO) as nanoprobe, which enable highly sensitivity detection of glutathione (GSH). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that PLL was used for the co-reactant of luminol. Notably, about a 5-fold enhancement was obtained compared with the individual PLA@rGO using GCE. Due to the remarkable quenching effect between the excited state of PLL and the reduced form of GSH in the ECL system of luminol/PLL, the ECL sensing platform exhibited wide linear ranges of 1.0 x 10(-9)-1.0 x 10(-4) M and 1.0 x 10(-4)-1.0 x 10(-2) M and a low detection limit of 7.7 x 10(-10) M. Simultaneously, the biosensor was also successfully applied to detect GSH in human serum sample with high recoveries. Hence, this work would open a new platform for the wide application of PLL in immunoassay and various sensors.

AB An efficient and new electrochemical biosensor for detection of DNA damage, induced by the interaction of the hybrid anti-cancer compound (7ESTAC01) with DNA, was studied by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The biosensor consists of a Stem-Loop DNA (SL-DNA) probe covalently attached to the gold electrode (GE) surface that hybridizes to a complementary DNA strand (cDNA) to form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The interaction and DNA damage induced by 7ESTAC01 was electrochemically studied based on the oxidation signals of the electroactive nucleic acids on the surface of the GE by DPV. As a result, the SL-DNA/GE and dsDNA/GE were tested with the reduced 7ESTAC01, showing the voltammetric signal of guanine and adenine, increase in the presence of 7ESTAC01. Under optimum conditions, the dsDNA/GE biosensor exhibited excellent DPV response in the presence of 7ESTAC01. The bonding interaction between 7ESTAC01 and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, dynamic simulations (performed to investigate the DNA structure under physiological conditions), and molecular docking. Theoretical results showed the presence of hydrogen bonding and intercalation in the minor groove of DNA, involving hydrophobic interactions.

AB Developing simple, portable, rapid, and easy-to-use diagnostic technologies is essential for point-of-care (POC) blood molecular testing. Integrated microfluidic devices that include the functionalities of blood separation, microfluidic pumping, and molecular detection are desirable for POC testing; however, current technologies still rely on off-chip sample processing or require bulky equipment. We report a fully-integrated microfluidic diagnostic device, i.e., an integrated pneumatic microfluidic circuit (iPC), that can autonomously pump whole blood, continuously sort blood plasma, and readily enable blood plasma proteomic analysis. The iPC contains vacuum pillars as a vacuum source and waste reservoir, as well as microchannels connecting the pillars as a plasma separator or a flow stabilizer. We combined the iPC and a miniaturized fluorescence microscope to create a portable diagnostic platform that enables fluorescence-based biomarker detection. First, we performed systematic parametric studies to establish design rules for determining the transport and distribution of fluid streams in the iPC. We then demonstrated the capability of the iPC-based diagnostic platform by successfully separating blood plasma from microliter quantities of whole blood while simultaneously quantifying thrombin in blood samples using an aptamer beacon within 5 min of sample injection. Our platform holds potential as a rapid, field-deployable, essentially universal diagnostic tool in POC settings.

AB In this paper, a three-line LFB was successfully developed by adding a thrombin line to a conventional two-line LFB for the detection of thrombin in a wide range of human serum. We introduced a thrombin line between the test line and the control line. The concentration of thrombin in the sample was quantitatively related to the signal formation on the three lines of the LFB. We can make use of signal on three lines to quantitative determinate the thrombin by data processing. The detection range of thrombin concentrations measured in 10 min was 1 nM to 100 mu M and the LOD was 0.85 nM. Our approach paves way for rapid and sensitive thrombin detection and a superior device for testing in a wide range of physiological concentrations, which also can be used in other hook-effect-limited aptamers or antibodies based sandwich LFBs, and has a high accuracy even within the range of the hook-effect.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic central neurodegenerative disease. The pathological features of AD are the extracellular deposition of senile plaques formed by amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os) and the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. However, due to the lack of effective method and experimental models to study the cognitive decline, communication at cell resolution and the implementation of interventions, the diagnosis and treatment on AD still progress slowly. In this paper, we established a pathological model of AD in vitro based on A beta Os-induced hippocampal neuronal network chip for multi-site dynamic analysis of the neuronal electrical activity and network connection. The multiple characteristic parameters, including positive and negative spike intervals, firing rate and peak-to-peak values, were extracted through the analysis of spike signals, and two firing patterns from the interneurons and pyramidal neurons were recorded. The spatial firing patterns mapping and cross-correlation between channels were performed to validate the degeneration of neuronal network connectivity. Moreover, an electrical stimulation with frequency at 40 Hz was exerted to preliminarily explore the therapeutic effect on the pathological model of AD. This neuronal network chip enables the implementation of AD models in vitro for studying basic mechanisms of neurodegeneration within networks and for the parallel testing of various potential therapies. It can be a novel technique in the research of AD pathological model in vitro.

AB A highly efficient quench-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was proposed for the trace detection of amyloid beta-protein (A beta(1-42)). In this work, tin disulfide nanoflowers (SnS2-NFs) with large specific surface area, favorable catalytic property and chemical stability were prepared and used as substrate material. Taking advantage of the excellent catalytic ability and biocompatibility, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) were in situ reduced on SnS2 NFs to obtain SnS2-Pd. Moreover it could combine with large amounts of luminol and achieve a strong ECL signal output. In addition, copper doped mesoporous tungsten trioxide (Cu:WO3) nanoparticles were selected to quench ECL emission of luminol@SnS2-Pd via resonance energy transfer, where luminol@SnS2-Pd was the donor and Cu:WO3 was the acceptor. On this basis, a quench-type ECL immunosensor was constructed for detection of A beta(1-42). Under optimum conditions, the fabricated ECL immunosensor showed sensitive response to A beta(1-42) concentration from 0.1 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 5.4 fg/mL (S/N = 3). It is expected to be a promising analytical tool for the sensitive detection of A beta(1-42) and other biomarkers with high specificity, good reproducibility and long-term stability.

AB As a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has huge potential in biomedical area; while its applications in multiplex bioassays are still a challenge. Here, we present novel MoS2-integrated silica colloidal crystal barcode (SCCB) for multiplex microRNA (miRNA) screening. MoS2 was adsorbed on SCCBs by electrostatic interaction, and quantum dots (QDs) decorated hairpin probes were coupled on MoS2 by covalent linkage. As the MoS2 could quench the QDs of the hairpin probes, they together formed a molecular beacon (MB) structure before the detection. When used in assays, target miRNA could form a double strand with the probe and made QDs keep away from MoS2 sheets to recovery their fluorescence. Because the released QDs were positively correlated with the concentration of the hybridized nucleic acid, the target miRNAs could be quantified by measuring the fluorescence signal of the QDs on the SCCBs. In addition, by utilizing different MoS2-integrated structural color encoded SCCBs, multiplexed miRNA quantification could also be realized. Based on this strategy, we have demonstrated that several pancreatic cancer-related miRNAs could be selectivity and sensitivity detected with a detection limit of 4.2 +/- 0.3 nM. These features make the MoS2-integrated SCCB ideal for many potential applications.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based dopamine sensor is realized using the state-of-art technique of molecular imprinting over an optical fiber substrate. Polypyrrole (PPy) is depicted as an effective polymer for the imprinting of dopamine through a green synthesis approach. Sensitivity of the probe is enhanced by the augmenting effect of surface imprinting of dopamine in polypyrrole over multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). To ensure the permselectivity of the probe towards dopamine molecules, a cation exchange polymer, nafion, is utilized as a membrane over imprinted sites to reduce the interference from anionic analyzes like ascorbic acid and uric acid at physiological pH. The probe is characterized for a wide range of dopamine concentration from 0 to 10(-5) M in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Various probe parameters are varied to maximize the sensitivity of the sensor. The sensor possesses 18.9 pM as the limit of detection (LOD) which is lowest of those reported in the literature. The manifestation of sensing probe over an optical fiber along with the improved LOD makes the approach highly advantageous in terms of stability, repeatability, online remote monitoring, fast response, and miniaturization for its in vivo/in vitro applications in clinical sensing of dopamine.

AB Early diagnosis of bacterial infections is crucial to improving survival rates by enabling treatment with appropriate antibiotics within the first few hours of infection. This paper presents a highly sensitive amperometric biosensor for the detection of several pathogenic bacterial cells in blood plasma around 30 min. The proposed device is based on an electropolymerized self-assembled layer on gold nanoparticles operated in a portable nano-sieving microfluidic system (NS-MFS). The redox-active gold nanoparticles (raGNPs) enhanced the electrical conductivity and provided a greater number of electrochemically active molecules for sensing, while improving resistance to the fouling of sensors by oxidation products in blood plasma. The detection limit of the device has been shown to reach 10 CFU/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus spiked in plasma. The dynamic range of the sensing system falls between 10 and 10(5) CFU/mL in a buffer solution by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The results demonstrated that the raGNPs/NS-MFS can successful detect P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in human plasma, and is very useful for the diagnosis of bacteremia from clinical samples.

AB For the first time, a quantitative photothermal-sensing immunochromatographic sensor (PT-ICS) is described using Au nanoparticle-enhanced two-dimensional black phosphorus (BP-Au) as signal component for the photothermal-sensing antibody probe. BP-Au has good photothermal properties at 808 nm, and the photothermal conversion efficiency of the BP-Au nanosheet increased by 12.9% over the black phosphorus nanosheet alone. In addition, the antibody was more easily coupled to this nanosheet due to the good physical adsorption capacity of Au nanoparticles. We used this PT-ICS to detect veterinary antibiotics enrofloxacin (ENR), the photothermal-sensing antibody probe was competitive captured by ENR target and antigen coating on test (T) lines of the sensor. This process was exothermic under an 808 nm laser, and the thermal energy decreased as the ENR in the sample increased. This thermal energy was recorded by an infrared thermal imager or an infrared thermometer, and the concentration of the ENR residues in animal-derived foods was obtained by analyzing the temperature changes in T-lines. Under optimal conditions, the PT-ICS exhibited sensitive and specific detection of ENR from 0.03 mu g/L to 10 mu g/L with detection limits of 0.023 mu g/L. The results agreed well with a commercial enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay kit. This PT-MS provided a promising strategy for the detection of ENR residues in animal-derived foods and expected to be used for the detection of other highly sensitive biomacromolecules.

AB Herein, an electrochemical aptasensor is described for detection of ampicillin (Ampi). The sensing strategy is based on the application of a ladder-shaped DNA structure as a multi-layer physical block on the surface of gold electrode. Attributing to the electrostatic repulsion and physical prevention of the ladder-shaped DNA structure, ultrasensitive detection of Ampi was achieved with a detection limit as low as 1 pM. In the presence of Ampi, the ladder-shaped DNA structure is disassembled and detached from the electrode surface. This leads to the high access of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as a redox indicator to the electrode surface and a strong redox peak. The aptasensor response for Ampi detection was in the linear range from 7 pM to 100 nM with the detection limit of 1 pM. The presented analytical strategy showed its application in detecting Ampi in the spiked milk samples with satisfactory performance. This work can be easily expanded for different targets by alternating the corresponding aptamers.

AB Optical trapping of single particles or cells with the capability of in situ bio-sensing or genetic profiling opens the possibility of rapid screening of biological specimens. However, common optical tweezers suffer from the lack of long-range forces. Consequently, their application areas are predominantly limited to target manipulation instead of biological diagnostics. To solve this problem, we herein report an all-in-one approach by combining optical forces and convective drag forces generated through localized optothermal effect for long-range target manipulation. The device consists of a 2D array of gold coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-wells, which are immersed by colloidal particles or cell solution. Upon excitation of a 785-nm laser, the hydrodynamic convective force and optical forces will drag the targets of interest into their designated micro-wells. Moreover, the plasmonic thermal dissipation provides a constant temperature environment for following cell analysis procedures of cell isolation, lysis and isothermal nucleic acid amplification for the detection of genetic markers. With the merits of fabrication simplicity, short sample-to-answer cycle time and the compatibility with optical microscopes, the reported technique offers an attractive and highly versatile approach for on-site single cell analysis systems.

AB Here, we propose a new two-layer three-dimensional (3-D) DNA walker sensor with highly integrated entropy-driven and enzyme-powered reactions for the first time. The 3-D DNA walker sensor is constructed by assembling densely carboxyfluorescein-labeled single strand oligonucleotides (inner-layer tracks) and nucleic acid complex S (outer-layer tracks) on a microparticle. In the presence of the target, outer and inner tracks are activated in turn, thereby releasing a great deal of the signal reporters for signal reading. As a result, our 3-D DNA walker sensor can realize the target detection in the range from 2 pM to 5 nM within one hour. Besides, the specific walker sensor can clearly distinguish even one-base mismatched target analogue. More importantly, our walker sensor can also test the target in human serum samples in the concentrations as low as 0.1 nM, which provides a bridge between real sample detection and clinical application. Certainly, this smart strategy could also be generalized to any target of interest by proper design.

AB Construction a sensor to accurately detect dopamine (DA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is meaningful due to their close relation to the health of organisms. In this work, one-step hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize hierarchical hollow hydrangea-like Fe3+ @epsilon-MnO2 microspheres constructed by interconnected nanosheets, and the growth mechanism of the microspheres (n(Fe)/n(Mn) = 0.6) was also investigated in detail. The material was used to construct an electrochemical sensor for DA and H2O2 detection with the linear range of 0.02-78 mu moL(-1) and 0.000133-5.19 mmoL(-1), respectively. The detection limit and sensitivity for DA and H2O2 are 5 and 50 nmoL(-1) (S/N = 3), 7034.1 and 242.6 mu A m(mol.L-1)(-1) cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the sensor was successfully applied to the detection of DA and H2O2 in serum and urine samples, indicating a potential value of this work in the pharmaceutical and environmental fields.

AB As a newly emerged photoactive material, Cu2MoS4 has motivated wide research interests in the field of photoelectrochemistry. Based on manganese doped CdS (CdS:Mn) sensitized graphene (G)/Cu2MoS4 composite, we developed a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for the detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). G as an excellent 2D conductive material, combined with Cu2MoS4 could improve its charge transfer efficiency. CdS:Mn nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on G/Cu2MoS4 further enlarged the light absorption range of Cu2MoS4 and restrained the electron-hole pairs recombination. Under optimal conditions, the proposed PEC immunosensor responded sensitively to cTnI with a low detection limit of 0.18 pg/mL and a wide linear range (0.005-1000 ng/mL). Moreover, as-fabricated immunosensor also exhibited high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and good stability. This work also was extended to real samples analysis and obtained satisfied results.

AB We designed and synthesized a novel covalent organic framework (COF) by condensation polymerization of 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and melamine through imine bonds (represented by Py-M-COF). The basic characterizations revealed that the Py-M-COF not only exhibited an extended pi-conjugation framework, a large specific surface area (495.5 m(2) g(-1)), big pore cavities, and nanosheet-like structure but also possessed rich functional groups, such as (CC)-C-center dot, (CN)-N-center dot, (CO)-O-center dot and NH2. These features endowed the Py-M-COF with high charge carrier mobility, further improving the strong immobilization of DNA aptamer strands via pi-pi stacking interaction and electrostatic interaction. As such, the Py-M-COF-based electrochemical aptasensors are ultrasensitive in detecting different antibiotics, including enrofloxacin (ENR) and ampicillin (AMP), yielding extremely low detection limits of 6.07 and 0.04 fg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) toward ENR and AMP, respectively, along with other excellent sensing performances. This biosensing platform based on Py-M-COF has potential applications for the sensitive detection of antibiotics or other analytes by replacing the corresponding aptamers.

AB Smartphone-based point-of-care testing (POCT) is rapidly emerging as a potential alternative to the traditional laboratory-based diagnostic testing owing to economic considerations and availability of medical equipment especially in resource-limited areas. A smartphone, combined with a biosensor and other related accessories, can offer high accuracy and sensitivity for medical testing. Moreover, the ubiquity of smartphone has propelled the development considerably, and accordingly research in recent years has shown promising progress in POCT. Here, we used samples (blood, urine, sweat, saliva and tears) of liquid biopsy as the standard for classification of smartphone-based POCT devices, considering that these samples contain multiple biomarkers of serious diseases. The colorimetric, fluorescent, brightfield, and electrochemical methods were utilized to examine these samples. We performed a comprehensive review of the development of smartphone-based POCT devices over the past two years (2017-2018) and assessed their relative merits and drawbacks. Based on the progress of POCT development, it illustrates that the various technological and economical requirements are urgent and tremendous. The tendency of high-quality, low-cost smartphone-based POCT devices, feature of biosensors (paper-based sensor, flexible device, microfluidic chip, et al.) currently widely used in POCT and recommendations of future works were summarized.

AB Early diagnosis of dengue biomarkers by employing a technology that is less labor- and time-intensive and offers higher sensitivity and lower limits of detection would find great significance in the developing world. Here, we report the development of a biosensor that exploits the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of silver nanostructures, created via thermal annealing of thin metal film, to detect dengue NS1 antigen, which appears as early as the onset of infection. The biosensor integrates membrane-based blood-plasma separation to develop lab-on-chip device that facilitates rapid diagnosis (within 30 min) of dengue NS1 antigen from a small volume (10 mu L) of whole blood. The refractive index (RI) sensitivity of the LSPR biosensor was verified by using aqueous glycerol (0-100 wt%) which showed that it is sufficiently sensitive to detect 10(-3) change in RI, which is comparable to that observed with protein-protein interaction. The RI sensitivity was utilized to demonstrate protein binding by using bovine serum albumin and detection of antibody-antigen immune reaction by binding human chorionic gonadotropin antigen to immunoglobulin antibody immobilized in our LSPR biosensor. Next, we demonstrated the detection of NS1 in plasma obtained via centrifugation and in plasma separated on-chip. From 10 mu L of whole blood spiked with NS1 antigen, our biosensor reliably detects 0.06 mu g/mL of NS1, which lies within the clinical limit observed during the first seven days of infection, with a sensitivity of 9 nm/(mu g/mL). These results confirm that the proposed LSPR biosensor can potentially be used in point-of-care dengue diagnostics.

AB In precision medicine, clinical decisions and pharmaceutical evaluations tends to be made upon parallel analysis of multiple protein biomarkers. Currently, the growing needs of high-throughput multiplex immunoassay is partially satisfied by spectrally encoded bead flow suspension arrays and other platforms, yet there is still room for progress in terms of encoding capacity, decoding accuracy, ease-of-manufacture/operation, and cost-effectiveness, for which graphical suspension arrays could make substantial contributions. Here we described a suspension array system made up of graphically encoded silica particles, an automated microplate imager and an in-house data processing program. The micro-fabricated, highly uniform planar particles provide a code space of 128-plex with further extendibility. The derived multiplex immunoassay reaches sub-picogram per milliliter sensitivity level (lowest LoD = 80 fg/ml) with wide dynamic range, as well as high precision and accuracy. The potential of clinical diagnostics was demonstrated by parallel measurement of three serum biomarkers for type 1 diabetes patients. Importantly, use of standard microplates as assay vessel extends its power to high-throughput applications, such as disease screening or drug discovery.

AB As a significant biomarker of prion diseases, ultrasensitive assay of infectious isoform of prion (PrPSc) is highly desirable for early diagnostics of prion diseases. Herein, taking normal cellular form of prion (PrPC) as a model owing to a high risk of pathogenicity of PrPSc, a new photoelectrochemical immunosensor has been developed based on hemin-induced switching of photocurrent direction. In the presence of PrPC, nitrogen-doped porous carbon-hemin polyhedra labeled with secondary antibody were introduced onto the CdS-chitosan (CS) nano particles -modified indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode via the antigen-antibody specific recognition. Because of the matched energy level between CdS and hemin, the high-efficiency switch of photocurrent direction of the ITO/CdS-CS photoelectrode from anodic to cathodic photocurrent was observed even at very low concentration (0.4 aM) of PrPC. Through changing the specific antibody, this method can be easily expanded to PrPSc assay. Such low detectable limit is very useful in the early diagnosis and screening of prion diseases. The developed method has also promising applications in bioanalysis, disease diagnostics, and clinical biomedicine.

AB This work used 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid-luminol composite (PTCA-luminol) as signal tag with improved ECL signal and applied cruciform DNA structure mediated exponential strand displacement reaction (SDR) to construct an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) detection. The novel luminol-based signal tags was synthesized utilizing the pi-pi stacking interaction between PTCA and luminol, realizing highly effective and stable immobilization of luminol and resulting in good stability and strong ECL response. Meanwhile, target miRNA-21 triggered disaggregation of cruciform DNA structure was used to mediate exponential SDR for target recycling amplification. Taking advantage of the novel luminol-based signal tag and exponential SDR, the proposed ECL biosensor achieved excellent sensitivity with wide linear range from 10 aM to 100 pM and detection limit was 2 aM. Moreover, this ECL biosensor was applied to estimate the expression level of miRNA-21 and pharmacodynamics of matrine in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells). The proposed biosensor provided a new opportunity for the preparation of ECL nanomaterials and exhibited great application potential in other biomarkers detection, clinical application and pharmacodynamics evaluation.

AB We proposed label-free and sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensors for the quantification of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which plays a critical role in the early diagnosis of primary liver cancer. Both detection strategies involved monitoring of the electrochemical response current of the AuPt-vertical graphene (VG)/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the oxidation of the redox probe, methyl orange. AuPt nanoparticles, which have good biocompatibility and excellent conductivity, were used to immobilize the primary antibody, Ab(1), while VG sheets helped accelerate electron transfer at the liquid-solid and solid-solid interfaces. The sensing electrode played a key role in signal amplification, and the sensitivity of the sandwich-type sensor was higher than that of the label-free sensor. The former exhibited a wide linear range from 1 fg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.7 fg mL(-1) under the optimal experimental conditions. The excellent performance of the AuPt-VG/GCE-based immunosensors in AFP detection in human serum, coupled with their good stability, makes them promising tools for the clinical monitoring of AFP and other tumor markers.

AB In this study, a novel carbon tube was prepared by carbonizing a rectangular polypyrrole (RPPy) tube at a high temperature for the construction of enzymatic biofuel cells with high performance. SEM and TEM images clearly showed that the initial PPy presented a rectangular tube shape, while the carbonized PPy became a shriveled rectangular tube with a concave surface, which might be beneficial for enzyme immobilization and electrochemical applications. The glucose oxidase (GOx)- or laccase (Lac)-modified electrodes based on carbonized RPPy exhibited excellent bioelectrochemical performance. In addition, a biofuel cell (GOx, glucose/O-2, Lac) was assembled, and the open-circuit voltage reached 1.16 V. The maximum power density was measured to 0.350 mW cm(-2), which correlated to the gravimetric power density of 0.265 mW mg(-1) (per mg of GOx) at 0.85 V. The constant-current discharge method was used to further evaluate the continuous discharge capacity. The discharge time reached 49.9 h at a discharge current of 0.2 mA before the voltage was lower than 0.8 V. Furthermore, three of the fabricated biofuel cells in series were able to continually light up a white light-emitting diode (LED) whose turn-on voltage was ca. 2.4 V for more than 48 h. This study suggests that carbonized conducting polymers may become a useful electrode material for the development of enzymatic biofuel cells.

AB A biosensor based on a chiral assembly of polymer of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) trimers was developed for the detection and quantification of the major shellfish allergen tropomyosin (TROP). TROP and anti-TROP monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were immobilized on 20 nm and 30 nm 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (16-MHDA) functionalized AuNPs to assemble a trimer, which has a Circular dichroism (CD) signal. The free TROP from samples was quantified as an inhibitor for the formation of the AuNP trimer. The AuNP trimer-based biosensor allowed for the selective determination of TROP in the range of 0.1-15 ng mL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 21 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 70 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 10). The use of a AuNP trimer-based biosensor with simple sample preparation functions with specificity and accuracy; this highlights its applicability for the detection of allergens in shellfish products, related products and their production lines. Furthermore, based on the less conserved sequences of TROP in phylogenetically different species, this biosensor is currently being used to identify the adulteration of shellfish products using TROP as biomarker.

AB The present work is dedicated to the development of a lab-on-chip (LOC) device for water toxicity environmental analysis and more especially herbicide detection. The final goal is focused on the functional integration of three electrode electrochemical microcells (ElecCell) and organic photodetectors (OPD) in order to perform simultaneously electrochemical and optical detection in the frame of algal metabolism monitoring. Considering three different algae, ie. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris while dealing with photosynthesis, the multi-microsensor platform enables to measure the variations of microalgae fluorescence as well as oxygen production. It is applied to study the Diuron herbicide influences on algal metabolism, evidencing fluorescence enhancement and oxygen production inhibition for concentrations as low as few tens of nanomoles. These results are performed with unconcentrated and six time concentrated algae solutions respectively, to estimate the ability of this dual-sensor system to conduct measurements without any sample preparation. Thus, according to the obtained results, the proposed LOC device is fully adapted to the electrochemical/optical dual detection for on-site pollutant analysis, ie. without sample pre-treatment.

AB A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection was constructed. In this sensing platform, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) loaded electroactive amino-zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (Pd/NH2-ZIF-67) nanocomposite is utilized as a novel redox mediator. Pd NPs, as the labeling signal molecule, owns good biocompatibility and excellent catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the electroactive ZIF-67 with lamellar structures serves not only as a carrier of Pd NPs but also as a synergistic catalyst of palladium to decompose H2O2. Amperometric method is used to determine the current signal generated on the electrode surface, which is conducive to achieve the quantitative determination of PSA. Under optimum conditions, the proposed immunosensor shows a wide detection range from 100 fg mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.03 pg mL(-1) d, featuring favorable selectivity, repeatability and stability. This proposed immunosensor is expected to be a powerful tool for realizing quantitative detection of PSA and other biomarkers in actural sample analysis.

AB An ultrasensitive Visible light-triggered photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor was designed based on ideal photoactive lead sulfoiodide (Pb5S2I6) as low band gap crystal, which hydrothermally synthesized rapidly at low temperature (160 degrees C) in hydrochloride acid media followed by its incorporation into polydopamine as reactive photo-biointerface, through a facile in situ electropolymerization method, coated on nanoporous TiO2 grown by anodization on Ti foil. The structure of as-prepared samples and their photoelectrochemical properties were fully characterized. This unique photo-sensitive Pb5S2I6 catalyst-based PEC bioassay was constructed for the detection of low-abundant Cr(VI) ion in real samples. Applying central composite design, individual and mutual interaction effects were evaluated to obtain optimized solution pH, applied potential and radiant light wavelength as operational factors influencing the PEC efficiency for Cr(VI) detection. At optimal condition, the proposed sensor due to effective suppress in electron-hole recombinations showed a very low detection limit of 3.0 nM, over a broad linear concentration range of 0.01-80 mu M in addition to high sensitivity versus 1.9 mu A/mu M Cr(VI), Proposed PEC sensor displayed high selectivity, reproducibility and stability as well as improved excitation conversion efficiency, which make it highly applicable using solar energy. The potential applicability of the designed sensor was evaluated in water, tomato juice and hair color.

AB Electroactive biofilms (EABs) have recently attracted considerable research interest for their possible use as amperometric biosensors in environmental or bioprocess monitoring, for example for in situ detection of toxic compounds. Almost exclusively, corresponding research has focused on heterotrophic, anodic EABs. These biofilms require sufficiently high organic loads and anoxic conditions to deliver a stable baseline current. Conversely, electroautotrophic O-2-reducing EABs have recently been proposed to monitor toxic shocks in oxic solutions that are poor or devoid of organic substrate. This was done in optimal media and only assessed for formaldehyde as a model toxic compound. Here we show that O-2-reducing EABs can grow in unamended tap water on carbon electrodes at + 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. They retained substantial electroactivity for at least eight months without adding exogenous compounds. The most represented operational taxonomic units were assigned to the phylum Gammaproteobacteria (25 +/- 15%, n = 5 electrodes). Cyclic voltammograms showed a reproducible nernstian behavior for O-2 reduction with a mid-wave potential at + 0.27 V and variable plateau current densities ranging from- 1 to - 22 mu A cm(-2) (n = 10 electrodes). The biocatalytic current was substantially impacted by the addition of either of three tested heavy metals (Hg(II), Cr(VI) or Pb(II)) or by organic pollutants (formaldehyde, 2,4-dichlorophenol, benzalkonium chloride), with limits of detection ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg L-1 (2.5-61 mu mol L-1). Response times were typically around 1 min. Comparison with previous reports suggests that O-2-reducing microbial cathodes may be more sensitive to toxic shocks than anodic, heterotrophic EABs.

AB Functionalized fibrous nano-silica (KCC-1) was applied to specific electrochemical detection of HT 29 colorectal cancer cells based on folate (FA)/folate receptor (FR) interactions. KCC-1 fibrous materials were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and then functionalized with FA molecules to produce KCC-1-NH2-FA nano particles. The KCC-1-NH2-FA fibrous nanoparticles offer favorable bleaching stability and exceptional surface area to volume ratio which provide facility to design more sensitive cytosensors. The morphology, size and surface charge of KCC-1, KCC-1-NH2 and KCC-1-NH2-FA were approved by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential, respectively. The porosity of the negatively charged KCC-1-NH2-FA was also tested with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) which approves the high surface area to volume ratio of the KCC-1 based materials. Flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging were applied to approve quantitative and qualitative attaching of KCC-1-NH2-FA to the HT 29 FR-positive cancer cells. Also, the specific capturing of the nanoparticles were approved by FR negative HEK 293 normal cells as FR-negative cells through cellular uptake assay which showed the smart differentiation by KCC-1-NH2-FA nanomaterials. The cytotoxicity results revealed the biocompatible nature of KCC-1 based materials, implying that the developed method could be used in in vivo applications under the optimized conditions. The developed cytosensor response is linear from 50 to 1.2 x 10(4) cells/mL with a lower limit of detection (LLOQ) of 50 cells/mL. As advantage of the developed cytosensor is simple and provides excellent specificity and sensitivity which enables us to design point of care devices for clinical uses.

Nanomaterials have been widely reported in lateral flow biosensors, offering new sensing strategies based on optical or electrical detection techniques. Looking for other advantageous nanomaterials, we propose for the first time the use of iridium oxide (IV) nanoparticles in lateral flow assays for the detection of human immunoglobulin as a model protein. These nanoparticles can be easily prepared and conjugated with biomarkers. Their dark blue color gives a high contrast against the white background of the strips being in this way excellent labels.

AB Flunitrazepam, also known as "Rohypnol" or "Rophy" among other trade and street names, is an extremely potent benzodiazepine that is prescribed to treat severe insomnia. Due to these attributes, flunitrazepam, when is surreptitiously administered to an alcoholic or soft drink, is associated with "drug-facilitated sexual assault". We report here for the first time, a low cost lab-on-a-screen-printed electrochemical cell (SPC) based on iron-sparked graphite working electrode modified with glucose oxidase (GOx) and glucose hydrogel droplets (G1uHD) for the detection of flunitrazepam. Iron-spark modification increases the response of the sensor by ca. 3-fold compared with that of the plain electrode, while an in situ deoxygenation process, based on GOx-glucose enzyme reaction, depletes dissolved oxygen. As a result, the method enables interference free voltammetric measurements of the electro reduction of the nitro group of flunitrazepam at ca. -0.71 to -0.78 V vs. Ag printed pseudo reference electrode depending on the samples matrix, and the detection of the drug at the sub-millimolar level. GOx/GluHD-FeSPC was directly applied to the drop-volume (similar to 60 mu L) detection of flunitrazepam to a wide range of untreated and undiluted spiked samples (Pepsi cola (R), Vodka, Whisky, Tequila, Gin, and Rum) of different acidity (pH 2.3-8.4), and alcohol content up to 40% v/v. Data demonstrate the excellent performance of the sensor for point-of-need screening of flunitrazepam and suggest that GOx/GluHD-FeSPC holds promise as an effective analytical tool to prevent phenomena of covert drug administration.

AB The importance of specific and label-free detection of proteins via antigen-antibody interactions for the development of point-of-care testing devices has greatly influenced the search for a more accessible, sensitive, low cost and robust sensors. The vision of silicon field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensors has been an attractive venue for addressing the challenge as it potentially offers a natural path to incorporate sensors with the existing mature Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) industry; this provides a stable and reliable technology, low cost for potential disposable devices, the potential for extreme minituarization, low electronic noise levels, etc. In the current review we focus on silicon-based immunological FET (ImmunoFET) for specific and label-free sensing of proteins through antigen-antibody interactions that can potentially be incorporated into the CMOS industry; hence, immunoFETs based on nano devices (nanowire, nanobelts, carbon nanotube, etc.) are not treated here. The first part of the review provides an overview of immunoFET principles of operation and challenges involved with the realization of such devices (i.e. e.g. Debye length, surface ftmctionalization, noise, etc.). In the second part we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art silicon-based immunoFET structures and novelty, principles of operation and sensing performance reported to date.

AB We demonstrate a swarm biosensing platform that detects analyte based on the change in plasmonic signal from thousands of single nanoparticles sensors, leading to increased quantitative accuracy. Following dark field microscopy, we perform computational image registration and analyses to compile the hue change from thousands of single gold nanoparticles acting as individual quantitative biosensors. This platform demonstrated a limit of detection of 10 pM with a dynamic range of at least 4 orders of magnitude in buffer solution, and the successful detection of c-reactive protein (CRP) in serum compatible with 3-tier clinical cutoffs within a 10-fold difference without the need for a blocking step. By analyzing the before-and-after status of each plasmonic sensor, our sensing scheme provides informative sensing capabilities with the flexibility to select a subset of nanoparticles with optimal performance based on their initial states. Hue comparisons within and among devices also render the platform tolerant to particle and device variation. In addition, the simplicity of the readout instrumentation based on optical imaging and the implementation of microfluidics make it promising for future adaptation into point-of-care systems.

AB Over the past decades, researchers have been seeking attractive substrate materials to keep microfluidics improving to outbalance the drawbacks and issues. Cellulose substrates, including thread, paper and hydrogels are alternatives due to their distinct structural and mechanical properties for a number of applications. Thread have gained considerable attention and become promising powerful tool due to its advantages over paper-based systems thus finds numerous applications in the development of diagnostic systems, smart bandages and tissue engineering. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review articles on the topic of thread-based microfluidics have been published and it is of significance for many scientific communities working on Microfluidics, Biosensors and Lab-on-Chip. This review gives an overview of the advances of thread-based microfluidic diagnostic devices in a variety of applications. It begins with an overall introduction of the fabrication followed by an in-depth review on the detection techniques in such devices and various applications with respect to effort and performance to date. A few perspective directions of thread-based microfluidics in its development are also discussed. Thread-based microfluidics are still at an early development stage and further improvements in terms of fabrication, analytical strategies, and function to become low-cost, low-volume and easy-to-use point of-care (POC) diagnostic devices that can be adapted or commercialized for real world applications.

AB In this study, a signal-on nanobiosensor based on bivalent aptamer-Cu nanocluster was designed and optimized for specific and sensitive detection of VEGF(165). The VEGF(165) is known as a promising biomarker in different diseases such as cancer in the angiogenic stage. Detection and quantification of VEGF(165) is a crucial step in diagnosis and monitoring the treatment plan. The represented nanostructure consists of multimerized VEGFiss aptamer joint with ssDNA based linker in the middle and poly thymine sequences on both 3' and 5' ends as a template for Cu-nanocluster supraparticle formation. This self-assembled structure leads to accurate controlling of aggregation in the presence of VEGF(165). This study is the first report for Cu nanocluster nucleation on ploy thymine tails of ssDNA which performed in two reduction steps to form stable CuNC supraparticle. The sensing strategy was designed based on the target-induced structure switching mode of the aptamer. In the presence of VEGF(165), due to self-assembly induced emission and aggregation-induced emission phenomena this nanostructure depicted the visible wavelength shift and enhancement in the fluorescence emission intensity. Also, the results of the analytical performance of this nanobiosensor indicated the LOD of 12 pM which revealed high rate sensitivity. This aptasensor exhibited stability and decent response linearity range (10-800 pM, R-2 = 0.9943). The selectivity and specificity assessment showed high discriminant capability in the real serum sample. In conclusion, this signal-on nanobiosensor provides a facile, sensitive and reliable assay for clinical monitoring of the VEGF(165) concentration in serum without further sample preparation.

AB Photonic crystals and plasmonic nanohole arrays are the conventional substrates for label-free biodetection applications. In this article, we readdressed these systems in terms of their sensing capability and provided a broad picture for a selection mechanism of optimum parameters providing strong sensing signals. We first investigated the physical origin of the transmission resonances supported by the two systems, which is the core of the label-free sensing mechanism, relying on strong light-matter interactions. We conducted an extensive theoretical study on optical and sensing properties of the two systems, e.g., linewidth of the optical modes, refractive index sensitivity and figure-of-merit capacities. Our theoretical analyses provided a rule-of-thumb method for the selection of geometrical device parameters of the two systems. In order to experimentally investigate the sensing properties, we fabricated the two systems via a lift-off free fabrication method based on electron beam lithography, where the plasmonic nanohole arrays are realized by covering the phonic crystal surface with a thin metal. As an example, we demonstrated the sensing strength of two systems with identical dimensions by monitoring the spectral variations within their optical responses. We also performed label-free sensing experiments through detection of protein mono- and bilayers, where the geometrical parameters favor the plasmonic sensor system. Integrating a high-resolution optical read-out scheme with a multi-spectral data tracking technique, we achieved an experimentally minimum detectable protein concentration as low as 200 pg/mL for the plasmonic nanohole array and 1 ng/mL for the photonic crystal based sensing platform.

AB A stable sandwiched electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor was originally constructed established upon Ru (bpy)(3)(2+)-doped silica nanoparticles (RuSiO2 NPs) with ferrocene carboxylic acid-aptamer (Fc-aptamer) to quantitatively detect cytochrome c (Cyt C). Herein, RuSiO2 NPs and Fc-aptamer were respectively prepared through the microemulsion method and amide reaction to fabricate the ECL aptasensor. Furthermore, Fc-aptamer was used as quenching probe for quenching the ECL emission of RuSiO2 NPs. In detail, RuSiO2 NPs were primarily immobilized onto the electrodes by the film-forming function of chitosan. Subsequently, the aptamer was incubated onto the decorated GCE via crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA). After Cyt C was connected to the GCE via immunoreaction, Fc-aptamer was immobilized onto the modified electrodes owing to the specific recognition between antigens and aptamer. Ultimately, ECL signals markedly descended owing to the poor electricity conductivity of proteins and superior quenching effect of Fc-aptamer. Under optimum conditions, the designed ECL aptasensor indicated an accurate analysis for Cyt C in a rang of 0.001-100 nM with a detection limit of 0.48 pM (S/N = 3).

AB A simple and feasible electrochemical immunosensing protocol with glucometer readout was designed for the detection of low-abundance disease-related biomarker (alpha-fetoprotein; AFP) on the basis of backfilling rolling cycle amplification (RCA) with invertase-DNA(2) conjugates on the detection antibody. The assay consisted of the immunoreaction, RCA reaction, DNA(2)-invertase hybridization and glucose measurement. Initially, a sandwiched immunoreaction was carried out between anti-AFP capture antibody-coated microplate between nanogold-labeled pAb(2) detection antibody conjugated with DNA). primer (DNA(1)-AuNP-pAb(2)) in the presence of target ATP. Thereafter, the carried primers triggered the RCA reaction in the presence of circular DNA template, polymerase and dNTP, to produce numerous repeated oligonucleotide sequences for hybridization with many invertase-DNA(2) conjugates. The carried invertase molecules accompanying the hybridization reaction hydrolyzed sucrose into glucose, thereby resulting in the amplification of the detectable signal on a handheld personal glucometer (PGM). Under optimum conditions, the developed immunoassay exhibited high sensitivity for the quantitative screening of AFP within a dynamic range of 0.1-100 ng mL(-1) at a low detection limit of 0.087 ng mL(-1) Other biomarkers and proteins did not interfere the signals of this system. In addition, this method was utilized to determine human serum samples containing target AFP, and received well-matched results with the referenced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.

AB A non-enzymatic and highly electrocatalytic H2O2 biosensor was proposed by using a novel electrode composed of hemin-capped biomineralized gold nanoparticles (Hem@AuNPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and chitosan (CS). Owing to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Hem@AuNPs and great conductivity of rGO, this developed biosensor is capable of ultrasensitive measuring H2O2 in real-time. In addition, the introduction of CS resulted in a film on the electrode, which can enhance the stability by protecting the biosensor from external disturbances. Taking advantages of the peroxidase-like activities of the nanohybrids, the developed electrode exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance toward H2O2 with high selectivity, fast response, superior sensitivity and good stability. More importantly, the lower determination limit of 9.3 nM and wider linear ranges of 5 orders of magnitude enable this biosensor to detect H2O2 releasing from living Hela cells accurately. This work provides tremendous potential for real-time monitoring the secretion of H2O2 in living cells.

AB Rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is of great importance for accurate diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. In this study, a novel method was developed for the selective detection of P. aeruginosa by combing the sandwich type complex of magnetic bead/aptamer/polyadenylated-DNA with the sensitive detection platform of gold (Au) interdigital electrode connected to a multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (Au IDE-MSPQC) system. Here, the magnetic bead (MB) was used as carrier for immobilization of the aptamer of P. aeruginosa. Polyadenylated DNA was bound to the aptamer through complementary strand pairing. When the P. aeruginosa was present in the sample solution, the polyadenylated DNA was replaced by the P. aeruginosa because of the specific interaction between P. aeruginosa and its aptamer. The released polyadenylated DNA strand in the detected solution could adsorb onto the surface of Au IDE by virtue of the strong interaction between adenine (A) and Au IDE, and result in sensitive frequency shift response of the MSPQC sensor. The limits of detection (LOD) of the method were as low as 9 CFU/mL in buffer and 52 CFU/mL in simulated blood sample. The proposed method was successfully applied to the selective detection of P. aeruginosa in blood samples. The constructed sensor is expected to find application for the rapid detection of P. aeruginosa in environment, food and clinical diagnosis.

AB A novel sensor platform modified with clay-protein based composite nanoparticles (Mt-HSA NCs) was developed to be used in electrochemical cytosensing application for the first time. The nanocomposite synthesized with desolvation method was structurally clarified by various characterization methods. Then, the working electrode was constructed by modifying the surface of the disposable pencil graphite (PGE) with physical adsorption to perform a simple sensor system. The characterization studies proved that the Mt-HSA NCs modified surface had a biocompatible, hydrophilic and large surface area where cancer cells can easily attach to the surface. As a diagnostic method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which has become very popular in recent years, was carried out. The linearity range was found as from 1.5 x 10(2) to 7.5 x 10(6) breast cancer (MCF-7) cells and the limit of detection was calculated as 148 cells mL(-1). From these results, a simple, effortless, cost effective and rapid electrochemical impedimetric sensor system for the diagnosis of breast cancer was developed by examining the interaction of Mt-HSA NCs/PGE surface with MCF-7 cells.

AB Mercury is a bio-accumulative and toxic pollutant causing severe damages to human health and environment. Since Hg2+ is the most stable form of mercury, selective and sensitive Hg2+ detection is required. Though classical approaches can realize accurate Hg2+ detection, the complicated instruments and the time-consuming operations inevitably limit their on-site applications. Here, we design a smart Hg2+ detection approach using the fluorescence biosensor, the smartphone fluorescence microscope and the smartphone application for Hg2+ on site detection. Based on the thymine-Hg2+-thyrnine coordination chemistry, a selective and sensitive fluorescence biosensor is designed for capturing Hg2+ in aqueous solution; besides, a miniaturized smartphone fluorescence microscope for fluorescence signal collection and an image processing application for quantitative Hg2+ measurements are constructed. A highly specific detection of Hg2+ with a linear relation between 1 nM and 1 M with a limit of detection of 1 nM is obtained using the smart Hg2+ detection approach. Considering it can realize selective and sensitive quantitative Hg2+ measurements in high precision with simple operations and cost-effective system, it is believed the proposed smart Hg2+ detection approach owns great potentials in Hg2+ detection for routine uses at home and in the field.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials have triggered an intensive interest due to the fascinating physiochemical properties with the exceptional physical, optical and electrical characteristics that transpired from the quantum size effect of their ultra-thin structure. Among the family of 2D nanomaterials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) features distinct characteristics related to the existence of direct energy bandgap, which significantly lowers the leakage current and surpasses other 2D materials. In this overview, we expatiate the novel strategies to synthesize MoS2 that cover techniques such as liquid exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition, mechanical exfoliation, hydrothermal reaction, and Van Der Waal epitaxial growth on the substrate. We extend the discussion on the recent progress in biosensing applications of the produced MoS2, highlighting the important surface-to-volume of ultrathin MoS2 structure, which enhances the overall performance of the devices. Further, envisioned the missing piece with the current MoS2-based biosensors towards developing the future strategies.

AB Reducing background signal is an effective method to improve the sensitivity of amperometric immunosensors, which are significant in the detection of cancer. Herein, a novel immunosensor probe was synthesised using zeolitic imidazolate framework-hydroquinone-bovine serum albumin (ZIF-8-HQ-BSA). Based on the probe, an "off-on" strategy was applied in the immunosensor to amplify AI, the current signal "turn off and on". The ZIF-8-HQ-BSA probe initially showed little current signal since ZIF-8 and BSA exhibit poor conductivity. To amplify the current signal "turn on", the structure of ZIF-8 was broken after treatment with HCl, releasing hydroquinone to be absorbed by the polyaniline hydrogel substrate. Hydroquinone can produce a strong signal and also exhibits strong catalytic ability for H2O2 to further enhance the signal. Following this method, the immunosensing platform was used to detect cytokeratins antigen 21.1 (CYFRA21-1) in human serum and revealed a wide liner range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.65 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3), demonstrating good consistency with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Thus, the amperometric immunosensing platform discussed in this work has high potential for application in healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical devices.

AB Vibrio parahaemolyricus is one of the most important foodbome pathogens that cause various life-threatening diseases in human and animals. Here, we present a rapid detection platform for V. parahaemolyticus by combining loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and disposable electrochemical sensors based on screen printed graphene electrodes (SPGEs). The LAMP reactions using primers targeting V. parahaemolyticus toxR gene were optimized at an isothermal temperature of 65 degrees C, providing specific detection of V. parahaemolyticus within 45 min at the detection limit of 0.3 CFU per 25 g of raw seafood. The LAMP amplicons can be effectively detected using unmodified SPGEs, redox active molecules namely Hoechst-33258 and a portable potentiostat. Therefore, the proposed system is particularly suitable as a point-of-care device for on-site detection of foodbome pathogens.

AB Highly sensitive phenol biosensor was developed by using well-dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in enzyme solution and adding CNTs in enzyme electrodes. First, the intact CNTs were dispersed in aqueous tyrosinase (TYR) solution, and TYR molecules were precipitated and crosslinked to prepare the sample of enzyme adsorption, precipitation and crosslinking (EAPC). EAPC exhibited 10.5- and 5.4-fold higher TYR activity per mg of CNTs as compared to enzyme adsorption (EA) and enzyme adsorption/crosslinking (EAC), respectively. EAPC retained 29% of its initial activity after incubation at 40 degrees C for 128 h, while EA and EAC showed no residual activities, respectively. In biosensing a model phenolic compound of catechol, the sensitivities of EA, EAC and EAPC electrodes on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) were 34, 281 and 675 mu A/mM/cm(2), respectively. When 90 w/ w% CNTs were added to the enzyme electrodes, the sensitivities of EA, EAC, and EAPC electrodes were 146, 427, and 1160 mu A/mM/cm(2), respectively, and the EAPC electrode showed a 2.3-fold increase in sensitivity upon CNT addition. Catechol and phenol could also be detected by EAPC on the screen-printed electrode (SPE), with sensitivities of 1340 and 1170 mu A/mM/cm(2), respectively. The sensitivity of EAPC-SPE for phenol detection in the effluent from real municipal wastewater treatment plant was 1100 mu A/mM/cm(2). The sensitivity of EAPC-SPE retained 74% of its initial sensitivity after incubation at 40 degrees C for 12 h. The combination of EAPC immobilization and CNT addition has great potential for application in the development of sensitive enzyme biosensors for various analytes and phenols in water environments.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) quantification in biomedicine is valuable as inflammation biomarker but also in assays employing enzymes that generate or consume H2O2 linked to a specific biomarker. Optical H2O2 detection is typically performed through peroxidase-coupled reactions utilizing organic dyes that suffer, however, from poor stability/reproducibility and also cannot be employed in situ in dynamic complex cell cultures to monitor H2O2 levels in real-time. Here, we utilize enzyme-mimetic CeO2 nanocrystals that are sensitive to H2O2 and study the effect of H2O2 presence on their electronic and luminescent properties. We produce and dope with Eu3+ these particles in a single-step by flame synthesis and directly deposit them on Si and glass substrates to fabricate nanoparticle layers to monitor in real-time and in situ the H2O2 concentrations generated by Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates. Furthermore, the small CeO2:Eu3+ nanocrystals are combined in a single-step with larger, non-responsive Y2O3:Tb3+ nanoparticles during their double-nozzle flame synthesis to engineer hybrid luminescent nanoaggregates as ratiometric robust biosensors. We demonstrate the functionality of these biosensors by monitoring their response in the presence of a broad range of H2O2 concentrations in vitro from S. pneumoniae, highlighting their potential for facile real-time H2O2 detection in vitro in cell cultures.

AB A novel sandwich-like immunosensor was efficiently fabricated for detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with three dimensional sea-urchin-like PdAuCu nanocrystals (PdAuCu NCs)/ferrocene-grafted-polylysine (Fc-gPLL) as the label of secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) as the substrate material. Herein, PdAuCu NCs were directly synthesized with polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a growth-directing agent by a facile one-step aqueous method without any organic solvent. Meanwhile, Fc-g-PLL was obtained by covalent linkage of Fc with PLL via Schiff-base reaction. The well-dispersed PdAuCu NCs by Fc-g-PLL have the enlarged surface area, enhanced catalytic properties and superior biocompatibility to amplify the current signals. The resultant immunosensor shows linear relationship of the electrochemical responses with the CEA concentrations within a broader linear range (0.001-100.0 ng mL(-1)) and a lower detection limit (0.23 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3). Furthermore, the immunosensor was explored for practical assay of CEA in human serum samples with accredited results. The novel immunoassay provides a feasible platform for early medical diagnosis.

AB In this work, an aptamer was used as the target capturing agent and a trimetallic signal amplification strategy based on Ce-MOF@Au and AuPtRu NPs was demonstrated for the sensitive detection of TSP-i. Herein, the synthesized AuPtRu nanocomposite (AuPtRu NPs) not only acts as the catalyst for catalyzing hydrogen peroxide but also acts as a nanocarrier for capturing the -NH2 termination single strand DNA (Si) to obtain the signal probe (SP, AuPtRu nanocomposite/S1). Then, SP was efficiently linked into TSP-i aptamers with the addition of complementary linking strands to form M1 (SP/aptamer). The Ce-MOF@Au nanocomposites were obtained by in situ reduction and used as GCE electrode modification materials. The -NH2-modified capture probe (CP) DNA was immobilized on the surface of Ce-MOF@Au nanocomposites for hybridizing SP. In the presence of the target TSP-1, the aptamer recognizes the target and binds strongly so that SP is released from the prepared Ml and then hybridized with CP. When the detection solution contains an electrochemical matrix of H2O2, AuPtRu NPs can oxidize H2O2 to obtain an enhanced signal. Furthermore, the proposed aptasensor has a very low LOD of 0.13 fg mL(-1) TSP-1 in the detection range of 1 fg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1). Moreover, the proposed platform also has application implications for other potential targets.

AB Ion channel is a pore-forming membrane protein that allows ions to pass through the cell membrane, which is essential for the continuation of life. Analysis of ion channel characteristics at the single cell level will help to study the role of cellular heterogeneity in disease progression and cellular signaling processes. In this study, we fabricate a photocleavable and entropy-driven reaction based electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel activity on HEK293 cell. We employed an antibody-DNA1 to conjugate the hERG channel in the cell membrane via antibody-antigen reaction. The release of the DNA1 by photocleavable reaction will trigger an amplification reaction by using the Exonuclease III (Exo III) to generate intermediate DNA. In addition, two hairpin DNA (DNA3 and DNA4) was employed for the signal amplification. We well designed a toehold on DNA3 for intermediate DNA hybridization to form double-strand DNA that opens the DNA3 hairpin. The free DNA3 exposed the relocked toehold domain to open the DNA4. After the entropy-driven toehold-mediated displacement amplification reaction by using intermediate DNA, DNA4 hybridized with DNA3 effectively, making the ferrocene labeled on the 5'-termini DNA4 close to the Au electrode surface to produce the electrochemical response. Then, the displaced intermediate DNA was released from the cell surface into solution for the next entropy-driven reaction. After two steps amplification reaction, one ion channel triggered thousands of DNA3/DNA4 duplex on the biosensor surface. By using this biosensor, electrochemical curve of hERG ion channels on a single cell was obtained.

AB A new, non-enzymatic, low-cost sensor based on tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) for the analytical determination of H2O2 has been proposed. An economically viable electrochemical technique was employed for the synthesis of TeNPs based non-enzymatic H2O2 sensor. Thin films of TeNPs were successfully electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using [BMIM] [Ac] ionic liquid at 90 degrees C. The effect of deposition potential on the morphology, phase formation, and electrochemical characterisation of nanostructured Te films has been studied. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize the nanostructured Te films on Fro surface. The electro-catalytic performance of the proposed TeNPs/FTO sensor has been studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) in phosphate buffer (Argon saturated) in the absence and presence of H2O2. TeNPs/FTO fabricated at applied potential of -1.40 V showed an excellent electro-catalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction. The proposed TeNPs/FTO sensor shows an excellent sensitivity of 757 A mu M-1 cm(-2). The sensor possess good selectivity and stability with an excellent amperometric response time of about 5 s. The present study also demonstrates that TeNPs/FTO is a promising sensing material suitable for determination of H2O2 in practical samples.

AB An early and accurate diagnosis of a specific DNA mutations has a decisive role for effective treatment. Especially, when an immediate decision on treatment most needs to be made, the rapid and precise confirmation of clinical findings is vital. Herein, we show a new strategy for the gene mutation (BRAF c.1799T > A; p. V600E) identification using highly SERS-active and reproducible SERS substrate (photo-etched GaN covered with a thin layer of sputtered gold) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The detection is based on the conformation change (gauche -> trans) of the alkanethiol linker modifying the capture DNA during the hybridization process. The value of the intensity ratio of the nu(C S) bands of the trans and gauche conformer higher than 1.0 indicated the presence of mutation. The demonstrated new DNA SERS (bio)sensor is characterized by the low detection limit at the level of pg mu L-1, wide analytical range from 6.75 pg mu L-1 to 67.5 ng mu L-1 and high selectivity. The proposed bioactive platforms, based on nanostructured GaN substrates modified with thiolated ssDNA (single stranded DNA) can be successfully used in the analysis of clinical samples.

AB Fluorescent copper nanomaterials (CuNMs), including copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and copper nanoclusters (CuNCs), become more and more popular with the abundant raw materials and low cost. A wide range of applications has been explored due to their fascinating properties such as low toxicity, remarkable water solubility, facile synthesis, large Stokes shifts, and good biocompatibility. As a kind of genetic material, DNA exhibits its molecular recognition function and diversity. The marriage between CuNMs and DNA endows DNAtemplated CuNMs (DNA-CuNMs) with unique properties such as fluorescence, electrochemiluminescence and catalytic features. In this review, we summarize the synthesis and recent applications of DNA-CuNMs. Fluorescent CuNMs can be grown on various DNA scaffolds with special sequence design. T base plays an important role in the formation of CuNMs on DNA templates. These fluorescent DNA-CuNMs hold great prospect in logic gate construction, staining and biosensing of DNAs and RNAs, ions, proteins and enzymes, small molecules and so on.

AB Research in wearable electronics has paved the way for next-generation technology, sought to create point-of care biosensors that combine chemical sensing on a biocompatible platform with a broad range of applications in human health monitoring. Despite significant progress, the microspatial mechanical mismatch and fluid-impermeable interface presented between skin and the electronics create adscititious problems in device lamination, conformality, and long-term monitoring. Herein, we engineered a skin-inspired, deterministically patterned, electrochemical biosensor that can be fully integrated with the curvilinear surface of the human body, while mechanically adapting to the natural stresses applied to the skin and allowing the mass transfer of gas and fluids. In particular, we developed mechanically-compliant lattice-structured biosensors for the continuous evaluation of lactate and oxygen. Systematic studies of the sensor performance were evaluated with variations in polymeric membranes and its ability to withstand commonplace harsh, multiaxial stresses.

AB Salivary urea was reported to be a useful biomarker to reflect the blood urea nitrogen in chronic kidney disease patients. However, as a new biomarker, enormous clinical trials are required to define the intended-use and to verify the specification. In this report, we demonstrated a low-cost easy-operated real-time sensing system (optical fiber-urea-sensing, OFUS, system) to detect salivary urea. We aim to make the system easily reproduced by the community to stimulate abundant clinical tests worldwide. The OFUS system is composed of a simple three-dimensional printed tank to link with two optical fibers, one connecting with a commercial light-emitting diode to deliver the input light signal, the other connecting with a commercial cadmium sulfide photo-conductive cell to detect the sensing signal. To allow on-site detection without any sample pretreatment, only 1 mu l saliva is needed to be mixed with 10 mu l urease solution and 90 mu l pH indicator solution in the reaction tank and the detection time is only 20 s. A stable and reproducible calibration curve can be easily built with a detection range as 24-300 mg/dL. The OFUS system successfully detected saliva with added synthetic urea and samples from chronic kidney disease patients. A good agreement between the OFUS system and the commercial kit was obtained. A good correlation between salivary urea and the blood urea nitrogen was also confirmed.

AB Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a class and widespread applied point-of-care biosensor in the rapid monitoring field. To address the matched antibodies and antibody labeling dependence in the conventional LFIAs, in this work, an innovative label-free LFIA was proposed for the sensitive detection of Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) by introducing a new nanoparticles-bacteria-antibody sandwich strategy in the sensor. Surface positively charged nitrogen-rich carbon (pNC) nanoparticles, synthesized via calcination and etching reactions, were used as adsorbent to capture bacteria as well as for generating signals. In the presence of target pathogens, bacterial cells could combine with pNC through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding, then the complex would be captured specifically by the anti-bacteria monoclonal antibody (McAb) coated on the test line (T-line). With the accumulation of nanoparticles-bacteria, the color on T-line would be gradually deepened from nearly colorless to deep black. Importantly, the pNC-based immunoassay could exhibit high sensitivity for target pathogens detection with a linear range of 10(2)-10(8) cfu mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 10(2) cfu mL(-1). Furthermore, this system was validated preliminarily to screen S. enteritidis in different food samples with recoveries ranging from 85% to 110%. Taking advantages of simplicity, label-free, convenience, and sensitivity, the pNC-based LFIA has the application potential for pathogenic microorganisms monitoring in food safety and early clinical diagnosis fields.

AB A simple, convenient, and inexpensive method to fabricate optical fiber based biosensors which utilize periodic hole arrays in gold films for signal transduction is reported. The process of hole array formation mainly relies on self-assembly of hydrogel microgels in combination with chemical gold film deposition and subsequent transfer of the perforated film onto an optical fiber tip. In the fabrication process solely chemical wet lab techniques are used, avoiding cost-intensive instrumentation or clean room facilities. The presented method for preparing fiber optic plasmonic sensors provides high throughput and is perfectly suited for commercialization using batch processing. The transfer of the perforated gold film onto an optical fiber tip does not affect the sensitivity of the biosensor ((420 +/- 83) nm/refractive index unit (RIU)), which is comparable to sensitivities of sensor platforms based on periodic hole arrays in gold films prepared by significantly more complex methods. Furthermore, real-time and in-line immunoassay studies with a specially designed 3D printed flow cell are presented exploiting the presented optical fiber based biosensors.

AB A highly sensitive diagnostic system for determining low-density infections that are missed by conventional methods is necessary to detect the carriers of Plasmodium falciparum. A fluorescent blue-ray optical system with a polycarbonate scan disc was developed to detect P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs), and nine samples could be analyzed simultaneously. The cultured P. falciparum strain 3D7 was used to examine the potential of the system for diagnosing malaria. After an RBC suspension had been applied to the disc, the cells were dispersed on the disc by rotation. During the 10 min standing period to allow the RBCs to settle on the disc surface, the cells were simultaneously stained with nuclear fluorescence staining dye Hoechst 34580, which was previously adsorbed on the disc surface. RBCs were arranged on the disc surface as a monolayer by removing excess cells through momentary rotation. Over 1.1 million RBCs remained on the disc for fluorescence analysis. A portable, battery-driven fluorescence image reader was employed to detect fluorescence-positive RBCs for approximately 40 min. A good correlation between examination of Giemsa-stained RBCs by light microscopy and the developed system was demonstrated in the parasitemia range of 0.0001-1.0% by linear regression analysis (R2 = 0.99993). The limit of detection of 0.00020% and good reproducibility for parasitemia determination were observed. The ability of the developed system to detect sub-microscopic low-density Pf-iRBCs and provide accurate quantitative evaluation with easy operation was demonstrated.

AB This study describes an environmental biosensor for real time toxicity monitoring, which exploits high sensitivity of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) to variations in concentrations of electron donors and acceptors. Fast biosensor response to changes in total heavy metal concentration of a mining rock drainage was observed in laboratory tests with acceptable repeatability and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95-0.97. The biosensor response is attributed to interference of heavy metals with the activity of electroactive microorganisms. Biomolecular analysis of the anodic electroactive biofilms showed significant population differences between microbial populations of the biosensor exposed to heavy metals and a non-exposed (control) biosensor. Furthermore, the biosensor outputs were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.92) with the results of the Microtox toxicity assay. The results of this study contribute towards the development of a simple MFC-based biosensor capable of detecting, in real-time, changes in environmental conditions and providing a tool for on-site toxicity monitoring.

AB In the present work, for the first time we takes the advantages of chitosan-Nafion(Chit-Naf) composite as a highly conductive surface platform and a novel CNT-based signal amplification strategy to develop a lable-free impedimetricaptamer-based sensor for highly sensitive detection of As(III). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) investigations surprisingly revealed that the glassy carbon electrode(GC) electrode modified with Chit-Naf composite had higher electron transfer kinetics compared the bare GC, GC/Naf and GC/Chit electrodes, which promises a great potential as an efficient platform in construction of biosensing assays. In this work, we employed a signal amplification strategy based on carbon nanotube-bovine serum albumin(CNT-BSA) hybrid system, by which sensitivity and detection limit of the aptasensor for the detection of As(III) were obtained to be 100.82 Omega nM(-1) and a of 74 pM, respectively. This protocol provided one of the lowest limits of detection for As(III) on aptamer-based electrodes recently described in the literature. Moreover, the change of the optical absorptive properties of CNTs upon biorecognition interactions provides a way to detect the biorecognition process and thus allowed us to design an optical As(III) aptasensor using the UV-Vis spectroscopic method. The discrimination capability of the fabricated aptasensor for recognizing As(III) in the presence of other metal ions and a complex matrix of waste water samples was successfully investigated. This protocol provided a new method for sensitive detection of As(III) with considerable advantages in terms of reproducibility, selectivity, being mediator free and regenerability of the sensing interface.

AB The brain-computer interface (BCI) devices are of prime important for study of nervous system as well as diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. To meet the needs of the BCI devices in high-density integration and multi-functionalization, 3-dimensional (3D) drivable optrode array with laser diodes (LDs) coupled wave guides was developed. The unique device realizes the 3D integration of the optrodes and avoids fiber tangle and tissue heating by adopting LD coupled waveguide structure. Besides, the postoperative position adjustment of the optrode array was achieved by integrating with a 3D printed micro-drive. Most importantly, high-resolution neural stimulations and recordings were achieved for study of working memory related neural circuits in four brain regions of mice including prelimbic cortex (PrL), mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), dorsal medial caudate nucleus (dmCP) and posterior motor cortex 2 (pM2). The results indicate that this novel device is promising for the research of complex neural networks.

AB By controlling target-induced signal quencher release, a label-free and modification-free microfluidic paper based photoelectrochemical analytical device (mu-PAD) for cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) detection was designed for the first time. To achieve it, cellulose paper based single-crystalline three-dimensional aloe like TiO2 arrays (PSATs) were firstly fabricated as the electron transporting material, providing direct pathways for the charge carriers transfer, and subsequently coupled with CdS to form PSATs/CdS heterojunction for extending the solar spectrum response. Meanwhile, positive charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) were prepared as the nanocarrier to efficient entrap the Cu2+ which could be regarded as signal quencher due to their reaction with CdS to form CuxS. Single stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), which could bind specifically with the target of cTnI, were then introduced to couple with the PMSNs and used as the bio-gate to encapsulate the signal quencher of Cu2+, endowing the functional PMSNs with responsiveness to cTnl. When the cTnl existed, the ssDNAs were dissociated from PMSNs due to the formation of cTnl-ssDNAs complexes, triggering controllable release of the trapped Cu2+, and further decreasing the photocurrent signal caused by the formation of Cu S. Accordingly, the concentration of cTnI could be accurately quantified via the photocurrent, realizing the target-induced modification-free mu-PAD assay. We believe this work could provide an ingenious idea to construct the easy-to-use novel modification-free mu-PAD.

AB In this paper several advances were implemented for glycoprofiling of prostate specific antigen (PSA), what can be applied for better prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostics in the future: 1) application of Au nanoshells with a magnetic core (MP@silica@Au); 2) use of surface plasmons of Au nanoshells with a magnetic core for spontaneous immobilization of zwitterionic molecules via diazonium salt grafting; 3) a double anti-fouling strategy with integration of zwitterionic molecules on Au surface and on MP@silica@Au particles was implemented to resist non-specific protein binding; 4) application of anti-PSA antibody modified Au nanoshells with a magnetic core for enrichment of PSA from a complex matrix of a human serum; 5) direct incubation of anti-PSA modified MP@silica@Au with affinity bound PSA to the lectin modified electrode surface. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) signal was enhanced 43 times integrating Au nanoshells with a magnetic core compared to the biosensor without them. This proof-of-concept study shows that the biosensor could detect PSA down to 1.2 fM and at the same time to glycoprofile such low PSA concentration using a lectin patterned biosensor device. The biosensor offers a recovery index of 108%, when serum sample was spiked with a physiological concentration of PSA (3.5 ng mL(-1)).

AB Cortisol is an hormone that regulates blood pressure, glucose levels and carbohydrate metabolism in humans. Abnormal secretion of cortisol can cause various symptoms closely linked to psychological and physical health. In this study, high-performance field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors for cortisol detection were fabricated from N -doped multidimensional carbon nanofibers. Nanofiber morphology was controlled by tailoring the pressure conditions during vapor deposition polymerization (VDP). Thereafter, conductive channels of FET were completed by thermal annealing, acid treatment, and antibody attachment. Changes associated with chemical processes were characterized by various instruments. The resulting transducers exhibited a rapid response toward cortisol molecules with accurate selectivity, stable reusability, and high sensitivity. Minimum detection level were as low as 100 aM with a wide linear detection range of 100 aM to 10 nM due to the large surface area of the transducer and a correspondingly high number of antibody labels. The response and applicability of these cortisol biosensors were also assessed using saliva as a test matrix.

AB Flexible neural probes have been pursued previously to minimize the mechanical mismatch between soft neural tissues and implants and thereby improve long-term performance. However, difficulties with insertion of such probes deep into the brain severely restricts their utility. We describe a solution to this problem using gallium (Ga) in probe construction, taking advantage of the solid-to-liquid phase change of the metal at body temperature and probe shape deformation to provide temperature-dependent control of stiffness over 5 orders of magnitude. Probes in the stiff state were successfully inserted 2 cm-deep into agarose gel "brain phantoms" and into rat brains under cooled conditions where, upon Ga melting, they became ultra soft, flexible, and stretchable in all directions. The current 30 mu m-thick probes incorporated multilayer, deformable microfluidic channels for chemical agent delivery, electrical interconnects through Ga wires, and high-performance electrochemical glutamate sensing. These PDMS-based microprobes of ultra-large tunable stiffness (ULTS) should serve as an attractive platform for multifunctional chronic neural implants.

AB Detection of viral infection is commonly performed using serological techniques like the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibody responses. Such assays may also be used to determine the infection phase based on isotype prevalence. However, ELISAs demonstrate limited sensitivity and are difficult to perform at the point of care. Here, we present a novel technique for label-free, rapid detection of ultra-low concentrations of virus specific antibodies. We have developed a simple, robust capacitive biosensor using microwires coated with Zika or Chikungunya virus envelope antigen. With little discernable nonspecific binding, the sensor can detect as few as 10 antibody molecules in a small volume (10 molecules/30 mu L) within minutes. It can also be used to rapidly, specifically, and accurately determine the isotype of antigen-specific antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate that anti-Zika virus antibody can be sensitively and specifically detected in dilute mouse serum and can be isotyped using the sensor. Overall, our findings suggest that our microwire sensor platform has the potential to be used as a reliable, sensitive, and inexpensive diagnostic tool to detect immune responses at the point of care.

AB This investigation develops a label-free and reagentless aptasensor, based on a capacitive transducer with simple face-to-face electrode pairs. The electrode pairs of the transducer are composed of a gold electrode and an indium tin oxide film with micrometer separation with a double-side polyethylene terephthalate tape. Aptamers and 1-dodecanethiol are modified to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the gold electrode surfaces, and function as bio-recognition elements and preventers of non-specific protein binding, respectively. Electrochemical characterization results indicate that the SAM also forms an effective insulating layer, which is sufficient for capacitive sensing. The feasibility of the capacitive biosensor is validated using thrombin as a model analyte. The ultra-small value changes of capacitance originating from thrombin binding with the aptamers modified on the biosensor were measured with a home-made capacitance measuring circuit based on switched capacitor (SC) technology. The developed biosensor has detection limits of 1 pM and 10 pM of thrombin in phosphate buffered saline and mimic serum solution, respectively. The linear range for thrombin detection in human serum solution is from 10 pM to 1 mu M, with a regression coefficient of 0.98. Additionally, the proposed aptasensor does not have significant levels of non-specific binding of bovine serum albumin and human serum albumin. Accordingly, the combination of SC and SAM bringing capacitive transduction at the forefront of ultrasensitive label-free and reagentless biosensing devices, particularly for point-of-care clinical analysis, which adopts small numbers of biological samples with low analyte concentrations.

AB Turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TIIA) is a classic immunodiagnostic method that has been extensively used for biomarker detection. However, the low sensitivity of this technique hinders its applications in the early diagnosis of diseases. Here, a new concept, optofluidic laser TIIA (OFL-TIIA), is proposed and demonstrated for sensitive protein detection. In contrast to the immunoreaction in traditional TIIA, in which the single-pass laser loss is detected, the immunoreaction in the OFL-TIIA method takes place in a laser cavity, which considerably increases the loss induced by antigen-antibody complexes (AACs) via the amplification effect of the laser. A commercial IgG TIIA kit was selected as a demonstrative model to characterize the performance of OFL-TIIA. A wide dynamic range of five orders of magnitude with an exceptional limit of detection (LOD) (1.8 x 10(-10) g/L) was achieved. OFL-TIIA is a fast, sensitive, and low-cost immunoassay with a simple homogeneous and wash-free process and low-volume sample consumption, thus providing a new detection platform for disease diagnostics.

AB A novel electrochemical immunosensor was proposed for the detection of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. Due to thionine (Thi) possessing electroactive redox properties, a one-step approach was utilized to synthesize a reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylene-thionine-Au (rGO-TEPA-Thi-Au) nanocomposite at room temperature using the synergistic effect of Thi and rGO-TEPA towards HAuC14. We obtained the excellent matrix material, which immobilized more primary antibody MCP-1-Ab(1) on rGO-TEPA on a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). To further enhance the sensitivity of the sensor, a novel signal generation and amplification strategy was developed for detection. RuPdPt trimetallic nanoalloy particles (RuPdPt TNPs), a novel nanomaterial, were synthesized by a one-pot method, displayed a uniform morphology as well as good electrochemical activity and bound with the secondary antibodies against MCP-1 via the Pt-NH2 bond. Most importantly, RuPdPt TNPs have a significant ability to catalyze H2O2 to produce an electron. The electrochemical signal was highly amplified because the electrochemical signal was primarily derived from the synergistic catalysis of H2O2 by RuPdPt TNPs and recorded by chronoamperometry. Under the optimal conditions, this newly designed biosensor exhibited sensitive detection of MCP-1 in the range from 20 fg mL(-1) to 1000 pg mL(-1), with a detection limit of 8.9 fg mL(-1) (based on a S/N = 3). Additionally, the designed immunosensor showed acceptable selectivity, reproducibility and stability. This immunosensor is a promising strategy for analyzing clinical serum samples in the future.

AB Liver diseases represent a vastly underestimated and historically neglected public health problem, disproportionately affecting those in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). Patients on hepatotoxic medications, such as HIV and TB medications, need consistent monitoring of liver function as part of their standard of care. In high resource settings, this is often the case, but in LMICs traditional methods fail due to high cost and lack of proper equipment, supplies and trained personnel. To address this gap in technology and patient care, we have developed a quantitative, electrochemical assay capable of quantifying levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a primary biomarker associated with liver function. We can quantify ALT with increased sensitivity (1.53 nA/(U/L*mm(2)) and over a wide, linear concentration range (40-1990 U/L). The assay demonstrated in this study can be used to overcome several pressing challenges associated with effective, timely treatment of liver disease in LMICs.

AB A novel p-type semiconductor-based cathodic "signal-on" photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was proposed for highly sensitive and selective detection of chloramphenicol (CAP). The photocathode was fabricated with hierarchical porous flower-like Bi-BiOI@C composite synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal method using glucose as both green reductant and carbon precursor. Due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Bi and high-conductivity of carbon, the composite exhibited an enhanced cathodic photocurrent as compared with pure BiOI or Bi-BiOI. When CAP-binding aptamer was immobilized as recognition element on Bi-BiOI@C modified electrode, a cathodic PEC aptasensor showing specific "signal-on" response to CAP was constructed. Some influencing factors such as coating amount of Bi-BiOI@C suspension, applied bias potential, and aptamer concentration were studied. Under the optimum conditions, the cathodic photocurrent of the constructed PEC aptasensor increased linearly with CAP concentration from 2 to 250 nM, with a detection limit (3S/N) of 0.79 nM. The proposed sensor was successfully applied to the determination of CAP in pharmaceutical tablet, eye drop and lake water samples.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been applied as biomarkers and better detection of their expression profiles plays important roles in early diagnosis of cancers. In this work, a simple dual-signal amplification strategy has been used to construct a novel nanosensor on single Au nanowire electrodes (SAuNWEs) for miRNA-16 detection based on the "signal-on" and "signal-off" features during hybridization/de-hybridization process. The ferrocenelabeled aptamer capture probe (Fc-CP-16) is designed to hybridize with thiolated methylene blue-labeled DNA probe (MB-CP) on SAuNWE to form duplex DNA, and the addition of miRNA-16 can lead to the dissociation of duplex structure due to the highly matched sequences between miRNA-16 and Fc-CP-16. The remaining MB-CP can thus tend to recover its hairpin structure at the presence of Mg2+ through the hybridization of its complementary sequences. During this hybridization/de-hybridization process, the changes of Fc and MB oxidation peaks can be recorded, and there has a linear relationship between the sum of dual-signal changes (Delta I = Delta I-MB +vertical bar Delta I-FC vertical bar) and the logarithm of miRNA-16 concentrations, which can be used to detect miRNA-16. Including miRNA extraction, the dual-signal amplification strategy for miRNA sensing assay was carried out about 2h for the detection in real samples. This novel nanosensor has small dimension, good selectivity, rapid response and regeneration ability, which can satisfy the need for early cancer marker detection in cells/organelles.

AB Electroporation has been a widely established method for delivering DNA and other material into cells in vitro. Conventional electroporation infrastructure is typically immobile, non-customizable, non-transparent regarding the characteristics of output pulses, and expensive. Here, we describe a portable electroporator for DNA delivery into bacterial cells that can quickly be reconstructed using 3D desktop printing and off-the-shelf components. The device is light weight (700 g), small (70 x 180 x 210 mm) and extremely low-cost (< EUR 130). We provide the electrical circuitry and a detailed parts list for rebuilding the device. We characterize the properties of generated pulses and apply the system for gene delivery into bacterial Dh5a cells. We analyze the transformation efficiency based on the optical density of cell suspensions at 595 nm and on quantitative analysis of images obtained from bacterial cell-grown agar plates using colony forming units as well as confluence as indicators. We demonstrate time-dependency of the transformation efficiency using single pulses of 500 V between 1 and 1000 ms duration and we show that commercially available electroporation cuvettes of 1 mm gap size reveal higher transformation rates compared to cuvettes with 2 mm gap. We benchmark the transformation efficiency obtained using our platform with data from a heat shock-based transformation protocol and with data from a commercially available electroporator and show that our system reveals comparable results as the other techniques in the applied configurations. While this work focuses on genetic manipulation of bacterial cells, the device may also be applicable for delivery of genetic material small molecule or nanomaterials into other cell types, including mammalian cells.

AB Most cancer diagnoses rely on biomarkers detection. This could be improved if directly conducted in suspicious cancer spots, preventing the need for biopsy. Lung cancer remains a perfect study-case for such a development, as it is generally detected at advanced stage and is in the need for early diagnosis techniques. To this aim, we have designed a minimally invasive catheter-embedded biosensor. It combines a specific grating structure photo imprinted in a telecommunication-grade optical fiber and an overlay made of a thin metal coating on which receptors are grafted, yielding plasmonic coupling. Our optrode targets a type of cytokeratins, overexpressed at the surface of cancer cells. It was assayed ex vivo in resected lung tissues collected from a dozen of patients. Biosensing responses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, conducted on the same samples. In addition to accurate biosensing, our gratings inherently enable force-sensing features, which also allow a fine positioning of the probe in the tissue. Finally, the in vivo navigation of the bronchoscope-embedded sensor was validated into pig lungs. These achievements are a critical milestone towards the development of this micro/nano biosensor as a cost-effective and weakly invasive diagnostic tool for applications in areas of critical access such as brain, liver or prostate.

AB Herein, a label-free and double recognition-amplification (LDRA) strategy for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection was developed, based on a new designed dual-function messenger probe (DMP) coalescing with DNA tetrahedron probes (DTPs) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The DMP possess dual-function to replace CEA for specific interface hybridization and initiate hybridization chain reaction. The interfacial hybridization event was quantitatively converted to an electrochemical signal by using hemin/G-quadruplex (h-Gx) formed after the hybridization chain reaction. Self-assembled DNA tetrahedron probes, which were readily decorated on an electrode surface as a scaffold with rigid support and ordered orientation, enabled the highly efficient strands hybridization and greatly increased target accessibility as well as significantly decreased noise. The proposed assay integrated dual recognition processes and HCR signal amplification processes, achieving the identification of low concentration of CEA as detection limit of 18.2 fg(-1) mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and wider linearity range of 0.0001 ng mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) A new electrochemical sensing method was proposed for CEA detection and used in real clinical samples. The obtained results were good consistency with those of clinical diagnosis.

AB Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) continue to represent a significant chemical threat to humans due to exposures from their use as weapons, their potential storage hazards, and from their continued use agriculturally. Existing methods for detection include ELISA and mass spectrometry. The new approach presented here provides an innovative first step toward a portable OP quantification method that surmounts conventional limitations involving sensitivity, selectivity, complexity, and portability. DNA affinity probes, or aptamers, represent an emerging technology that, when combined with a mix-and-read, free-solution assay (FSA) and a compensated interferometer (CI) can provide a novel alternative to existing OP nerve agent (OPNA) quantification methods. Here it is shown that FSA can be used to rapidly screen prospective aptamers in the biological matrix of interest, allowing the identification of a 'best-in-class' probe. It is also shown that combining aptamers with FSA-CI enables quantification of the OPNA metabolites, Sarin (NATO designation "G-series, B", or GB) and Venomous Agent X (VX) acids, rapidly with high selectivity at detection limits of sub-10 pg/mL in 25% serum (by volume in PBS). These results suggest there is potential to directly impact diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of emergency response testing methods by both simplifying sample preparation procedures and making a benchtop reader available for OPNA metabolite quantification.

AB This article is clearly presenting the development of a biosensor for human factor IX (FIX) to diagnose the blood clotting deficiency, a so-called 'Royal disease' using an interdigitated electrode (IDE) with the zinc oxide surface modification. Gold nano-urchins (GNUs) with 60 nm in diameter was integrated into a streptavidin-biotinylated aptamer strategy to enhance the active surface area. Two different comparative studies have been done to validate the system to be practiced in the current work holds with a higher capability for the high-performance sense. Whereby, the presence and absence of GNUs in the aptasensing system for FIX interaction were investigated using the amperometric measurement, using a linear sweep voltage of 0-2 V at 0.01 V step voltage. The detection limit was 6 pM based on 3 sigma calculation when GNUs integrated aptamer assay was utilized for FIX detection, which shows 8 folds sensitivity enhancement comparing the condition in the absence of GNU and 50 folds higher than sensitive radio-isotope and surface plasmon resonance assays. Albeit, the surface and molecular characterizations were well demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, 3D nanoprofilometry and further supports were rendered by UV Vis spectroscopy and Enzyme-linked apta-sorbent assay (ELASA). Furthermore, the spiking experiment was done by FIX-spikes in human blood serum in order to demonstrate the stability with a higher non-fouling.

AB This work reported curcumin quenched electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior of luminol with H2O2 as coreactant. To achieve excellent ECL signal, luminol was anchored on Au functionalized MoS2/Bi2S3 nanorods (Lurninol-Au@MoS2/Bi2S3), which not only exhibited super catalysis for H2O2 decomposition to enhance the ECL intensity of luminol/H2O2 system, but also offered a satisfying substrate material for grafting more Au nanoparticles via Au -S binding which was used to adsorb luminol and primary antibodies. As an antioxidant, the hydrophobicity of curcumin limited its bioavailability. Herein, curcumin was conjugated with ZnO nanomaterials (ZnO-CR) to increase its dispersity in water which can make it more bioavailable. Moreover, the possible quenching mechanism between luminol/H2O2 system and ZnO-CR was ascribed to the consumption of superoxide radical (02) and energy transfer. The consumption amount of O-2(center dot-) was calculated to be 1.2092 mu M/mL through superoxide anion free radical detection kit. Besides, polydopamine was self -polymerized on the surface of ZnO-CR (PDA@ZnO-CR) to anchor secondary antibodies. In optimum parameter, the ECL immunosensor exhibited excellent performance for amyloid-beta(A beta) proteins detection with a wide detection range from 0.05 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 21 fg mL(-1) (S/N = 3).

AB Despite huge successes achieved by strand displacement amplification (SDA) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in biomolecules sensing, the strategy of combination of SDA and AuNPs-based dynamic light scattering (DLS) for a biomolecule sensing is unexplored. Here we developed a non-invasive, SDA-based DLS method for the diagnosis of bladder cancer by detecting telomerase activity in human urine. In the presence of telomerase, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer was elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG)n, and the resulting product triggers SDA between the hairpin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the Primer. The SDA product can be recognized by the oligonucleotide-modified AuNPs probes, resulting in DLS measurable AuNPs aggregation. The assay displayed a detection limit of 3 MCF-7 cells with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in a dynamic range of 5-1000 cells. The method was simple, reliable and has been successfully applied in the detection of telomerase in urine with good accuracy, selectivity and reproducibility. Moreover, only urine samples from bladder cancer patients induced a significant change in the average hydrodynamic diameter, indicating practical applicability of the method for the non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer.

AB Seventy years after its discovery, the zika virus emerged in Brazil and spread rapidly throughout the Americas, bringing unusual complications such as microcephaly. The World Health Organization classifies zika as the most harmful viral disease today and considers the development of new diagnostic methods for zika and related diseases, such as dengue, urgent. Although there are tests to identify both infections, current diagnostic methods are slow, nonspecific, and costly. This study describes an impedimetric electrochemical DNA biosensor for label free detection of zika virus. Disposable electrodes were fabricated by thermal evaporation on polyethylene terephthalate substrates covered with a nanometric gold layer manufactured in three-contact configurations. The disposable, evaporated electrodes were morphologically characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The electrode surface was characterized by electroanalytical techniques. Genetic sequences of primers and complementary capture probes were designed based on analysis of the zika and dengue virus genomes. The biosensor used a three-contact electrode to identify DNA sequences in a drop of sample, and for detection of zika virus sequences, it allowed for direct reading of the hybridization event without labeling on disposable electrodes and with a 1.5 h response time. In this system, impedance measurements indicated a limit of detection of 25.0 +/- 1.7 nM. The developed biosensors showed selectivity for zika in the synthetic DNA assays, and therefore, are promising for clinical analysis.

AB Herein, a near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive imprinting biosensor with excellent conductivity and tensibility was designed by incorporation graphene oxide/polyaniline (GO/PANI) with thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel (PNiPAAm) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In this design, polyaniline (PANI) nanofiber modifies with graphene oxide (GO) acts as a physically cross-linker, providing hydrogen bond interaction with amide groups in the PNiPAAm. It is functioned to enhance the strength of imprinted hydrogel networks. Thus, the imprinted hydrogel biosensor incorporation of GO/PANI nanocomposite exhibited excellent mechanical performance and NIR light-responsive characteristic. As a NIR radiation trigger gate, the obtained biosensor not only has a function of IR-based cleaning toward bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the absence of elution solution, but also a function of proteins releasing and uptaking, basing on reversibly conformational changes with 808 run NIR light. Simultaneously, the responsive processes were electronically monitored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the proposed GO/PANI nanocomposite imprinted biosensor exhibited excellent characteristics along with high conductivity and tensibility, long-term stability, and wide linear range, performing great promising for preparing remote NIR light-driven extraction protein smart devices.

AB A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was successfully constructed for N-6-methyladenine (m(6)A) detection based on the photoactive materials of black titanium dioxide (B-TiO2) and bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3) and the signal amplification unit of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-doped metal organic framework (MOF). The Bi2O3/B-TiO2/ITO electrode was first fabricated, then decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) which provided sites for anchoring m(6)A antibodies. After the capture of m(6)A via immunoreaction with the antibody, the Zr-based metal organic framework (UiO-66)-[Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) compound was further attached specifically to the phosphate group of m(6)A. With visible light irradiation, a large and stable photocurrent response was produced in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). Under optimized experimental conditions, the linear range of the PEC biosensor was 0.05-30 nM, with a low detection limit of 0.0167 nM (S/N = 3). This method showed high specificity, selectivity, stabilization and repeatability. Moreover, it was successfully used for the detection of m(6)A in rice seedling leaves that had been subjected to heavy metal treatment during their development.

AB An electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor was developed for the detection of the neuropeptide Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH) based on the immobilization of half-antibody fragments on gold nanoparticles (AuNp). Then, the optimal conditions for the obtainment of AuNp through electroplating on a bare gold electrode were studied. The results showed that the obtainment of AuNp at a fixed potential of -0.2 V for 330 s, at 80 degrees C and 2.10-3 mol.L-1 of HAuCl4 generates an adequate nanostructured surface and is a highly reproducible method. Also, the optimal conditions for immobilizing the half-antibody on AuNp were studied. The interaction of the CRH with the recognition layer of the immobilized half-antibody on the nanostructured surface was carried out by incubation at 4 degrees C for 2 h. A dissolution of [Fe(CN)(6)](4)/[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) as a redox probe was used to study the electrochemical responses of the nanostructured surface and the immobilization processes of the half -antibody and detection of CRH, using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An immunosensor was obtained for the specific detection of CRH, within a range of 10.0-80.0 mu g mL(-1), with a limit of detection of 2.7 mu g mL(-1) and a limit of quantification of 9.2 mu g mL(-1) . Additionally, the association constant between the CRH and the immobilized half -antibody was calculated at 1.96.10(5) M-1.

AB Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) performance and cytotoxicity of CdTe quantum dots (QDs)-based nanocomposites and its possible application for ECL immunoassay were investigated. Two types of CdTe-based nano composites, i.e., SiO2-coated CdTe (CdTe@SiO2) and CdTe-functionalized SiO2 (SiO2@CdTe), were synthesized and comprehensively compared in regarding of the cytotoxicity and ECL performance. The in vitro cytotoxicity of SiO2@CdTe and CdTe@SiO2 nanoparticles was assessed in L02 cells using standard CCK-8 assay, and their ECL performance was investigated by constructing sandwiched immunosensor using SiO2@CdTe and CdTe@ SiO2 as tags for the labelled antibody, respectively. The results showed that CdTe@SiO2 exhibited much lower cytotoxicity and a higher ECL intensity than SiO2@CdTe. Taking the analysis of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as an example, the ECL immunosensor using CdTe@SiO2 as an emitter was proved to have a wide linear dynamic range from 1.0 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.22 pg mL(-1) (S/N ratio of 3). The ECL immunosensor also demonstrated satisfactory recovery and excellent reproducibility and stability, indicating that this method has prospects in practical application in the clinical diagnosis of AFP.

AB Stimuli-responsive nanotheranostic systems, integrated with diagnosis and treatment features, have recently emerged and attracted much interest. However, most of the research mainly focuses on the novelty of nano materials, and undervalues the significance of single-particle characterization which can provide detailed physical and biochemical information for performance evaluation and heterogeneity assessment. Due to the small particle size and low content of functional modules, high throughput and multiparameter analysis of individual stimuli-responsive nanoparticles still remains challenging. Here, fabricating a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive liposome (Lipo@BODIPY11) and taking it as an example, we report the development of a strategy for theranostic nanoparticle characterization by a laboratory-built nano-flow cytometer (nFCM). Coincident detection of light scatter and fluorescence intensity provided a measure for liposome quality assessment. Theranostic performance referred to stimuli-responsive capability and drug release behavior upon ROS treatment were obtained in minutes. Besides, the dissociation of functional modules from liposomes and the formation of aggregates under high modification degree were revealed, which was otherwise masked by ensemble -averaged methods. At last, consistent results were also observed in intracellular studies. This nFCM-based method provides a comprehensive approach for the proof-of-principle study, heterogeneity assessment and quality control of biochemical nanosensors and theranostic nanomaterials.

AB Here we report a highly selective and ultrasensitive DNA biosensor based on electrochemical atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) signal amplification and "Click Chemistry". The DNA biosensor was prepared by immobilizing thiol and azide modified hairpin DNAs on gold electrode surface. In the presence of target DNAs (T-DNA), hairpin probes hybridized with T-DNAs to form a duplex DNA, and the ring of hairpin DNA was opened to make azide groups accessible at 3' ends. "Click reactions" proceeded between the azide and propargyl-2-bromoisobutyrate (PBIB) to initiate the ATRP reaction which brought a large number of ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate (FMMA) on the electrode surface. The amount of FMMA was proportional to the concentration of T-DNA and quantified by square wave voltammetry. Combining ATRP signal amplification with "Click Chemistry", the optimized DNA biosensor was capable of detecting 0.2 aM. T-DNA. The preliminary application of the developed DNA biosensor was demonstrated by detecting target DNA in spiked serum samples. The developed DNA biosensor shows great promise for the detection of gene biomarkers.

AB A new electrochemical sensor was fabricated for the sensitive and selective detection of acetaminophen (AP), based on a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with poly caffeic acid (PCA) and Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800 using an electro-polymerization method. The carbon material of Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800 derived from bimetal-organic framework was synthesized by one-step pyrolysis method. Then, the as-prepared materials and the corresponding fabricated sensors were fully characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET, SEM, TEM and XPS analyses, In addition, the electron transfer abilities of the modified sensors were investigated by CV and EIS. Subsequently, the parameters of polymerization time, pH value and scan rate were systematically studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the desirable linear relationships were obtained between the peak current and the AP concentration at the PCA@ Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800/GCE sensor with a detection limit of 0.0291 mu M. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the proposed sensor can be attributed to the good electrocatalytic activity of PCA, the large surface area and high conductivity of Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800 as well as the synergistic effect of PCA and Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800. Moreover, the fabricated sensor was also successfully applied for the determination of AP in pharmaceutical dosage forms and human urine sample, and satisfactory recoveries were obtained.

AB We fabricate a novel electrochemical biosensor based on the specific thymine-Hg2+ -thymine (T-Hg2+ -T) base pair for the highly sensitive detection of mercury ions (Hg2+) and utilize toluidine blue (TB) as a redox indicator that is combined with a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for signal amplification. The dandelion-like CuO (D-CuO) microspheres that were assembled using Au nanoparticles were first introduced as support materials, which produced more active sites for the thiolated probe (P1) combination. Then, the presence of Hg2+ induced P1 to hybridize with the other oligonucleotide (P2) through Hg2+-mediated T-H2+-T complexes. In addition, the partial sequence of P2 acted as an initiator sequence, which led the two hairpin DNA (H1 and H2) strands to collectively form the extended double-strand DNA through the HCR process on the electrode surface. TB was employed to interact with the double strands and produce an efficient electrochemical signal. The proposed strategy combined the amplification of the HCR and the inherent redox activity of TB and utilized D-CuO/Au composites, which exhibited high sensitivity for Hg2+ determination. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed biosensor showed a prominent response for Hg2+, including a linear range from 1 pM to 100 nM and a detection limit of 0.2 pM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the new biosensor proved its potential application for trace Hg2+ determination in environmental water samples.

AB Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based DNA biosensors have considered as excellent, fast and ultrasensitive sensing technique which relies on the fingerprinting ability to produce molecule specific distinct spectra. Unlike conventional fluorescence based strategies SERS provides narrow spectral bandwidths, fluorescence quenching and multiplexing ability, and fitting attribute with short length probe DNA sequences. Herein, we report a novel and PCR free SERS based DNA detection strategy involving dual platforms and short DNA probes for the detection of endangered species, Malayan box turtle (MBT) (Cuora amboinensis). In this biosensing feature, the detection is based on the covalent linking of the two platforms involving graphene oxide-gold nanoparticles (GO-AuNPs) functionalized with capture probe 1 and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with capture probe 2 and Raman dye (Cy3) via hybridization with the corresponding target sequences. Coupling of the two platforms generates locally enhanced electromagnetic field 'hot spot', formed at the junctions and interstitial crevices of the nanostructures and consequently provide significant amplification of the SEAS signal. Therefore, employing the two SEAS active substrates and short-length probe DNA sequences, we have managed to improve the sensitivity of the biosensors to achieve a lowest limit of detection (LOD) as low as 10 fM. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor exhibited sensitivity even for single nucleotide base-mismatch in the target DNA as well as showed excellent performance to discriminate closely related six non-target DNA sequences. Although the developed SERS biosensor would be an attractive platform for the authentication of MBT from diverse samples including forensic and/or archaeological specimens, it could have universal application for detecting gene specific biomarkers for many diseases including cancer.

AB The emergence of DNA origami greatly accelerated the development of DNA nanotechnology. A thorough understanding of origami thermodynamics is very important for both fundamental studies and practical applications. These thermodynamic transitions usually take place in several seconds or even less, and are very difficult to monitor by conventional methods. Numerous tests are required to characterize the origami molecules behaviors at different temperatures, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, an axially distributed temperature gradient along a capillary was formed in a spatially varying temperature field. In such a temperature gradient, the origami molecules thermodynamic processes occur and remain stable at every position along the capillary's microchannel. It looks like the time of the thermodynamic process is frozen along the microchannel. With this method, the origami molecule's thermodynamic characteristics at different temperatures can be obtained in a single experiment, and rapid processes can be monitored with ease by conventional methods for an adequate time period at low cost. In order to show its potential abilities, this method has been demonstrated in applications which the origami's assembly, denaturation and strand displacement are carry out in a flowing or stationary solution.

AB A ratiometric fluorescence probe based on carbon dots (CDs) was developed for discriminative and highly sensitive detection of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in human whole blood. When o-phenylenediamine (OPD) was oxidized by Cu2+, the product 2,3-diaminophenazine (oxOPD) could effectively quench the fluorescence of CDs at 460 run due to the inner filter effect and gave rise to a new emission peak at 570 nm. The AChE or BChE catalyzed hydrolysis reaction of acetylthiocholine or butyrylthiocholine to generate thiocholine, whose sulfhydryl group strongly captured Cu2+ to inhibit the oxidization of OPD, thus effectively preserving the natural fluorescence emission of CDs. The resulting fluorescence intensity ratio served as the signal output of the probe for cholinesterases (ChEs) activity sensing. The activities of AChE and BChE were determined to range from 0.2 to 14.0 U L-1 and from 0.1 to 5.0 U L-1, with detection limits of 0.1 U L-1 and 0.04 U L-1, respectively. Additionally, the IC(50)of tacrine and ethopropazine for the inhibition of AChE and BChE were estimated to be 29.8 nM and 132.6 nM, respectively. Moreover, the probe was successfully applied to the discriminative determination of AChE and BChE in human whole blood without any pretreatment. These results suggested that the proposed strategy provided a discriminative, sensitive and robust analytical platform for ChEs clinical diagnostics and drug screening.

AB In this mini review, we will briefly introduce the rapid development of DNA conformational polymorphism in biosensing field, including canonical DNA duplex, triplex, quadruplex, DNA origami, as well as more functionalized DNAs (aptamer, DNAzyme etc.). Various DNA structures are adopted to play important roles in sensor construction, through working as recognition receptor, signal reporter or linking staple for signal motifs, etc. We will mainly summarize their recent developments in DNA-based electrochemical and fluorescent sensors. For the electrochemical sensors, several types will be included, e.g. the amperometric, electrochemical impedance, electrochemiluminescence, as well as field-effect transistor sensors. For the fluorescent sensors, DNA is usually modified with fluorescent molecules or novel nanomaterials as report probes, excepting its core recognition function. Finally, general conclusion and future perspectives will be discussed for further developments.

AB In this work, by using amorphous bimetallic sulfides of CoSnSx-Pd as signal amplifier and magnetic material of Fe3O4@PPy-Au as the substrate, we fabricated an electrochemical immunoassay for N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). CoSnSx was used as the signal amplifier of the immunosensor for the first time, which was synthesized by fast stoichiometric co-precipitation method. The binary sulfide was identified as an amorphous structure and performed apparent electrochemical behavior. The excellent performance of signal marker was induced by the synergistic effect between SnS2 and cobalt, as well as the loaded Pd nanoparticles (NPs). Both CoSnS and Pd NPs presented excellent electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 oxidation. Moreover, the magnetic nanocomposite of Fe3O4 @PPy-Au was firmly immobilized on the magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE) by the magnetic force. The magnetic substrate not only performed good electron conductivity, but also improved the stability of the fabricated electrochemical immunosensor. The developed immunosensor for the NT-pro BNP detection exhibited a wide linear response (0.1 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL), and low detection limit of 31.5 fg/mL. In addition, the immunosensor held an excellent analysis capability and broad fascinating application for the detection of other biomarkers in medical diagnosis and treatment.

AB Glutamate excitotoxicity is a pathology in which excessive glutamate can cause neuronal damage and degeneration. It has also been linked to secondary injury mechanisms in traumatic spinal cord injury. Conventional bioanalytical techniques used to characterize glutamate levels in vivo, such as microdialysis, have low spatio-temporal resolution, which has impeded our understanding of this dynamic event. In this study, we present an amperometric biosensor fabricated using a simple direct ink writing technique for the purpose of in vivo glutamate monitoring. The biosensor is fabricated by immobilizing glutamate oxidase on nanocomposite electrodes made of platinum nanoparticles, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and a conductive polymer on a flexible substrate. The sensor is designed to measure extracellular dynamics of glutamate and other potential biomarkers during a traumatic spinal cord injury event. Here we demonstrate good sensitivity and selectivity of these rapidly prototyped implantable biosensors that can be inserted into a spinal cord and measure extracellular glutamate concentration. We show that our biosensors exhibit good flexibility, linear range, repeatability, and stability that are suitable for future in vivo evaluation.

AB Abnormal expression of microRNAs is closely related to human diseases. Ultrasensitive detection of microRNAs with wide linear dynamic range is necessary as the concentrations of microRNAs distributed in biological samples usually range from fM to nM. Here, we constructed an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for microRNA-21 based on the integration of a dual signal amplification strategy of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and enzyme-induced metallization (EIM) with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). MicroRNA-21 was captured by capture probe H1 (CP H1) modified magnetic nanobeads (MBs) and amplified by HCR. Multiple alkaline phosphatases (ALP) were coupled based on the specific reaction of biotin and streptavidin. A dual amplification strategy of HCR and EIM enhanced electrochemical signal by approximately 120-fold from the perspectives of target amplification and detection signal amplification, which decreased the detection limit of microRNA-21 to 0.12 fM. Compared to the reports previously reported, a wider linear dynamic range of 2.5 fM to 25 nM spanning 7 orders of magnitude was obtained. The method provides high sensitivity, specificity and a wider linear dynamic range, which shows a great potential in the early diagnosis of diseases.

AB Nucleic acid nanoswitches have a status that cannot be ignored in the field of biosensing due to the excellent biocompatibility and flexibility of design. In our current research, we have constructed a new electrochemical platform based on self-assembled pH-sensitive continuous circular DNA nanoswitch for miRNA-21 detection. We elaborately designed an inside ring probe (IRP) which could form a circle when complemented with an outside ring probe (ORP). Under the weakly acidic condition, IRPs and ORPs are self-assembled into continuous annular DNA, meanwhile, the nanoswitch is activated. However, if it is not a weakly acidic environment with a pH equal to 6, these circles are separated and the nanoswitch cannot be triggered. Therefore, the biosensor doesn't work. Only when the pH is 6, can the nanoswitch be activated. Consequently, a large number of RuHex will accumulate on the continuous annular DNA, which leads to highly sensitive detection of miRNA-21, with concentration ranged from 10(-15) to 10(-8) M and limit of detection down to 0.84 fM. More importantly, this nanoswitch-based biosensor can directly detect the target microRNA in human serum without pretreatment. Therefore, the proposed novel electrochemical DNA nanoswitch will have broad application prospects in biomarker detection and clinical diagnosis.

AB In the study, we describe an oscillatory flow-assisted efficient target enrichment method by using a particle based microarray device. Periodic oscillating flow effectively increased the mixing and binding performance between the target molecules in the sample solution and surface functionalized microparticles. Particles were trapped, secured, and released with an elastic microvalve structure operated via differences in the flow conditions. Single particle (20-mu m diameter) trapping efficiency exceeded 95%. Secured particles can freely move inside each array element based on oscillating sample flow. Furthermore, the particles can be released from the array and collected at the outlet of the device, and this provides an opportunity for further off-chip analysis. As a proof-of-concept, we used the interaction between streptavidin-coated microparticles and fluorescence labeled biotin solution and demonstrated that target enrichment and detection based on oscillatory flow were significantly more efficient than that based on unidirectional or static flow. The applicability of the method was further examined by conducting an on-chip immunoassay to detect the presence of anti-Zika nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) monoclonal antibody. The limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 1 ng/mL with an assay time of only 10 min and less than 10 mu L of sample consumption.

AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death within industrialized nations as well as an increasing cause of mortality and morbidity in many developing countries. Smoking, alcohol consumption and increased level of blood cholesterol are the main CVD risk factors. Other factors, such as the prevalence of overweight/obesity and diabetes, have increased considerably in recent decades and are indirect causes of CVD. Among CVDs, the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents the most common cause of emergency hospital admission. Since the prognosis of ACS is directly associated with timely initiation of revascularization, missed, misdiagnosis or late diagnosis have unfavorable medical implications. Early ACS diagnosis can reduce complications and risk of recurrence, finally decreasing the economic burden posed on the health care system as a whole. To decrease the risk of ACS and related CVDs and to reduce associated costs to healthcare systems, a fast management of patients with chest pain has become crucial and urgent. Despite great efforts, biochemical diagnostic approaches of CVDs remain difficult and controversial medical challenges as cardiac biomarkers should be rapidly released into the blood at the time of ischemia and persistent for a sufficient length of time to allow diagnostics, with tests that should be rapid, easy to perform and relatively inexpensive. Early biomarker assessments have involved testing for the total enzyme activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), which cardiac troponins being the main accepted biomarkers for diagnosing myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   To allow rapid diagnosis, it is necessary to replace the traditional biochemical assays by cardiac biosensor platforms. Among the numerous of possibilities existing today, electrochemical biosensors are important players as they have many of the required characteristics for point-of-care tests. Electrochemical based cardiac biosensors are highly adapted for monitoring the onset and progress of cardiovascular diseases in a fast and accurate manner, while being cheap and scalable devices. This review outlines the state of the art in the development of cardiac electrochemical sensors for the detection of different cardiac biomarkers ranging from troponin to BNP, N-terminal proBNP, and others.

AB A sandwich-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensing platform was designed for detection of amino terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). Thereinto, flower-like Bi2WO6/Ag2S nanoparticles (FBi2WO6/Ag2S) were employed as photoelectrochemical matrix, and graphene oxide and polydopamine composite (GO/PDA) were prepared as signal labels. In this proposal, Ag2S was in-situ growth on the surface of FBi2WO6 modified with thioglycolic acid (TGA). Specially, a cascade-like band-edge level between F-Bi2WO6 and Ag2S effectively improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency and enhanced the photocurrent response. Then, the conjugated GO/PDA aimed to further amplify signal because PDA as electron donor could sweep the holes and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, while GO owned brilliant conductivity speeding up the electrons transfer. The photocurrent increased with the amount of GO/PDA conjugates which had positive correlation with the NT-pro BNP. Under optimal experimental conditions, the proposed sandwich-type PEC immunosensor presented a desirable linear relationship ranged from 0.1 pg/mL to 100 ng/ mL for NT-pro BNP with the detection limit of 0.03 pg/mL (S/N = 3). The prepared PEC immunosensor exhibited high stability and selectivity, which offered an innovative idea for the detection of other biomolecules.

AB Mucin 1 protein (MUC1) is a membrane-associated glycoprotein overexpressed in the majority of human malignancies and considered as a predominant protein biomarker in cancers. Owing to the crucial role of MUC1 in cancer dissemination and metastasis, detection and quantification of this biomarker is of great importance in clinical diagnostics. Today, there exist a wide variety of strategies for the determination of various types of disease biomarkers, especially MUC1. In this regard, aptamers, as artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with catalytic and receptor properties, have drawn lots of attention for the development of biosensing platforms. So far, various sensitivity-enhancement techniques in combination with a broad range of smart nanomaterials have integrated into the design of novel aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) to improve detection limit and sensitivity of analyte determination. This review article provides a brief classification and description of the research progresses of aptamer-based biosensors and nanobiosensors for the detection and quantitative determination of MUC1 based on optical and electrochemical platforms.

AB Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes are high mortality diseases, which account for almost two thirds of all deaths worldwide. Their early detection and continuous evaluation are fundamental for an improved patient prognosis and reduced socioeconomic impact. Current biosensor technologies are typically based on the analysis of whole blood samples from patients for the detection of disease-specific biomarkers. However, these technologies display serious shortcomings, such as reduced sensitivity and dynamic range, limited in vivo applicability, and lack of continuous monitoring. There is the urgent need for new diagnostic and treatment follow-up tools, which allow for the early detection of the pathology as well as for the continuous monitoring of the physiological responses to specific therapies. During the last years, a new generation of biosensor technologies with improved performance has emerged in the biomedical sector. The combination of advanced biomaterial methods, biochemical tools, and micro/nanotechnology approaches has resulted in the development of innovative three-dimensional (3D) biosensor platforms for advanced medical diagnosis. In this review, we report the most recent advances in the field of 3D biosensors for clinical applications, focusing on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. We discuss about their clinical performance compared to standard biosensor technologies, their implantable capability, and their integration into microfluidic devices to develop clinically-relevant models. Overall, we anticipate that 3D biosensors will drive us toward a new paradigm in medical diagnosis, resulting in real-time in vivo biosensors capable to significantly improve patient prognosis.

AB This paper primarily demonstrates the approach to enhance the sensing performance on antigen C-reactive protein (CRP) and anti-CRP antibody binding event. A nanogapped electrode structure with the gap of similar to 100 nm was modified by the anti-CRP antibody (Probe) to capture the available CRP. In order to increase the amount of antigen to be captured, a gold nanorod with 119 nm in length and 25 nm in width was integrated, to increase the surface area. A comparative study between the existence and non-existence of gold nanorod utilization was evaluated. Analysis of the sensing surface was well-supported by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, 3D nano-profilometry, high-power microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The dielectric voltammetric analysis was carried out from 0 V to 2 V. The sensitivity was calculated based on 3 sigma and attained as low as 1 pM, which is tremendously low compared to real CRP concentration (119 nM) in human blood serum. The gold nanorod conjugation with antibody has enhanced the sensitivity to 100 folds (10 fM). The specificity of the CRP detection by the proposed strategy was anchored by ELISA and failure in the detection of human blood clotting factor IX by voltammetry. Despite, CRP antigen was further detected in human serum by spiking CRP to runthrough the detection with the physiologically relevant samples.

AB Enzymatic and non-enzymatic amperometric glucose sensors based on nanostructured Au-Ni alloy were prepared and compared in their performance. The hierarchically structured Au-Ni surface was merely used for the non-enzymatic glucose sensor, while glucose oxidase attached poly-3'(benzoic acid) -2,2':5',2'- terthiophene (pTBA) formed on the alloy surface was used as the enzymatic sensor. The fabricated sensor was characterized using surface analysis and electrochemical experiments. In case of the enzymatic sensor, the anodic current of H2O2 generated from the enzyme reaction was used as the analytical signal, while the direct oxidation of glucose was observed on a mere Au-Ni alloy electrode without enzyme immobilization, which shows an excellent catalytic oxidation of glucose even in physiological pH. The potential pulse pretreatment of the sensor surfaces improved the performance, which allowed both the sensors reproducible and reusable (enzymatic sensor: coefficient of variation = 1.82%, n = 5, non-enzymatic: coefficient of variation = 2.93%). The enzymatic biosensor reveals the advantages of increased sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, compared with the non-enzymatic sensor. The linear range of enzymatic sensor was attained from 1.0 mu M to 30.0 mM with a detection limit of 0.29 mu M. The reliabilities of the sensors were also demonstrated through the glucose analysis in human blood samples, and the result was compared with the commercially available glucometer.

AB In this work, a novel facile closed bipolar electrochemiluminescence (C-BP-ECL) sensor has been developed for highly sensitive detection of glucose based on the integration of chitosan (CS), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)-functioned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PDDA-MWCNTs) and graphene quantum dots-gold nanoparticles (GQDs-AuNPs) on the wax/carbon ink-screen-printed cloth-based device, When CS, PDDA-MWCNTs and GQDs-AuNPs are successively decorated onto the cathode of closed bipolar electrode (C-BPE), the C-BPE anode can emit much stronger C-BP-ECL signals. Moreover, the cathodic decoration of the C-BPE can generate a stronger ECL signal in comparison with its anodic decoration. Under optimized conditions, glucose can be detected in the range of 0.1-5000 mu M, and the limit of detection is estimated to be 64 nM, which is about three orders of magnitude lower than that in case of the bare C-BPE cathode (31 mu M). It has been shown that the proposed sensor has high detection sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and as well acceptable reproducibility, selectivity and stability. Finally, the applicability and validity of the C-BP-ECL sensor are demonstrated for the detection of glucose in human serum samples. We believe that this novel highly-sensitive sensor will have potential applications in various areas such as clinical diagnosis, food analysis and environmental monitoring.

AB Asthma is a common chronic disorder, and the decreased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production in the lung has been considered as an early detection biomarker for asthma. However, the detection of H2S in biological systems remains a challenge; because it requires the designed sensors to have the following features: nanoscale size, good biocompatibility, real-time detection, high selectivity/sensitivity, and good water stability. Here, we propose the potential of using nanoscale fluorescent metal-organic framework (MOF) composites Eu3+/Ag +@UiO-66-(COOH)(2) (hereafter denoted as EAUC) as a logic platform for tentative diagnosis of asthma by detecting the biomarker H2S. This INHIBIT logic gate based on Eu3+@UiO-66-(COOH)(2) (EUC) can be produced by choosing Ag+ and H2S as inputs and by monitoring the fluorescent signal (I-615) as an output. Our fluorescent studies indicate that the EAUC exhibits excellent selectivity, extreme sensitivity (limit of detection: 23.53 mu M), and real-time in situ detection of H2S. Further, MTT analysis in PC12 cells shows that the EAUC possesses low cytotoxicity and favourable biocompatibility that are suitable for the detection of biomarker H2S in vivo, as demonstrated by the successful detection of spiked H2S in the diluted serum samples. This work represents the possibility of using MOF-based logic platform for tentative diagnosis of asthma in clinical medicine.

AB Current genetic detection methods require gene isolation, gene amplification and detection with a fluorescent-tagged probe. They typically require sophisticated equipment and expensive fluorescent probes, rendering them not widely available for rapid acute infection diagnoses at the point of care to ensure timely treatment of the diseases. Here we report a rapid genetic detection method that can detect the bacterial gene directly from patient stools using a piezoelectric plate sensor (PEPS) in conjunction with a continuous flow system with two temperature zones. With stools spiked with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in situ bacteria lysing and DNA denaturation occurred in the high-temperature zone whereas in situ specific detection of the denatured DNA by the PEPS occurred in the lower-temperature zone. The outcome was a rapid genetic detection method that directly detected bacterial genes from stool in < 40 min without the need of gene isolation, gene amplification, or expensive fluorescent tag but with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sensitivity. In 40 blinded patient stools, it detected the toxin B gene of Clostridium difficile with 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The all-electrical, label-free nature of the detection further supports its potential as a low-cost genetic test that can be used at the point of care.

AB A novel electrochemical biosensor was developed based on multiwall carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide nanoribbons (MWCNTs/GONRs) for sensitive analysis of microRNA-21. Signal-amplified strategy was achieved by duplex-specific nuclease assisted target recycling and alkaline phosphatase-induced redox reactions. At the fabrication process of the sensor, ssDNA capture probes were immobilized on the surface of the MWCNTs@GONRs/AuNPs modified electrode through the Au-S bond, and the streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (SA-ALP) was attached to the end of the probe. In the absence of miRNA-21, SA-ALP catalysed the conversion of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) into ascorbic acid (AA), triggered a redox reaction under iodine, producing a marked electrochemical response. When miRNA-21 was hybridized to the capture probe, the duplex would be cleaved by the duplex-specific nuclease (DSN), causing the electrochemical signals being significantly decreased as a result of SA-ALP detached from the electrode surface. Under the optimized conditions, our biosensor showed satisfactory sensitivity (detection limit, 0.034 fM), excellent selectivity and good accuracy (recoveries, 77.4-120.2%; RSD, 5.2-7.3%) after systematic evaluations. The proposed approach was applied to detect miRNA-21 from human serum samples, which indicated that it was reliable and could be widely used as an effective tool for rapid detection of the target in serums.

AB Herein, tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-based electrochemical immunosensor was exploited for highly sensitive detection of CTCs. In this immunosensor, the nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411 (CP) was used to specifically capture tumor cells, and a TSA-based signal enhancement system consisting of Pt NPs@HRP@CP composite as catalytic probe and tyramine functionalized infinite coordination polymer (ICPs@Tyr) as electroactive signal tag was applied to improve the detection sensitivity. Using HeLa cell as the model CTCs, after a sandwich reaction, CP HeLa Pt NPs@HRP@CP bioconjugates were formed on the electrode. Millions of ICPs@Tyr could be layer-by-layer deposited onto the target cell membrane by the catalysis of Pt NPs@HRP@CP. The developed immunorsensor could detect HeLa cell with a wide dynamic range from 2 to 2 x 10(4) cells/mL and a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. Most importantly, the amperometric immunosensor was successfully applied to discriminate tumor cells from white blood cells, exhibiting high specificity and sensitivity. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the TSA-based signal enhancement system might be a potential alternative tool for the electrochemical measurement of trace amounts of CTCs in clinical diagnosis.

AB The paper describes a new biological sensor which represents a resonator based on a segment of a rectangular waveguide of 8 GHz band with shear dimensions of 28.5 x 12.6 mm(2). On one side, the resonator is bounded by a metallic short-circuited wall; on the other side, it is bounded by a lithium niobate plate with a porous polystyrene film. This film, applied by centrifugation and modified in high-frequency discharge plasma in argon, was used to immobilize cells of Escherichia cob K-12. This resonator was connected through a coaxial-waveguide adapter to the S parameter meter, by means of which the reflection coefficient S-11 in the plane of the lithium niobate plate was measured. The addition of an aqueous solution of ampicillin at 4-50 mu g/ml to immobilized cells led to a significant change in the reflection coefficient of S-11 from - 10.15 dB to - 15.09 dB. At the same time, the resonance frequency changed insignificantly within the range 8.06-8.068 GHz. The optimal time for modifying the polystyrene film for obtaining the required porosity and the optimal time for the immobilization of the bacterial cells were determined. The immobilized cells retained their activity for 4 months at a temperature of 4 degrees C. The study showed the promise of such a biosensor to determine beta-lactam antibiotics in aqueous solutions by using ampicillin as an example. The limit of detection of the developed biosensor with respect to ampicillin was established (4 mu g/ml).

AB L- Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and hyperglutamatergic signaling is implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Monitoring glutamate with a glutamate oxidase-based amperometric biosensor offers advantages such as high spatial and high temporal resolution. However, commercially-available glutamate biosensors are expensive and larger in size. Here, we report the development of 50 gm diameter biosensor for real-time monitoring of L-glutamate in vivo. A polymer, poly-o-phenylenediamine (PPD) layer was electropolymerized onto a 50 mu m Pt wire to act as a permselective membrane. Then, glutamate oxidase entrapped in a biocompatible chitosan matrix was cast onto the microelectrode surface. Finally, ascorbate oxidase was coated to eliminate interferences from high levels of extracellular ascorbic acid present in brain tissue. L-glutamate measurements were performed amperometrically at an applied potential of 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. The biosensor exhibited a linear range from 5 to 150 mu M, with a high sensitivity of 0.097 +/- 0.001 nA/mu M and one-week storage stability. The biosensor also showed a rapid steady state response to L-glutamate within 2 s, with a limit of detection of 0.044 mu M. The biosensor was used successfully to detect stimulated glutamate in the subthalamic nucleus in brain slices and in vivo. Thus, this biosensor is appropriate for future neuroscience applications.

AB The importance of knowing creatinine levels in the human body is related to the possible association with renal, muscular and thyroid dysfunction. Thus, the accurate detection of creatinine may indirectly provide information surrounding those functional processes, therefore contributing to the management of the health status of the individual and early diagnosis of acute diseases. The questions at this point are: to what extent is creatinine information clinically relevant?; and do modern creatinine (bio)sensing strategies fulfil the real needs of healthcare applications? The present review addresses these questions by means of a deep analysis of the creatinine sensors reported in the literature over the last five years. There is a wide range of techniques for detecting creatinine, most of them based on optical readouts (20 of the 33 papers collected in this review). However, the use of electrochemical techniques (13 of the 33 papers) is recently emerging in alignment with the search for a definitive and trustworthy creatinine detection at the point-of-care level. In this sense, biosensors (7 of the 33 papers) are being established as the most promising alternative over the years. While creatinine levels in the blood seem to provide better information about patient status, none of the reported sensors display adequate selectivity in such a complex matrix. In contrast, the analysis of other types of biological samples (e.g., saliva and urine) seems to be more viable in terms of simplicity, cross-selectivity and (bio)fouling, besides the fact that its extraction does not disturb individual's well-being. Consequently, simple tests may likely be used for the initial check of the individual in routine analysis, and then, more accurate blood detection of creatinine could be necessary to provide a more genuine diagnosis and/or support the corresponding decision-making by the physician. Herein, we provide a critical discussion of the advantages of current methods of (bio)sensing of creatinine, as well as an overview of the drawbacks that impede their definitive point-of-care establishment.

AB A well-defined Ag@AgCl nanocubes loaded on the reduced graphene oxide plasmonic heterostructure (Ag@AgCl/RGO) was facilely prepared by sacrificial salt-crystal-template process and ethylene glycol-assisted reduction. The Ag@AgCl/RGO heterostructure shows superior photocurrent response and stability under the visible light irradiation. The enhanced performance mainly attributes to the plasmon resonance effect of AgNPs by improving the absorbance and transfer of photogenerated electrons. Significantly, we observed that the photocurrent could be dramatically decreased with the introduction of H2O2 and experimental results demonstrated the etching effect of H2O2 to AgNPs should be responsible for this phenomenon. Inspired by this phenomenon, employing H2O2 that generated from glucose oxidase catalyzed glucose triggered AgNPs etching as a novel signal mode, an improved photoelectrochemical immunosensing platform was constructed by employing Ag@AgCl/RGO heterostructure as photoactive material. As a proof of concept application, the photoelectrochemical immunosensor employed for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection with competitive-type format and it exhibited excellent analytical performance. Under optimized conditions, the photocurrent increased with the concentration of target OTA in the dynamic range of 0.05 to 300 nM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 nM (4.0 pg mL(-1)). The immunosensor also showed high sensitivity, good reproducibility, and satisfactory accuracy. Although the methodology proposed here focused on OTA sensing, it could flexibly extend to monitor other targets by replacing the corresponding bio-recognition elements. Thus, this work provides a new paradigm for designing novel photoelectrochemical biosensing mode based on the plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructure.

AB In this work, DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) with unique fluorescent and electrochemical properties are prepared as dual signal probes for both qualitative imaging and quantitative detection of cancer cells in an integrated system. ITO electrode that has good light transmittance and electric conductivity is employed as a substrate for dual analysis of cancer cells. ITO electrode is firstly modified by AS1141 aptamer, which could selectively bind to nucleolin overexpressed on the surface of a model breast cancer cell, MCF-7 cell line. The composite of mucin 1 antibody (anti-MUC1) and DNA-AgNCs then binds to MUC1 on the surface of captured MCF-7 cell, forming a sandwich-like structure. Therefore, our method allows noninvasive fluorescence imaging and amplified electrochemical detection using a single labeling platform, providing a biocompatible and highly specific method for adequate analysis of cancer cells. Experimental results demonstrate that strong red fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs clearly displays the loading of cancer cells on ITO electrode after dual recognition, and amplified electrochemical signals of DNA-AgNCs enable improved sensitivity toward quantitative analysis with a detection limit of 3 cells.

AB Microchip electrophoresis (MCE) was a good available method for high-throughput and rapid detecting chemical pollutants in food samples. However, many of the reported MCE assays involve complex design of microchip, laborious operation and poor universality which limited its promotion in multiple antibiotics' detection. Herein, a multiplexed aptasensor was developed based on a universal double-T type microchip to one-step and simultaneously detect several antibiotics within 3 min using chloramphenicol (CAP) and kanamycin (Kana) as representatives. Besides, a novel stir-bar assisted DNA multi-arm junctions recycling (MAJR) strategy was designed for transducing and amplifying the signal. The brief detection mechanism was as following: the added CAP and Kana can specifically react with their aptamer probes on the stir-bar and produce different single stranded DNA primer, respectively. Afterwards, the primers can trigger MAJR to form a lot of three-and four-arm DNA junctions corresponding to different targets. The DNA multi-arm junctions can be easily separated and detected by MCE for quantification. Moreover, the stir-bar can facilitate phase separation and obviously eliminate matrix interference in food. The assay was successfully applied in milk and fish samples, showing excellent selectivity and sensitivity with a detection limits of 0.52 pg mL(-1) CAP and 0.41 pg mL(-1) Kana (S/N = 3). Thus, the assay holds a great potential application for screening of antibiotics in food.

AB Early cancer diagnosis is of prime importance as it paves the way for effective treatment and possible patient survival. The recent advancements in the field of biosensorics have facilitated the development of functionalized nanobiosensors which have the potential to provide a cost-effective, reliable and rapid diagnostic strategy for cancers. These nanoscaled sensing systems utilize electrochemical, optical, mass and calorimetric sensing mechanisms to specifically identify the disease-specific biomarkers. Because of clinical translational utility, the present review aims to describe the recent developments and status of the nanobiosensors as a point-of-care approach for cancer diagnosis. The review also offers important insights into the design, preparation and characterization of these nano-frameworks. In particular, the state-of-art nanobiosensors based on carbon nanostructures, metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, silica-based nanomaterials, conducting polymers based nanoparticles and quantum dots, which provide countless opportunities in the field of cancer biosensorics have been summarized. It also showcases the need to perform robust clinical validation of the emerging nanobiosensor strategies that would act as the ultimate point-of-care test for the personalized cancer therapeutics.

AB In this study, a dual-type responsive electrochemical biosensor was developed for the quantitative detection of alpha 2,6-sialylated glycans (alpha 2,6-sial-Gs), a potential biomarker of tumors. The gold nanorods (AuNRs), which exhibited great specific surface area, as well as good biocompatibility, was synthesized by the way of seed growth method. Furthermore, a biotin-streptavidin (biotin-SA) system was introduced to improve the immunoreaction efficiency. Accordingly, a label-free biosensor was fabricated based on AuNits-SA for the quick detection of alpha 2,6-sial-Gs by recording the signal of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Furthermore, to expand the ultrasensitive detection of alpha 2,6-sial-Gs, a carboxylated single-walled carbon nanohoms/sulfur-doped platinum nanocluster (c-SWCNHs/S-PtNC) was synthesized for the first time as a novel signal label, which showed an excellent catalytic performance. The usage of c-SWCNHs/S-PtNC could significantly amplify the electrochemical signal recorded by the amperometric i-t curve. Herein, a sandwich type biosensor was constructed by combining the AuNRs-SA on the electrode and c-SWCNHs/S-PtNC (signal amplifier). The label-free biosensor possessed a linear range from 5 ng mL(-1) to 5 mu g mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.50 ng mL(-1), and the sandwich-type biosensor possessed a wide linear range from 1 mu g mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.69 mu g mL(-1). Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited excellent recovery and stability, indicating its potential for use in actual samples.

AB Pesticide contamination has become one of the most serious problems of public health in the world, due to their wide application in agriculture industry to guarantee the crop yield and quality. The detection of pesticide residues plays an important role in food safety management and environment protection. However, the conventional detection methodologies cannot realize highly sensitive, selective and on-site detection, which limits their applications. Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonudeotides (RNA or DNA) selected by SELEX method, which can selectively bind to their targets with high affinity. Compared with the commonly used antibodies or enzymes in designing biosensors, aptamers exhibit better stability, low molecular weight, easy modification and low cost, and were regarded as excellent candidates for developing aptasensors for pesticide detection. In this review, application of aptamers for pesticide detection was reviewed. Firstly, aptamers specifically bind to various pesticides were first summarized. Secondly, the progresses and highlights of developing aptasensors for highly-sensitive and selective detection of pesticide residues were systematically provided. Finally, the present challenges and future perspectives for developing novel highly-effective aptasensor for the detection of pesticide residues were discussed.

AB Point-of-care (POC) applications have expanded hugely in recent years and is likely to continue, with an aim to deliver cheap, portable, and reliable devices to meet the demands of healthcare industry. POC devices are designed, prototyped, and assembled using numerous strategies but the key essential features that biosensing devices require are: (1) sensitivity, (2) selectivity, (3) specificity, (4) repeatability, and (5) good limit of detection. Overall the fabrication and commercialization of the nanohole array (NHA) setup to the outside world still remains a challenge. Here, we review the various methods of NHA fabrication, the design criteria, the geometrical features, the effects of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on sensing as well as current state-of-the-art of existing NHA sensors. This review also provides easy-to-understand examples of NHA-based POC biosensing applications, its current status, challenges, and future prospects.
