AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially those having four or more rings, are abundant and toxic environmental contaminants that are highly persistent and difficult to remove from contaminated ecosystems. Bioreactors with microalgae have been used to remove some low-molecular-weight PAHs. Immobilization is a good choice for the recovery of biomass from reactors once its function of removing contaminants is fulfilled. Alginate is a natural material that is transparent, is permeable and acts as a protective barrier against other microorganisms and harmful particulates suspended in water. Therefore, in this study, we designed and evaluated four mini-bioreactors packed with alginate beads that contain two microalgal species, Selenastrum capricornutum and Scenedesmus acutus which are capable of removing the high-molecular-weight PAHs benzo(a)anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene. One of the bioreactors was a batch reactor with a continuous magnetic stirring tank, and the other bioreactors were enclosed tubular bioreactors operating in semi-continuous mode with two cycles. The influence of parameters such as the reactor shape, stirring speed, flow, number of alginate beads, number of cells and cell species ratio, as well as the time of contact and the use of two operation cycles were studied. The amounts of the remaining PAHs after exposure tests with microalgae were determined. It was found that the shape and the mode of operation of the bioreactor markedly influenced the efficiency of removal. The removal capacity of these mini-bioreactors and the advantages and the disadvantages of using these mini-bioreactors were analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pulverizing aerator in the process of lake restotation
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Lake restoration; Pulverizing aeration; Goreckie lake
AB In 1995, the Institute of Agricultural Engineering of the Agricultural University in Poznan launched research on an integrated lake restoration technology, whose core was a wind-powered aerator capable of oxygenating also the bottom layers (the hypolimnion) of deep lakes. The aerator uses energy from the Savonius rotor mainly for water pulverizing, causing the release of gases such as hydrogen sulphide or methane, which usually result in complete water saturation and replace them with oxygen. Even the early studies showed the constructed device to be highly efficient in improving oxygen conditions in the bottom zone. Moreover, the research made it clear that the device should be equipped with an autonomous system designed to inactivate phosphorus, one of the principal factors determining the rate of lake degradation. In 2013 the first wind-driven pulverizing aerator equipped with such a new system was installed at Goreckie Lake.
   The research describe results of the process of the restoration of Goreckie Lake with using pulverizing aerator system conducted regularly from 2013 to 2015. It was the aim of this work. The results show that the efficience of pulverizing aerator with a phosphorus inactivation system and the efficiency of the coagulant dosage depend on the wind speed from the determined range of the speed. The technical specifications causes that the device uses only energy of the wind, which is the main advantage of the whole system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A module-based Green Infrastructure (GI) and Ecosystem Service (ES) approach, adapted to the specific requirements and conditions for railway line-side vegetation management, is presented in this paper. The multi-functionality of line-side vegetation is addressed by an integration of the GI and ES concepts. The use of widely available geo-data enables its applicability, both in terms of large-scale and other infrastructure networks. In this way it can serve as a feature for emphasizing the creation of a productive, attractive and cost effective landscape resource. A methodological approach for the Ecosystem Service Demand Assessment (ESDA) of GI line-side elements was developed and applied at a study site. An ESDA was performed concerning "Structural landscape diversity" and "Water and climate regulation". The results represent the composition of landscape types, the demand for structural landscape features, the distribution of GI line-side elements and hotspots of land consumption. Additionally, potential capacity of GI line-side vegetation to provide ecosystem services was addressed. Maps created provide basic information for the railway operator to consider ecosystem service demand in construction and maintenance works. In this way, the presented GIS approach can support decision-making-sovereignty in implementing holistic line-side vegetation management strategies. The use of high resolution geo-data proved to provide a good basis for the accurate mapping of GI line-side elements. The study has confirmed that high resolution geo-data and GIS technologies have great potentials regarding spatial data provision and as analytical frameworks for line-side vegetation management.

AB Different kinds of sulfur sources which acted as a growth enhancer of carbon nanotube (CNT) were employed in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Influences of sulfur sources, sulfur powder and thiourea, were investigated. The production of CNTs was facilitated when sulfur source was added, but its degree depended on sulfur source. Results showed that the smallest activation energy for CNT growth was obtained in sulfur powder, and an intermediate value between Co/Mo without sulfur source and with sulfur powder was obtained in thiourea. We attempted to interpret the difference in activation energy, especially between thiourea and sulfur powder.

AB In the present research, an electron donor-acceptor compound (called push-pull systems) were studied using DFT methods in the vacuum space. We used [14] annulene and [18] annulene as pi conjugated system and connected methoxy diphenylamine group as an electron donor and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor group. It was shown that the donor and acceptor groups narrowed the E-g of structure which is the result of hyperconjugation. Pristine annulenes had intensive light absorption in the ultraviolet region in electromagnetic radiation. After both molecules sandwiched between electron donor-acceptor groups, a significant redshift from the UV region to the visible and IR region was observed. Also in NMR calculation, it was observed the amount of aromaticity has increased after sandwiching. In all IR and Raman spectrum, it was shown the amount and intensity of light absorption increased after placing annulenes in electron donoracceptor groups. The results of this research may be useful in designing new materials applicable as photosensitizers and photodynamic therapy.

We assumed that the ratio of electrical conductance change was equal to the surface coverage, and our detection model verified this assumption. To prove this assumption, we simulated the sheet resistance of a film with numerous joints. Our Monte Carlo simulations proved that when the joint resistance increased owing to molecular adsorption, the sheet resistance increased in accordance with the surface coverage.

AB A series of beta-Bi2O3/BiOClheterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by in-situ treatment of beta-Bi2O3 with HCl. Compared to pure beta-Bi2O3, the as-synthesized beta-Bi2O3/BiOCl composites displayed unexpectedly high visible-light photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation, which was even higher than that of P25 under UV light. Based on the results of transient photocurrent measurement and trapping experiments of active species, the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the formation of heterostructure between beta-Bi2O3 and BiOCl, leading to the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. This research may establish foundation for practical application of the new visible-light-active beta-Bi2O3-based heterojunction photocatalysts.

AB The electric and magnetic field effects on the energy spectrum, the charge distribution and the electric dipole moment induced by the electron released from an off-axis donor confined inside the thin shell layer is studied by using the double Fourier series expansion method. The density of states exhibits strongly marked Aharonov-Bohm oscillations induced by the magnetic field, while the electric field modifies the charge distribution. The average electron-donor distance increases slowly as the electric field increases from zero, but then it rises sharply as the electric field exceeds a threshold value forming a giant permanent dipole moment.

AB alpha-Zirconium phosphate (alpha-ZrP) nanocrystals with different morphology and particle size were synthesized via three facile and mild methods, namely alpha-ZrP plates, alpha-ZrP nanoparticles-1 and alpha-ZrP nanoparticles-2. alpha-ZrP plates and alpha-ZrP nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 sorption isotherms. The photocatalytic activity of alpha-ZrP plates and alpha-ZrP nanoparticles were explored by photodegradation of Rhodamine B under ultraviolet irradiation. 97% of Rhodamine B was degraded with alpha-ZrP nanoparticles-2 within 50 min, which is more efficient than alpha-ZrP plates and alpha-zirconium phosphate nanoparticles-1. All alpha-ZrP catalysts exhibited superior photocatalytic activity.

AB In this study, infrared vibrational modes and intensities are calculated for F-2+ H -> HF+ F reaction according to distance between F and H atoms by using DFT-B3LYP/6-311++ G (d, p) level of theory. Also for the relevant reaction, the vibrational energy eigenvalues of the nascent H-F molecule at specific locations of the separated fluorine atom are obtained using the Schrodinger wave equation on the most realistic potential energy surface for this reaction. Since the main aim of the work is to analysis nascent molecular structure by the help of IR transitions, in the light of these two studies indicated above, the most appropriate vibration quantum states supporting the relevant IR transitions are determined and are verified by comparison with experimental results for some transitions that are available in the literature. Moreover, the transition state regions relating to both the reaction and the nascent HF molecule are detected by means of these.

Materials were applied in thin film metal-semiconductor (MS) junction based Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBDs). The nonlinear current-voltage characteristics indicate successful application of the materials in optoelectronic device. The device performance of the fabricated SBDs are analyzed by employing the thermionic emission (TE) theory and the space charge limited current (SCLC) theory followed by a schematic band structure.

When tested as a potential anode for lithium-ion batteries, the as-prepared TiO2-0.05 M exhibits impressive lithium storage performance, delivering a reversible capacity of 117.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after even 1300 cycles. Moreover, the results indicate that the rational nanostructure of TiO2-0.05 M should be responsible for thus impressive lithium storage performance.

AB Expression of CCR7 on T cells has been reported to be associated with the lymphocytic migration and infiltration, which is recognized as a vital part of the pathogenesis of Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Here, we compared the expression of CCR7 on CD4 + T cells between pSS patients and control groups, including healthy donors (HD) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and examined correlations with disease activity and damage severity, which were evaluated by EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Damage Index (SSDDI), respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients and controls and expressions of CCR7 were evaluated by flow cytometry. CCR7 was selectively and frequently expressed on CD4 (+) T cells, but less on CD8 (+) T cells of patients with pSS. In contrast, this phenomenon was neither seen in normal subjects nor in patients with SLE. The expression level of CCR7 in the peripheral blood CD4 (+) T cells is closely correlated with ESSDAI, but not SSDDI. Correspondently, the chemotactic index (CI) of CD4(+)T cells was higher than CD8-FT cells in patients with pSS. Furthermore, the CI of CD4(+)T cells is also higher than that of other controls, which is correlated with ESSDAI. All the findings suggested that CCR7 might play an important role in the development of pSS by mediating the migration of CD4(+) cells. Thus, the expression of CCR7 in CD4 (+) T cells is probably a useful biomarker to evaluate and monitor disease activity. CCR7 can also potentially be a novel target for the therapy of pSS.

AB Introduction: The aim of the present study was to assess the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other suggested therapeutic growth factors with the degree of ischemia in patients with different clinical manifestations of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) according to the Rutherford grades.
   Methods: The study cohort consists of 226 consecutive patients admitted to a Department of Vascular Surgery for elective invasive procedures. PAD patients were grouped according to the Rutherford grades after a clinical assessment. Ankle-brachial pressure indices (ABI) and absolute toe pressure (TP) values were measured. Serum levels of circulating VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) were measured from serum and analysed against Rutherford grades and peripheral hemodynamic measurements.
   Results: The levels of VEGF (P = 0.009) and HGF (P < 0.001) increased significantly as the ischaemic burden became more severe according to the Rutherford grades. PDGF behaved in opposite manner and declined along increasing Rutherford grades (P = 0.004). A significant, inverse correlations between Rutherford grades was detected as follows; VEGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.183, P = 0.004), HGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.253, P < 0.001), bFGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.169, P = 0.008) and PDGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.296, P < 0.001). In addition, VEGF had a clear direct negative correlation with ABI (Pearson's correlation 0.19, P = 0.009) and TP (Pearson's correlation 0.20, P = 0.005) measurements.
   Conclusions: Our present observations show that the circulating levels of VEGF and other suggested therapeutic growth factors are significantly increased along with increasing ischemia. These findings present a new perspective to anticipated positive effects of gene therapies utilizing VEGF, HGF, and bFGF, because the levels of these growth factors are endogenously high in end-stage PAD.

AB Creatinine is the breakdown product of creatine, a key participant in the generation of ATP and is traditionally considered to be a biologically inert waste product. Based on our earlier work, we analyzed the effects of creatinine hydrochloride on the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in a human T cell line, as well as human and mouse macrophage cell lines. Exposing cells to creatinine hydrochloride significantly reduced TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels compared to control-treated cultures in all cell lines tested. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of inflammation, was employed with in mouse macrophage cell lines to induce high levels of TNF-alpha in order to determine whether creatinine hydrochloride could reduce preexisting inflammation. Cells treated with LPS and creatinine hydrochloride had significantly reduced TNF-alpha levels compared to cells treated with LPS alone. As the NF-kappa B signaling pathway represents a major mechanism of TNF-alpha generation, nuclear extracts were examined for NF-kappa B pathway activation. Cells exposed to CRN had significantly lower levels of NF-kappa B in the nucleus compared to control-treated cells. Together, these results support the hypothesis that CRN can alter anti-inflammatory responses by interfering with the activation of the NF-kappa B pathway.

AB Trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral tissues to draining lymph nodes is a prerequisite for induction of adaptive immunity. An immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, however, inhibits migration of DCs by downregulating the expression of chemokine receptor CCR-7. Whether TGF-beta 1 engages any other receptor to mediate this inhibitory effect is currently unknown. In this article, we report that TGF-beta 1 attenuated the lymph node homing ability of mouse DCs by reducing C-type lectin receptor-2 (CLEC-2) expression. Notably, TGF-beta 1 inhibited CLEC-2 expression in DCs via c-Src. DCs silenced for c-Src were resistant to TGF-beta 1-induced inhibition of CLEC-2 expression. Furthermore, silencing of c-Src substantially improved the lymph node homing capacity of TGF-beta 1-treated DCs by restoring CLEC-2 expression. These results document a critical role for c-Src and CLEC-2 in TGF-beta 1-mediated impairment of DC migration and define a previously unknown mechanism by which TGF-beta 1 attenuates the lymph node homing ability of DCs.

AB Background: Most of the literature has shown a direct association between adiposity, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and an inverse association with adiponectin. The aim of this paper was to assess the association of obesity measurements and IL-6, CRP and adiponectin.
   Methods: We performed cross-sectional/longitudinal analysis in the 1993 Birth Cohort in Brazil. Associations between IL-6 (pg/mL), CRP (mg/L) and adiponectin (mu g/Ml) with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), percentage total fat mass (FM) (BODPOD) and trunk FM (DXA) were verified. Four trajectory variables were generated: (a) highest tertile/obesity according to BMI in both follow-ups; (b) highest tertile/obesity only at 18 years; (c) highest tertile/obesity only at 22 years; (d) not in the highest tertile/not obese at both ages.
   Results: We found a direct association for IL-6 and CRP and an inverse association for adiponectin with measures of adiposity. For instance, for females, the highest mean IL-6 and CRP, respectively, was for those who had been in the obese category at 18-22 years (2.49; 3.75), in the highest tertile of WC (2.11; 3.08), in the highest % of FM (1.56; 3.30 l), and in the highest tertile of trunk FM (2.07; 3.26) (p < 0.001 for all these results in the adjusted analysis). Adiponectin showed an inverse association for the above variables, with lower mean values for males than females.
   Conclusion: There was a longitudinal and direct association between adiposity and IL-6 and CRP, and an inverse association with adiponectin at 22 years.

AB Aims: Clq/TNF-related protein 9 (CTRP9) is an adipokine mainly secreted by white adipose tissue and plays protective roles in energy metabolism. However, information regarding the role of CTRP9 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is scarce. Here we aimed to ascertain the clinical relevance between circulating CTRP9 levels and NAFLD through a cross-sectional study.
   Methods: The study enrolled 82 NAFLD adults and 79 sex- and age-matched non-NAFLD controls. Serum CTRP9 was measured via ELISA method. Metabolic parameters were also determined.
   Results: Although serum CTRP9 level seems to be higher in NAFLD adults, there was no significant difference among the ultrasonographic degrees of NAFLD (P = 0.275). Further, after adjustment for BMI in the multinomial logistic regression model, no significant odds ratio difference was observed for NAFLD among the CTRP9 tertiles. Moreover, binary logistic regression models demonstrated that, body mass index (BMI) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but not CTRP9 were independent factors related to NAFLD. Besides, serum CTRP9 was positively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, Fasting insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in all subjects. BMI was the independent factor associated with serum CTRP9.
   Conclusions: Serum CTRP9 is not independently related to NAFLD. The association between serum CTRP9 and NAFLD might be due to the influence of obesity.

AB Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) is one of the commonest acquired immune-mediated neuropathies, often preceded by infections. Although cellular immune responses are shown to substantially account for the pathophysiology of GBS, the precise mechanistic basis of risk and disease course remains enigmatic till date. Cytokines are best known for their abilities to drive cellular immunity and inflammation through their co-ordinated actions. Data obtained from clinical and animal model studies suggest important implications of some of the cytokines in the progression and recovery of GBS. However, these studies were performed on few cytokines and small set of GBS patients, thereby lacking a complete understanding of the patterns of association of cytokines representing Thl, Th2, and Th17 responses with GBS.
   We studied 65 well-characterized GBS patients and 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. A panel of 15 cytokines representing Thl, Th2 and Th17 pathways was assayed using Multiplex Suspension Array platform. Plasma levels of five cytokines were found to be altered in GBS patients compared to healthy control subjects: (i) IL-1 beta exhibited reduced levels, and (ii) IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-21 and IL-33 were elevated in GBS patients. The most important finding of this study was up-regulated expression of IL-21 and IL-33 in patients with GBS. Given the role of IL-33 as an alarmin, the elevated level of this cytokine provides important indication about a much broader role of cytokines in GBS. This study also provides evidence towards a multi-lineage Th cells (Thl, Th2 and Th17) associated cytokine responses in the pathophysiology of GBS.

AB Background: Fibrosis is attributed to dysregulation of tissue-remodeling. In remodeling areas, fibroblasts and macrophages actively make contact with each other. Osteopontin (OPN) is a pro-fibrotic molecule, whose expression is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-1 beta via secretion of its downstream cytokines, such as IL-6. Here, we investigated the effect of interaction between fibroblasts and macrophages under IL-1 beta stimulation on the expression of OPN.
   Methods: We used human lung fibroblasts and THP-1 macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured under IL-1 beta stimulation. Secretion of OPN and IL-6 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The effects of siRNA against IL-6 or OPN on OPN expression were evaluated.
   Results: OPN expression increased when fibroblasts and THP-1 macrophages were co-cultured under IL-1 beta stimulation. The siRNA against IL-6 in fibroblasts suppressed the upregulation of OPN expression during co-culture, whereas siRNA against IL-6 in THP-1 macrophages did not. The upregulation of expression of OPN mRNA in fibroblasts or THP-1 macrophages when co-cultured under IL-1 beta stimulation was mediated by IL-6 from fibroblasts. OPN from THP-1 macrophages was involved in the increase of OPN expression in fibroblasts.
   Conclusions: The present study revealed the crosstalk between fibroblasts and THP-1 macrophages under IL-1 beta stimulation, where IL-6 from fibroblasts, stimulated by IL-1 beta, upregulated OPN expression in fibroblasts themselves via increase in OPN from THP-1 macrophages. The fibroblasts/macrophages network may induce activation or qualitative changes in both cells, which contributes to inflammation-associated fibrosis.

AB The pro-tumoral effects of CCL5 have been identified in numerous cancer types. We successfully cultivated 4 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, including TWES-1, TWES-3 and a pair of cell lines derived from primary lesion (TWES-4PT) and metastatic lymph node (TWES-4LN) of the same patient. Whole genome screening showed that TWES-4LN expressed higher levels of CCL5 compared to that of TWES-4PT; quantification of protein secretion displayed comparable results, suggesting that CCL5 could be associated with lymph node metastasis in ESCC. CCL5 knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced basal growth rate, tumor migration and invasiveness in the paired cell lines; whereas this treatment induced cell apoptosis in TWES-1 and TWES-3. CCR5 antagonist maraviroc significantly inhibited tumor migration and invasion in the paired cell lines without affecting tumor growth. Collectively, these results suggest that CCL5 autocrine loop may promote ESCC progression; targeting the CCL5/CCR5 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for this deadly disease.

ID TASK-FORCE; BIOMARKERS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY
AB Background: Heart failure (HF) is characterized by impaired systolic ejection capacity and/or diastolic filling of the heart, leading to a multisystem disorder. Remote organ failure, systemic inflammation or pulmonary hypertension (PH) are hallmarks of the pathophysiological changes in HF. The Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in a variety of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Circulating MIF levels and their potential role as a disease marker in the different subgroups of HF have not been investigated yet. We here aimed to unravel a potential role of MIF in HF.
   Methods and results: MIF plasma levels were assessed in 249 consecutive patients with HF. MIF was detectable in all investigated subjects and showed no difference with regard to the nature of HF (preserved or reduced ejection fraction). Spearman correlation revealed an association with inflammatory biomarkers (white blood cell count r = 0.18, p = 0.005; c-reactive protein r = 0.20, p = 0.003). MIF was associated with higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) as assessed by echocardiography (r = 0.23, p < 0.001). Log-transformed PASP was also independently associated with MIF in a multivariable linear regression model (p = 0.02). Follow-up (FU) data after 180 days revealed that patients with increased MIF values (in ng/ml) were more likely to reach the endpoint all-cause mortality (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.004-1.02, p = 0.005, per unit change).
   Conclusion: MIF is detectable in the circulation of patients with HF and might be associated with clinical end-points in HF, markers of inflammation and PH. These promising results should stimulate further research to elucidate the role of MIF in the multisystem disorder of HF.

   STATISTICS
AB Introduction: Despite the widely described role of IL10 in immune response regulation during carcinogenesis, there is no established model describing the role of its receptor. The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship between the subunit alpha of IL10 receptor (IL10RA) in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Methods: The study was conducted on archived paraffin blocks of 125 CRC patients, from which tissue micro arrays (TMA) were made. These were subsequently used for immunohistochemistry to assess the expression of IL10RA, IL10, phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and the Ki67 proliferation index. The intensity of both reactions was assessed by independent researchers using two approaches: digital image analysis and the Remmele and Stegner score (IRS). To assess the possible correlations between the two investigated markers and the clinical stage of CRC, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated. The expression of aforementioned proteins was assessed in tumor samples, healthy surgical margins and healthy control samples, obtained from cadavers during autopsy from the Department of Forensic Medicine. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica ver. 13.05 software.
   Results: The final analysis included 105 CRC patients with complete clinical and pathological data, for whom the expressions of IL10RA, IL10, pSTAT3 and Ki67 were assessed using two independent methods. There was a positive correlation between the IL10RA expression and Ki-67 proliferation index (R = 0.63, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation between the IL10RA expression and the clinical stage of CRC (R = 0.21, p = 0.022). IL10RA correlated positively with pSTAT3 and IL10 in neoplastic tissue and tumor margin (with p < 0.01 for all correlations). We also observed a significantly higher expression of IL10RA in healthy surgical margins when compared to the actual tumor (p = 0.023, the paired t-test). The expression of IL10 was significantly higher in tumors than in healthy intestinal endothelium from control group.
   Conclusions: The correlations between the expression of IL10RA and the proliferation index or the clinical stage of CRC seem to confirm the importance of IL10RA in the pathogenesis of CRC. The higher expression of IL10RA in healthy surgical margins than in the tumor itself may suggest that IL10RA plays a role in regulating immune response to the neoplasm.

AB Melanin synthesis in melanocytes is affected by various cytokines. Here, we reported for the first time that tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) inhibits melanogenesis in the primary culture of human epidermal melanocytes. TNFSF14 is known to bind to its receptors herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT beta R) for signal transduction, but TNFSF14-induced hypopigmentation was independent of HVEM and LT beta R in melanocytes. To explore signaling in melanocytes treated with TNFSF14, we performed RNA-seq and found that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling is activated by TNFSF14. Further, we observed that inhibition of NF-kB effectively blocks the hypopigmentation induced by TNFSF14. We conclude that TNFSF14 inhibits melanogenesis in melanocytes via NF-kappa B signaling and could be applied in the treatment of cutaneous pigment disorders.

AB We have previously verified that neonatal hepatitis B vaccination induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and behavior impairments in mice. However, the exact mechanism of these effects remain unclear. In this study, we observed that neonatal hepatitis B vaccination induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response lasting for 4-5 weeks in both the serum and the hippocampus, primarily indicated by elevated IL-4 levels. Three weeks after the vaccination schedule, however, hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)-mice showed delayed hippocampal neuroinflammation. In periphery, IL-4 is the major cytokine induced by this vaccine. Correlation analyses showed a positive relationship in the IL-4 levels between serum and hippocampus in HBV-mice. Thus, we investigated whether neonatal over-exposure to systemic IL-4 influences brain and behavior. We observed that mice injected intraperitoneally with recombinant mouse IL-4 (mIL-4) during early life had similar neuroinflammation and cognition impairment similar to those induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination. Next, the mechanism underlying the effects of IL-4 on brain in mice was explored using a series of experiments. In brief, these experiments showed that IL-4 mediates the delayed neurobehavioral impairments induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination, which involves the permeability of neonatal blood brain barrier and the down-regulation of IL-4 receptor. This finding suggests that clinical events concerning neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and allergic asthma in human infants, may have adverse implications for brain development and cognition.

AB Plasma cell mastitis (PCM) is a chronic mastitis with limited treatment options and common recurrence. A histopathological hallmark of PCM is the infiltration of numerous plasma cells surrounding the mammary duct. Our previous study showed that the activity of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was elevated in patients with PCM. However, the etiology of PCM remains largely unclear. In this study, we sought to explore the effects of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PCM. Histological analysis showed that the mammary glands of mice that received human breast tissue homogenates, followed by an injection of IL-6, exhibited features of PCM similar to human PCM. The IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling activity was significantly elevated and Bcl-2 was highly expressed in CD138 + plasma cells in the mammary glands of mice with PCM. Furthermore, treatment with AG-490, an inhibitor of JAK family kinases, suppressed activation of the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling cascade, in turn resulting in a decreased number of plasma cells in the mammary gland and reversing the pathogenesis of PCM. Taken together, our study indicated that a PCM mouse model was successfully established through activation of the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway by injecting IL-6 into the mammary gland of mouse that had received homogenates of human breast tissue. Thus, the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway plays a critical role in orchestrating the pathogenesis of PCM.

AB We have previously shown that the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-12, and the homodimer of its larger subunit p40, both bind to heparin and heparan sulfate with relatively high affinity. In the present study we characterised these interactions using a series of chemically modified heparins as competitive inhibitors. Human interleukin-12 and p40 homodimer show indistinguishable binding profiles with a panel of heparin derivatives, but that of murine interleukin-12 is distinct. Heparin markedly protects the human and murine p40 subunits, but not the p35 subunits, from cleavage by the bacterial endoprotease LysC, further implicating the larger subunit as the location of the heparin binding site. Moreover the essential role of the carboxyterminal D3 domain in heparin binding is established by the failure of a truncated construct of the p40 subunit lacking this domain to bind. Predictive docking calculations indicate that a cluster of basic residues at the tip of the exposed C'D' loop within D3 is important in heparin binding. However since the human and murine C'D' loops differ considerably in length, the mode and three dimensional orientation of heparin binding are likely to differ substantially between the human and murine p40s. Thus overall the binding of IL-12 via its p40 subunit to heparin-related polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix appears to be functionally important since it has been conserved across mammalian species despite this structural divergence.

AB Background: Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 are viewed mainly as anti-inflammatory cytokines. Yet, high concentrations have also been associated with inflammation-related diseases in newborns.
   Methods: We measured the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10, as well as IL-8 and ICAM-1 in blood specimens collected on postnatal day 21 (N = 555), day 28 (N = 521), and both days 21 and 28 (N = 449) from children born extremely preterm (EP) (< 28 weeks gestation) who at age 10 years had a DAS-II IQ Z-score >2 (which approximates a score of > 70) and the following assessments, CCC-2, and CSI-4, DAS-II, NEPSY-II, SCQ, and WIAT-III. Selected children also were assessed with the ADI-R and the ADOS-2. We modeled the risk of low scores or dysfunctions associated with top quartile concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 on each day and on both days.
   Results: The risks of low scores on the Animal Sorting and Arrows components of the NEPSY-II, both components of the OWLS-II, and the PseudoWord and Spelling components of the WIAT-III were heightened among children who had top quartile concentrations of IL-4 on postnatal days 21 and 28. Children who had high concentrations of IL-10 on days 21 and 28, individually and collectively, were at increased risk of low scores on the WIAT-III Spelling component. High concentrations of IL-4 on day 28 were associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). High concentrations of IL-10 on day 28 were also associated with a doubling of ASD risk, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Top quartile concentrations of IL-4 and IL10 on both days were not associated with increased risk of social, language, or behavioral dysfunctions.
   Conclusion: Among children born EP, those who had top quartile concentrations of IL-4 and/or IL-10 on postnatal days 21 and/or 28 were more likely than their peers to have low scores on components of the NEPSY-II, OWLS-II, and WIAT-III assessments, as well as identification as having an ASD. What is known:
   center dot IL-4 and IL-10 are viewed as predominantly anti-inflammatory proteins.
   center dot Less commonly, high concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 have been associated with adverse health outcomes. What is not known:
   center dot We do not know to what extent elevated concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 during the third and fourth postnatal weeks are associated with increased risk of neurocognitive, behavioral, language, and social dysfunctions among children born very preterm. What this study adds:
   center dot Children born very preterm who have elevated concentrations of IL-4, but not IL-10, on both postnatal days 21 and/or 28 are at increased risk of low scores on assessments of processing speed, visuospatial skills, listening comprehension, oral expression, and reading and spelling achievement.

TI IL-33 stimulates expression of the GPR84 (EX33) fatty acid receptor gene

AB Expression of GPCR fatty acid sensor/receptor genes in adipocytes is modulated by inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 beta. In this study we examined whether the IL-1 gene superfamily member, IL-33, also regulates expression of the fatty acid receptor genes in adipocytes. Human fat cells, differentiated from preadipocytes, were incubated with IL-33 at three different dose levels for 3 or 24 h and mRNA measured by qPCR. Treatment with IL-33 induced a dose-dependent increase in GPR84 mRNA at 3 h, the level with the highest dose being 13.7-fold greater than in controls. Stimulation of GPR84 expression was transitory; the mRNA level was not elevated at 24 h. In contrast to GPR84, IL-33 had no effect on GPR120 expression. IL-33 markedly stimulated expression of the IL1B, CCL2, IL6, CXCL2 and CSF3 genes, but there was no effect on ADIPOQ expression. The largest effect was on CSF3, the mRNA level of which increased 183-fold over controls at 3 h with the highest dose of IL-33; there was a parallel increase in the secretion of G-CSF protein into the medium. It is concluded that in human adipocytes IL-33, which is synthesised in adipose tissue, has a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes, particularly CSF3, and on the expression of GPR84, a pro-inflammatory fatty acid receptor.

AB Inflammation can occur via different mechanisms, such as via acute and chronic responses, on numerous occasions and function accordingly through various roles. There are more than five subsets of neutrophils; neutrophilic heterogeneity is modulated by the inflammatory condition. To understand the characteristics of inflammation, identification of atypical neutrophils is important. In this study, we found that the expression of eotaxin receptor (CD193) on atypical neutrophils in the duodenum is augmented in IL-21 isoform transgenic (Tg) mice. In a series of studies, we have established a Tg mouse strain to further investigate the functions of IL-21 in vivo. Interestingly, Tg mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) were more sensitive to OVA-induced systemic anaphylaxis as compared with wild type mice with duodenal and splenic gross congestion. Further analysis conducted in the duodenum of Tg mice revealed that only the number of neutrophils migrating into the duodenum was significantly increased prior to immunization. Previous studies have shown that the gastrointestinal compartment and the spleen constantly produce eotaxin, which regulates basal levels of tissue eosinophils. Therefore, we analyzed CD193(+) expression on neutrophils and eosinophils. As expected, its expression by duodenal neutrophils was upregulated in Tg mice. Furthermore, the addition of IL-21 into bone marrow cell culture increased the number of CD193(+) neutrophils, which easily migrated into the duodenum. These observations suggested that CD193(+) neutrophils increase in number under inflammatory conditions due to chronic IL-21 production.

AB Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic skin disorder resulting from the imbalanced interaction between infiltrating immune cells and keratinocytes. These immune cells, including monocytes, are able to mediate the immune responses in inflamed skin lesions. Chemokines are responsible for the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. In patients with PsO, the keratinocytes are the main source of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), which is a CC chemokine. After CCL2 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR2, which mainly is expressed on the surface of monocytes, the monocytes differentiate into macrophages and migrate from the blood stream to sites of inflammation. This process can cause the formation of lesions. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that CCL2 could be a potential biomarker to monitor the progression of PsO. Thus, evidence suggests that there could be a potential role for CCR2 and CCL2 during treatment of PsO and to prevent its further development. For example, to modify the course of PsO, efforts have been made to inhibit or modulate the CCR2/CCL2 axis. However, before exploring the targeting of the CCR2/CCL2 axis in a clinical setting, better understanding of the different molecular aspects of PsO is required.

AB Circulating cytokines, and particularly the interleukin (IL)-family are known to play an important role in inflammation. These molecules circulate in the blood and therefore have a direct effect on the plasma molecules and the formed elements like the erythrocytes and platelets. Aberrant coagulation (hypercoagulation or blood clots that form too easily) and clot lyses (hypofibrinolysis, where clots do not dissolve properly, with an abnormally low rate of clot lysis time), are usually the hallmarks of many inflammatory conditions. However, the mechanism by which cross-linking augments clot stiffness remains undetermined. IL-1 beta; IL-6 and IL-8 has been found to be involved in most chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we investigate clot structure of healthy blood, with the addition of these 3 interleukins, to determine the individual effects at concentrations that mimic low-grade, chronic inflammation. Previous studies showed that clot rheological behavior is regulated by at least the following three factors, fibrinogen concentration, fibrin network architecture and FXIIIa-induced ligation. We investigated clot formation and lysis using thromboelastography (TEG), before and after exposure, and created clots by adding thrombin to whole blood. This allowed us to look at extensive fibrin fiber formation and their interactions with particularly the erythrocytes, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results showed that IL-1 beta; IL-6 and IL-8 causes hypercoagulation and results in a disheveled fibrin clot, with trapped ABCs. IL-8 showed eryptosis (a type of apoptosis in erythrocytes). Our lysis results showed that both clot lysis time and maximum rate of lysis are decreased, with the addition of the interleukins. This is a novel finding and the observations reported in this paper, therefore points to the importance of looking at the effects of individual circulating inflammagens, to better understand the role that each play in the expression of disease. These methods can be used for an individualized patient-orientated approach in healthcare to track blood viscosity in conditions with acute and chronic inflammation.

AB It has been suggested higher serum levels of IL-15 and lower expression levels of IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15R alpha) are correlated with pathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD). However, whether overexpressing IL-15R alpha could be used as a therapeutic candidate for BD is currently unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether overexpressing IL-15R alpha could affect BD symptoms in a mouse model. IL-15/IL-15R alpha complex expressing vector or protein complex of IL-15/IL-15R alpha-Fc was used to treat BD mice. Frequencies of IL-15R alpha + cells in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and lymph node cells were determined using a flow cytometer. BD symptoms in mice improved after treatment with IL-15/15R alpha expression vector or IL-15/IL-15R alpha-Fc protein complex. In addition, treatment with pIL-15/15Ra significantly (p =.016) decreased disease severity score of BD mice compared to treatment with control vector. Frequencies of IL-15R alpha + cells were also significantly (p =.01) higher in peritoneal macrophages of pIL-15/15R alpha treated BD mice than those of mice treated with control vector. Frequencies of IL-15R alpha + PBL were also significantly higher in BD mice treated with IL-15/IL-15R alpha-Fc protein complex than those in the control group. These results suggest up-regulating IL-15R alpha + cells could be used as novel therapeutic strategies to control BD in the future.

AB Innate immune responses are known to influence the subsequent development of adaptive immunity. We have previously shown that RSV infection of human airway epithelial cells results in production of the B cell growth factor, BAFF. To better understand how the airway responds to RSV infection by production of this and other factors to support or enhance local B cell responses to infection, we analysed the lung expression of BAFF and B cell homeostatic chemokines CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21 in a murine model of RSV infection. Following infection with A2 strain RSV, the highest RSV N gene expression was observed at day 4 after challenge with virus. In contrast, two peaks of elevated BAFF expression at days 2 and 7 were observed. CXCL13 was significantly elevated at days 1, 2 and 7. CXCL12, CCL19 and CCL21 were expressed within lung tissue from control and RSV challenged animals but no significant difference in expression was found. Immunofluorescence showed BAFF to be present throughout the tissue however CXCL13 expression was localized to cell rich areas probably constituting lymphoid aggregates. Our results define the kinetics of B cell chemoattractant and growth factor expression during RSV infection and indicate an important role for these cytokines in the airway response to RSV infection.

AB Objective: To compare the expression pattern of angiogenic cytokines in CD56 + uNK cells from peri-implantation endometrium in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage and fertile controls.
   Methods: 28 women were recruited, from which 18 women were diagnosed as recurrent miscarriage and 10 women were of proven fertility. Endometrial biopsy samples were obtained precisely 7 days after luteinization hormone surge in a natural cycle. The angiogenic profile of isolated CD56 + uNK cells was determined by RayBio human angiogenesis antibody array G Series 1000. Differentially expressed angiogenic cytokines between groups were validated by ELISA kits.
   Results: CD56 + uNK cells freshly isolated from peri-implantation endometrium were determined to be > 90% pure. Angiogenic cytokine array demonstrated that CD56 + uNK cells are one of the angiogenic factors producers in endometrium around the time of embryo implantation. A differential angiogenic cytokine expression profile was found between two groups, with significantly higher expressions of angiogenin, VEGF-A and bFGF in CD56 + uNK cells from women with recurrent miscarriage, compared with fertile controls.
   Conclusions: Differential angiogenic cytokine profile of isolated CD56 + uNK cells suggested the role of uNK cells in the altered endometrial vascularity at the time of implantation, which may account for the endometrial contribution to recurrent miscarriage.

AB Epilepsy is a chronic disorder in which immune dysregulation is shown to be involved. Imbalances in the cytokine levels both in serum and brain tissue have been demonstrated in epileptic patients. In the present study, we assessed mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, CXCL8, IL-1 beta, IL-2, 1L-4, IL-6, IL-17 and CXCL8 in blood samples of 40 epileptic patients compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls by means of quantitative real time PCR. The relative levels of CXCL8 transcripts were significantly higher in total epileptic patients compared with healthy subjects (P =.023). Relative mRNA expression of IFN-gamma was significantly higher in female patients compared with female healthy subject (P =.048). In addition, significant correlations have been found between the mRNA levels of mentioned cytokines. Such imbalance between expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines might be implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

ID ORGAN FAILURE; SEPSIS; DEFINITIONS
AB Need for prompt recognition and management of sepsis recently led to the introduction of qSOFA score. However, its association with underlying host inflammatory response remains unclear, while previous studies have challenged its performance in non intensive care unit (ICU) patients comparing to previously used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Between June 2016 and April 2017, we performed a prospective observational study in the medical ward of a tertiary hospital to explore the relation of qSOFA 2 and < 2 to underlying inflammatory response, as this is mirrored in levels of serum pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators i.e. IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. A total of 100 consecutive patients were finally included in this study. Comparable levels ((pg/ml) median (IQR)] of IL-6 [200 (53-200) vs 65.1 (17.3-200)], IL-10 [7 (2.3-170.6) vs 2.3 (2.3-27.7)], and TNF-a [4 (4-46.1) vs 46.06 (4-227.2)] were noted between group of patients with qSOFA >= 2 or < 2. Nevertheless, prognosis was worse in patients with qSOFA >= 2 showing longer length of stay [10 (7-25) vs 5 (3-7) days, p =.03] and lower recovery rates (41 vs 93%, p <.0001). Our results underline the need for prompt management of critically ill patients in presence of systemic inflammatory response regardless of qS0FA score, partly reflecting its low sensitivity comparing to previously used SIRS criteria.

AB Objective: To detect the expression of IL-37 and its receptors IL-18Ra and IL-1R8 in CD4(+) T cells and total lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and the relationship between autoantibodies and disease activity. To investigate the mechanism of IL-37 and its receptors involved in the pathogenesis of RA. To evaluate the effects of different concentrations of rhIL-37 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in RA patients with TNF-alpha, and IL-6.
   Methods: The expression of IL-37 and its receptor IL-18Ra and IL-1R8 in peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells and total lymphocytes in RA patients and healthy controls were measured by flow cytometry. The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the supernatant were measured by ELISA after rhIL-37 stimulation with PBMCs.
   Results: The expression of IL-37 and IL-18Ra in the total lymphocytes, especially in CD4(+) T cells in RA patients, was significantly higher than in the healthy control group. There was a positive correlation between the frequency of IL-37- or IL-18Ra-positive CD4(+) T cells and ESR, CRP, and DAS28 values. Additionally, rhlL-37 significantly down-regulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in RA patients' PBMCs.
   Conclusions: IL-37 plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation in RA. IL-37 and its receptors may play an immunoregulatory role in the activation of lymphocytes, especially CD4(+) T cells, in RA patients. IL-37 may represent a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.

AB Background: Endocan plays an important role in the processes of inflammation and infection. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery can induce an inflammatory response. We aimed to describe the kinetics of endocan in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with and without the use of CPB.
   Methods: Single-centre, observational study with retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, to compare the kinetics of endocan in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Endocan was measured at induction of general anesthesia (baseline), and at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after the end of surgery. Patients were classified into two groups, namely those undergoing CPB (CPB group) and those without CPB (off-pump group).
   Results: In total, 91 patients were included in this analysis: 61 patients in the CPB group and 30 in the off-pump group. There were no major significant differences between groups. Patients with CPB had a significantly higher level of endocan at 6 h (9.7 +/- 6.7 ng/ml vs 6.9 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, p = 0.03), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at subsequent timepoints. Endocan values were not significantly correlated with the duration of CPB (p = 0.53).
   Conclusion. Endocan levels in patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery with CPB are significantly higher at 6 h than in patients with off-pump surgery, and peaks earlier in those with CPB (6 h) than in those undergoing off pump surgery (24 h).

AB Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a multifactorial disease, including the genetic factor, caused by coronary artery obstruction by atheroma. Some genetic variants have been described as risk factors for this disease. Its early diagnosis and stratification of risk of death by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) are important. Therefore, we evaluated variants in the IL6R (c950-1722C > T), TNFa (c.-488G > A), LEPR (c.2673 + 1118C > T) and ILlb (c.-598T > C) genes in relation to TIMI risk, cytokine serum levels, and risk factors for ACS. We selected 200 patients with ACS, 50 without ACS from the Real Hospital Portugues, Recife PE, and 295 blood donors at the Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco (Hemope). Variants were determined by DNA sequencing or enzymatic cleavage. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. The most frequent risk factors found in the patients were dyslipidemia and hypertension, this latter associated with high TIMI risk (p = 0.003). Genotype frequencies of IL6R and TNFa differed between patients with ACS and the blood donors (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.01, respectively), and TNF-alpha levels differed between genotypes. The TT genotype of the IL6R gene is as a possible protective factor for ACS because it was significantly more present in blood donors (32.2%) than in patients with ACS (18.0%), and was more frequent in low TIMI risk (22.9%) than in the intermediate (20.2%) or high (4.9%). In patients with ACS, the TT genotype in IL6R was related to a lower concentration of c-reactive protein (p = 0.03) and troponin (p = 0.02), showing a less inflammatory reaction and tissue damage. The differences in the frequencies of variants in genes of medical interest among the groups show the importance of studies in specific populations groups to establish the relationship between genes and diseases.

It has been shown to be downregulated by histone acetylation and promoter methylation, and to function as a tumor suppressor gene by inducing apoptosis in renal cell cancer cells. However, its relationship with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been well studied. Our objective was to investigate the effect of plasma Sfrp5 levels in subjects with and without CKD. Plasma Sfrp5 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 196 consecutive patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). For the purpose of this study, stage 1 or 2 CKD patients (eGFR >= 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) were classified as not having CKD. With increasing Sfrp5 tertiles, the patients had higher frequencies of hypertension, stage 4 or 5 CKD, and waist-to-hip ratio, incrementally lower eGFRs and serum hemoglobin levels, and higher levels of blood urine nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and adiponectin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an increased plasma Sfrp5 level was independently associated with CKD for all subjects (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.14; p = 0.011). Sfrp5 was also significantly positively related to BUN, creatinine, and adiponectin, and significantly negatively related to eGFR and hemoglobin. When the patients were stratified by age, plasma Sfrp5 level was independently related to CKD for patients > 65 years old (adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20; p = 0.045), however, the association was not significant for those < 65 years old. In addition, Sfrp5 was significantly positively related to BUN, creatinine, and adiponectin, and significantly negatively related to eGFR and hemoglobin in patients > 65 years old. Our results suggest that Sfrp5 may play a role in the pathogenesis of CKD in acute STEMI patients who are older than 65 years.

AB Objective: We investigated the effect of topotecan on injury and inflammation in a model of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
   Methods: Acute lung injury (ALI) was induced in mice by high-tidal volume ventilation, and the mice were then treated with topotecan or PBS. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected to assess pulmonary vascular leaks, inflammation, and cell apoptosis.
   Results: Compared to PBS treatment, topotecan significantly decreased the ALI score, myeloperoxidase (MPO) content, total protein concentration, and presence of inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Topotecan also reduced caspase-3 activation and type II alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, topotecan inhibited NF-kappa B expression and activation in the VILI model.
   Conclusion: Topotecan alleviates acute lung injury in the model of VILI through the inhibition of the NF-kappa B pathway.

AB Background and aims: Chronic viral hepatitis is a prevalent disease with major health implications. Its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully understood. IL-1 beta and the NLRP3 inflammasome involvement has been suggested in recent years, from in vitro data and data from peripheral blood samples. Therefore, we investigated IL-1 beta and the NLRP3 inflammasome in liver tissues in an effort to clarify their role in the pathophysiology of chronic viral hepatitis.
   Methods: We studied liver biopsies from patients with a new diagnosis of either chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) or patients with chronic hepatitis B in remission (CHB-rem). The biopsies were separated in two parts. The first part was sent to histology to determine the grade of inflammation and fibrosis. From the second part, RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA used in semi-quantitative Real-Time PCR to measure the levels of IL1B, CASP1, NLRP3, ASC and IL1RA. The cell lines used in the in vitro experiments were Huh7.5, LX2 and THP-1 in variety of combinations of monocultures, co-cultures and triple cultures with one of the cell lines infected with the JFH-1 HCV clone. From the cell cultures RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA. For cell lines, we focused in the expression of IL1B and NLRP3.
   Results: The expression of IL1B, CASP1 and NLRP3 were found significantly different between our groups (p = 0.001, p = 0.001 and p = 0.038, respectively). CHB patients displayed significantly higher IL1B and CASP1 mRNA levels compared to both CHB-rem and CHC patients. IL1B expression significantly correlates with liver biochemical data in CHB patients (AST: p = 0.006, r = 0.457; ALT p = 0.002, r = 0.497). Finally, mRNA levels of ILIB in CHB patients significantly correlate with the degree of inflammation (p = 0.016) but not the stage of fibrosis (p = 0.362). Interestingly, the relative expression of IL1B in triple culture experiments in vitro was below of 1.5-fold, suggesting no activation of MB. Moreover, no activation of NLRP3 was demonstrated in all investigated in vitro conditions.
   Conclusion: IL-1 beta might play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatic inflammation from HBV, but not from HCV.

AB Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is best known as key regulator in eosinophil-associated diseases such as asthma. While a connection to vascular changes in eosinophil-associated lung diseases is still elusive, recent evidence suggests that IL-5 may have an atheroprotective role. Here, we report an unexpected anti-angiogenic potential of IL-5 on vascular endothelial cells in vitro. IL-5 significantly inhibited fundamental functions of human lung micro vascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) in vessel formation including VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. Knockdown (KD) of STAT5 abolished the direct anti-angiogenic effect of IL-5 on VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation.

AB Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); cytokines are recognized as important mediators in its pathogenesis. In this study we investigated the role of cytokine gene polymorphisms on HSCT outcome. A total of 106 patient and 98 donors were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) based assay for tumor necrosis factor a 308 (TNFa-308), interleukin (11.)-6-174, IL-10-1082, 819, 592, Interferon-gamma + 874 (IFN-gamma + 874), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) codon10 and 25 polymorphisms. Except one in each category, all patients and donors were TNF alpha-308 high producers and the majority were IL-6-174 high producers (93.3% and 90.8% respectively); a pattern that would alleviate any potential biological impact. Patient's IFN-gamma + 874 showed significant association with the development of chronic GVHD. Patients with IFN-gamma + 874 high producer showed an 8 folds likelihood to develop chronic GVHD as compared to those with IFN-gamma + 87 4 low producer predicted phenotype (95% CI: 1.59-40.2, p = 0.01). Patient's TGF beta 1-codon 10 and 25 high/intermediate producers showed a lower incidence of acute GVHD though it did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.065) on account of the low frequency of this genotype in our patients and donors (11.4 and 8.2% respectively). Other factors contributing to risk of GVHD included older age for both acute and chronic (p = 0.01 and 0.02 respectively) with age 24 as the best discriminating cutoff; CD34 + cell dose for chronic GVHD (p = 0.045) with a dose of 8 x 106/kg as the best discriminating cutoff; and conditioning regimen with Flu/Bu associated with the lowest incidence of acute GVHD (p = 0.003) and no impact on chronic GVHD. In conclusion the current study further indicates a potential role of some cytokine gene polymorphisms in the development of GVHD. The relative distribution of high and low producer genotypes in different ethnic groups contributes to their biological impact in different populations.

AB IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disorder characterized by elevated serum IgG4 level, which is mediated by T follicular helper 2 (Tfh2) cell. However, the cytokines responsible for enhancing IgG4 production remain unclear in IgG4-RD. The aim of this study was to identify responsible Tfh2-related cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-21) for enhancing IgG4 production in IgG4-RD. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from consecutive patients with active, untreated IgG4-RD and healthy controls were examined. The production of both IgG and IgG4 were significantly increased by stimulation with IL-4 alone as well as IL-21 alone compared to background stimulation with anti-CD40 antibody in IgG4-RD. On the other hand, the IgG4/IgG ratio was statistically higher by stimulation with IL-4 alone compared to the other Tfh2-related cytokines including IL-21 in IgG4-RD. IgG4 production was not increased by stimulation with IL-4 in healthy controls. These results suggest that IL-4 can contribute to the shift of balance of IgG subclasses toward IgG4 compared to the other Tfh2-related cytokines in IgG4-RD.

AB Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), is a debilitating chronic condition that afflicts over 3 million women above the age of 18 in the U.S., and most patients fail to respond to current treatment options. Mast cells have previously been implicated as both a diagnostic and prognostic marker in IC/PBS. Patients with IC/PBS have been shown to have elevated levels of IL-33, a cytokine released in response to tissue insult, in their urine. We hypothesize that mast cell-mediated inflammation induced from IL-33 may play an important role in initiating pain and inflammation in IC/PBS. A human cathelicidin, LL-37, which is found at elevated levels in IC/PBS patients, was used to induce an IC/PBS-like state of inflammation and bladder pain in mast cell deficient C-kit (-/-) and wild type C57B1/6 (WT) mice. Inflammation was quantified using myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in bladder tissues measured via ELISA. Response rate to suprapubic stimulation from von Frey filaments was used to assess the relative pain and discomfort. Both types of mice increased IL-33 expression in response to LL-37 exposure. However, mast cell deficient mice demonstrated significantly lower levels of inflammation (p < 0.001) and reduced pain response (p < 0.001) compared to WT mice. These findings implicate an IL-33-mast cell dependent axis with a potential etiology of pain and inflammation in IC/ PBS.

AB Gp130 is the common receptor within the Interleukin 6 cytokine family. Gp130 consists of 6 extracellular domains followed by a small stalk region connecting the last extracellular domain with the trans-membrane domain. Whereas the first three extracellular domains bind to IL-6-type cytokines, the domains 4-6 are needed for correct positioning of the intracellular domains to facilitate Janus kinase activation after cytokine binding. Interestingly, deletion within the cytokine-binding domain resulted in cytokine-independent constitutive activation of mutant gpl 30 receptors. Here, we tested the hypothesis, if deletions of the stalk region and/or domains 4-6 of gp130 might also result in constitutive receptor activation. Shortening of the stalk region of gp130 alone did, however, not result in constitutive receptor activation, whereas a gp130 receptor deletion variant only consisting of the three N-terminal cytokine binding domains but lacking all FNIII domains was biologically inactive. Importantly, combined deletion of the three FNIII domains plus shortening of the stalk region of gp130 resulted in ligand-independent, constitutive receptor activation of gp130.

AB Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are treated as one entity but are in fact a heterogeneous group of diseases. If not addressed, subsite-associated variability may interfere with mechanism-targeted therapies and accuracy of potential CRC biomarkers. Little is known about the contribution of systemic inflammatory and immune mediators to subsite heterogeneity in CRC. Our purpose was to compare the profiles of key cytokines between right and left colonic and rectal CRCs. Using Luminex xMAP (R) technology, serum concentrations of eotaxin, IL-1 beta, IL-ira, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFNy, IP-10, FGF-2, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha and beta, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNFa, and VEGF-A were determined in 104 CRC patients. We found the concentrations of IL-12(p70), IL-10, IL-Ira, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF and TNF alpha to be significantly higher in right-sided and GM-CSF in left-sided than rectal CRCs. The concentrations of IFN gamma and MIP-la were significantly higher in right-sided CRCs as compared to cancers of other locations combined. In turn, MIP-1 alpha was higher in rectal CRCs as compared to colon cancers. Taken together, our results show subsite heterogeneity of CRC cancers in terms of systemic inflammatory and immune responses that ought to be taken into account when attempting immunotherapy or developing biomarkers. Additionally, more pronounced TH2 response accompanied by T(H)1 immunity and more prominent tumor-promoting inflammation in CRC patients with primary tumors originating from right-sided colon may constitute a molecular background of unfavorable prognosis associated with this location.

AB Aims: Tear cytokine levels indicate severity of ocular surface inflammation. Previous reports of cytokine concentrations were based on hospital-based studies or non-Chinese populations. We determine the range of tear concentration of cytokines in a representative adult Chinese population.
   Methods: Thirty-nine participants were recruited from a population-based study of Chinese adults in Singapore, and standardized clinical ocular surface/eyelid features evaluated. Tear was extracted from Schirmer strips and analysed using a multiplex bead-based assay.
   Results: Tear concentrations of 14 cytokines were investigated and quantifiable in each participant. Eight cytokines increased with increasing age, and 4 cytokines (IL-4, IL-12, IL-10 and IFN-gamma) were increased in people with increased frequency of ocular discomfort. Three cytokines (MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-13) had increased levels in people with lower Schirmer tests, while 9 other cytokines were increased in patients with eyelid crusting (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-17 alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10 and IFN-gamma). Twelve percent of participants had eyelid crusting.
   Conclusion: Using a convenient collection technique that is a routine clinical test, 14 tear cytokines could be quantifiable even in Singapore Chinese adults without a dry eye diagnosis. Elevation of different tear cytokines may be linked to subclinical aqueous tear deficiency or eyelid inflammation even in asymptomatic people.

AB In the present work, the excited states (singlet and triplet) for three different porphyrins, with and without coordinated Pt(II) complex derivatives, were investigated by three different temporal laser regimes were employed in the Z-Scan technique. Intersystem crossing time (singlet to triplet conversion mechanism) was obtained by a combination of Z-Scan with single or with a train of picosecond laser pulses. These measurements have shown that the excited state absorption spectrum shows distinct absorption behaviors. Also, the absorption cross-section is equivalent to the ground state, describing no changes in the optical transmittance.
   Fluorescence lifetimes and quantum yields were determined, respectively, by time resolved fluorescence analysis. To determine the intersystem crossing time constant, two additional levels were incorporated to the rate equation model. Moreover, fluorescence decays, internal conversion and ISC times have shown a strong dependence in Pt(II) derivatives and their position to the porphyrin ring (meta or para position).

AB A hierarchical structured TiO2@C photocatalyst has been fabricated by using P25 as model nano-photocatalyst and dictyophora indusiata as a natural hierarchical template, which showed significantly higher photocatalytic performance in comparison with P25 and M-TiO2@C. The enhanced catalytic properties can be mainly ascribed to the formation of titanium vacancy and promoted diffusion and transport of substrate molecule benefited from the hierarchical structure.

AB The present letter reports unusual high fluorescence anisotropy of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) prone 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl) benzoxazole (HBO) in water followed by its imidazole (HBI) and thiazole (HBT) analogues. The low fluorescence anisotropy of the acetate compound of HBO in water reveals the key role of the hydrogen bonded cage-like probe-water cluster for the findings in water. Formation of the aquated cluster is controlled possibly by the combined effect of the electronegativity and mesomeric effect of the heteroatom away from the ESIPT site. The work invites further explorations, preferably from computational perspective, for a proper explanation.

AB The kinetic influences of transition metals (TMs) in non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts using ethylenediamine-TM (en-TM) complex are studied for the electro-reduction of oxygen. We exhibit that Ni atoms are inefficiently dispersed, which may influence the N doping as evidenced by XPS and elemental maps. High concentrations of N are attributed to the well-dispersed Co and Fe over the carbon. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the ORR on Co@NC and Fe@NC catalysts takes place faster than that on NC and Ni@NC catalysts. The correlation between the quaternary-N concentration of species and the onset potential with respect to TMs is investigated.

AB In order to investigate the electronic correlation effects in the ionization potentials of small lithium clusters, we obtain accurate ground-state energies using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We decompose both the adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials of the clusters into physical components to analyze the nature of the superalkali characteristics of the lithium clusters. We find that the electron-correlation contribution to the ionization potential is mostly canceled out by the orbital relaxation with net contribution less than 0.5 eV. The superalkali characteristics of the clusters is basically determined by the electrostatic and exchange interactions.

AB Collision-induced dissociation (CID) with ESI-MS was used to obtain structural information on early-stage aggregation of hIAPP (human islet amyloid polypeptide) monomers and oligomers. MS analysis showed that the hIAPP monomers and oligomers were multiply charged. MS/MS analysis indicated that the hIAPP monomers adopt different structures depending on the parent ion charge state. The fragmentation patterns indicated structural similarity of M2+ & M3+ and M4+ & M5+ (M = monomer). MS/MS analysis of the dimers showed that D5+ (D = dimer) comprised M2+ and M3+ subunits, and the peptide bond dissociated in the 15-37 residue region of the monomer subunit.

AB Hierarchical 3D sisal-like CuO/ZnO nanostructures assembled from nanorods have been successfully synthesized by a facial one-step solution with a chelating agent 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA). XRD patterns have revealed that the prepared sisal-like nanostructures show single-crystalline behavior. The concentration of NaOH has strong influence on sisal-like nanostructures. Moreover, formation mechanism of CuO/ZnO 3D sisal-like nanostructures was proposed. The hierarchical CuO/ZnO exhibited high catalytic performance on thermal decomposition of Ammonium perchlorate (AP) determined by TG and DSC.

AB The catalytic reduction of N2O on a single Si or P atom incorporated nitrogen-doped graphene (SiN4-Gr/PN4-Gr) is investigated by means of DFT calculations. It is found that for both surfaces, the dopant atom prefers to reside in the divacancy site. The N2O reduction by CO molecule over these surfaces proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (a) N2O -> N-2 + O*, and (b) O* + CO -> CO2. Our results indicate that the catalytic activity of SiN4-Gr is higher than that of PN4-Gr, due to the more favorable orbital interaction between CO molecule and Si atom in the corresponding transition state.

AB We proved by computational NMR data the effect of donating/withdrawing substituents on the A and B complexes in a molecular seesaw balance. The results of investigations were computationally examined by using binding energies, NMR analyse, SAPT decomposition, geomatrical parameters, AIM and NBO analyse at M05-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. These substituents affect the stability of optimized complexes so that A and B complexes without substituent (X=H) have minimum binding energies documented the greatest impact of donating/withdrawing substituents. Results show the A complexes is stable than B complexes due to the greater ability of pi-pi stacking between benzene-pyridine rings.

AB Nanocluster arrays grown on a graphene Moire on Rh(1 1 1) are an excellent model system that can bridge the materials gap between single crystals and real catalysts. They feature different adsorption sites like edges, kinks, and facets, but are at the same time well-ordered with a small size distribution. Herein, we used platinum nanocluster arrays to investigate the oxidation of sulfur, which is a common catalyst poison, as a possible route to restore the catalyst. We studied the kinetics in a site-resolved manner with high-resolution XPS, despite the complex shape of the nanoparticles. Since SO3 and SO4 were the only observable SOx surface species, the reaction of S to SO was identified as the rate-determining step. As a secondary process, the displacement of sulfur from edge to facet sites caused by oxygen was observed.

AB A simple time-evolution method for nuclear quantum dynamics is proposed in which the wavefunction is expanded in terms of Gaussians placed at von Neumann unit cells in phase space, with an accuracy threshold parameter epsilon. The wavepacket propagation is obtained by solving the equations of motion for expansion coefficients only. New Gaussians are added to the basis set when the change in wavefunction exceeds another threshold parameter delta (>epsilon). From the application to model tunneling systems in one to three dimensions, the present Gaussian expansion approach is able to accurately evaluate the tunneling time and tunneling direction in multidimensional systems.

AB In this paper, irregular sub-micron flaky silver has been rapidly synthesized at room temperature. The product was detailedly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The average diameter and thickness of the irregular sub-micron flaky silver were 200-600 nm and similar to 70 nm, respectively, and the flake-particle ratio of product was over 95%. Further, the possible formation mechanism of the irregular sub-micron silver flakes was discussed. The conductive pastes doped with irregular sub-micron flaky silver revealed a good conductivity of 3.1 x 10(-4) Omega.m, indicating its potential applications in the electronic materials.

AB To predict new materials with special electronic and optical properties can be considered as an effective procedure to design new potential applications. In this article by using density functional theory (DFT), a new two-dimensional structure of antimony carbide is theoretically predicted. Our DFT based simulations show that the proposed monolayer is energetically, kinetically, and thermally stable. By more investigation on its physical properties it is found that the Sb2C monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with interesting electronic and optical properties can be effectively modulated by biaxial external strains and has potential applications in new electronics technology.

AB A series of quinazolinone-based materials was synthesized and fully characterized. Firstly, the third-order nonlinear optical properties of the quinazolinone derivatives in CH2Cl2 were investigated by using Z-scan measurement. Secondly, the photophysical properties of the compounds were determined with aid of experimental and theoretical calculation methods. The results showed that the introduction of phenylacetylene groups on the planar structure of parent ring of 1a reduced the pi-pi intermolecular stacking of parent ring compound, and the formation of push-pull structure by connecting phenylacetylene groups to quinazolinone backbone decreased energy gap of entire molecule. A good NLO response was obtained, that the second-order NLO susceptibilities (gamma) of 2b were 6.225 x 10(-31) esu, which is more than 7 times higher than that of no-modified 1a. Our results indicate that the quinazolinone derivatives were promising candidate materials for future nonlinear optical applications.

AB Quasi-reversible single electron transfer (ET) kinetics of methylviologen partly-included at the rim of 4-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (n = 4,6 and 8) has been investigated in aqueous solution. ET rates were measured by Nicholson method with relatively large potential scan rates (0.9 V/s < v < 50 V/s). ET proceeded adiabatically on the direct collision between the MV+/MV2+ and the electrode surface. The host-guest binding equilibrium at the activation state was not established under the highspeed cyclic voltammetry condition. The non-equilibrium stabilization energy was independent of the size of the cavitands. The activation energy of ET under the partly-included condition was 70-80% of that without any inclusion.

AB The equilibrium structure and thermodynamic behavior of a soft matter suspension of hard-core soft-shell (HCSS) colloids have been modeled using stochastic hard collision (SHC) dynamics [Craven et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 138, 244901]. SHC dynamics includes the effects of inter-penetrability of soft particles while retaining the computational efficiency of hard collision dynamics. The HCSS colloids are characterized using two parameters: softness parameter (a measure of the propensity toward interpenetration), and core-to-shell ratio. In both, molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations, the softness parameter is seen to profoundly affect the effective packing fraction and the thermodynamic behavior of the system. Once we accounted for the trivial effects from changes in the reduced volume fraction on changing softness, we found that the inter-particle penetration continues to affect this thermodynamic behavior. The structural origin of this nontrivial effect likely lies in the loss of translational order upon increasing softness.

AB Quantum chemical computations predict that compression of the methane dimer to an inter-nuclear separation lower than 2 A facilitates a concerted coupling and dissociation of C-H bonds of the molecules to form ethane/ethylene. In this bimolecular, concerted mechanism, ethane formation is accompanied by production of H radicals from each methane moiety that may further abstract hydrogen atoms to lead to ethylene formation. Alternatively, transformation to ethane and ethylene proceeds via stepwise molecular hydrogen elimination, with the first eliminated hydrogen molecule originating from one of the methane moieties, accompanied by an intermolecular hydrogen transfer, and the second originating from both methyl groups.

Copper conductive inks were obtained simply by extracting the xylene layer containing copper nanoparticles from the reaction system. The particles are monodisperse and range in size from 8 to 29 nm and have no direct contact with air, from nucleation to the preparation of inks. Conductive films prepared using the inks have relatively low resistivity after sintering, which enables their application in electronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of CO2 on physical and electrochemical properties of deep eutectic solvent (DES) containing Fe (II)/Fe(III) redox couple were studied. At 25 degrees C, the viscosity of the DES decreased from 690.4 cP to 620 cP (10.1% decrease), and the ohmic resistance reduced from 1867 Omega to 1409 Omega (24.5% decrease) with saturated CO2. The magnitude of the changes reduces with the increase of temperature. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry curve shows that the addition of CO2 has no remarkable influence on the reaction kinetics of redox couple in DES. The results reported here imply that CO2 has positive effects on the physicochemical characteristics of DES, while further studies are needed for being used in a DES electrolyte flow battery.

AB Yellow-emitting Y2BaAl4SiO12:Ce3+ (YBAS:Ce3+) phosphors were synthesized by a sol-gel method followed by annealing at high temperature. The phase purity of the YBAS:Ce3+ phosphors was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The emission characteristics of YBAS:Ce3+ phosphors were investigated by measuring their photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra. These phosphors can be efficiently excited with blue light that induced an intense yellow emission peak centered at 530 nm. White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) were fabricated using the synthesized YBAS:6Ce(3+) phosphors. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of YBAS:6Ce(3+) and the fabricated WLEDs were located at the yellow (0.391, 0.563) and cool white-light (0.265, 0.326) regions, respectively.

AB The potential energy surface (PES) for guanine formation from 4-aminoimidazole-5-carbonitrile (AICN) after adding H2O and cyanogen (NCCN) was determined from quantum chemical calculations using the CBS-QB3 method. Its activation energy was too high for the reaction to occur in the interstellar medium. The PES for the formation of a protonated guanine from AICN by adding H3O+ and NCCN was also determined. Although its overall activation energy was zero, its occurrence in the interstellar gas phase is not likely due to unstable intermediates. When H2O was added to some reaction steps as a catalyst, their activation barriers were significantly reduced.

AB Theoretical calculation results show that electron flow occurs from xanthene to phenyl ring within the Rh101(+) after its electronic transition from ground state (S-0) to first excited state (S-1). Time and frequency resolved transient grating (TG) spectroscopy is then conducted to seek the experimental evidence. Through Fourier analysis at different wavelengths of TG signal and their specific value spectra, vibrational enhancement corresponding to electron acceptor chromophore (phenyl ring) is observed. So the ultrafast vibrational energy redistribution process is detected experimentally and the direction of electron flow is confirmed.

AB First principle calculations have been performed to study the carrier type and transport characteristics of unsubstituted and substituted S,N-heteroacene molecules with different conjugation lengths. It has been revealed that the unsubstituted conjugated heteroacenes are mainly hole conducting while substitution at both ends by strong electron withdrawing dicyanovinylene (DCV) groups turn them into electron conducting materials. This opens an easy possibility of obtaining pair of hole and electron transporting materials in the series of S,N-heteroacenes by simple chemical functionalization.

AB The reaction of nitrous oxide (N2O) with hydroxyl (OH) is studied using high-level quantum chemistry and advanced chemical kinetics techniques. Three reaction mechanisms including a direct O-abstraction, an unusual indirect O-abstraction, and OH-addition/NO-elimination have been characterized. Reaction enthalpies calculated from first principles agree well with those of experiment. Chemical kinetics results show that the title reaction is not a candidate for short or long-time removal of N2O (with an atmospheric lifetime of at least 1 x 10(13) years) from the atmosphere but may play a minor role in high-temperature combustion where it may convert N2O pollutants to N-2.

AB The geometric and electronic structures, energetics and spectroscopy of different complexes formed between cytosine and a molecule of [C(n)mim]Br (n = 2,4,6,8,10) are investigated in detail using the M06-2X and omega B97XD methods with 6-311 + + G(2d, p) basis set. A great number of stable C-[C(2)mim]Br and C-[C(4)mim]Br complexes were obtained, these structures are classified as three types: approximately coplanar, parallel and perpendicular. The BSSE-corrected binding energies of the most stable structures (C(n)1) at the M06-2X method are -108.3 to -97.3 kJ.mol(-1), which higher than the results of omega B97XD. The aqueous solvation environment has an extremely weaken impact on the cytosine interaction with imidazolium bromide ionic liquid.

AB The exploration and improvement of excellent mid-infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is still in great demand. The perovskite-type Sr2Nb2O7 is found to be a good predictor of NLO properties due to the similar band gap and NLO coefficients to KTiOPO4 (KTP). In this paper, we systematically investigated the electronic structures, linear and nonlinear properties of pure and V-doped Sr2Nb2O7 based on DFT. It is found that the V-doped Sr2Nb2O7 doubles the NLO coefficient and exhibits higher birefringence, which is moderate and sufficient for phase-matching. The results are helpful to the further development of the mid-infrared NLO crystals with perovskite structure.

AB The potent antioxidant alpha-tocopherol is known to trap two hydroxyl radicals leading to the formation of the experimentally observed alpha-tocopherylquinone product. Based on double-hybrid density functional theory calculations, we propose for the first time, a reaction mechanism for the conversion of alpha-tocopherol to alpha-tocopherylquinone. We find that a water-catalysed ring-opening reaction plays a key role in this conversion. The water catalysts act as proton shuttles facilitating the proton transfers and reducing the ring strain in the cyclic transition structures. On the basis of the proposed reaction mechanism, we proceed to design an antioxidant with potentially enhanced antioxidant properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The recent advances in the molecular device fabrication have outstretched the exciting applications in vapor sensing devices. This report investigates the explosive vapor detection using the antimonene molecular device (AMD) implemented with the first-principles study. The adsorption of four different explosive vapors namely hexanitrostilbene, M-dinitrobenzene, picric acid, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene on AMD device is examined. The adsorption configurations, charge transfer, band gap variation of antimonene nanosheet upon adsorption of explosive vapors on AMD are studied. The adsorption of vapors on AMD device is supported with the transmission spectrum and current-voltage features. Further, the results suggest that next-generation nanosensor is conceivable using antimonene nanosheets.

AB We have computed the ground and excited state energies and the wave functions of a spherical quantum dot with finite potential barrier in the presence of magnetic field. The oscillator strength, the static dipole polarizability and the refractive index changes are investigated as a function of dot radius and magnetic field strength. The results show that the energy state, the oscillator strength, the static dipole polarizability and the refractive index changes are strongly affected by the magnetic field strength and dot size. It is found that while the magnetic field strength increases, the static polarizability decreases strongly.

AB The Mo0.25Co1.257W0.25S3 composite was synthesized using a single-step hydrothermal method and hybridize with graphene oxide as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation. The structure and morphology of this composite were validated by using x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Cyclic voltam-metry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to survey the operation of modified glassy carbon electrode with the foregoing composite. The results showed suitable electrocatalytic property for the direct methanol fuel cell, as well as a dramatic diffusion current, which was confirmed by the Tafel diagrams.

AB A distorted Frank-Kasper polyhedral structure (A) as the putative global minimum was identified for the neutral and charged V-17 clusters by using the Monte Carlo basin-hopping algorithm based on semi-empirical Gupta potential and density functional theory calculations. The cationic V-17(+) cluster reproduces well the experimental infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy, and the calculated adiabatic ionization potentials and electron affinities of the A structure are close to its experimental values. It is also found that the shell-closed V-17(+) structure can be stabilized by 20 delocalized 3e-2e and 4 delocalized 6e-2e sigma bonds on the outer shell and 12 delocalized 4e-2e sigma bonds on the inner shell. Our results will inevitably stimulate future theoretical and experimental studies for the design and exploration of largely nanoscale materials.

AB Molecular dynamics is utilized to investigate the effect of moisture content on the molecular structure and bonding in the interlayer region between calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and graphene oxide sheet functionalized by deprotonated carboxyl (COO), hydroxyl (C-OH), epoxy (C-O-C) group. The interfacial bonding is dependent on Ca-O-COO, Ca-O-C-(OH), and Ca-O-C-(O)-(C) bond as well as H-bond. These interlayered chemical bonds are sensitive to interlayer water and both of them can be degraded by moisture content increasing, resulting in a decrease in failure strength of GO/C-S-H composite. Among these interlayer chemical bonds, Ca-O-COO bond possesses the highest strength and stability.

AB Low-molecular-weight heparin and ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin are widely used as anticoagulant and antithrombotic drugs. An atmospheric pressure dielectric-barrier discharge procedure was developed to depolymerize heparin to low-or ultra-low-molecular-weight fragments. Dielectric-barrier discharge treatment of heparin resulted in several well-separated and uniform fragments. The structural character of digested fragments below 3,000 Da was elucidated. Expected digestion products such as sulfated disaccharide, sulfated tetrasaccharide, and pentasaccharides with alternatingly-linked N-acetyl glucosamine and iduronic acid were detected. The anticoagulant potential of the digested heparin was tested. The results indicated that dielectric-barrier discharge treatment can produce various molecular weight (MW) heparin fragments and maintain anticoagulant potency.

AB A "green" synthesis alternative for Au nanoparticles (NPs) is reported using an aqueous media, environmental friendly reducing agents and the replacement of alkytrimethylammonium halides by biocompatibles molecules. The usage of an extract from the alga Egregia sp. intrinsically provides with biomolecules for the shell formation around the Au NPs to aid for their biocompatibility. The detailed analysis presented here allows to elucidate the double role played by the algae extract as the reducing agent and as the stabilizing capping shell for the Au NPs colloid. The optimized parameters to obtain a narrow size distribution of Au NPs are elucidated.

AB Calculation of the gas phase proton affinity of CH4, PA(CH4), involves characterisation of the CH5+ ion whose fluxional nature requires reevaluation of some assumptions routinely made for more normal molecules. Here we determine the PA(CH4; 0 K) using quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (QDMC) simulations on a previously developed CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ potential energy surface for CH5+. We obtain a value of 542.4 kJ/mol in reasonable agreement with the most recent measurements. The results obtained from standard thermochemical methods, and the limitations of these methods, are also discussed.

AB The submillimeter spectrum of the CrP radical (X-4 Sigma(-)) has been recorded using direct absorption techniques in the frequency range 347-545 GHz. This study is the first pure rotational measurement of a metal-phosphide species. CrP was synthesized in an AC discharge in argon by the reaction of gas-phase chromium with phosphorus vapor, produced by a novel source. Twelve rotational transitions of CrP were measured, each consisting of four fine structure components. The spectra were analyzed using a Hund's case (b) Hamiltonian, and rotational, spin-spin, and spin-rotation constants determined. The 3d phosphides appear to resemble the corresponding nitrides in terms of bonding.

AB Room-temperature ionic liquids based on the bis ((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)-imide anion with the tributyl phosphate (TBP) system employed to extract lithium ion from salt lake brine with a high Mg/Li ratio. The influences of cation structure, concentration of ionic liquid and phase ratio on extraction efficiency were investigated. Results indicated that N-butyl pyridinium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide (BD) has high extraction efficiency for lithium; tributylmethylammomium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide (JA) has lower extraction efficiency for lithium and impurity ions but exhibits better selectivity; when cation exchange mechanism occurs during solvent extraction by using ionic liquids as a synergistic extraction agent, the cation more hydrophobic was, the more difficult for it to enter the solution exchange process.

AB We investigated the effect of both lanthanum and strontium deficiencies upon the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 mixed-valence manganite. Lacunar powder oxides La-0.7 x square x Sr0.3MnO3 and La-0.7 x square x Sr0.3MnO3 (x= 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05), where square is a vacancy, were prepared by the sol-gel technique by sintering at 750 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Our synthetized samples crystallize in a rhomboedrically distorted perovskite structure with space group R-3C. Both these series of samples are ferromagnets and undergo second order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition with decreasing temperature. Magnetization measurements versus magnetic applied field at low temperature confirm the ferromagnetic behavior of our lacunars samples. Curie temperature decrease with increasing vacancy content for strontitum-deficient samples, while, its shows a maximum at about x = 0.01 (T-c = 358 K) followed by a minimum for x = 0.03 (T-c = 336 K) for lanthanum- deficient compounds. All compounds undergo a large magnetocaloric effect and have consequently potential applications in magnetic refrigeration domain around room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

ID SCATTERING; SUBSTRATE; GRAPHENE; NUMBER
AB Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was used to grow large area and layer controllable WS2 film. Our results show that the as grown WS2 film is an excellent substrate for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The Raman enhancement effect depends crucially on the layer number of WS2 film: monolayer WS2 offers the strongest Raman signal, and the Raman enhancement effect gradually decreases with the increase in the layer number of WS2 . Further analysis indicates that this transition originates from the charge transfer yield between the R6G molecules and the underlying WS2 substrate. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To explore the supply of emergency contraception (EC) from Australian community pharmacies after the introduction of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and to explore pharmacists' knowledge, decision-making, attitudes and beliefs surrounding supplying EC.
   Study design: A mixed-methods approach of mystery shopping with structured interview was employed. From August to November 2017, 20 pharmacy students mystery-shopped 10 community pharmacies in metropolitan Sydney, Australia, requesting "the morning after pill." Each pharmacy was visited five times with varying scenarios. Structured interviews were conducted immediately postvisit. Visit data were analyzed descriptively and comparatively. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and categorically analyzed.
   Results: Of 50 planned visits, 43 were analyzed. EC was supplied in 38 requests by pharmacists (54% male). Levonorgestrel (LNG) was more frequently supplied than UPA (74% vs. 26%). UPA was only supplied when intercourse occurred >72 h prior. Directions for use were provided in 35 supplies. No difference in questioning or counseling was found based on sex of requester. Female pharmacists provided more counseling points (MED=4 [IQR=4-5] vs. MED=3 [IQR=0-4]; p<.01). Two pharmacists asked all guideline questions, and no pharmacist provided all guideline counseling points. Interviews elicited supply guidelines, regulatory and clinical knowledge, financial considerations, privacy and stock availability as factors influencing EC supply.
   Conclusions: EC was supplied in accordance with local legislation in all instances, with the majority supplied within the licensed timeframe for each EC formulation ; LNG was supplied more frequently than UPA. UPA was only supplied in the 72-120-h timeframe. Clinical and regulatory knowledge, availability and cost to consumer were identified as factors influencing supply. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Chemokines are mostly known for their chemotactic properties, and less for their ability to direct the biological function of target cells, including T cells. The current review focuses on a key chemokine named CXCL10 and its role in directing the migratory propertied and biological function of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the context of cancer and inflammatory autoimmunity.
   CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is abundant on CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and NK cells. It has three known ligands: CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. Different studies, including those coming form our laboratory, indicated that aside of attracting CD8 + and CD4 + effector T cells to tumor sites and sites of inflammation CXCL10 directs the polarization and potentiates the biological function of these cells. This makes CXCL10 a "key driver chemokine" and a valid target for therapy of autoimmune diseases such as Inflammatory Bowl's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid arthritis and others. As for cancer this motivated different groups, including our group to develop CXCL10 based therapies for cancer due to its ability to enhance T-dependent anti cancer immunity. The current review summarizes these findings and their potential translational implication.

AB Chemokines are important proteins involved in the regulation of directed leukocyte migration during inflammation and the homeostatic homing of immune cells. In addition, they play a role in angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, organogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the chemokine/chemokine receptor network is highly complex and needs to be tightly controlled. An important mechanism of fine-tuning chemokine activity and reducing its apparent redundancy is post-translational modification (PTM) of chemokines and their receptors. Under inflammatory conditions, enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), plasmin, CD13, CD26, and peptidylarginine deiminases (PADS) and protein-modifying agents, such as peroxynitrite, are upregulated and released and may provoke truncation, degradation, nitration or citrullination of chemokines. Most modified chemokines show altered biological activity. This review reports how PTMs influence the biological functions of chemokines, with special attention for the impact beyond chemotaxis.

In this review we will extend the findings that chemokines participate actively in the neoplastic process, and consider the contribution of CCL5 activation of CCR5 on breast cancer cells to upregulation of anabolic metabolic events that would support the energy demands of cell replication and proliferation.

AB Migration of leukocytes is typically mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) upon activation by specific ligands that range from small peptides, chemokines to a variety of lipidic molecules. The heptahelical receptors are highly dynamic structures and the signaling efficiency largely depends on the discrete contact with the ligand. In addition, several allosteric modulators of receptor activity have been reported, which do not induce migration by themselves. Another important mechanism modulating the activity of GPCRs is their local environment. Not only the membrane lipid composition influences the activity, but also direct binding of lipids, in particular cholesterol, was shown to alter receptor signaling properties. Recent findings indicate that also chemokine receptor activity is modulated by membrane lipids. In this short review we discuss this new paradigm and potential consequences for chemokine-induced migration.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) and its major metabolites, hydroxyibuprofen (OH-IBU) and carboxyibuprofen (CA-IBU) were monitored from November 2015 to March 2017 at four full-scale constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow treating municipal wastewater in the Czech Republic. During the seven sampling campaigns, all three compounds were identified in high concentrations in the inflowing raw wastewater. The average inflow concentrations of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU amounted to 14.6, 18.3 and 36.4 mu g l(-1). The ratio between IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU is in agreement with the previously published results indicating that the ibuprofen metabolites occur in higher concentration in the raw wastewater than the parent compound with CA-IBU exhibiting the highest concentrations. The outflow concentrations off studied compounds decreased and removal amounted to 44.7%, 29.3% and 47.5% for IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU, respectively. The results are in line with general fact that ibuprofen and its metabolites are not removed with high efficiency in anoxic or anaerobic conditions and that OH-IBU is the least removed compound. The areal loadings of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU averaged 0.425, 0.574 and 0.999 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The annual loads of all forms of ibuprofen varied between 458 and 958 g year(-1) among four studies constructed wetlands.

AB The nutrient stoichiometry in fine roots plays an important role in terrestrial carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, but how it changes with stand age in forests is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated fine root C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations and age sequence ratios (10-, 25-, and 40-year stands) of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. (evergreen) and Robinia pseudoacacia Linn. (deciduous) forests on the Loess Plateau, China. Fine root C, N, and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were 22, 23, and 32% greater in 40-year stands than in 10-year stands, respectively, but did not differ significantly in P. tabulaeformis stands of different ages. Fine root P and C:P of both tree species significantly differed with respect to stand age. Fine root C:P and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were lower in 10- and 25-year stands than in 40-year stands. The age-related patterns of C, N, and C:N in fine roots were similar to those in green leaves. Fine root N:P of R. pseudoacacia was positively related to soil N:P. Our results suggest that stand age (temporal factor) plays a key role in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry in temperate forests. Differences in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry between P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia suggest that the nutrient-use strategy in evergreen tree forests is more conservative than in deciduous tree forests as age increases.

AB The green infrastructure (GI) is a network of natural and semi-natural areas with environmental features that is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. The concept has roots in the former hierarchical system of ecological networks. There are several examples of GIs, but details of their implementation at a landscape level are often missing or they have been used non-systematically. Here, we demonstrate opportunities for landscape-level implementation of GIs based on spatial analysis through the application of ecological engineering or other measures. Using maps and expert evaluations of different land-use types, we created a methodology for national-scale determination of Estonia's GI. Based on spatially explicit datasets (e.g., land cover, soils, topography, roads), we determined the proportions of greenness and brownness (primarily anthropogenic) landscape indices. Areas with the highest greenness values served as the GI's core areas, whereas areas with the greatest anthropogenic composition represented the brown infrastructure. Identification and classification of hotspots where the two infrastructures are in conflict (e.g., construction, mining areas, roads, settlements, airports, power lines, wind turbines) revealed locations where ecological engineering and other measures are needed to mitigate or eliminate the conflict. Developing spatially explicit models of the conflicts between the infrastructures represents a new approach in landscape planning and environmental management that links coarse-scale landscape planning and regional landscape plans with more detailed local landscape plans that support the design of site-specific ecological engineering and other measures. We demonstrate that the implementation of GIs is inseparably connected with ecological engineering and landscape-scale planning.

AB River infrastructure poses a serious threat to diverse and productive fish stocks in many tropical river-floodplain systems; particularly the Lower Mekong River, where the fisheries are vital for food security. Dams and weirs block fish migration pathways and prevent access to feeding, spawning or nursery habitat. Fishways are becoming increasingly important for mitigating the effects of barriers; however, knowledge regarding their effectiveness for the biodiverse tropical river systems is still scant. This study examined the effectiveness of differing low-cost fishway designs for rehabilitating degraded floodplain fisheries in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) in Laos: (1) vertical slot; (2) submerged orifice - 150 mm square opening; and (3) submerged orifice - 300 mm square opening. Day and night in situ field experiments were undertaken to compare the abundance, biomass, species richness and size range of fish able to pass through each design with relatively low drops between pools (i.e. 150 mm each) and low water velocities (i.e. 1.71 ms(-1)). Passage of a total of 73 species was supported by the fishway designs at a similar abundance, biomass, species richness and size range of fish, during both the day and night; although, the vertical slot design supported a different suite of fish species to that of the other two designs during the day. This suggests that each of these fishway designs could be successfully used to support the rehabilitation of fisheries in the LMB and potentially other large tropical river systems with relatively diverse migratory fish communities and variable hydrological characteristics. However, the vertical slot provides greater design and operational flexibility over the submerged orifice designs particularly in tropical systems with inherently variable hydrology. The final fishway design choice ultimately depends on the fish species and size classes being prioritised for restoration and the unique hydrological characteristics of the site.

AB The root system of plants grown in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs), although it favors the removal of nutrients/pollutants from the wastewater under treatment, can contribute to the clogging of these systems. The objective of this work was therefore to evaluate the influence of Vetiver and Tifton 85 grass roots on the process of clogging and extraction of nutrients/pollutants in HSSF CWs. The drainable porosity in the medium was quantified before planting and after 250 days of cultivating the above-mentioned grass, having obtained the volume, productivity and nutrient extraction of the roots and shoots of these plants. There was a reduction in the porosity of the medium in the HSSF CWs due to the development of roots of the Vetiver and Tifton 85 grasses in the medium, however these roots occupied only 3.07 and 4.11% of the total pore space, respectively, and therefore are not factors of great influence in clogging process. HSSF CWs cultivated with Vetiver grass presented higher extractions of K and P by the roots, especially when the medium saturating solution presented greater availability of nutrients. On the other hand, higher extraction capacity of nutrients/pollutants was presented by the Tifton 85 shoots.

AB Surface-flow constructed wetlands (CWs) are potential cost-efficient solutions to mitigate phosphorus (P) loads from agricultural areas to surface waters. Hydraulic and phosphorus loading rates (HLR and PLR) are critical parameters that regulate P retention in these systems. The present study aimed to assess P retention from agricultural drainage discharge by three new CWs in Denmark during three years. The CWs presented different geologies, and received event-driven drainage discharge. The relations of HLR, PLR, dominant P forms, and iron (Fe) inputs to P retention were also investigated. The drainage discharge varied seasonally and average annual HLR ranged from 17 to 60 m yr(-1) for the three CWs. PLR varied concomitantly to HLR with average annual PLR from 2.8 to 13.5 g m(-2) yr(-1), where specific total P (TP) retention followed its variations. Specific TP retention responded differently to HLR and PLR in the CWs, depending on the dominant P forms at the inlet water. The CWs worked as P sinks and presented similar or higher retentions than other Nordic CWs with similar loads. PLR explained most of the variation in specific TP retention (52-72%), whereas HLR only explained 20-34%. Specific TP retention responded more promptly to PLR when the inlet water was dominated by particulate P (PP), since it is more easily retained than dissolved P. TP retention efficiency varied more irregularly and the annual retention ranged from 24 to 66%. It presented weak correlations to HLR and PLR, and depended on the dominant P forms and major retention mechanisms, as well as P biogeochemical stability. Thus, increasing TP retention efficiency occurred under higher stability of sediment bound P, as supported by higher total Fe:PP molar ratios at the inlet water. The supply of P sorbents by drainage discharge, soil redox conditions and Fe:P molar ratios are considered key parameters controlling the biogeochemical stability of P, and thus the long-term P retention performance in CWs.

AB The development of easy-to-perform techniques for unclogging of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF-CW) is essential to make them operationally simpler and increase their useful life. The objective of this work was to evaluate the drainable porosity, the extension of the bed presenting surface runoff and the characterization and quantification of the constituent solids clogging the porous medium of the HSSF-CW, after they were drained and submitted to different rest periods. Three systems were evaluated measuring 1.0 m wide and 4.0 m long, with 0.25 m working depth; one was cultivated with Vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides), the other with Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) and a control, in which no plant species were cultivated, where all were used for the treatment of municipal wastewater and presented conditions of partially clogged porous medium. After drainage of the system, the drainable porosity of the porous medium increased exponentially with the rest time during which they remained unsaturated, where the control and the HSSF-CW cultivated with Tifton 85 grass tended to stabilize. There was an increase in porosity of 18, 19 and 39% in relative to the initial porosity for the control HSSF-CW and those cultivated with the Tifton 85 and Vetiver grasses, respectively. Surface runoff in the HSSF-CW bed stopped completely between the 7th and 13th days after draining. However, no change was observed in the volatile solids content in the clogging material of the porous medium due to drainage of the HSSF-CWs.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two ornamental plants in monoculture and polyculture horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands for treating wastewater. Two pilot-scale HSSF systems each with a surface area of 4.5 m(2) were operated over two years (2015 and 2016); a) one was planted with a mixture of Cyperus papyrus and Zantedeschia aethiopica (HSSF-Cyp/Zant), and b) the other was planted only with Cyperus papyrus (HSSF-Cyp). To compare the performance between monoculture and polyculture systems, in situ parameters and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5)), total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) and pathogens (fecal coliform (FC) and total coliform (TC)) removal efficiencies were evaluated. Moreover, growth characteristics, biomass production and nutrients uptake of different plants used in HSSF systems were also compared. The removal efficiencies of organic matter, suspended solids, nutrients and pathogens during the operational years were above 60%, 90%, 10% and 1.8 Log most probable number (MPN)/100 mL, respectively, without significant differences between HSSF-Cyp/Zant and HSSF-Cyp. The biomass production and the density of both HSSF systems fluctuated between 19.7 and 21.5 kg dry weight (DW)/m(2) and 454-684 individuals/m(2). Regarding the nutrient content of different plants used, Zantedeschia aethiopica, which was planted in the polyculture system, had the highest TN and TP content in all plants tissues (59.6 g N/kg.DW and 8.28 g P/kg.DW, respectively). However, TN and TP mass balances determined that the effect of monoculture and polyculture systems was not significant. Despite these results, polyculture CWs represent a good alternative of treatment system because they provide social benefits to the community such the improving of the system landscape and a better habitat quality. Moreover, some authors reported that polyculture system enhance the resistance to environmental stress and disease and the system landscape.

AB This study was carried out to investigate the phytoremediation ability of Phragmites australis to remove cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) from contaminated water, to study the effect of pH and salinity on the removal of cadmium, lead, and nickel, and to estimate the pattern of accumulation of these metals in the roots, shoots, and leaves of the plant. The experiments were carried out in a deep-water hydroponic system and 5 mg/L was used as a concentration of each of the heavy metals. The results of the study showed that P. australis had a residual of 7% (93% removal) of cadmium, 5% (95% removal) of lead and 16% (84% removal) of nickel over a 6-week period. In the control experiment, there was a residual of 96% (4% removal) for both cadmium and lead and 89% (11% removal) for nickel over a 6-week period. There was no major effect of pH on the removal of cadmium except at pH10, which led to a slightly reduced removal of cadmium (89% removal). Also, there was no major effect of pH on the removal of lead, however, there was the enhanced removal of nickel at pH10 (93% removal). The major mechanisms employed by the plant were probably phytostabilization on the basis of the calculated Biological Concentration Factor (BCF) - metal concentration ratio of plant root to soil; and Translocation Factor (TF) - metal concentration ratio of plants shoots to roots.

AB To demonstrate the feasibility of Enhanced Pond and Wetland (EPW) system for the treatment of Biological Trickling Filter (BTF) effluent, pilot-scale EPW systems were installed and operated in New Zealand climate conditions. The system consisted of: two High Rate Algal Ponds (HRAPs) followed by gravity Algal Harvesters (AHs), two Surface Flow Constructed Wetlands (SFCWs), and a Woodchip Denitrification Filter (WDF). The wastewater treatment performance of each treatment component was monitored fortnightly over six months (late autumn to winter) in terms of TSS, total and soluble BOD5, nutrients (N and P) and E. coll. removal. Algal biomass production, algal harvest efficiency, and algal dominance in the HRAPs were also determined. The pilot-scale system maintained low final effluent TSS and BOD5 concentrations below 5 and 8 mg L(-1 )respectively, and achieved high removal of nitrogen (NH4-N: similar to 95%; NO3-N: 77%), phosphorus (DRP: similar to 65%) and E. coll. (at least 3-log E. coll. removal) throughout the experimental period. Particularly in autumn, the HRAPs achieved almost complete removal of both NH4-N (5.0 to < 0.3 mg L-1) and NO3-N (3.4 to < 0.2 mg L-1) mainly through algal assimilation. Furthermore, when sunlight U.V radiation was high, similar to 4-log E. coll. removal (10(4) to < 2 cfu/100 ml) was achieved in the HRAPs mainly through sunlight disinfection. The HRAPs had algal biomass productivity of 7.2 and 4.1 g m(-2) d(-1) in autumn and winter respectively, and the algal biomass was efficiently removed in AHs by gravity sedimentation (similar to 80% TSS removal after 6.5 h settling) through bio-flocculation under nitrogen limiting conditions (< 0.5 mg L-1). Overall, the Enhanced Pond and Wetland system can efficiently treat secondary wastewater effluent from a domestic wastewater treatment plant and produce a high quality final effluent with minimum energy inputs.

AB Combustion waste disposal sites typically display unfavourable conditions for revegetation and are nitrogen deficient, therefore the introduction of alders may be promising due to their nitrogen-fixing abilities. We investigated the impact of alder species (Alnus glutinosa, A. incana and A. viridis) after ten years of growth on the physico-chemical properties (pH, SOC and nutrient content, sorption complex parameters) of combustion waste technosols. The experiment was fully randomized with 24 study plots (area 72 m(2)) and included a combination of 3 alder species x 2 different soil treatments: CCW + L (combustion waste with lignite culm amendment in planting hole) and CCW (pure combustion waste with no amendment). Pre-treatment preparation of the disposal site included start-up mineral fertilisation (N: 60, P: 36 and K: 36 kg ha(-1)) and initial stabilisation by hydroseeding with sewage sludge (4 Mg ha(-1) dry mass) and a mixture of grasses (Dactylic glomerata L. and Lolium multiflontm Lam.) (200 kg ha(-1)). The obtained results indicated that over the long term the lignite culm addition did not affect soil properties, whereas the effect of alder species was evident. The accumulation of litter in the O horizon ranged from 2.9 Mg ha(-1) to 3.6 Mg ha(-1) (dry mass). Litter pH was slightly acidic (pH in KCl 6.3) to neutral (pH in KCl 6.7), which is favourable for strongly alkaline combustion wastes. The 0 horizon under A. incana typically displayed the highest content of N, P and K, whereas the highest N content (1.57 g kg(-1)) in the mineral horizon (0-5 cm) was under the black alder. The SOC content in the 0-5 cm mineral horizon ranged from 18.60 g ha(-1) to 28.34 g kg(-1), respectively, for A. viridis and A. glutinosa. The obtained results corroborated findings of a previous study on alder growth on combustion waste disposal sites and indicated usefulness of alders, especially A. glutinosa, for biological reclamation of this type of barrens.

AB Plant-probiotic rhizobacteria with abilities of plant growth stimulation and lignocellulosic degradation were isolated from rice rhizosphere, and were used for degradation of rice straw residues to compost. Probiotic bacterial composts formulated with Bacillus cereus RSDa2, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia RSI6 or Klebsiella pneumoniae RSI9 were characterized and applied in rice rhizosphere that significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the growth of plants. Variation in rhizosphere bacterial community of rice plants treated with probiotic bacterial compost were studied utilizing the metagenomic analysis of 16S (V3-V4) rRNA gene sequences. Proteobacteria remained the most prominent phyla in control and compost treatments, though relative abundance was lower than control. Also, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Acidobacteria increased several fold. An unclassified genus from Xanthomonadaceae family (26.3%) dominated the rice rhizosphere population in control, while its relative dominance was highly reduced in compost treatments. Several genera including Geobacter, Geothrbc, Cellulomonas, Methylomonas, Azospira were detected in all three compost treatments, which were completely absent in control. The Shannon alpha diversity index was low for control as compared to probiotic bacteria composts treatments. PCoA based on unweighted UniFrac distances placed R516 and RS19 treatments close to each other, while, unweighted UniFrac distances placed all the treatments at different coordinates.16S (V3-V4) rRNA gene sequence datasets had been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number SRP9811 under Bioproject no.

AB Living shorelines are nature-based solutions to coastal erosion that can be constructed as salt marshes with fringing oyster reefs. Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0-20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxe (N-2 and O-2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management.

AB Seedling recruitment in many ecosystems depends upon seed dispersal to, and retention at, sites that are suitable for seed germination and seedling establishment. Seed retention has been well known to be facilitated by vegetation structures in ecosystems. In many degraded ecosystems (e.g., bare salt marsh areas), this facilitative effect of vegetation structures on seed retention is often restricted, limiting vegetation recovery. The role of vegetation structures as seed traps may be replaced by microtopographic structures, but the effectiveness of microtopographic structures in seed retention across temporal and spatial scales has been seldom tested, leaving its application value in restoration of degraded ecosystems unclear. We tested the facilitative effect of microtopographic structures on seedling recruitment in degraded, bare areas in a salt marsh ecosystem. Field experiments revealed that most (>= 94.4%) microtopographic structures facilitated seedling recruitment via seed trapping and the number of recruited seedlings increased with the increasing size and depth treatment of microtopographic structure. However, when excluded the effect of size, recruited seedling density decreased with size. Moreover, this trend will be modified by variation rate in depth at smaller-sized structures, when the variation in depth was significant. The stability of those induced microtopographic structures would be influenced by tidal events, thus tidal frequency can modify the effect of structural characteristics on seed retention and seedling recruitment. Our results indicate that, the most efficient microtopographic structures in seedling recruitment will be different at different locations. These findings are valuable in designing suitable microtopographic structures to facilitate seedling recruitment in microtopography-lacking degraded or restored wetlands.

AB Rapid industrialisation, increased rate of waste production, higher agricultural inputs, mining, industrial waste, and contaminated irrigation water are increasing the heavy metal contamination in agricultural land and freshwater sources. These heavy metals contaminated resources are used by humans for food production that ultimately get accumulated in the food chain. Biomagnification of heavy metals can pose solemn health threats to human life, such as mutations, endocrine disruption, nephro-toxicity, etc. There has long been a need for decontamination of these resources and prevention from the further contamination to avert the negative effects on human health. The "phytoremediation" process is a very promising and eco-friendly approach for heavy metal remediation from contaminated sites with some limitations. An effort has been made to present the scattered information of phytoremediation technique in a single paper through this review. The present review describes the fundamentals of phytoremediation including the different associated processes, mechanism, and influencing factors. The mechanism of tolerance and detoxification of heavy metals by plants has also been discussed in brief. The possible amelioration/modification of a particular phytoremediation strategy has been advocated to increase its potential efficacy and further development of these strategies for future reference. The review tries to cover all the essential and adequate information of the relevant published data with some recent advances in phytoremediation approaches. It is recommended to apply the combination of different available techniques or phytoremediation techniques with modern chemical, biological and genetic engineering tools for an easy and effective decontamination of heavy metals from soil and agricultural land. The review advocates the development of site specific, farmer driven, sequential and phytoremediation strategies along with policy support for effective decontamination.

AB The need to expand marine fish production and improve the economic viability and sustainability of recirculating aquaculture systems led to the development of a zero-discharge, marine aquaponic system. In this study, water treatment capacity, nutrient cycling, and biomass production were evaluated in a prototype, commercial-scale marine aquaponic system that included a moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) for nitrification, a sand filter for solids removal and denitrification, and hydroponic plant beds. Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), two species of edible halophytes sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and saltwort (Batts maritima), and organic solids, were successfully produced over a 9-month period. Extensive analysis of solids, organic matter, and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) in water and plant biomass was used to develop detailed mass balances on the system. Simultaneous operation of the moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) and plant beds resulted in high ammonia removal rates, allowing the system to support a high fish biomass density (38.8 kg/m(3)). Passive denitrification was the main nitrate removal mechanism, contributing to approximately 59% of aqueous nitrogen removal. Conversion of a sand filter to a side-stream denitrification reactor resulted in removal of 17% of the daily aqueous nitrogen load and prevented nitrate accumulation in the system. In addition to fish and edible halophyte production, 34 kg of organic solids were harvested from the sand filter and provided to a commercial nursery that used the solids as a fertilizer. This study demonstrates that marine aquaponics is an effective way to simultaneously produce marine fish, edible halophytes, and fertilizer. Addition of biological MBBR and a denitrifying sand filter was shown to be beneficial in situations where there are space limitations for plant growth, unexpected plant losses, or to support high densities of fish.

AB A bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the global scientific production on ecological restoration from the period of 1997 to 2017. This analysis was based on online database of Science Citation Index Expanded Web of Science and a total of 3297 publications was retrieved. The analysis comprised seven main aspects: (1) publication activity, (2) Web of Science categories, (3) journals, (4) countries, (5) authors, (6) organizations and (7) keywords. The results indicated that the annual publications on ecological restoration study have recently increased. The USA play an important role as they have published highly in this field and have been the most frequent partner in international collaborations. American researchers have accumulated most of the publications. The Chinese Academy of Science is the emblematic organization, with 363 published papers. The Restoration Ecology and Ecological Engineering are the two most used journals to disseminate results. The major related research areas are "Environmental Science Ecology", "Forestry" and "Biodiversity Conservation". Studies about "restoration", "pinus ponderosa", "climate change", "biodiversity" and "ecosystem services" have become the main subject of research along the years. Analyses of keywords suggested that there is a relatively lack of information about "soil" and "tropical ecosystems" among the analyzed studies. Overall, this framework proved to be effective to evaluate the recent research trends and to contribute with researchers and governments on management and decision-making on science.

AB River morphology and riparian vegetation continuously adapt to changing discharge conditions, which makes it a challenge to distinguish long-term development driven by natural discharge variation from the impacts of flow alteration due to climate change and due to dams. The aim of this study was to investigate how such flow alterations affect bio-geomorphological processes and habitat suitability of several fluvial plant and animal species. This is done with a numerical model representing dynamic interactions between morphodynamic processes and riparian vegetation coupled to habitat suitability models of fluvial species. We compared a control run with natural flow regime to altered flow for two scenarios with different dam operating regimes, two scenarios with climate change, and for combinations of dams and climate change. Results show that flow stabilization leads to incision, acute reduced seedling recruitment and decline of riparian vegetation. Climate change generates a gradual response, where high flow extremes counteract an otherwise reduced seedling recruitment of pioneer vegetation, while drying reduces riparian vegetation recruitment and causes vegetation shifts towards lower elevations on the floodplain. Modelled habitat availability for facilitated plant and animal species declines most when the synchronicity between critical life history events and habitat requirements is disrupted by altered flow conditions, with opposite effects for different species. Dynamic interactions between bio-geo-morphological processes with somewhat different characteristic timescales create non-linear and adaptive behaviour of morphology, habitat patterns and facilitated species habitat. This implies that only models that include bio-geo-morphological feedbacks can forecast impacts of multiple flow alteration pressures, whereas addition of single-pressure regime effects is overly simplistic.

AB Roadside tree pits commonly suffer from small size, poor soil, and heavy compaction. Their three soil types with different properties, respectively site soil, backfill and rootball, could constrain tree establishment and long-term growth. Sixty-nine soil samples were taken from 19 tree pits, with multiple artificial layers sampled separately, at roadside sites in Hong Kong. They were analyzed for profile characteristics, pH, bulk density and particle-size distributions. Pores were divided by into three classes: (1) unavailable moisture UM at < 0.2 mu m (also known as micro-pores); (2) available water AW at 0.2-60 mu m (meso-pores); and (3) and air capacity AC at > 60 mu m (macro-pores). Critical pore-volume thresholds, namely extreme, marginal and optimal, assessed soil-porosity quality. Site soils were heavily compacted with < 40% and < 30% total porosity, denoting respectively marginal and extreme thresholds, equivalent to bulk density exceeding 1.6 and 1.9 Mg/m(3). The upper soil zone was more compacted than middle and lower zones to generate undesirable surface sealing. Backfill and rootball soils had less stressful porosity and bulk-density limitations. Long-term root growth into site soil would be hampered to suppress tree health and stability. The excessively sandy texture, upon compaction to a certain degree, generated a continuous coarse matrix. It established inter-granular contacts and high load-bearing capacity to arrest further compaction. Some AW pores could be sustained for available-water storage to support tree growth. The findings could inform porosity specification in urban soil management to foster roadside tree performance.

AB Forests often cover a significant portion of a watershed and play an important role in water, carbon, and nutrient cycling. The widely-used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has not been thoroughly tested for simulating forest ecosystems and associated impacts on watershed-scale water resource assessment. Using the St. Croix River basin as a testbed, we examined SWAT simulations of forest biomass, net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water yield with default and improved model settings. Model simulations with the default parameterization significantly underestimated forest biomass, ET, and NPP relative to benchmark data. With adjusted forest growth and development parameters, including radiation use efficiency, temperature control on plant growth, and leaf to biomass fraction, as well as a new phosphorus supply module, the SWAT model's performance with respect to the above variables was substantially improved. These improvements also enhanced SWAT estimates of water yield, streamflow, and sediment loads at the watershed scale. Results of this study show the important role of forest ecosystems in watershed scale water balance and the connections between terrestrial and aquatic processes via lateral water and sediment fluxes. We suggested that watershed models, such as SWAT, should be assessed for both terrestrial and aquatic processes in order to provide credible water quantity and quality simulations at the watershed scale. Calibrated forest parameters and the phosphorus input algorithms will be applicable to future SWAT simulations of watershed hydrology.

AB Riparian vegetation along streams provides a suite of ecosystem services in rangelands and thus is the target of restoration when degraded by over-grazing, erosion, incision, or other disturbances. Assessments of restoration effectiveness depend on defensible monitoring data, which can be both expensive and difficult to collect. We present a method and case study to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration of riparian vegetation using a web-based cloud-computing and visualization tool (ClimateEngine.org) to access and process remote sensing and climate data. Restoration efforts on an Eastern Oregon ranch were assessed by analyzing the riparian areas of four creeks that had in-stream restoration structures constructed between 2008 and 2011. Within each study area, we retrieved spatially and temporally aggregated values of summer (June, July, August) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and total precipitation for each water year (October-September) from 1984 to 2017. We established a pre-restoration (1984-2007) linear regression between total water year precipitation and summer NDVI for each study area, and then compared the post-restoration (2012-2017) data to this pre-restoration relationship. In each study area, the post-restoration NDVI-precipitation relationship was statistically distinct from the pre-restoration relationship, suggesting a change in the fundamental relationship between precipitation and NDVI resulting from stream restoration. We infer that the in-stream structures, which raised the water table in the adjacent riparian areas, provided additional water to the streamside vegetation that was not available before restoration and reduced the dependence of riparian vegetation on precipitation. This approach provides a cost-effective, quantitative method for assessing the effects of stream restoration projects on riparian vegetation.

AB Void space clogging of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) can result in hydraulic malfunction and reduced service life. In this study, the effect of solids accumulation and root growth on the hydrodynamics of the HSSF CWs was evaluated by tracer tests. The experimental HSSF CWs were designed to be unplanted, uniformly planted and linearly planted to investigate the role of Iris (I. pseudacorus) root and the effects of different planting patterns. Results showed that the traditional design of HSSF CW was easy to develop the preferential bottom flow, and the solids accumulation near inlet zone aggravated the fast bottom flow throughout the whole systems. Plant root impeded the upper layer flow at the initial stage and promoted the uniform flow in the severe clogging situation. Consequently, the water flow was more uniform in the linearly planted (dispersion number (d) = 0.16) and uniformly planted (d = 0.13) systems than the unplanted system (d = 0.10) at the final stage. The opening of new void spaces by root growth and the upward water drag induced by plant transpiration was responsible for such phenomenon.

AB Plants are essential components of bioretention systems, with bioretention design-guides around the world providing extensive advice on the role of selection of plants to maximize system performance and sustainability. Four principal hypotheses regarding the role of plants have been identified in bioretention design manuals: (i) Planted systems are more effective than unplanted systems, (ii) Plant species differ in their effectiveness, (iii) Native species are more effective than exotic ones, (iv) Diverse systems are more efficient than monocultures. This paper examines the extent to which these hypotheses are supported by the scientific literature. Comparison of planted and unplanted systems show that increased permeability and hydraulic conductivity, as well as removal of nitrogen, are the main benefits of the presence of plants in bioretention. Knowledge on their positive effect on hydrocarbons remains fragmented, although there is evidence from phytoremediation studies in other plant-based technologies. Choosing the right species makes a difference in hydraulic performance and nitrogen removal, with root traits being identified as important predictors of performance. No scientific results can support the hypothesis that native plants or diversely-planted systems offer better performance than systems planted with fewer species or with exotic species. Questions remain regarding the plant-microbe interaction in the bioretention context, the role of biomacropores in pollutant migration or the differential impact of plant choice on performance.

AB Farmlands are globally widespread and their management should consider both human and environmental needs. In fact, these man-made ecosystems provide subsistence to the human population but are also habitats for plant and animal communities. The worldwide increase of exotic species has affected native communities, but also human activities or health. We used an exploited farmland in northern Italy, where many exotics are present, as a test case for identifying restoration measures based on an ecosystem approach. In particular, we focused on red swap crayfish for its ecosystem engineering capabilities, and examined the factors affecting its invasion success in order to attempt the definition of management strategies. We used multivariate and regression analysis to evaluate the relationships between the red swamp crayfish, water quality, macrophytes abundance, watercourse hydraulics and the fish community. All analyses indicated that red swamp crayfish was less likely to establish in large, deeper and fast flowing waterways, especially when these are deprived of vegetation and less eutrophicated. Based on our results, fish predation was also a significant factor in limiting red swamp crayfish abundance. We thus concluded that a different hydraulic management, which leaves more water in irrigation canals throughout the winter, could be possibly used to slow down or even reverse the invasion process.

AB The mitigation hierarchy is increasingly used in environmental policy as a way of reconciling economic development and biodiversity conservation. The principle of the mitigation hierarchy is to avoid, reduce and offset the environmental impacts arising from development projects by providing ecological gains through conservation or restoration measures. Most of the research on its implementation to date has focused on terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relevance of marine ecosystem restoration in meeting offset requirements. Stemming from a brief literature review on existing restoration techniques for marine ecosystems (e.g. coral reefs, seagrass meadows, macroalgae beds, 'green' marine construction, and marine sediment re mediation) and our experience on Environmental Impact Assessments undertaken in mainland France and in its oversea territories, we discuss the main criteria ensuring a suitable use of 'restoration' practice regarding offset requirements. We then clarify the different levels of equivalence that should be met when designing offsets relying on 'restoration' techniques. This study aims to clarify to what extent the environmental impacts of economic activity on marine biodiversity can be offset through marine ecosystem restoration.

AB Intense human activity in the marine environment poses a threat to marine ecosystem. The ecosystem-based planning and management approach has developed over the past decades with the goal of reducing this threat by defining planning and management of uses in a way that mitigates negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. For oceans and coasts, marine spatial planning (MSP) can further aid the implementation of ecosystem based management, a widely accepted tenet of planning for the marine environment. It can do so by allocating different uses of space in a way that reduces conflicts for the benefit of the environment. Here, we propose an approach to MSP that incorporates principles of reconciliation ecology for the planning of marine (nearshore) enclosures. The approach supports conservation within and around anthropogenic elements outside of marine protected areas. Since human activity typically involves some damage to natural ecosystem, this research contributes by proposing a way to incorporate ecosystem modeling for MSP that includes human activity. Examining areas of human activity under different management scenarios allows identification of possible trends in human-natural ecosystem interactions. Using such an approach increases marine conservation opportunities, and directs educated and cautious MSP in ways that allow implementation of an ecosystem-based approach.

AB The global sprawl of urban centres is replacing complex natural habitats with relatively flat and featureless infrastructure that supports low biodiversity. In a growing countermovement, artificial microhabitats are increasingly incorporated into designs for "Green" and "Blue" infrastructure. In order to maximise the ecological value of such interventions, we need to inform the designs with observations from natural systems and existing Green and Blue infrastructure. Here, we focussed on water retaining features mimicking intertidal rock pools, as this is a widely used intervention in coastal ecosystems. Using a meta-analysis and a qualitative literature review, we compiled information on diversity and function of rock pools on natural rocky shores and built structures to assess the potential ecological benefits of water retaining microhabitats and the design metrics of rock pools that affect diversity and function. Our meta-analysis showed higher species richness in rock pools compared to emergent surfaces on built structures, but this was variable among locations. The qualitative review revealed that rock pools on both natural and artificial shores generally hosted species that were not present on emergent rock and can also host non-indigenous species, suggesting that the addition of these features can sometimes have unwanted consequences and local ecological knowledge is essential to implement successful interventions. Relationships between species richness and design metrics, such as height on shore, volume, surface area and depth of pool were taxa-specific. For example, results from the meta-analysis suggest that building larger, deeper pools could increase diversity of fish, but not benthic organisms. Finally, this study highlights major gaps in our understanding of how the addition of rock pools and design metrics influence diversity and the variables affecting the ecological functioning of rock pools. Based on the knowledge gathered so far, recommendations for managers are made and the need for future studies to add knowledge to expand these recommendations is discussed.

AB The expansion of built infrastructure in the marine environment threatens natural ecological communities at local and regional scales. An increasing interest in incorporating heterogeneity that is reflective of natural rocky shores into artificial structures through ecological engineering seeks to mitigate negative impacts. The addition of complex surfaces and novel habitats, such as water-retaining features, has been particularly successful at increasing biodiversity of marine infrastructures to date. Importantly, key habitat-forming groups, such as the complex turfing algae Corallina officinalis found on natural shores and their associated assemblages are still lacking from these eco-engineered features. Furthermore, whether observed biodiversity increases from eco-engineering are due to native or non-indigenous species remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether adding small-scale complexity (artificial turf) to artificial rock-pools ('flowerpots') on urban seawalls enhanced their effectiveness to increase native biodiversity. Responses of benthic invertebrates, algae, epifauna and fish in flowerpots with and without artificial turf (coir) were quantified. Contrary to existing literature, which reports an increase in biodiversity with an increase in complexity, no consistent effect of coir was seen on benthic, epifaunal or fish assemblages. Native species consistently occupied more than 95% of space in flowerpots while the proportion of non-indigenous species in flowerpots was small (<75% of the assemblage) regardless of treatment, and decreased over time. This result is promising, but warrants further investigation to determine if these trends reflect seasonal patterns or if non-indigenous species colonise early, but are replaced over time by native species. These are important considerations when planning large-scale deployments of eco-engineering features on seawalls to ensure that native species are targeted without increasing opportunities for non-indigenous species.

AB Seawalls made from rock and concrete are engineered to defend coastlines and infrastructure from sea level rise, storm surge and shoreline erosion. However, while they provide a poor substitute for natural intertidal habitat, emerging designs addressing this biodiversity deficit have incorporated eco-engineering concepts with promising results. This study tested whether adding inexpensive household flower boxes (artificial rock pools) to a seawall in a tropical region would support benthic flora and fauna, and whether simple orientation of boxes improves benthic assemblage colonization. Boxes were positioned at mean fide height (1.1 m AHD) along a seawall in tropical Townsville, Australia. Nine boxes were deployed: three positioned vertically on the seawall, while three positioned at 45 degrees facing towards the sea, and three positioned at 45 degrees facing towards the land. Tilting the artificial rock pools at 45 degrees compared overhang walls (simulating rocky shoreline ledge microhabitat) to vertical walls of artificial rock pools. After 12mths, boxes had accumulated (particularly inside on overhang walls compared to outside walls) a greater surface cover of algae and invertebrates. After the second year, box inside walls supported vastly different assemblages compared to outside box walls regardless of orientation, with the most diverse benthic assemblage found on overhang walls, giving support to the conclusion that artificial rock pools on seawalls support more biodiversity (of native species, with no non-indigenous species found) from filling and creating overhangs. The turbid nature of this coastal region contributed to sediment accumulation at about 25 mm/yr, regardless of box orientation, which may pose maintenance problems (and cost) for managers, and if unchecked could negate any advantages offered by these engineered pool features.

AB Increasingly, urbanised coastlines are being armoured by shoreline protection structures, such as seawalls. Seawalls typically lack the complex microhabitats and protective spaces of natural shorelines and consequently organisms that settle on them may be particularly susceptible to predation. We tested whether the addition of complex microhabitats to seawalls enhances the survivorship of oysters, key habitat-forming species on intertidal shores, by reducing the intensity of predation. At two sites in Sydney Harbour, we compared the magnitude and sources of mortality of juvenile oysters among (1) flat tiles, without crevices or ridges; (2) complex tiles, with 2.5 cm high ridges, separated by crevices; and (3) complex tiles, with 5 cm high ridges, separated by crevices. We also compared predatory fish visitation and feeding among sites and treatments using GoPro (R) cameras. The abundance and feeding of predatory fish was much greater at one of the study sites than the other, but at neither site differed among treatments. At the site with greater predatory fish abundances, survivorship of juvenile oysters was 50% greater on the 5 cm complex tiles than flat tiles, and on complex tiles approximately 300% greater in crevices than on ridges. Of the dead oysters, almost all were cracked, indicative of fish predation. In contrast, at the site with fewer predatory fish, there were no detectable differences in oyster survivorship between treatments. These results suggest that the addition of complex habitat to seawalls could be an effective strategy in reducing fish predation pressure on juvenile oysters at sites with abundant predatory fish. A greater understanding of the site-specific pressures is required to enhance the abundances of desirable species and functions on seawalls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of climate change and an expanding human population are driving the need for the expansion of coastal and marine infrastructure (CMI), the development of which is introducing hard substrate into the marine environment on a previously unseen scale. Whilst the majority of previous research has focussed on how physical features affect intertidal macrobiotic communities, this study considered the effects of differences in the chemical composition of concrete on subtidal biofilm and macrobiotic communities. Two commonly used cement replacements, pulverised fly ash (PFA) and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), were used in a combination of proportions to assess how concrete tiles with differing surface chemistries affect development of early successional stages of marine biofouling communities. Controlled leaching experiments showed that although total metal leaching varied considerably between tile type, tiles containing GGBS resulted in statistically lower amounts of metal released compared with tiles containing PFA. Concrete treatment had no effect on the percentage cover or richness of diatoms, but there were significant increases in both over the duration of the experiment. Concrete treatments containing GGBS had a lower richness of native macro-fouling species compared to the control, but there was no significant difference in non-native species richness among treatments. Results suggest that different components can be used to alter the surface chemistry of concrete to further enhance the ecological value of CMI more than physical features can achieve alone.

AB The recent Danish cohort study reported a 20% increased risk of breast cancer among current and recent hormonal contraception users. These results are largely consistent with previous studies. This study did not report on stage of disease at diagnosis, and it is not clear to what extent the apparent increased risk may be due to a small advance in the timing of diagnosis. This study did not report on the risk associated with the use of a 20-mcg ethinyl estradiol pill. They did find an increasing risk in current users of longer duration and an increased risk with use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system-both of these potentially important findings have not been consistently found in previous studies and require further investigation. The breast cancer effects described now in multiple studies wane with time, and in the long term, hormonal contraception use has been found not to be associated with any increased total cancer risk.

AB Objectives: To evaluate weight changes in women randomized to either the etonogestrel (ENG)- or the levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing contraceptive implants and to compare with users of the TCu380A intrauterine device (IUD).
   Study design: A multicenter randomized trial with 1:1 allocation ratio of the ENG and the LNG implants with nonrandomized, age-matched control group of women choosing TCu380A IUD. The primary objective was to assess contraceptive efficacy and method continuation rates and, secondarily, the incidence of common complaints and side effects (including weight changes) associated with use of the three contraceptives. All women were enrolled in nine centers at seven countries. Weight change was evaluated from time at device (s) placement. Confounders were sociodemographic, baseline weight and body mass index, center and time from insertion. We used a linear mixed-effects regression modeling with random intercept and slope. Weight was compared between the two implants groups and between the implants and the IUD groups through linear mixed multivariable regression model.
   Results: A total of 995, 997 and 971 users in the ENG implant, LNG implant and IUD groups, respectively, were included. At 36 months of use, ENG and LNG implant users had similar significant mean weight increase of 3.0 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-3.5] and 2.9 kg (95% CI 2.4-3.4), respectively (p<.0001), while IUD users had an increase of 1.1 kg (95% CI 0.5-1.7) (p=.0003). On adding the group-time interaction term to the stratified baseline weight models, implant users gained 0.759 kg (standard error [SE] .11) and 0.787 kg (SE .22) more weight than their IUD-user counterparts per year since placement if their baseline weight was in the category 51-69 kg (p<.0001) or >= 70 kg (p=.0005), respectively.
   Conclusions: ENG and LNG implant as well as IUD users had a small but significant weight increase with little clinical significance during the 3 years of follow-up, and it was slightly higher among implant than IUD users weighing >50 kg.
   Implications: These findings must be useful for clinicians to counsel implant users which could improve method continuation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Multiple contraceptive method use and prevalence of fertility awareness
   based method use in the United States, 2013-2015
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Fertility awareness based methods; Rhythm method; Contraceptive
   prevalence; Multiple method use
ID WOMEN
AB Objectives: Contraceptive prevalence in the United States is typically calculated according to the most effective method of contraception reported. This could theoretically underestimate the number of women using fertility-awareness based methods (FABMs), including those who use other methods (e.g., condoms) during the fertile window, but the extent of any such underestimation has not been assessed.
   Study design: We used data from the 2013-2015 National Survey of Family Growth to examine the extent to which women report use of an FABM alone or with other methods. We investigated FABM use patterns and compared demographic profiles of FABM users versus other contraceptive users. We considered how to most appropriately define FABM prevalence.
   Results: One in six (16.5%) female contraceptors 15-44 reported use of multiple contraceptive methods in their month of interview. Among women reporting current FABM use, 67% used it alone or with withdrawal, 24% also used condoms or emergency contraception, and 9% also used hormonal contraception or sterilization. An FABM was the most effective method reported for 2.2% of current contraceptive users; while 3.2% of contraceptors reported any current FABM use. We posit an FABM prevalence of 3% (1,113,000 users) among US female contraceptors (2013-2015). FABM users had similar sociodemographic characteristics as other method users, but were more likely married.
   Conclusions: Currently, consideration of multiple method use has modest implications for estimation of FABM prevalence among contraceptors (i.e., an increase from 2.2% to 3%). However, multiple method use patterns with FABMs may merit special consideration if FABM use continues to increase. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To assess the effect of the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable (DMPA) and of the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant on genital HIV shedding among women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
   Methods: We randomized HIV-infected Malawian women to either DMPA or LNG implant from May 2014 to April 2015. HIV RNA was measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) fluid and TearFlo Strips (TFS), and HIV DNA was measured in cells collected by CVL. We compared the frequency and magnitude of HIV genital shedding before and for 6 months after initiation of contraception and between arms among women receiving ART. We also compared genital HIV RNA levels obtained by sample type (TFS versus CVL).
   Results: We analyzed data for 68 HIV-infected women receiving ART: 33 randomized to DMPA and 35 randomized to the LNG implant. Overall, HIV RNA was more often detectable and the quantity was higher on TFS compared with CVL. HIV DNA was detected very rarely in CVL cell samples (4 of 360 samples). The frequency of genital shedding and the genital HIV quantity did not increase after contraceptive initiation with either DMPA or LNG implant among women receiving ART.
   Conclusions: HIV-infected women receiving ART initiating contraception with either DMPA or LNG implant did not have any increase in genital HIV shedding during the first 6 months of contraceptive use. These findings are consistent with growing evidence that progestin contraception is not associated with increased HIV transmission risk from such women to their male partners. Consistent with other studies, genital HIV RNA detection was higher in TFS than in CVL fluid. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   abortion
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article

   Transvaginal ultrasound; Mifepristone
ID ECTOPIC PREGNANCY; ACCEPTABILITY; ULTRASOUND
AB Objectives: To compare transabdominal sonography (TAS) to transvaginal sonography (TVS) in medical abortion eligibility assessment, specifically to measure how often clinicians chose to order additional testing for eligibility assessment following TAS and TVS, and to look for differences by patient and clinician characteristics. Also, to compare patient acceptability between the two modalities.
   Study design: This pragmatic multisite randomized noninferiority trial compared TAS to TVS at 10 New York City and New Jersey health centers that provide medical abortion. Women seeking medical abortion were randomized 1:1 to receive TAS or TVS. Following the study ultrasound examination, clinicians determined whether participants were eligible for medical abortion based on these results or warranted further testing. All participants completed an acceptability questionnaire. We compared additional testing and acceptability between TAS and TVS.
   Results: Of those randomized to TAS, 63/317 (19.9%) received additional testing compared to 15/312 (4.8%) randomized to TVS. After TAS, most additional testing consisted of a same-day TVS. Other tests included beta-hCG testing, scheduled repeat sonography or return visit. After TAS, 13.4% seen by physicians and 27.6% seen by advanced practice nurses (APNs) received additional testing (p<.01). Additional testing was more common in early gestational ages for both groups. We enrolled too few women with a body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m(2 )to make comparisons. Participants found TAS more acceptable than TVS, and two thirds preferred TAS for future care.
   Conclusions: TAS provided sufficient information for clinicians to assess medical abortion eligibility without additional tests for most patients. However, the frequency of additional testing was exceedingly close to our predefined noninferiority boundary. Why APNs ordered substantially more additional testing than physicians is unclear. TAS was more acceptable to patients than TVS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SURGICAL ABORTION; UNITED-STATES; WOMEN; MUSIC; CARE
AB Objective: To determine if offering patients a choice of adjunctive nonpharmacologic pain management during first-trimester aspiration abortion results in lower pain scores when compared with standard care.
   Study design: We enrolled women receiving first-trimester aspiration abortion at the University of Hawaii. We randomized patients to standard care (control) or standard care plus a choice of nonpharmacologic pain management options (intervention). Standard care was ibuprofen 800 mg orally at least 30 min preprocedure, lidocaine paracervical block and anticipatory guidance from the provider. We measured pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale immediately postprocedure with adequate sample size to detect a 20-mm difference in pain scores.
   Results: Seventy-four women participated in the trial and reported an overall mean pain score of 61.9 +/- 27.0. Participants in the control and intervention groups reported similar overall mean pain scores (control 60.6 +/- 28.8, intervention 63.3 +/- 28.5). We found procedure time, complications, provider-perceived case difficulty and patient satisfaction with pain management to be similar between groups. Providers underestimated participant pain compared to participants' own scores (mean physician estimate of participant pain: 46.3 +/- 18.5, mean participant pain score: 61.9 +/- 27.0, p<.01). Intervention group participants most frequently selected ambient music (59%) as the nonpharmacologic intervention. Forty-one percent (15/37) of participants in the intervention group chose more than one nonpharmacologic intervention.
   Conclusions: Participants in the control group reported similar pain scores to participants in the intervention group. Procedure time and difficulty were similar between the two groups.
   Implications: Incorporating patient choice into a nonpharmacologic pain management model did not result in lower pain scores. This approach did increase the patient's visit time. Abortion providers frequently use nonpharmacologic pain management in the United States, and these techniques did not negatively impact patient pain scores in our study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID PATIENT SATISFACTION
AB Objective: Assess if video-based contraceptive education could be an efficient adjunct to contraceptive counseling and attain the same contraceptive knowledge acquisition as conversation-based counseling.
   Study design: This was a multicenter randomized, controlled trial examining contraceptive counseling during labor and maternity hospitalization regarding the options of immediate postpartum contraception. At two urban public hospitals, we randomized participants to a structured conversation with a trained counselor or a 14-min video providing the same information. Both groups received written materials and were invited to ask the counselor questions. Our primary outcome was to compare mean time for video-based education and conversational counseling; secondary outcomes included intended postpartum contraceptive method, pre- and postintervention contraceptive knowledge, and perceived competence in choosing a method of contraception.
   Results: We enrolled 240 participants (conversation group=119, video group=121). The average time to complete either type of counseling was similar [conversational: 16.3 min, standard deviation (SD) +/- 3.8 min; video: 16.8 min, SD +/- 4.6 min, p=.32]. Of women intending to use nonpermanent contraception, more participants intended to use a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method after conversational counseling (72/103, 70% versus 59/105, 56%, p=.041). Following counseling, mean knowledge assessment scores increased by 2 points in both groups (3/7 points to 5/7 correct). All but two participants in the video group agreed they felt equipped to choose a contraceptive method after counseling.
   Conclusions: Compared to in-person contraceptive counseling alone, video-based intrapartum contraceptive education took a similar amount of time and resulted in similar contraceptive knowledge acquisition, though with fewer patients choosing LARC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD) insertion using a newly developed dedicated PPIUD inserter (inserter) to insertion with modified Kelly placental forceps (forceps).
   Study design: We randomized 500 women at five Indian academic centers to PPIUD insertion of a Copper T380A with either the inserter or forceps. The primary outcomes were fundal placement (assessed by postinsertion ultrasound), ease of insertion on a 5-point Likert scale and safety (infection/perforation). Secondary outcomes included IUD status at 6-8 weeks postpartum, assessed by string check, ultrasound or x-ray.
   Results: Between September 2015 and July 2016, 241 women in the inserter group and 239 women in the forceps group completed the study, with 20 women excluded due to consent withdrawal (n=4), lost to follow-up (n=10) and protocol deviation (n=6). Median distance from the fundus was similar (p=.36): 5.2 mm (0-130) and 5.8 mm (0-120) in the inserter and forceps groups, respectively. Most providers reported insertion to be easy or very easy with inserter (n=195, 81%) and forceps (n=206, 86%; p=.51). There were no perforations or insertion-related infections. Complete expulsion occurred in 19 (7.9%) in the inserter and 13 (5.4%) forceps groups (p=.28). The inserter group had more partial expulsions (n=26, 10.8% versus n=12, 5.0%,) and self-removals (n=4, 1.7% versus n=0); however, most retained their IUD [174 (72.2%) and 200 (83.7%), respectively] (p=.01). Strings were not visible at follow-up in 23 (13.1%) participants in the inserter group and 45 (22.4%) in the forceps group (p=.04).
   Conclusions: High fundal placement was similar between groups, with strings subsequently seen more frequently in the inserter group. The inserter's increased partial expulsions and self-removals are likely associated with the longer string. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare 2-year continuation rates in Malawian women undergoing immediate postpartum insertion of the levonorgestrel implant or etonorgestrel implant.
   Study design: We followed 159 women who underwent immediate postpartum levonorgestrel implant or etonorgestrel implant insertion at Kasungu District Hospital for up to 2 years.
   Results: We analyzed continuation data on 145 (92.4%) implant users. The 2-year continuation rates were 93.4 (95% CI 86.5-96.8) for levonorgestrel implant and 963 (95% CI: 76.5-99.5) for etonorgestrel implant (p=.268).
   Conclusions: Immediate postpartum implant insertion of both the levonorgestrel and etonorgestrel implant had high continuation rates at 2 years in Malawian women. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID LEVONORGESTREL INTRAUTERINE-DEVICE; DELAYED INSERTION; BARRIERS; WOMEN
AB Objective: To investigate whether an early 3-week postpartum visit in addition to the standard 6-week visit increases long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) initiation by 8 weeks postpartum compared to the routine 6-week visit alone.
   Study design: We enrolled pregnant and immediate postpartum women into a prospective randomized, non-blinded trial comparing a single 6-week postpartum visit (routine care) to two visits at 3 and 6 weeks postpartum (intervention), with initiation of contraception at the 3-week visit, if desired. All participants received structured contraceptive counseling. Participants completed surveys in-person at baseline and at the time of each postpartum visit. A sample size of 200 total participants was needed to detect a 2-fold difference in LARC initiation (20% vs. 40%).
   Results: Between May 2016 and March 2017, 200 participants enrolled; outcome data are available for 188. The majority of LARC initiation occurred immediately postpartum (25% of the intervention arm and 27% of the routine care arm). By 8 weeks postpartum, 34% of participants in the intervention arm initiated LARC, compared to 41% in the routine care arm (p=35). Overall contraceptive initiation by 8 weeks was 83% and 84% in the intervention and routine care arms, respectively (p=.79). There was no difference between the arms in the proportion of women who attended at least one postpartum visit (70% vs. 74%, p=.56).
   Conclusion: The addition of a 3-week postpartum visit to routine care does not increase LARC initiation by 8 weeks postpartum. The majority of LARC users desired immediate rather than interval postpartum initiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To identify risk factors for failure to attend postpartum follow-up within 3 months of delivery, including social support, intrinsic motivation, insurance type and prenatal care attendance.
   Study design: This planned secondary analysis is derived from a randomized controlled trial of patients intending intrauterine device (IUD) use following their delivery (n=197). Subjects were postpartum from a vaginal or cesarean birth at >= 32 weeks' gestation. We obtained baseline demographics and certainty about their plan to receive a postpartum IUD. We administered validated scales for social support and intrinsic motivation at enrollment. We then reviewed health records for prenatal visits and any postpartum visit by 3 months and performed logistic regression to assess for predictors of follow-up.
   Results: A total of 38/197 subjects (193%) failed to attend any postpartum visit by 3 months. Subjects who failed to follow up were more likely to have Medicaid versus private insurance (92% versus 8%, p<.01). Income <$50,000, no car, younger age, unplanned pregnancy, unemployment, multiple children, missed prenatal visits and late initiation of prenatal care were also associated with failure to follow up. Higher scores for social support and goal-directed motivation were not significantly associated with follow-up.
   Conclusions: In our cohort, we found that one in five participants did not attend a postpartum visit by 3 months. Several socioeconomic indicators are associated with loss to follow-up, most notably Medicaid insurance. Having high motivation and social support is not sufficient to predict successful follow-up.

ID OPPORTUNISTIC SALPINGECTOMY; UNITED-STATES; BILATERAL SALPINGECTOMY;
   STERILIZATION; RISK; SYSTEM
AB Objective: Evaluate completion of partial or total salpingectomy during Cesarean delivery based on intended procedure.
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective study of women who had a permanent contraception procedure during Cesarean delivery at an urban, academic hospital from November 2015 through April 2017. We reviewed all charts of women who had a Cesarean delivery to identify those who underwent concomitant tubal surgery, including both completed and attempted procedures. We compared demographic, medical, and obstetric characteristics of participants by planned and completed method using univariate analysis.
   Results: We identified 122 women who underwent Cesarean delivery with planned concurrent permanent contraception procedure. Thirty-two (26.2%) women preferred partial salpingectomy and 90 (73.8%) preferred total salpingectomy. All women who desired partial salpingectomy had the procedure performed. However, 17 (18.9%) women desiring total salpingectomy could not have the procedure performed bilaterally: nine underwent a mixed procedure and seven underwent bilateral partial salpingectomy because of adhesions, engorged vasculature, or unspecified reasons. One woman had significant adhesive disease preventing any procedure. Among women who planned a total salpingectomy, having >= 3 Cesarean deliveries was the only factor associated with needing an alternative procedure (P=.04).
   Conclusion: As interest in total salpingectomy for permanent contraception increases, surgeons should counsel women who are interested in total salpingectomy at time of Cesarean delivery that adhesions and tubal proximity to adjacent vessels may preclude completion of bilateral tubal removal and discuss alternative options prior to surgery.
   Implications: Interest in bilateral total salpingectomy for permanent contraception at the time of Cesarean delivery is increasing; accordingly, surgeons should counsel patients that adhesions and proximity to large vessels may preclude completion of bilateral total salpingectomy, especially in women who have had multiple prior Cesarean deliveries.

ID LEVONORGESTREL; PREGNANCY; OVULATION; EFFICACY
AB Objective: The most effective forms of emergency contraception (EC) require a prescription or a medical procedure; therefore, provider willingness to offer EC remains critical to patient access. This study seeks to assess whether political alignment of a provider's county is associated with provider attitudes and behaviors regarding EC.
   Study design: We analyzed survey data collected from 1313 healthcare providers from February 2013 to April 2014 at 14 academic medical centers in the United States. Using logistic regression, we estimated associations between the county political alignment of a provider's practice and his or her EC-related beliefs and practices: 1) if the provider is aware of the most effective EC methods; 2) if knowing that a hypothetical EC method prevented implantation would make a provider less likely to prescribe that method because of personal ethical or religious reasons; and 3) if the provider prescribes any form of EC in his or her practice.
   Results: In multivariate models, a one percentage-point increase in county Republican vote share was associated with a 2.9% decrease in the odds of a provider prescribing EC, after accounting for provider knowledge and attitudes about EC.
   Conclusions: EC provides a critical last chance to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, yet women living in Republican-leaning counties may face difficulty obtaining EC from healthcare providers. Programs seeking to improve access to EC should focus on areas likely to have fewer providers willing to prescribe EC, which may be those that are more Republican-leaning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To assess variability in the use of surgical sterilization among privately insured U.S. men and women.
   Study design: We queried the MarketScan Commercial Claims database using CPT, ICD9, and HCPCS codes to identify 658,509 individuals between 18-65 years old (0.37% of total) who underwent male or female sterilization between 2009-2014. We examined annual trends using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We analyzed differences in age, geographic distribution, and family size using Wilcoxon sum-rank and generalized chi-squared tests.
   Results: Between 2009-2014, 422,290 men (0.55% of total men) and 236,219 women (0.24% of total women) with employer-sponsored insurance underwent male and female sterilization, respectively. Annual male sterilizations decreased from 77,565 (0.60%) in 2009 to 61,436 (0.51%) in 2014 (p<.001), while annual female sterilizations decreased from 43,766 (0.26%) to 30,465 (0.19%) (p<.001) over the same time period. Median age at time of male or female sterilization was 38 and 37 years, respectively. The decision to undergo sterilization at age 35 or older was associated with family size of 4 or more individuals (p<.001). Sterilization was more common in urban areas, with 84% of male sterilizations and 79% of female sterilizations performed in urban areas. 79% of men compared to 60% of women who underwent sterilization were the primary policyholders of their employer-sponsored healthcare plans (p<.001).
   Conclusion: Male sterilization was twice as common as female sterilization in this privately insured cohort. Use of surgical sterilization was associated with increased age and larger family size. There was a decline in the annual number of male and female sterilizations during the study period. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the clinical performance (pregnancy and occurrence of pelvic infection) of the levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine system (LNG IUS) in solid organ transplant recipients.
   Study design: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients seen in the Family Planning Clinic at the University of Campinas Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 2007 to 2017 to identify women with solid organ transplantation using immunosuppression who received an LNG IUS. Our routine clinical practice for such patients is to perform initial follow-up 40-60 days after placement and then every 12 months. We analyzed women's sociodemographic characteristics, duration of use of the LNG IUS, continuation and discontinuation reasons, and complications.
   Results: Of the 23 women evaluated, 21 had kidney transplantation and 2 had liver transplantation. One woman received an LNG IUS prior to solid organ implantation (1.7 years, renal transplant). The 22 other women received the LNG IUS a median of 6.3 years (interquartile [IQ25-75] range 1.7-15 years). Seventeen (74%) women primarily used the LNG IUS for contraception; the other 6 desired the LNG IUS for contraception and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) treatment. We observed no cases of pregnancy or pelvic infection. Over the median follow-up time of 49.3 months (IQ(25-75) 15-80 months), 7 women used the same IUS for more than 60 months and 8 women received a second IUS.
   Conclusions: Due to the fact that no pregnancies or pelvic infections were observed in this case series, we concluded that the LNG IUS is an option for transplanted women for contraception and for HMB treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Periodic algal blooms in certain tributary bays of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) have become a serious environmental problem. A three-year observational study of the water velocity, temperature, nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chl.a) in Xiangxi Bay (XXB), a which is tributary of the TGR, was undertaken to identify the mechanisms underlying algal blooms. The results showed that, in the Xiangxi Bay, bottom-layer intrusive current (BLIC) happened in winter, middle-layer intrusive current (MLIC) occurred in spring and summer, and surface-layer intrusive current (SLIC) happened in autumn. The MLIC could cause a extraordinary thermal stratification. In addition, these density currents carried large amounts of nutrients into XXB, thus inducing eutrophication. The Critical Depth Hypothesis (CDH) implied that algal blooms in XXB would occur continuously when the MLIC happened. As the hydrodynamics in the TGR could be affected singnificantly by the change of the water level, water level operations may represent a method to control algal blooms.

AB Biochars and ashes from sewage sludge have a high phosphorus (P) content, but plant P availability is typically rather low. Phosphate-solubilising microorganisms (PSM) have been shown to have the ability to solubilise P from different compounds. The aim of this study was to explore the P-solubilisation potential of different PSM on various biochars and ashes, and the effect of the addition of different carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources on their P-solubilisation activity. The most promising combination of PSM, thermal residue and nutrients was then tested for its effect on plant growth and P uptake in a pot trial. Six PSM strains (four Penicillium bilaiae (Pb), one Penicillium aculeatum (Pa) and one Aspergillus niger (An)) were tested on two sewage sludge ashes and one biochar. Pb.4 and An showed the highest P-solubilisation rates on fluid-bed incineration (FB-I) ash. Pb.4 solubilised higher amounts of P when it was supplied with fructose in combination with NH4-N, while An performed equally well with fructose, maltose, mannose and xylose in combination with NH4-N. Increasing the concentration of the C source generally also increased the P solubilisation. However, when FB-I ash was inoculated with Pb.4 plus xylose/NH4-N and applied to spring wheat in a pot trial with gamma-irradiated soil, the inoculation did not significantly affect plant shoot biomass or P uptake. The results indicate that the amount and temporal availability of P solubilised by the fungal strain from the ash did not match plant requirements, suggesting that further work is required that focuses on further increasing solubilisation efficiency.

AB Recent interest has focused on wetland restoration techniques that introduce a thin layer of sediment onto degrading marsh surfaces. A restoration project in Avalon, New Jersey, received 5-19 cm of dredged sediment onto vegetated marsh areas and 32-82 cm of sediment into degraded open water panne features interspersed within the degraded marsh plain. There were significant differences in soil physical properties between the placed dredged sediments and the buried native marsh and panne soils. For example, six months after project implementation, application of dredged sediment increased surface panne bulk density from 0.22 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) to 0.83 +/- 0.09 g cm(-3), surpassing the threshold required for Spartina altennflora Loisel. establishment. Soil nutrient and microbial properties also differed between placed sediments and buried marsh/panne soils. Notably, buried marsh soils remained microbially active demonstrating the capacity for buried soils to provide labile nutrient sources, such as ammonium, during vegetation recruitment. Results suggest that thin layer sediment placement techniques may jump-start marsh recovery by maintaining native vegetation seed sources, rhizomes, and microbes in near-surface soils compared to other restoration approaches. Examining short term changes in soil microbial activity may provide early indicators of restoration outcome, although, additional research is required to more accurately predict changes in soil properties over time.

AB The number of low-head barriers to fish migration far outweighs the number of large magnitude barriers and thus the cumulative negative impact on fish communities could also be far greater. Removal of man-made obstructions to fish migration is the most beneficial mitigation measure for reconnecting fragmented rivers but is not always possible and thus fish passes must be constructed. Given the large number of low-head barriers, cheap but effective fish passes must be identified. This study measured passage of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) at a low-head gauging weir on Eshton Beck, England, before and after low cost baffle (LCB) fish pass construction using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. The LCB fish pass significantly improved overall passage efficiency from a maximum of 64% to 91%. There was a significant decrease in delay at the obstruction after the LCB fish pass was constructed and fish passed on a greater range of flows (0.08-5.39 m(3)s(-1)) in comparison to before (0.56-1.92 m(3)s(-1)). Fish ascended the fish pass through the low velocity channel (gaps in the baffles) as well as over the baffles, though a higher proportion were detected ascending over baffles at higher flows. It was therefore concluded that similar low-head structures should incorporate this style of fish pass to improve longitudinal connectivity for brown trout and other species with similar passage capabilities.

AB Seedling establishment in degraded Oak forests is often hampered by harsh soil conditions, which may take decades to recover. Translocating the top soil from old-growth healthy forests to severely impaired sites can improve environmental conditions and eventually trigger self-repairing forest succession. We tested the potential of this strategy to enhance the seedling establishment of three oak species (Quercus eduardii Trel., Quercus viminea Trel. and Quercus resinosa Liebm.) in a fragmented seasonally dry oak forest with severely weathered soils in Mexico. We transferred old-growth forest topsoil with and without leaf litter to a degraded clearing. To separate habitat from soil effects, we also moved topsoil from the clearing into the old-growth forest. The effects of soil translocation on seedling establishment varied according to life-stage (acorn, seedling, and young sapling), season (rainy vs dry) and site (clearing vs forest). In the clearing, transferred forest topsoil covered with leaf litter yielded the maximum germination probability rates, which were 7 +/- 1% higher than in native weathered soil. Once seedlings emerged, survival probability decreased in the transferred soil in both sites, i.e. the weathered clearing soil in the forest habitat, as well as the forest soil in the clearing. Furthermore, transferring forest soil and leaf litter enhanced initial seedling growth in the clearing, increasing growth rates by 60 +/- 5% compared to native weathered soil. Increased soil moisture due to soil translocation enhanced seedling establishment in the clearing, but decreased germination and survival rates in the forest. Our results suggest a dynamic water stress mechanism: (1) lack of moisture in soils with poor water retention capacity during the dry season; and (2) water excess during the rainy season in more mesic soil habitats. Given the elevated cost of translocating topsoil and the damage this causes at donor-sites, we recommend considering this intervention only for sites with reduced water retention capacity, prolonged dry seasons and slow soil formation.

AB Groundwater levels (GWL) are a major controlling factor for aeration and organic matter turnover in wetland soils but little is known about this relationship under field conditions. This study tested how the O-2 availability in fen peat soils is related to groundwater levels. The study encompassed five sites over a wide range of land use intensity. Ground water levels and soil oxygen saturation in 5 cm and 20 cm depth were measured biweekly in three replicates per site over periods of 2-3 years.
   The( )O(2) levels were not linearly proportional to the GWL, but changed sharply from anoxic to nearly atmospheric levels depending on the positions of water table. Binary logistic regression analyses (LRA) were calculated for the individual sites in order to predict the threshold GWL for defined probabilities of hypoxic or oxic conditions in 5 cm depth. The GWLs for 95% probability of oxic conditions were markedly lower for the managed grasslands (-116 cm and - 89 cm to surface level, respectively) than for the unmanaged pasture and the sedge fen (- 60 cm and - 38 cm). Hypoxic conditions required GWLs close to the surface (7 cm and - 2 cm for the pasture and the restored site, respectively) while in 5 cm soil depth managed grasslands remained hypoxic even at GWLs of - 8 cm and -28 cm. In 20 cm soil depth, full oxygen saturation never occurred even at GWL as low as 80 cm. Threshold GWL required for 95% probability of oxic conditions was higher with increasing porosity and roofing density. The offset between GWL and oxic conditions can be used for hydrological wetland management, especially for restoration efforts.

AB Land managers need scientifically-based information to enable them to select the most appropriate treatments for reduction of high-severity wildfires in shrubland areas. The soil seed bank is known to play a key role in the post-disturbance recovery of shrubland communities, although information about how it is affected by fuel reduction treatments is still scarce. We carried out a combined greenhouse and field study to evaluate the effects of prescribed burning, clearing and mastication on the response of the soil seed bank and vegetation recovery in a Cytisus oromediterraneus (Spanish golden broom) shrubland area in central Spain. We determined the following variables: total seedling density in the greenhouse, broom density (in the greenhouse and field), vegetation cover recovery in the field, species richness (in the greenhouse and field) and similarity index between the floristic composition of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. We also evaluated how the remaining soil organic cover and depth affected seedling emergence after treatments in the field. In addition, we explored the effect of soil thermal regime during prescribed burning on posterior seedling emergence.
   In the greenhouse experiment, a significantly greater number of seedlings emerged from the soil seed bank samples obtained after burning (1297 seedlings m(-2)) than from the seedlings obtained before burning (775 seedlings m(-2)) and after clearing (801 seedlings m(-2)) or mastication (705 seedlings m(-2)). The mechanical treatments did not induce any changes in the seedling emergence from the soil seed bank. Species richness in the soil seed bank was not altered by fuel reduction treatments. Post-burning seedling density was not significantly related to any of the soil thermal regime parameters during burning. Soil organic cover after the treatments negatively affected the response of the soil seed bank.
   The field study revealed no differences between treatments in relation to total vegetation cover, broom cover or grass cover. However, forbs cover was significantly higher in the prescribed burning treatment that is related with the higher density of seedlings of these species measured in the greenhouse experiment. C. oromediterraneus regenerated strongly via sprouting, being the seed germination rate in the field very low. That suggests that the soil seed bank makes little contribution to recovery of this species after fuel reduction treatments, and the same was observed for the remaining plant community.

AB Understanding the hydrology of a created or restored wetland is a critical component in understanding the overall functioning of its design, and in determining if the original goals of the wetland are being met. Freedom Park, a 20-ha park constructed in Naples, Florida in 2009, includes a 4.6-ha subtropical stormwater wetland treatment system for improving the water quality of the downstream impaired Gordon River and estuaries that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. Subtropical wetlands often present significant issues of sustaining viable wetland vegetation communities because of long wet and then long dry patterns in the wetlands' hydroperiods. The treatment wetland's watershed includes 1766 ha of an urbanized Naples metro area. The goals of the stormwater wetlands are to improve the water quality, reduce peak flows discharging into Gordon River and further to Naples Bay, and provide an aesthetic water park for the public. A monthly hydrologic budget for the period August 1, 2016 to January 31, 2018 showed the following averages: pumped surface water inflow of 50.1 cm week(-1); average surface outflow of 38.8 cm week(-1); precipitation of 3.76 cm week(-1), potential evapotranspiration (PET) of 5.34 cm week(-1); and estimated seepage of 14.8 cm week(-1). During the wet season, water pathways are largely influenced by pumped surface inflow and surface outflow, balanced to not produce significant changes in water level from month to month. Groundwater seepage and evapotranspiration are the most important outflows during the dry season. A stormwater pulsing study during Hurricane Irma (September 10, 2017) showed that after an initial inflow flush due primarily to rainfall, total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations were higher at the outflow than at the inflow for several days during and immediately after the hurricane. Similarly, the mass of nutrients leaving the system was 130% and 37% higher for TN and TP, respectively, than the mass entering the system during this 6-day period during and immediately after the hurricane. Ironically, the design of the pump-only inflow did not allow for major urban runoff during the hurricane to enter the wetlands. Samples taken at the inflow and outflow of the system for four other storm events throughout the 2017 wet season (July through October) were also analyzed for their effects on water quality. While total phosphorus removal during and after storm events is comparable to normal conditions at the Freedom Park wetlands and other stormwater treatment wetlands in the world, total nitrogen removal decreased during and after storm events.

AB Woodchip bioreactors are recognized as an effective best management practice in the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy. This edge-of-field practice intercepts and removes NO3-N, thereby reducing the NO3-N concentration in file drainage before being discharged into surface water. Actual NO3-N load reductions realized by woodchip bioreactors are impacted by bioreactor size, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and denitrification efficiency. A typical woodchip bioreactor in Iowa may have 0.07% bioreactor area with respect to treatment area, 4-8 h HRT, and 43% mean denitrification efficiency. Here, we explored the potential of using electrically stimulated woodchip bioreactors to achieve greater NO3-N removal, and estimated the costs of this approach. Batch experiments were conducted to determine the denitrification efficiency of electrically stimulated and traditional woodchip bioreactors at different HRTs and current densities. The resulting data was used to model costs and denitrification efficiency in 75 scenarios, covering a range of bioreactor volumes, HRTs, current densities, and annual durations of electrical stimulation periods. For each scenario, we reported the estimated annual NO3-N load reduction and NO3-N removal cost. We found that electrically stimulated woodchip bioreactors may remove an additional 37-72% annual NO3-N load than a traditional woodchip bioreactor, but at the expense of higher NO3-N removal costs, which were increased by 138-194%.

AB Microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) has the potential to restore concrete, contributing to a longer lifespan of construction. The MCP process starts with microbes attaching to the damaged substrate, and completes with carbonate precipitation. Tremendous studies have focused on ureolytic bacteria, while this research investigated the function of cyanobacteria by monitoring the chemical variation of solution, morphological and spectroscopic changes of mortar surfaces. By comparing the biomineralization mediated by three cyanobacterial species in experimental solutions and on mortar surfaces, this study concludes that Synechocystis PCC6803 exerted the highest impact in carbonate precipitation under both conditions. Environmental factors such as viability of cells, UV exposure and light intensity modified the MCP processes of Syn. PCC6803 and Synechococcus LS0519, but not Synechococcus PCC8806. UV-killed Syn. PCC6803 brought about the highest rate of carbonate precipitation.

AB In Austria, about 95% of the population are served by 1865 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with design size > 50 population equivalent (PE). Besides, there are about 27'500 small WWTPs with design size less than 50 PE. Among these small WWTPs, the technologies implemented most frequently are about 7020 conventional activated sludge plants, 5560 treatment wetlands and 5240 Sequencing Batch Reactors. About 45% of the small WWTPs have a design size between 5 and 10 PE. It has been shown that design standards for small WWTPs increased the numbers implemented for both technical and nature-based technologies. A permit given from the local authorities is required for operating a small WWTP. If the design of a small WWTPs follows a design standard, the process to get a permit is simplified. Most authorities request that owners of small WWTPs have a maintenance contract with a company and/or that owners/operators have to pass the training course for operators of small WWTPs offered by the Austrian Wastewater and Waste Association (OWAV). Within the 1.5 days long training courses, owners/operators gain basic knowledge on wastewater treatment and thus better understand their plant. This should finally result in well operated and maintained small WWTPs. Since the year 2000, more than 200 training course have been held and more than 5500 owners/operators of small WWTPs have been trained.

AB The present study demonstrates the vermistabilization of paper mill wastewater sludge (PMS) spiked with cow dung (CD) employing indigenous epigeic earthworm Perionyx excavatus Perrier. A total of six treatments were prepared along with a positive control (PC) and negative control (NC). Twenty earthworms were released into each treatment including PC and NC without earthworms. The different proportions viz., T1 (CD - 100%), T2 (PMS:CD - 1:3), T3 (PMS:CD - 1:2), T4 (PMS:CD - 1:1), T5 (PMS:CD - 3:1), T6 (PMS:CD - 2:1), PC (PMS - 100%) and NC (PMS - 100%) and changes in chemical parameters and microbial properties were recorded during the course of 60 days. Vermistabilization caused a significant decrease in the level of heavy metals: Cd (2.9-27.8%), Cu (0.22-42.3%), Pb (1.3-56.3%) and Cr (0.8-46.2%). The bioconcentration factor (BCFs) was also calculated and great amount of heavy metals accumulated in their body (mg kg(-1)) that ranged from 0.31 +/- 0.003-0.45 +/- 0.007 for Cd, 0.12 +/- 0.005-0.24 +/- 0.003 for Cu, 0.15 +/- 0.005-0.31 +/- 0.006 for Pb and 0.29 +/- 0.007-0.56 +/- 0.001 mg kg(-1) for Cr, accumulation of heavy metals are in the order: Cr > Cd > Pb > Cu. The physicochemical parameters of earthworm treated substrate such as electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium were significantly increased; whereas, pH, total organic carbon, C:N ratio (carbon: nitrogen) and C:P ratio (carbon: phosphorus) were reduced after 60 days of vermistabilization. The vermistabilized materials also had a higher population of bacteria (98.90 +/- 0.30 CFU x 10(6) g(-1)), fungi (43.75 +/- 0.55 CFU x 10(3) g(-1)) and actinomycetes (67.65 +/- 0.45 CFU x 10(5) g(-1)) than initial mixtures. Moreover, several histopathological changes were observed in earthworm tissues viz., disintegration of cells, irregular surface of epidermis, cellular debris, irregular cellular compartmentation, and oval-shaped nucleus. Higher level of histopathological abnormalities was recorded in PC (PMS-100%) while none were detected in lower concentrations of PMS. Furthermore, the study concludes that the paper mill sludge in a mixture of cow dung (1:1 ratio) can be a useful proposition for utilizing this hazardous waste through the adoption of vermitechnology.

AB The middle Jinsha River is a crucial spawning site for Coreius guichenoti, an endemic and economically important fish. The spawning habitat has been influenced by dam construction and operation upstream and downstream of the river reach. This study evaluated the effects of dam operation on spawning habitat suitability using a physical habitat model developed by combining a fuzzy logic approach and a coupled hydrodynamic model. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated with field-measured data. The habitat model was able to predict spawning habitat suitability through comparisons of weighted usable areas (WUAs) and the numbers of collected fish eggs. The habitat model was explored to evaluate the effects of upstream and downstream dam construction on spawning habitat suitability. The results showed that the operation of constructed upstream dams had negative effects on spawning habitat suitability and produced temporal changes in the available WUA. The main spawning period may be delayed from May to June as a result, and variations in the water temperature regime were likely the main influential factor. Predictions revealed that the impoundment of the under-construction Wudongde hydropower station downstream of the study area would increase the suitability of hydrodynamic factors. The suitable water discharge range for spawning was from 1500 m(3)/s to 2500 m(3)/s, and the optimal discharge was 2000 m(3)/s without the impacts of the Wudongde Reservoir impoundment. However, the suitable water discharge range would be extended to be from 750 m(3)/s to 2750 m(3)/s, and the optimal water discharge for spawning is estimated to range from 1500 m(3)/s to 1750 m(3)/s after the reservoir begins operation. The results of this study may help to formulate more efficient methods of improving spawning habitat suitability, such as adjusting the rate of discharged flow. Furthermore, the presented methods provide a basis for further research on the assessment of fish habitat suitability in the context of cascade dam construction.

AB Recent years have seen an increasing interest in hybrid constructed wetland (HCW) systems for domestic sewage treatment. This paper is focused on kinetics of removal of the main pollutants occurring in wastewater i.e. organics expressed as chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen. The purpose of the article is to compare different HCW configurations in terms of mass removal rates (MRR) and removal rate coefficients (k(A) and k(v)). Analysed data have been collected at two wetland systems, each composed by two subsurface flow beds: horizontal flow (HF) and vertical flow (VF). Reliable evaluation was achieved by using the same composition of influent wastewater in both HCWs. Performance of opposite configurations HF + VF vs. VF + HF was compared after each stage and the overall HCW system. The average mass removal rates of COD, BOD5 and TN in both systems were similar, respectively: 2.30, 0.98 and 0.40 g m(-2) d(-1). However, removal rates differ between single wetland beds after each treatment stage.

AB Habitat destruction is one of the main causes of the decline of biodiversity and of fishery resources in the marine environment. An artificial reef (AR) could be a tool for protecting or restoring these habitats and their declining biodiversity, and also help to enhance sustainable fisheries. The goal is to design non-polluting structures that best mimic the complexity of natural habitats in order to improve their service to the community. To date, the assessment of reef performance has been mostly focused on fish assemblages and species of ecological and/or socio-economic interest, and has disregarded the biofilm communities that determine the first level of an AR's trophic network. In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no significant differences between the micro-algae communities developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes, haptophytes, and dinoflagellates. However, we showed that the material for ARs is crucial for biofilm development, especially with regard to its secretions of sugar. The choice of an appropriate substrate for AR construction is thus of particular importance since biofilm secretions determine the organic substrate on which sessile macro-organisms will settle.

AB Restoration is needed to recover biodiversity in many lowland rivers under threat by human activities. It is commonly believed that stable large wood provides a suitable habitat for benthic fauna in lowland rivers with an unstable riverbed of fine sediment, as the wood creates benthic habitat via riverbed stabilization. In the present study, we installed large wood in the riverbed to test the stabilization effect on benthic fauna and to assess the differences in composition of macroinvertebrates between the large wood itself (branches) and the riverbed stabilized with the wood. Current velocity near the riverbed was substantially decreased by installing large wood. Abundance and richness of macroinvertebrates in the riverbed with large wood were significantly higher than those in riverbed without wood. Larval lampreys were also found in the riverbed but only with large wood present. Macroinvertebrate compositions differed between the stable riverbed and the branches. Chironominae (midges) was the most dominant taxon in all habitats, collector-gatherer mayflies Paraleptophlebia and Ephemerella were abundant in stable riverbed habitats, and collector-filterers such as Simulium, Cheumatopsyhce, and Hydropsyche in addition to the mayflies were also abundant in branch habitats. This study showed that large wood not only serves as habitat for benthic fauna but also creates habitat via riverbed stabilization. In lowland river restoration, installing large wood could have a significant effect on the provision and creation of stable habitats for benthic fauna.

AB The plains surrounding the northern part of the Xingkai Lake (XL) straddling the border between China and Russia, is a major agricultural production area in Northeastern China. The accumulations from herbicides applied in the farmlands are an important factor affecting the local wetland environment. In this paper, top soil and surface water samples collected from different land use types were analysed. The sediments of a restored wetland receiving agricultural drainage (RW) were tested for two representative herbicides (butachlor and acetochlor). The removal of the two herbicides were calculated based on the herbicide differences between the sediments of RWO and RWI. Results showed that herbicides were widespread in XL area. The highest acetochlor con- centration was detected in soybean dry land soil (117.1 ng g(-1) ) and RWI water (402.2 ng L-1) compared with the average concentration of 121.63 ng g(-1) in the riparian soils of the Sanjiang Plain, and the highest butachlor concentration was in the paddy field soil (140.55 ng g(-1)), which mainly originated from human activities related to agricultural production. Due to the selective removal of RW and the differences in the characteristics of the herbicides, removal by RW was higher for butachlor than acetochlor, with removal efficiencies of 29.9% and 0.5%, respectively, indicating that butachlor was more degradable in wetlands. We conclude that herbicide accumulations do exist in the Lake Xingkai area, while RW used for agricultural drainage treatment can remove limited parts of herbicides. More rigid pesticide controls are recommended for the protection and management of the wetland environment in XL area.

AB Phytoremediation of selenium (Se)-containing Hoagland solution and seleniferous soil leachate using two aquatic plants Lemna minor and Egeria densa was evaluated. L. minor showed the highest Se removal efficiency (97%) in the Hoagland solution with a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 504.35 (+/- 0.83). In artificial soil leachate with addition of 2 mg L-1-MnSO4 , L. minor and E. densa showed a Se removal efficiency of 77% and 60%, respectively. The addition of K2S2O8 decreased the Se uptake by both plants by 40% and the medium pH decreased from 7 to 3, whereas the addition of SO42- decreased the removal efficiency of both aquatic plants by 30%, in which only 3% of Se was taken up by the plants. L. minor was selected to remove Se from a real seleniferous soil leachate which contained 74 mu g L-1 Se and a 76% efficiency was achieved, with a Se uptake of 29 mu g g(-1) dry weight and a BCF of 393.2 (+/- 13.6). This study demonstrates that aquatic plants such as Lemna minor and Egeria densa can be used to remove Se from seleniferous soil leachate and that the phytoremediation efficiency depends on the composition of the extractant used for soil washing.

AB Since the 1990s, the territory of the Sumava National Park (Czech Republic) has faced significant changes in land cover, especially deforestation, in conjunction with several bark beetle disturbances and hurricane Kyrill in 2007. The aim of the study is to review the hydrological and climatic function of the forest and deforestation impacts on the landscape temperature. As a case study, surface temperature changes of the selected area of Sumava National Park from the satellite Landsat thermal data is presented from 1991 to 2016. At the sites with decayed forest, the surface temperature increased by 2-4 degrees C. Images from ground temperature measurements illustrate extreme temperature differences (similar to 35 degrees C) at locations where dead wood has not been removed; in the live forest, they are around 5 degrees C. Further, we show the increase in air temperature is associated with the decay of forest stands, including snow melting. The duration of the permanent snow cover on the mountaintops with the growing forest in the last four years is, on average, 11 days longer than the areas with decayed forest. The results show that the increase in surface temperature in the large area causes changes in the local climate and hydrological regime. These changes may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystems, including the Sumava wetlands and peat bogs belonging to the Ramsar sites.

AB Large mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.

AB Increased adoption of denitrifying bioreactors to mitigate nutrient export in agricultural drainage can improve water quality but also raises concerns about potential unintended consequences of widespread implementation. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially as nitrous oxide (N2O) produced during denitrification, are of particular concern. To gain understanding of the variables controlling bioreactor GHG production, the effects of nutrient loading, hydraulic residence time, and biochar addition on emissions of N2O methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were tested in 6550 cm(3) laboratory columns. Biochar, an organic carbon pyrolysis product, was hypothesized to reduce GHG emissions, as has been reported with its use as an agricultural soil amendment. GHG fluxes were measured during 5-day trials using the closed dynamic chamber technique. The 36 combinations of three media types (woodchips, 10% biochar, and 30% biochar), three residence times (3, 6, and 12 h), and four influent formulations, all combinations of high and low nitrogen as nitrate (16.1 and 4.5 mg NO3-N L-1) and phosphorus as orthophosphate (1.9 and 0.6 mg PO (4)-P L-1) concentrations, were tested in triplicate. Treatment effects were assessed with linear mixed effects models. Biochar addition, particularly at the 30% rate, was found to increase N2O and CO2 emissions and the proportion of removed NO3-N released as N2O-N. However, quantified GHG flux rates were not environmentally concerning. Methane fluxes were negligible, and CO2 fluxes were not considered to increase net GHG emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes normalized to surface area averaged 2.92 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1), and 98% of measured fluxes were within the range previously reported for woodchip bioreactors and considered acceptable.

AB Instream wood in steep headwater streams impacts channel morphology and sediment fluxes via the development of log steps and related sediment storage. I investigated detailed characteristics of 73 log steps in managed temperate Carpathian forests and assessed channel- and wood-based thresholds for log step development. The limited recruitment of wood from managed forests was apparent in the low frequency of log steps (an average of 1.3 steps per 100 m channel length) in bedload-dominated channels when compared to temperate and boreal old-growth forests, and an even lower number of log steps was observed in streams recently affected by debris flows or hyperconcentrated flows. The upstream threshold of log step occurrence can be assigned to those locations in stream longitudinal profiles, where transport capacity during ordinary high flows exceeds the critical value for the initiation of bedload movement. Downstream thresholds are controlled by stream transport capacity and wood dimensions, which correspond to the limited recruitment of large wood pieces in managed forests. All log steps were found in contributing basin areas smaller than 1 km(2), and the majority of log steps (93.1%) originated in channels less than two metres in width. The development of a log step at a particular channel width or basin area was controlled by the wood length, but the resultant step parameters (step height and width, length of upstream sedimentary wedge and volume of stored sediments) were better correlated with wood diameter. The parameters of horizontal and vertical wood orientation had less importance in the development of a log step or its dimensions. Wood pieces shorter than 4 m in length accounted for 72.2% of the step-forming pieces, and the maximal diameter was less than 0.1 m for 20.5% of the pieces. These findings show the significance of relatively small wood pieces in log step development and sediment routing in steep headwater streams; the average sediment storage generated by a log step was 0.51 m(3). The support of log step development and their preservation in headwater streams draining managed forests represents an alternative low-cost approach for sediment management at the basin scale.

AB Here, we examine the relationships between the macrophyte community structure and the presence and abundance of the water beetle family Dytiscidae in 35 water bodies along the Drava River (Slovenia). In addition, selected water quality parameters were examined. The surveyed water bodies differed in altitude, type, size and distance from the Drava River. With the exception of a weak size effect on the water beetles, these parameters did not significantly affect the community structure. For hydrophyte plants, the community structure was significantly related to water quality parameters, which explained 38% (p <= 0.05) of the variability of species presence and abundance. For the water beetles, the oxygen concentration, and the sodium, potassium and chlorine ion concentrations were significant, together explaining 24% (p <= 0.05) of the species variability. Redundancy analysis revealed the importance of the presence and abundance of the low-growth plant species Potamogeton trychoides for the occurrence of Cybister lateralimarginalis, Dytiscus marginalia, Graphoderus cinereus, Graphoderus austriacus, Hydaticus seminiger and Acilius canaliculatus, while other water beetle species were more related to floating leaf plant species. Altogether, the presence and abundance of hydrophytes explained 35% of the variability of the Dytiscidae water beetle species presence and abundance. This study demonstrates the importance of selected natant plant species and submerged plant species, with low-growth forms for the occurrence of large and medium sized Dytiscidae water beetle species. Therefore, correct management of the macrophyte vegetation can positively affect the richness of these Dytiscidae species.

AB Sludge Treatment Reed Beds (STRBs) is the technology of sludge treatment, which is based on natural processes occurring in the environment, in specially designed and operated facilities to achieve benefits for the environment. Integrated dewatering and stabilization occur in reed systems. For economic and environmental reasons it is an attractive solution, especially in rural areas where there are no appropriate facilities.
   In the recent years many European countries like Denmark, France or Germany have applied this technology for sewage sludge management. Poland has also some experience in dewatering and stabilization of sewage sludge in STRB systems.
   The objective of the paper is to present the current experience and lessons learned from the operation and to assess the quality of sewage sludge from STRBs in Poland.
   The analyzed sewage sludge was treated in STRBs located in five wastewater treatment plants: Darzlubie, Swarzewo, Zambrow, Nadole and Gniewino, Poland. Two from the analyzed systems (Darzlubie and Swarzewo) worked only in a pilot scale and three of them (Darzlubie, Swarzewo and Nadole) did not work any longer. In the collected samples of sludge the evaluation of dewatering and stabilization processes, fertilizer properties, as well as heavy metals concentrations were determined.
   The average dry matter content in sludge treated in Polish STRBs was from 11.2 to even 53.7%. The degree of mineralization in analyzed systems was from 31.4 to 68.6%. The average nutrient contents was for nitrogen from 1.0 to 10% DM and for phosphorus from 0.2 to 1.0% DM.
   The conducted research confirms that sludge treated in STRBs is dewatered and stabilized, thus it could be used as a fertilizer in agriculture.

AB An experimental campaign was implemented along a 300 m stretch of a drainage channel, with the purpose of estimating the roughness coefficients of vegetated channels at the real scale for different management scenarios. The study was carried out in an agricultural area where the ordinary vegetation management consists in the total removal of natural vegetation along the whole wetted perimeter; thus, significantly impacting the aquatic ecosystem. To determine the sustainability of a less-impactful management, three scenarios were tested: a full-vegetated scenario, a partial removal, and the traditional total removal. The vegetation distribution and the channel morphology were determined for modelling purposes. Four increasing discharges were controlled by a pumping system up to the bankfull conditions, while hydraulic parameters were being monitored. Measuring the flow characteristics on three cross-sections, roughness coefficients were obtained by inverting the 1D equation of gradually varied steady flow. Results show how the presence of an undisturbed vegetation community significantly rises the water levels, thus possibly increasing the flood risk. The flow resistance resulted decreasing for increasing velocities, suggesting a considerable effect of plants reconfiguration due to drag. The intermediate scenario, represented by the preservation of an untouched vegetated buffer on one bank, resulted to be less impactful on flow and not far from the total removal scenario. The experimental results represent a reference for flow resistance models development and validation. Moreover, the findings of the present work provide useful information for a more focused drainage channel management, supporting the reduction of the ecological impact on aquatic communities.

AB Sunlight exposure of streams controls their thermal regime and light availability for photosynthesis. Restoring riparian shade to formerly forested streams in cleared land is an important step in the restoration of stream ecological health. Methods exist for measuring existing stream shade, but management tools are needed for predicting future shade as riparian plantings grow. We refine an existing geometrically-based numerical model for diffuse lighting which can be linked to models of tree growth to investigate how shade changes over time. The model predicts 'diffuse non-interceptance' (difn) which is an index of long-term averaged lighting. Shade of real (meandering) streams is bounded by two computationally straightforward cases: a perfectly straight channel (canyon model) and a channel meandering so tightly that its shade geometry 'collapses' to that of a circular pool (cylinder model). In this paper, we verify model results against measurements of shading made with a canopy analyzer instrument in precisely-constructed physical models of both the cylinder and canyon cases. For both canyon and cylinder geometries the observed and predicted difn matched closely (over a wide range of the ratio tree height to stream width, h/w) corroborating the numerical model. As expected, light exposure at the channel mid-point was higher than at channel edges, highlighting the need to consider variations in lighting across the channel when predicting water temperature and aquatic plant growth. Over the range of h/w where difn changes rapidly, shade was appreciably higher for the cylinder than the canyon case.

AB Soil loss due to sheet or rill soil erosion is a critical problem in watersheds of Taiwan. However, an order-of-magnitude discrepancy of soil loss in the literature raises many questions. In this study, we conducted a new analysis using the most recent available data and the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to compute the amounts of sheet and rill erosion of the Shihmen reservoir watershed in northern Taiwan. Using four different Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), we identified relatively high soil erosion sites and found them to be located at similar locations despite of the difference in DEM. We also determined that the average soil erosion in the Shihmen reservoir watershed is comparable to other watersheds in Asia, but higher than those of the European Union. Furthermore, soil erosion is not uniformly distributed throughout the study area. It is found that the distribution of soil erosion is highly skewed to the right (right-tailed), which means that the majority of the distribution is concentrated to the left side (many cells with low soil erosion). Based on our model, approximately 2% of the areas account for 30% of the soil erosion. In other words, a small proportion of the areas contribute to a large proportion of the total soil loss. Moreover, the DEM created from airborne LiDAR yields the highest amount of soil erosion, the two DEMs created from satellite images yield the lowest amounts of soil erosion, and the DEM created from aerial photographs yields an in-between soil erosion amount. Their vertical resolutions range from high to low. It appears that the amount of soil erosion is influenced by the vertical accuracy of DEMs. In addition to the comparison of DEMs, we demonstrated rudimentary steps to visualize areas of high soil erosion risk using freely available tool for long-term monitoring.

AB In this study, wastewater blended from textile, distillery, and domestic sources at a corresponding volumetric ratio of 3:1:18, was treated using Lemna minor and Azolla filiculoides for 28 days in a batch system installed in a shade house. Analysis of variance between the two macrophytes showed no statistical differences in removals of all tested parameters (p < 0.05) except for the biochemical oxygen demand where removal was higher in the L. minor. Electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, the studied heavy metals, and sulfate ma the agricultural reuse and discharge limits. The removal of chemical oxygen demand by A. filiculoides (96%) was slightly higher than the L. minor (92%), but the biochemical oxygen demand removal by L. minor (92%) was significantly higher than A. filiculoides (90%). Despite the high removals of chemical and biochemical oxygen demands, total phosphorus and total nitrogen attained, the concentrations were found exceeding the discharge and agricultural reuse limits. Finally, while the number of total coliform in both macrophyte populated chambers were too numerous to count, the number of colonies of fecal coliform were 400 in the L. minor and 267 in the A. filiculoides treatments. In conclusion, the higher removals of all the studied parameters in the macrophyte populated chambers compared with the control might be attributed to the contributions of the macrophytes.

ID RIPARIAN; TEMPERATURE; RESTORATION; LIGHT
AB Restoring riparian shade to formerly forested streams in cleared land is an important step in the restoration of stream ecological health. In a companion paper, we validated a numerical model for diffuse non-interceptance (difn) against measurements made in precisely-constructed physical models for two simplified geometries 'canyon' and 'cylinder' with trees lacking canopy 'shape'. In this paper, we extend the model to include canopy `shape' by representing trees as ellipses or kites, and quantifying shading from canopy overhang of the channel. The ratio of tree height (h) to stream width (w) strongly influences stream shade and is a key parameter when scoping riparian revegetation. Canopy width, overhang and viewpoint affect stream shade and could profitably be included in water temperature and aquatic plant growth models. Tree shape has a second-order effect on shade, most noticeably near the stream banks. The model predicts shade assuming a sky of uniform radiance (viz., it predicts shade to diffuse radiation) on the premise that difn is a useful index of long-term averaged light exposure. The model successfully reproduced the trajectory of shade reductions following riparian restoration predicted using a published physically-based model, confirming its suitability for scoping riparian shade restoration. While it would be feasible to include direct radiation in the model, this would require additional input data and computational effort.

AB In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) employing 3-level Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the parameters for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) degradation using yeast consortium YC01 in presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles and produced biosurfactant in the growth medium. The biosurfactant producing ability of YC01 was investigated by drop collapsing test, methylene blue agar plate method and emulsification index (E-24). Various process parameters viz. pH (A: 5.0-9.0), temperature (B: 10-50 degrees C), shaking sped (C: 110-150 rpm), inoculum dosage (D: 1-5%) and ZnO nanoparticle concentration (E: 1-3 g/L) were chosen for optimization. Maximum BaP degradation was found to be 82.67 +/- 0.01 (%) at central values of all the factors viz., pH 7.0, temperature 30 degrees C and shaking speed 130 rpm in the presence of 2 g/L of ZnO nanoparticle using 3% inoculum dosage of yeast consortium YC01 after 6 days of incubation period. It was well in close agreement with the predicated value obtained by RSM model yield 82.67 +/- 0.04 (%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed F-value of 66.09, R-2 of 0.9814, probability of < 0.0001 and coefficient of variation of 0.97%, which confirmed the validity of the model. Degradation of BaP was confirmed using GC-MS and FTIR analysis. Kinetic study demonstrated that BaP degradation fitted first order kinetic model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on statistical optimization of BaP degradation using yeast consortium in presence of ZnO nanoparticles and produced biosurfactant.

AB This study presents an analysis of the relationships among tree species, the type of mine soil substrate vs. vegetation development and features of plant communities. The study was conducted on two types of afforested mine sites (open strip sulphur and sand pit mine) built from various parential rocks: mixed quaternary sands and Neogene clays (QsNc) and quaternary loams (Q1). The study plots were arranged in stands of Scots pine (Punts sylvestris L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), silver birch (Benda pendula Roth) and black alder (Abuts glutinosa Gaertn.) from 25 to 35 years old. Tree stand parameter measurements and analyses of soil substrate properties and vegetation characteristics based on phytosociological surveys were done. The diversity expressed as the number of species (S) and Shannon-Wiener index (H), the Simpson dominance index (C) and ecological indicator values of vascular plants (EIVP) were assayed. We hypothesised that in similar substrates (parent rock conditions) the influence of tree stand species in the early phase of reclaimed ecosystem development is significant. Based on the results, we concluded that forest floor vegetation under deciduous species had clearly more herb layer cover and less moss in comparison to vegetation under coniferous species, which confirmed a significant influence only on the level of the ecological group of trees and not at the level of individual tree species. In contrast, the diversity of plant communities was influenced mainly by tree stand species. The highest diversity indexes (H) of communities were under birch and larch, and the lowest H was noted under alder. This phenomenon may be explained by the impact of the alder on soil nitrogen content, which led to the domination of communities by highly competitive species such as Aegopodium podagraria L. and Geranium robertianum L. on QsNc and Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth on Ql. Only EIVP values depended more strongly on soil substrate than tree stand species, and these were only slightly affected by tree stand species composition. Among the tree species, alder significantly increased the value of trophy indicators.

AB The objective of this paper is to present the design, construction and operation (during one year) of 3 full scale semi-closed, horizontal tubular photobioreactors (PBR, 11.7 m(3) of volume each) used to remove nutrients of a mixture of agricultural run-off (90%) and treated domestic wastewater (10%). PBRs were located outdoor and have 2 paddlewheels (engines of 0.25 kW) to ensure the movement of the mixed liquor. The microalgal biomass produced in the PBRs was harvested in a static lamella settling tank in which a polyaluminium chloride coagulant is applied. Each PBR treated in average 2.3 m(3)/d, being the actual mean hydraulic retention time 5 d. PBRs were submitted to strong seasonal changes regarding solar radiation and temperature, which had a direct impact in the activity of microalgae and the efficiency of the system. Higher mixed liquor pH values were registered in summer (daily average > 10). These high values were not observed in the effluents because the system was designed to discharge the mixed liquor (effluent) only at the end of night, when pH reached the lowest daily values (around 8.5). Most of the influent and effluent nitrogen content was inorganic (average of 9.0 mg N/L and 3.17 mg N/L, respectively), and in the form of nitrate (62% and 50%, respectively). Average nitrogen removal efficiency was 65%, with values of around 90% in summer, 80% in autumn, 50% in winter and 60% in spring. Most of the influent and effluent phosphorus content was in the form of orthophosphate. Influent average was 0.62 mg P/L, but with great variations and in a considerable number of samples not detected. Removal efficiency (when influent values were detected) was very high during all the study, usually greater than 95%, and there were not clear seasonal trends for efficiency as observed for TIN. Volumetric biomass production greatly changed between seasons with much lower values in winter (7 g VSS (volatile suspended solids)/m(3).d) than in summer (43 g VSS/m(3).d). Biomass separation efficiency of the settler was very good in either terms of turbidity and total suspended solids, being most of the time lower than 5 UNT and 25 mg/L, respectively. Overall this study demonstrated the reliable and good effectiveness of microalgae based technologies such as the PBR to remove nutrients at a full scale size.

AB Urbanisation and the construction of commercial structures on coasts cause a significant impact on natural marine habitats. The concept of "Ecological Engineering" , recently applied to marine biology, integrates ecology, economy and society's needs into the design of artificial marine structures. Recently, some ecological designs, such as the addition of pools, pits, and crevices, have been proposed in order to reduce habitat modification, diminish colonization by invasive species, and spread and maintain ecosystem functioning and biodiversity indexes that are more similar to those of the natural environment. Within the features that may increase artificial habitats' diversity, tidepools are unique habitats that reduce stress in the intertidal, favouring breeding and feeding, as well as providing shelter and a greater degree of moisture to a certain group of species, which may present an advantage for them. Nevertheless, the ecological benefits that arise from the inclusion of these features on fully mature artificial structures are still poorly known. In the present study, tidepools were created on artificial substrate with an affordable method (jackhammer) in the locality of Ceuta (Strait of Gibraltar). The pools were carved on dolomitic riprap at two different intertidal levels, high and low shore (+ 0.75 m and + 0.25 m higher than the lowest fide, respectively) with an average area of 195.2 cm(2) and 353.01 cm(3) of volume. These coastal defence structures were built more than eight years ago, thus the biota has substantially completed its colonization period and is set in terms of species composition. To test humidity effects on benthic assemblages around tidepools, the adjacent halo around the pool, with a width of 5 cm, was equally traced. Pool assemblages were compared to adjacent artificial and natural substrate and also to nearby natural pools. One year later, the results in species richness and diversity were significantly higher in the tidepools than the other two studied treatments (5 cm and control), artificial pools exceeded control species richness by 39.21% and control diversity by 30.70%. Focusing on the tidepool halo (5 cm) effect in the artificial substrate, the results show that the biological assemblages were different than tidepool and emerged rock, indicating that the newly created habitat extends its influence beyond the limits of the tidepools. Tidepools increased the number of species on ripraps and contributed to reduced fragmentation of some vagile species' populations, as they favoured settlement of species that previously seemed excluded from artificial substrate such as Pisania striata, Fisurella sp., Phorcus turbinatus and Lepidochitona sp. In the case of Siphonaria pectinata, it increased its presence in the tidepools and most of its egg masses were observed inside the pools. Finally, it should be mentioned that the pools have extended the upper vertical limits of infra-littoral level species such as Paracentrotus sp., mostly young individuals, and Aiptasia sp. These results may help to modify existing artificial shores to reduce their ecological impact.

AB This editorial describes a 12-paper special issue that began with a symposium at EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier France in August/September 2016 with a focus on ecological engineering and spatial planning in coastal seascapes. The papers in this issue review ideas around experimental design for testing and application of eco-engineering to reduce the impacts of coastal infrastructure and improve ecological outcomes. Similarly, the need for early integration of ecological principles into engineering designs (eco-design) is highlighted as a key factor in the success of impact mitigation (2 papers). Ideas are presented on spatial planning for coastal infrastructure to mitigate and offset impacts at regional scales (3 papers). At more local scales, empirical evidence is presented to support the manipulation of physical complexity on coastal infrastructure through the addition of artificial rock pools and turf mimics, as well as complex crevice and ledge habitat (3 papers). Chemical manipulations of substrate (concrete) are also explored (3 papers) with the aim of increasing the sustainability of structures and improving specific ecological outcomes. While increasing human pressure has pushed our oceans out of balance, this special issue provides practical solutions, supported by case studies and empirical data to begin helping the "feng shui" of our coastal seascape.

AB In many parts of the world, shorelines of estuaries are being modified because of increasing urban infrastructure. Consequently, habitats are being lost and replaced by other, artificial habitats, or are being severely modified in deleterious ways. Management of these changes requires recognition of the types of changes that are being made to estuarine shorelines, what sorts of impacts they cause and what sorts of managerial intervention are possible or desirable. Because experimentation in these managed habitats is in its early stages, it is important to provide sound ecological advice based on realistic hypotheses about consequent ecological changes. Wherever possible, management should be evaluated by well-planned experiments, involving analyses of changes in managed areas compared with changes in appropriate control areas. Where the goals of managerial action are the recovery of assemblages of species, what happens in managed areas should also be compared by equivalence tests with what happens in reference areas or relative to pre-defined ecological measures of what would constitute recovery. Here, different types of altered habitats, impacts, ecological changes and purposes of management are discussed. The needs for and nature of different types of hypotheses, experiments and analyses are reviewed with reference to relevant examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eco-design aims to enhance eco-engineering practices of coastal infrastructure projects in support of ecological functions before these projects are developed and implemented. The principle is to integrate eco-engineering concepts in the early phases of project design. Although ecological losses are inherent in any construction project, the goal of eco-design is to introduce environmental considerations upfront during technical design choices, and not just afterwards when evaluating the need for reduction or compensatory mitigation. It seeks to reduce the negative impacts of marine infrastructure by introducing a new reflexive civil engineering approach. It requires a valuation of nature with the aim of reducing impacts by incorporating intelligent design and habitat-centered construction. The principle advocated in this paper is to design coastal infrastructures, at micro- to macro-biological scales, using a combination of fine and large scale physical and chemical modifications to hard substrates, within the scope of civil engineering requirements. To this end, we provide a brief introduction to the factors involved in concrete-biota interactions and propose several recommendations as a basis to integrate ecology into civil engineering projects, specifically addressed to concrete.

AB Many coastal habitats are actually replaced with hard infrastructures which alter the taxonomic/functional structure of natural ecosystems worldwide. Few information about habitat loss and species composition in South American coasts are available compared with other coasts. Here, I examine the distribution and identity of coastal artificial infrastructures, especially artificial breakwaters, present along the coast of Chile and the proportion of natural habitat loss derived from their construction. Differences in species taxonomic/functional composition in artificial breakwaters and natural habitats present in northern Chile are also examined. I also propose/discuss opportunities for coastal planning based on habitat rehabilitation and ecological engineering in Chile, which could guide future marine infrastructures construction. An important proportion of natural habitat has been replaced by artificial coastal defences along the coast of Chile, accounting for about 200 km of total coastal length. Given their specific uses and functions, artificial granite breakwaters are one of the most important coastal infrastructures present in Chile (62% of the total of artificial breakwaters present). Differences in taxonomic/functional structure between artificial breakwaters and natural adjacent habitats are significant, and appear related to contrasting spatial heterogeneity. Artificial infrastructures like granite breakwaters can facilitate presence of native and non-native species, which live in the marine-terrestrial interphase (crabs, rats). The present study highlights how the recent proliferation of coastal artificial infrastructures is replacing important natural habitats in Chile, and how the taxonomic/functional structure of coastal ecosystems can be negatively impacted. Furthermore, this study showed how artificial infrastructures can have direct consequences for human-health security and specific guidelines can be conducted to buffer impacts on ecosystem structure to match social livelihood and wellness.

AB With nearly 60% of the human population concentrated around the coastlines, alongside growing threats from sea level rise and increased storminess, accelerated coastal development is inevitable. As most marine flora and fauna reside in coastal areas, anthropogenic changes to coastlines are a key reason for loss of coastal habitats, and associated ecosystem services. While coastal infrastructure such as seawalls or breakwaters add significant amounts of hard substrate for marine organisms, they do not support similar species assemblages to those of natural habitats. This is mainly due to design features related to steep slopes, low structural complexity, and high homogeneity, all of which are rarely found in natural habitats. This study provides an example for seascape architecture of coastal structures using ecologically sensitive designs and concrete technologies that enhance the structures' biological and ecological value while contributing to structural integrity. Four 1.5 mx0.8 m seawall panels made of bio-enhancing concrete with high structural complexity were deployed in an active marina (Herzliya, Israel). The panels, spanned from the Mean High Higher Water (MHHW) down to the sublittoral zone, were surveyed 2, 7, 12, 18 and 22 months post deployment using 0.3 x 0.3 m quadrats in both intertidal and sublittoral zones of each panel. Bio-enhanced panels were compared to fixed control quadrats comprised of scraped sections of the original concrete marina seawall.
   Results demonstrated the effectiveness of applying ecological considerations for biological and ecological enhancement of active infrastructure. All community parameters examined (live cover, richness, biodiversity) were significantly higher on bio-enhanced panels compared to controls. Moreover, mobile invertebrates and resident fish species were clearly enhanced through design aspects (holes and crevices) of the bio-enhanced panels. The study provides an example of an emerging approach of assimilating ecological considerations into the design and construction of working waterfronts and active coastal infrastructure, thus reducing their ecological footprint without compromising their operational performance.

AB The ecological value of engineered marine structures can be enhanced by building-in additional habitat complexity. Pre-fabricated habitat units can be cheaply and easily cast from concrete into heterogeneous three-dimensional shapes and surface topographies, with proven ability to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. The net ecological benefits of enhancement using concrete, however, may be compromised on account of its large environmental footprint and poor performance as substrate for many marine organisms. We carried out a pilot study to trial alternative cast-able "Reefcrete" concrete mixes, with reduced environmental footprints, for use in the marine environment. We used partial replacement of Portland cement with recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and partial replacement of coarse aggregate with hemp fibres and recycled shell material. We calculated the estimated carbon footprint of each concrete blend and deployed replicate tiles in the intertidal environment for 12 months to assess their performance as substrate for marine biodiversity. The hemp and shell concrete blends had reduced carbon footprints compared to both ordinary Portland cement based concrete and the GGBS based control concrete used in this study. At the end of the experiment, the hemp and shell blends supported significantly more live cover than the standard GGBS control blend. Taxon richness, particularly of mobile fauna, was also higher on the hemp concrete than either the shell or GGBS control. Furthermore, the overall species pool recorded on the hemp concrete was much larger. Community compositions differed significantly on the hemp tiles, compared to GGBS controls. This was largely explained by higher abundances of several taxa, including canopy-forming algae, which may have facilitated other taxa. Our findings indicate that the alternative materials trialled in this study provided substrate of equal or better habitat suitability compared to ordinary GGBS based concrete. Given the growing interest in ecological engineering of marine infrastructure, we propose there would be great benefit in further development of these alternative "Reefcrete" materials for wider application.

AB Effects of different silanization followed via the sol-gel growing of silica nanoparticles (SiO2) onto carbon fibers (CFs) on interfacial strength of silicone resin composites were investigated systematically. CFs were grafted with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) at different conditions to introduce amino groups (CF-NH2) or ethoxy groups (CF-Siloxane) for improving interfacial interaction between CFs and SiO2. Experimental results indicated that SiO2 was grown onto different functionalized CFs successfully, which enhanced the wettability owing to the increases of fiber polarity and surface roughness. Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of SiO2 modified CFs composites enhanced significantly, especially for CF-Siloxane grafted with SiO2 (CF-Siloxane-SiO2), increasing 46.79% in ILSS and 39.61% in IFSS. Additionally, the introduced Si-O-C bonds increased hydrothermal aging resistance of the resulting composites greatly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial Intelligence approach is utilized for developing the auto-design model of neural network based genetic algorithm (GA) to manipulate the obtained experimental data of H2S solubility measurements. The solubility of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in low vapor pressure organic solvents N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) has been measured experimentally. The experimental input data included operating temperature and pressure, and solubility values regarded as output data. Design of topology and parameters of the neural networks as decision variables have been achieved by GA, which enhances the effectiveness of the forecasting scheme. The precision of the GA is compared with experimental data and also with thermodynamical modeling approach in which Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) cubic equation of state has been chosen for this purpose. The results reveal that the thermodynamical and GA-artificial neural networks (ANN)-based model, both have sound agreement with experimental values. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR) and gas chromatography (GC) we studied the sub-zero temperature decontamination performance of Chemical Warfare Agents (sulphur mustard (HD), soman (GD) and S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl O-ethyl methylphosphonothiolate (VX)) and their simulants (2-chloroethyl ethyl sulphide (2-CEES) and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP)) on a novel nanoparticulate Zn (2+) and Ge4+ co-doped titanium dioxide (Zn-Ge-TiO2) material. To discover further progress toward the practice use of the powdered catalyst and improve its low-temperature disinfection, a novel suspension decontaminant was prepared successively by suspending Zn-Ge-TiO2 in hydrofluoroether (HFE). By means of a variety of characterization methods such as XRD, BET, BJH, SEM and TEM, the evolution of structure and properties across Zn2+ and Gedoping were systematically studied. Our data show that Zn (5.28 wt%)-Ge (1.48 wt%)-TiO2 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance. Versus undoped TiO2, the sample has unchanged crystal structure (anatase) and decreased average pore diameter (2.86 nm), accompanied with increased specific surface area (424.9 m(2)/g), crystallite size (5.8 nm) and pore volume (0.29 cm(3)/g). Under simulated sunlight irradiation at -30 degrees C, after a reaction time of 120 min, the degradation efficiency of HD, GD and VX on the suspension composed of Zn (5.28 wt%)-Ge (1.48 wt%)-TiO2 and HFE-458 (HCF2CF2CH2OCF2CF2H) were all over 99.95%. This indicated that the suspension will have a promising prospect of application in CWAs decontamination under the sub-zero environment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We review first how properties of curved surfaces can be studied using Hill's thermodynamics, also called nano-thermodynamics. We proceed to show for the first time that Hill's analysis is equivalent to Gibbs analysis for surfaces of constant curvatures (cylinders or spheres). This simplifies the study of such surfaces on the nano-scale, and opens up a possibility to study non-equilibrium systems in a systematic manner. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study has proposed a Huckel theory-based extrapolation scheme for estimating the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap of polymers without resorting to periodic boundary condition calculations using plane wave functions with hybrid functionals. The extrapolation scheme similar to ONIOM combines pure density functional theory (DFT) using plane wave functions for polymers and hybrid DFT using Gaussian functions for oligomers. We numerically assessed the scheme for polythiophene and 380 polymers and confirmed its accuracy and efficiency for polymer screening. Therefore, this scheme can be a screening methodology to estimate HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photoreaction of molecular complex composed of ozone and dimethylamine is investigated by matrix-isolation IR and UV-visible spectroscopies. The UV-visible spectrum of the molecular complex isolated in an Ar matrix shows two broad bands in the region between 400 and 700 nm. Upon red-light irradiation (lambda >= 680 nm), dimethylamine-N-oxide is produced by intermolecular oxygen-atom transfer from O-3 to the lone pair on the nitrogen atom of dimethylamine. Dimethylamine-N-oxide isomerizes to N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine by intramolecular hydrogen-atom migration upon the second light irradiation lambda >= 385 nm). The both photoproducts are identified by the DFT calculation at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Proton dynamics in a tropolone crystal was studied by 2D quantization of nuclear motions using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. This study presents the characteristics of the conjugated system of O-H stretching vibrations in the tropolone crystal. The MD simulations elucidate the presence of a pseudo-cyclic dimer structure in the crystal phase. The results obtained herein were compared with the IR spectroscopic data for the tropolone crystal. The skeleton and butterfly motions of the seven carbon rings strongly influence the strength of the hydrogen bonds in the cyclic dimers and are extensively discussed in this paper.

AB The calcination temperature has a great influence on the adsorption performance, but there are few studies on the calcination temperature. In this research, the effects on clinoptilolite calcined at different temperatures under vacuum conditions are studied and the raw material of clinoptilolite comes from China's Liaoning Province. Clinoptilolite treated at 100 degrees C is methane selectivity and the equilibrium adsorption capacity between methane and nitrogen at 1 atm (atmosphere) pressure reaches 5.73. With the increase of treatment temperature, the adsorption capacities of methane and nitrogen on clinoptilolite increase, but the influence of changing calcination temperature on nitrogen adsorption is more significant. After calcination at 150 degrees C, clinoptilolite gradually changes to nitrogen selectivity, and the nitrogen selectivity reaches the maximum at 190 degrees C. The ratio of equilibrium adsorption capacity between nitrogen and methane at 1 atm (atmosphere) pressure is 1.52. When the calcination temperature reaches 350 degrees C, clinoptilolite can't be regenerated after adsorption performance. The adsorption capacity of nitrogen on clinoptilolite calcined at 190 degrees C at 100 s (second) reaches 0.32 mmol/g, while the adsorption of methane at this time is only 0.032 mmol/g, so the nitrogen kinetic selectivity of clinoptilolite calcined at 190 degrees C is much greater than that of methane.

AB A symmetrical, almost linear and planar motif 2,6-bis(1-phenyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-4-nitroaniline have been designed and synthesized by click chemistry. The synthesis of this novel structure is straightforward and inexpensive. Two kinds of polymorphic crystals are obtained in different solvents, suggesting the versatile intra- and intermolecular interactions. Theoretical calculation was used to study the linear absorption spectrum, which show good agreement with the experimental results. Linear optical property shows an absorption band centered at 368 nm.

For double-electron oxidation Watson-Crick ring-expanded base pairs, they possess open-shell broken symmetry singlet states except for [xxGC](2+). Some complexes exhibit a significantly large amount of diradical character and some of diradical base pairs also possess excellent magnetic characteristics. [xGC](2+), [xAT](2+) and [xxAT](2+) show more and more strong AFM with the size expansion of guanine and adenine. The magnetic interactions get relatively weaker and weaker with the size expansion of cytosine and thymin. [xxTA](2+) even manifests a weak FM character. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decisive investigations on stabilities of Sc2O@C-86 and Sc2S@C-86 isomers were carried out via density functional theory with statistical thermodynamic method. Sc-2 X@C-2v(63751)-C-86 and Sc2X@C-1(63755)-C-86(X = O and S), observing isolated pentagon rules, were confirmed as thermodynamically preferred isomers within fullerene-formation temperature. Particularly, it is the first time to acknowledge C1( )63755)-C(86 )as host for encapsulating Sc2X (X = 0 and S), herein. Interactions between Sc and nonmetal atoms in Sc2X@C-2v (63751)-C-86 and Sc2X@C-1(63755)-C-86(X = O and S) were specifically explored. Importantly, characteristics and electron density ellipticity for independent X-Sc (X = O and S) bonds and their bonding paths performed clear distinction due to weak intramolecular interaction.

AB A series of composite materials based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheet were designed and investigated. The g-C3N4 sheet has been coupled with wide gaped organic molecules to reduce the band gap of the composite materials. Out of the five composites, g-C3N4-A shows excellent optical and electronic properties. In this case, the band gap of g-C3N4 sheet has been reduced from 3.65 to 2.65 eV. Besides, the angle between the g-C3N4 sheet and the organic molecular plane becomes approximately 90 degrees, which minimizes the rate of recombination of the electron-hole pair.

AB We present a theoretical investigation on the structures and properties of Ti2Si20-/0 clusters using density functional theory calculations. The results showed that the global minima of both anionic and neutral Ti2Si20 adopt a C-2h symmetric double hexagonal prisms stacked structure with the two Ti atoms encapsulated inside the silicon cage. Bond length, Wiberg bond order, constant electronic charge density, and molecular orbital analyses suggest that the Ti-Ti interactions in Ti20Si20-/0 are weak. Interestingly, Ti2Si20-/0 exhibit significant 3D aromaticity, which play important roles in their structural stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to provide global energy applications, solar energy resources will desire remarkable advances in solar energy technologies. In this paper, the novel synthesis of the functionalization of Multi-wall Carbon Nanotube(MWCNT) with Azobenzene molecule (4-(4-nitrophenylazoyl)-phenol) by esterification method was approached. The covalent bond of carbonyl was revealed in FTIR Test (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). Templating Azobenzene molecules on the side wall of MWCNT increased the stored energy per Azobenzene molecule and created hybrid Solar Thermal Fuels (STF). The DSC Test (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) showed that Solar Thermal Fuels composed of a photoswitchable molecules indicates significantly increased energy storage capabilities over the generation of a nanotemplated structure.

AB Weight loss, Potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurement were used to study the inhibition efficiency of 1,2-bis(4-chlorobenzylidene) Azine (AZI) as an inhibitor of copper corrosion. Results showed a mixed type of inhibition and an increase in the resistance of charge transfer due to the molecules absorption of the inhibiting agent on the copper surface. The observation by an electronic microscope (MEB) and analysis using the spectrometry of energy dispersion (EDS) confirms the presence of a film of the inhibiting agent. Quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to explore the mechanism of inhibition of AZI. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthesized phosphors have a single phase and flower-like microstructure. Under the excitation at 321 nm, SrLaMgNbO6:Mn4+ phosphors show intense red emission with three peaks, which come from the E-2(g), T-2(2g )-> (4)A(2g) transitions of the 3d(3) electrons in the octahedral MnO68 complex.SrLaMgNbO6:Mn4(+) phosphors have potential applications in WLEDs.

AB Kinetics of the thermal decomposition reaction CH2F2 -> CHF + HF was studied by laser absorption measurements in a shock tube. The rate constants were determined by analyzing temporal profiles of HF produced in pyrolysis of CH2F2 over the temperature range 1577-2214 K at pressure of similar to 100 kPa in Ar bath. The results were well reproduced by master equation analysis based on RRKM theory and classical trajectory calculations, which gave the following rate constant expressions: k(infinity) = 2.34 x 10(15) exp(-41,550 K/T) s(-1), k(0) = 5.33 x 10(25) (T/K)(-8.635) exp(-44,190 K/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), and F-cent = 0.13.

AB Experiments with irradiated single-walled carbon nanotubes are shown to generate a set of probability distribution functions and to derive a set of information theoretic entropy-based parameters. Energetic Cs+ ions initiate linear collision cascades and nonlinear thermal spikes in single-walled carbon nanotubes. The probability distribution functions are constructed from the normalized experimental yields of the sputtered atoms and clusters. The information or Shannon entropy and fractal dimension are evaluated for each of the emitted species. Along with the fractal dimension, the information is used to identify and distinguish the energy dissipation processes that generate conditions for monatomic sputtering and clusters emissions.

AB Ultraviolet photodissociation dynamics of tricarbonylnitrosylcobalt, Co(CO)(3)NO, is studied by ion-imaging. The photon energy is large enough to eliminate both NO and CO ligands in this heteroleptic complex, among which state-specific scattering is observed in the NO loss channel. The velocity distributions of the NO ligands exhibit clear evidence of two pathways. NO fragments with higher and lower kinetic energies are ascribed to direct dissociation in the electronic excited state and secondary decomposition following relaxation processes, respectively. The state-specific angular distribution of the faster component corroborates the rotational alignment, indicating the bent coordination of the nitrosyl ligand in the photoexcited state.

AB The dispersions were obtained as a result of phase exclusion of the DNA molecules from aqueous-salt-PEG-containing solutions. The CD spectra have shown cholesteric and hexagonal packing of the DNA in single dispersion particles at room temperature. The phase transition of the hexagonal -> the "re-entrant" cholesteric packing of DNA takes place at elevated temperature. The texture of the "re-entrant" phase does not demonstrate attributes of DNA cholesteric phase. Alternative reasons of such discrepancy are discussed in the presented Letter.

AB By exploiting the property of the density functional theory, a new monolayer of tellurium-selenium (TeSe2) is reported. It is found that the predicted monolayer is thermodynamically, dynamically, and thermally stable as proved by cohesive energy calculation, phonon spectrum analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the electronic properties calculation indicates that the newly reported TeSe2 monolayer is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of about 0.94 eV from the HSE06 level of theory which can be expertly tuned by strain effects. The obtained results open a new area for designing new nanoscale electronic devices with significant potential applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this Letter, theoretical study is carried out on the reactions of O-2 with c-C6H7 and 2-methyl-5-isopropyl-, 2-isopropyl-5-methyl, and 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-CHRs under the atmospheric conditions. Calculations show that the reaction of c-C6H7 forms benzene and the reactions of three CHRs forms p-cymene + HO2 with almost unit yield. The reaction of c-C(6)H(7 )is much different to that of c-C6H6-OH. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemokines are named and best known for their chemotactic cytokine activity in the hematopoietic system; however, their importance extends far beyond leukocytes, cell movement and immunoregulation. CXCL12, the most protean of chemokines, regulates development in multiple systems, including the hematopoietic, cardiovascular and nervous systems, and regulates diverse cell functions, including differentiation, distribution, activation, immune synapse formation, effector function, proliferation and survival in the immune system alone. The broad importance of CXCL12 is revealed by the complex lethal developmental phenotypes in mice lacking either Cxcl12 or either one of its two known 7-transmembrane domain receptors Cxcr4 and Ackr3, as well as by gain-of function mutations in human CXCR4, which cause WHIM syndrome, a multisystem and combined immunodeficiency disease and the only Mendelian condition caused by a chemokine system mutation. In addition, wild type CXCR4 is important in the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and cancer. Thus, CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 provide extraordinary examples of multisystem multitasking in the chemokine system in both health and disease.

AB The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) are important players in the cross-talk among lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia cells and their microenvironments. In hematological malignancies and solid tumors, the overexpression of CXCR4 on the cell surface has been shown to be responsible for disease progression, increasing tumor cell survival and chemoresistance and metastasis to organs with high CXCL12 levels (e.g., lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM)). Furthermore, the overexpression of CXCR4 has been found to have prognostic significance for disease progression in many type of tumors including lymphoma, leukemia, glioma, and prostate, breast, colorectal, renal, and hepatocellular carcinomas. In leukemia, CXCR4 expression granted leukemic blasts a higher capacity to seed into BM niches, thereby protecting leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and was correlated with shorter disease-free survival. In contrast, neutralizing the interaction of CXCL12/CXCR4 with a variety of antagonists induced apoptosis and differentiation and increased the chemosensitivity of lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia cells. The role of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies and the clinical therapeutic potential of CXCR4 antagonists in these diseases is discussed.

AB The discovery that atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) can initiate alternative signaling pathways rather than classical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling has changed the paradigm of chemokine receptors and their roles in modulating chemotactic responses. The ACKR family has grown over the years, with discovery of new functions and roles in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. However, the extent to which these receptors regulate normal physiology is still continuously expanding. In particular, atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) has proven to be an important receptor in mediating normal biological functions, including cardiac development and migration of cortical neurons. In this review, we illustrate the versatile and intriguing role of ACKR3 in physiology.

AB The chemokine CCL18 is constitutively expressed in human lung and serum, and is further elevated during pathologic conditions such as allergy, fibrosis and cancer, suggesting that it may participate in both homeostatic and inflammatory processes. Under steady state conditions, CCL18 has chemotactic activity, albeit modest, toward naive T cells and as such, may be involved in the initiation of the adaptive response. Its chemotactic effect on inflammatory cells is ambiguous as it attracts both regulatory and inflammatory immune cells. CCL18 can also modulate tissue inflammation by inhibiting cell recruitment through binding to glycosaminoglycans with high affinity, thereby displacing other chemokines bound to the endothelial surface. CCL18 induces regulatory phenotype and function of immune cells through direct activation and plays a major role in fibrotic processes, particularly in the lung. Finally, CCL18 is involved in cancer cell activation and migration and also participates in immune tolerance toward cancer. Its high constitutive expression levels and its further up-regulation in many diseases, together with its moderate chemoattractant properties support the fact that this chemokine has activities beyond cell recruitment.

AB Chemokines regulate leukocyte migration during physiological and pathological conditions. It is currently accepted that these chemotactic cytokines are also important in the development and progression of cancer. CXCL4 and its non-allelic variant CXCL4L1 are two platelet-associated chemokines that have been attributed anti-tumoral activity as a result of their angiostatic potential and the chemotactic activity for anti-tumoral leukocytes. Here we review the role of CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 in cancer, the use of both chemokines as cancer biomarkers and discuss some possible therapeutic opportunities.

AB Because of the level of attention it received due to its role as the principal HIV coreceptor, CCR5 has been described as a 'celebrity' chemokine receptor. Here we describe the development of CCR5 inhibitory strategies that have been developed for HIV therapy and which are now additionally being considered for use in HIV prevention and cure.
   The wealth of CCR5-related tools that have been developed during the intensive investigation of CCR5 as an HIV drug target can now be turned towards the study of CCR5 as a model chemokine receptor. We also summarize what is currently known about the cell biology and pharmacology of CCR5, providing an update on new areas of investigation that have emerged in recent research.
   Finally, we discuss the potential of CCR5 as a drug target for diseases other than HIV, discussing the evidence linking CCR5 and its natural chemokine ligands with inflammatory diseases, particularly neuroinflammation, and certain cancers. These pathologies may provide new uses for the strategies for CCR5 blockade originally developed to combat HIV/AIDS.

The properties of products can be tunable by adjusting the combustion parameters, such as fuel type, fuel-to-oxidizer ratio and atmosphere. Detailed combustion reaction mechanisms have been discussed. When glycine as fuel, the average particle size of VO2 product is 40 nm. When citric acid and glycine as the mixture fuels, the VO2 product with the average particle size of 20 nm show typical temperature-driven semiconductor to metal transition. The V2O3 product with the average size of 70 nm could be synthesized in an inert atmosphere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lattice expansion and thermal behavior of gamma-irradiated unstable clathrate hydrates are explored to understand the complex physicochemical properties of clathrate hydrates. A previous study revealed that enclathrated methyl vinyl ketone molecules show a peculiar conformational change via a ketyl radical anion after c-irradiation with an annealing process. We measured the lattice parameters of gamma-irradiated binary methyl vinyl ketone + CH4, O-2, and N-2 hydrates at various temperatures. We observed that induced radical affects the lattice expansion behavior, and the thermal expansion coefficients of gamma-irradiated hydrates highly depend on the types of secondary gaseous guest molecules.

AB The D-5h -> D-10h isomerization in the C-10 carbon cluster is investigated at the relativistic, all-electron CCSDT(Q)/CBS level. Previous high-level studies examined this isomerization at the valence CCSD(T)/CBS level. We show that capturing this isomerization energy requires accurate treatment of the CCSD(T)/CBS, post-CCSD(T), core-valence, scalar relativistic, diagonal Born-Oppenheimer, and zero-point vibrational energy components. Combining these components shows that the two structures are practically isoenergetic at 0 K (i.e., the D-5h structure is more stable by merely + 0.100 kcal mol(-1)). We also show that computationally economical composite protocols erroneously predict that the D-10h structure is energetically more stable at 0 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This method only adjusted epoxy functional groups on GQDs' surface, and correspondingly maintained their original size and concentration. The formation mechanism of this epoxidation of graphene quantum dots (E-GQDs) is similar to the epoxidation of alkenes, which will be epoxidated by electrophilic addition reaction. The GQDs after epoxidation will enhanced surface activity of GQDs, and help to expand its application in biological imaging and photothermal therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The structural phase transition and dehydration for gypsum were investigated by Raman spectroscopy and electrical conductivity up to similar to 12.2 GPa and similar to 723 K. A similar to 5.8 GPa of phase transition was verified at atmospheric temperature. The variations in the sulfate and hydroxyl Raman shifts and a change in electrical conductivity marked the onset of dehydration. At similar to 2.5 GPa, gypsum transformed into bassanite at similar to 523 K, and then completely dehydrated to c-anhydrite at similar to 673 K. And furthermore, the gypsumbassanite and bassanite-anhydrite dehydration boundaries were obtained: P (GPa) = -23.708 + 0.050 T (K) and P (GPa) = -4.907 + 0.011 T (K), respectively.

AB A direct Z-scheme photocatalyst Bi2O3/MoO3 was prepared via hydrothermal method and mixing-calcination methods. The as-obtained Bi2O3/MoO3 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activities than pure Bi2O3 and MoO3 for degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The increased photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers through a Z-scheme system between Bi2O3 and MoO3. Furthermore, the results of energy band positions, active species trapping experiments and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) provide direct evidence of an efficient Z-scheme as the main mechanism for degradation of MB under visible light irradiation over Bi2O3/MoO3 composites.

AB Polycrystalline samples of La-0.5 xYxCa0.5 ySryMnO3 (0 <= x <= 0.20, 0 <= y <= 0.22) were synthesized by solid state reaction method. The degree of A-site disorder increases linearly with increasing doping content. Structural analysis of X-ray diffraction shows that samples crystallize in a pure orthorhombic Pnma phase and antisymmetry stretching appears in MnO6 octahedron. Raman spectra illustrate rotationlike mode and antisymmetry stretching mode are both hardened with increasing A-site disordering, indicating the Jahn-Teller distortion strengthened. The metal-insulator transition temperature and MR values are found to decrease with increasing A-site disordering. The suppression of metallic behavior is ascribed to the enhancement of Jahn-Teller effect caused by increasing A-site disordering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results suggest that W18O49 nanorods will grow well when calcined at 650 degrees C for 2 h at 10 l/h H-2 gas flow rate. Using GSAS software the fitted lattice parameters of obtained W18O49 are given, that is, a: 18.340 angstrom, b: 3.788 angstrom, c: 14.025 angstrom, beta: 115.168 degrees, by the Rietveld refining X-ray diffraction pattern. The result of sheet resistance measurement of samples indicates that pure W18O49 nanorods exhibit a resistivity as low as 0.068 X Omega.cm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report an efficient molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) supported by thermally reduced graphite oxide (TRGO) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The TRGO-MoS2 composite exhibits excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of -0.23 V, which is almost three and seven times lower than those of precursor MoS2 and GO-MoS2. The high performance of HER attributes to TRGO, providing a conducting network for fast electron transport from MoS2 to electrodes. The composite also shows high stability in which the overpotential remains constant after 1000 cycles and strong durability after 48 h, demonstrating a synergistic effect of MoS2 and TRGO for efficient HER.

AB Adsorption of BMP-2 on hydrophobic gold and hydrophilic silicon nitride is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The wetting behavior of the dissolution media directly guided the protein-substrate interaction, impacting the protein adsorption. The saline solution restricted the movement of the protein on gold, limiting adsorption to hydrophobic and charged residues while preserving the secondary structure. Stronger adsorption occurred on silicon nitride where the protein had more flexibility to interact with the surface leading to the disruption of beta-sheet structures in two orientations. This research contributes to the understanding of BMP-2 adsorption behavior in four orthogonal orientations with medically relevant materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Downshift of 24 cm(-1) in FT-IR due to the change from the ground state to the intramoleclar charge transfer (ICT) state and Py-N (pyrimidine-nitrogen) wavenumber shift is predicted theoretically. In natural bonds orbital analysis the magnitudes of charges transferred from lone pairs of LP(1)(N7) into the antibonds pi*/(N-1-C-6) has stabilization energy 61.64 kJmol(-1) due to resonance effect concomitant to red shift of their stretching frequencies.

AB The energy level alignment at the interface between an organic layer and an electrode plays a critical role in the performance of organic electronic devices. To improve the charge injection efficiency, the energy barrier between the charge transport level of an organic layer and the Fermi level of an electrode should be reduced. Especially, poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is a polymeric semiconductor that is widely used as a hole transport and electron blocking layer in various optoelectronic devices. Thus, an understanding of the energy level alignment between PVK and an electrode is of great importance. In this study, the energy level alignment of PVK and indium tin oxide (ITO) was determined with X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The effect of UV-ozone (UVO) treatment on the formation of a hole injection barrier (Phi(h)) in ITO was also investigated. In both cases of bare ITO and UVO ITO, only small interface dipole and band bending were observed, which indicates charge transfer between PVK and ITO is miniscule. The UVO treatment significantly increases the work function of ITO from 4.05 eV to 4.40 eV, which results in the reduction of Phi(h) from 1.70 eV to 1.50 eV. This reduced Phi(h) value dramatically improves the current density-voltage characteristics of PVK-based hole-only devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new accurate ab initio potential energy surface (PES) of the HeTiO system is constructed. The multi-reference configuration interaction with the Davidson correction is used to obtain the energy points, and the neural network method is employed to fit the PES. State-to-state rotational quenching cross sections and rate coefficients are obtained over a wide range based on the PES. Wigner threshold law is proved to be valid in the ultralow energy regime. In comparison with He-3, He-4 is more efficient for the TiO molecule cooling process in the dominant transition j = 1 -> 0 due to the isotope effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can exhibit adverse effects by increasing or blocking hormonal activities as agonists or antagonists through nuclear receptors. Computational toxicology research provides a fast and automated screening tool for determining the potential effects of EDCs. Here, we collected a large dataset of known hormonal activities to develop ternary classification models of androgen receptor (AR) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR), in combination linear discriminant analysis (LDA), classification and regression trees (CART), and support vector machines (SVM). The optimum model for classifying AR and TR activities was SVM. These newly developed models constitute a rapidly systematic early-warning technical system for identifying different hormone activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To enhance computational efficiency of ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), reduced-dimensional models are proposed for X + YCZ(3) -> XY + CZ(3). In these models, bond parameters of CZ(3) are fixed keeping the C-3v symmetry. These models are denoted by r-RPMD, t-RPMD, p-RPMD, i-RPMD, and irc-RPMD. Extensive RPMD calculations in both full-and reduced-dimensional fashions are performed for H + CH4. The computational efficiency of the reduced-dimensional calculation is found to be enhanced by a factor of roughly 3.5, which is close to 4 (factor for 12D -> 3D). Good agreements between irc-RPMD and previous results are found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Water-dispersible Mn2+-doped Ag2Se QDs were synthesized by solvothermal reaction of silver and manganese salts with selenium source and subsequent ligand exchange. The Mn doping level could be tuned by changing the feed amount of the Mn precursor. The Mn2+-doped Ag2Se QDs had a crystal structure typical of monoclinic alpha-Ag2Se. At the Mn doping level of 0.28%, the photoluminescence quantum yield at 1130 nm remained at 5.7%. Moreover, EPR spectrum and VSM result suggest paramagnetic characteristics of the 0.28% doped QDs. Cytotoxicity test indicates good biocompatibility of the Mn2+-doped Ag2Se QDs, which have great potential for biomedical imaging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel carbon modified Co3O4/BiVO4 p-n heterojunction photocatalyst (Co3O4/BiVO4/C) is prepared via one-step method. The Co3O4/BiVO4/C photocatalyst is characterized by SEM, Raman, UV-vis DRS, electrochemical performance analysis and so forth. In addition, the optimum activity of the Co3O4/BiVO4/C p-n heterojunction is higher than that of pure Co3O4 and BiVO4 for the degradation of tetracycline under visible light. The improved photocatalytic property could be ascribed to the enhanced light absorption and the facilitated separation of photogenerated charge carriers through forming a p-n heterojunction. Furthermore, the Co3O4/BiVO4/C has superior magnetic properties, recyclability and stability, which is conducive to practical application. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with excellent monodispersity, colloidal stability and biocompatibility are important for the fabrication of magnetic targeted drug delivery system. In this study, magnetic lipid microcapsules (MLMs) containing lipid-coated MNPs were fabricated. 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) release from MLMs triggered through thermal activation of MNPs was investigated in detail upon application of an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The experimental results revealed that coating lipid on MNPs effectively reduced the MNPs aggregation, enhanced the dispersion, stability and biocompatibility but did not affect their heat transfer. This new drug delivery system holds a great potential on cancer treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A profound understanding of the ultrafast interfacial charge transfer (CT), charge separation (CS), and charge recombination (CR) are paramount in enhancing the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell devices. Here, a combination of steady-state and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopies with broadband capabilities are used to explore and decipher the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics at the PCE10/C60 interfaces. Our experimental results verified the efficient and ultrafast (sub-picosecond) photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the PCE10 polymer to fullerene acceptor C60. Notably, the slow CR and fast ET make the current PCE10/C60 system ideal for its potential use in solar cells devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman scattering spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. During the photodegradation of rhodamine B and phenol, BiOCl-S exhibits higher activity than BiOCl. Sn, Mn doped BiOCl were also synthesized successfully with the same doping route. We provide a simple and effective method for doping element into bismuth oxyhalides.

AB The construction of supramolecular hollow tubes from amphiphilic molecules is of great interest in biology and nanotechnology. Previous electroformation techniques were mainly based on two face to face electrodes, generating an electric field perpendicular to the lipid film for giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). This work demonstrated the electroformation of lipid tubes based on electric field paralleling to the lipid film. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) near the lipid interface is main force for the formation of lipid tubes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose new approach to accurate calculation of the molar attenuation coefficient epsilon and the threshold concentration C-del, exceeding of which it results in a deviation from Beer's law. The method is based on the asymptotic approximation of the equality of integrals associated with the true values of C-del and e as well as their approximate values C-i and epsilon(i) within max. rapprochement: Delta C = min {C-i - C-del} and Delta epsilon = min {epsilon - epsilon(i)} when C-i -> C-del and epsilon(i) -> epsilon. After reaching the acceptable accuracy, the infinite iterative cycle is interrupted that allows to significantly saving the computing resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results, obtained from a newly implemented magnetic beam apparatus based in Madrid, are compared with theoretical results from the independent atom model with screening corrected additivity rule including interference effects and rotational excitation (IAM-SCAR+I+R). A very good level of agreement has been found between the present experimental and theoretical data at above about 20 eV electron impact and to within the experimental uncertainties.

ID PICKERING EMULSION POLYMERIZATION; WATERBORNE POLYURETHANE
AB In this paper, zwitterionic graphene oxide (ZGO) was prepared with two silanes. It was evident that the silane molecules were grafted on GO surfaces by covalent bondings. zeta potential of ZGO varied from -29.0 mV to +28.5 mV when the pH of the aqueous solution was changed from 12 to 2. As a result, the ZGO can be dispersed in both anionic and cationic waterborne polymer matrix. Besides, ZGO can be used as two-dimensional surfactant in a wider range of pH values than GO. The multi-applications of ZGO were enabled by the unique pH-responsive charge-conversion properties and pH-insusceptible amphiphilicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular fuel production during electricity generation is an elusive challenge in the chemistry of energy devices offering tremendous possibilities in the sustainable energy landscape. We illustrate an inherent-heat-driven electrochemical cell (IHEC) where the heat of neutralization can be tapped as electromotive force for simultaneous power (similar to 70 mW/cm(2)) and molecular fuel (similar to 70 mL/h) production. By coupling fuel and electricity generation in the same device, IHEC offers a paradigm shift in the chemistry of energy devices by its capability to directly fuel a proton exchange membrane fuel cell without any hydrogen storage unit.

AB The reaction of dimethyl ether (DME) with OH radical was studied using a laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique in the temperature range of 257-333 K at 30 Torr. The temperature dependent rate coefficient is represented by the expression, k(T) = (9.7 +/- 1.0) x 10(-12) exp {-(380 +/- 25)/T} cm(3) molecules(-1) s(-1) and atmospheric lifetime was found to be 4.7 days. To elucidate the reaction mechanism and complement the experimental work, the energies and structures of the reactants and transition states involved were determined theoretically using the G3 method. The radiative forcing and the global warming potential for 100 years time horizon of DME were estimated to be 0.03 W m(-2) ppb(-1) and 0.02, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical descriptors using DFT concepts characterize elements reactivity. Hardness and electrophilicity relate to the charge and energy exchanged, determining changes in the length and slope during reaction. Three zones are identified. At low charge exchange (<0.25) the length of the path shortens with constant slope. At higher charge exchange (>0.50) the length increases while its slope rotates. The two regions respectively correspond to frontier molecular orbital and charge-controlled reactions. They relate to the divergence and rotational components of the chemical potential gradient, pointing toward nucleophilic or electrophilic reactions. In between reactions are a mixing both end-member components. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have employed simple model potentials and an evolutionary algorithm to assess the low-energy landscape of clusters resulting from the self-assembling of oppositely charged particles in two-dimensions (2D). The global minimum structures were obtained by employing an evolutionary algorithm (EA), which has been adapted to deal with planar clusters. The present results show that various families of structures, including linear-and ring-type motifs, arise in a relatively small energy-window. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aggregation of the misfolded scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) is known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we have investigated the stability of PrPC by combining coarse-grained model and all-atom molecular simulations. Our results show that the unfolding of PrPC starts from the opening of the folded domain with alpha 1 moving away from alpha 2 alpha 3 domain, and then arrives at a metastable intermediate, and forms a more stable dimer complex in the end.

AB This work reports on the singlet excited-state absorption spectrum of sodium-copper chlorophyllin using three distinct methods of Z-Scan measurement: white-light continuum Z-Scan technique ranging from 470 to 780 nm, tunable Z-Scan technique with femtosecond pulses (490-700 nm) and 532 nm Z-Scan technique with 100 ps pulse width. A transition from reverse saturation absorption (RSA) to saturable absorption (SA) was observed at 570 nm, and at 532 nm RSA was tested showing potential application as optical limiting device. Pump-probe technique was used to measure lifetime of the first singlet excited state (22 ps) and no evidence of triplet conversion was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate a technique which can change the pH inside an NMR tube in steps of <= 0.01 pH unit, during a solution-state NMR experiment. We use a photo-acid co-solute with the actual specimen, and photo-excite the solution by direct fibre-mediated light delivery to the NMR tube. The photo-excitation and NMR measurements can be performed simultaneously. Our method should allow precise variation of the pH in studying protein folding, aggregation and enzyme catalysis processes which often display critical pH dependence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-53(Fe) was synthesized. MIL-53(Fe) is capable of activating peroxymonosulfate to achieve highly efficient rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light, and MIL-53(Fe) shows good photocatalytic activity in a wide pH range. The results of the recycling experiments, X-ray diffraction patterns, and Fourier transform infrared spectra of MIL-53(Fe) before and after the catalytic reaction revealed that MIL-53(Fe) is stable. Electron paramagnetic resonance tests indicated that sulfate radicals are the dominant reactive species in RhB degradation. This study provides some guidance in the exploration and utilization of MOFs for environmental remediation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enamel demineralization of the brackets caused by surrounding bacteria is the main challenge facing orthodontists. Aiming to resolve this issue, here we originally reported a novel antibacterial coating based on ZnO and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) composite prepared via a facile and environmentally-friendly method. As desired, the bracket modified with ZnO/CQDs coating exhibited excellent antibacterial performance than the unmodified bracket (Streptococcus mutans 96.13%, Staphylococcus aureus 90.28% and Escherichia coli 92.35%) under natural light. In addition, the natural light antibacterial mechanism was explored, which could be ascribed to the upconversion fluorescence of the CQDs and the interaction between CQDs and ZnO.

An earlier reported weighted data fitting scheme for enumerating the entire cross-section database is modified and extended for the N2O2 system. The cross-section database is suitable for studying reactions in hypersonic flows especially with high degree of nonequilibrium. Additionally, the relevance on NO formation as a result of N-2-O-2 collision is explored. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ESM were covered with ZnO nanostructures by electroless deposition using Au as catalyst. The structural, optical, morphological and wetting properties of the pristine ESM and ESM/ZnO were evaluated. The ESM fibers were uniformly coated by ZnO hexagonal prisms, the hybrid ESM/ZnO preserving the water absorption characteristic of the pristine ESM. Combining an abundant bio-waste with a simple wet chemical synthesis method, flexible organic/inorganic hybrid networks based on ZnO-functionalized ESM can be designed for various applications.

AB Using a covalent functionalization strategy, hyperbranched poly (trimellitic anhydride-diethylene glycol) ester epoxy resin (HTDE) was grafted on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Then the HTDE grafted MWCNTs (HTDE-g-MWCNTs) were used as toughener to prepare epoxy composites (HTDE-gMWCNT/ EP). The results show that the HTDE-g-MWCNTs are homogeneously dispersed in the epoxy matrix and the tensile strength and fracture toughness of HTDE-g-MWCNT/EP composites are enhanced. The property improvements are due to the enhanced interfacial shear stress and relieved internal residual stress. The main toughening mechanisms are pull-out, breakage of HTDE-g-MWCNTs, and their bridging effect to crack, and shear failure of epoxy matrix around HTDE-g-MWCNTs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study K-alpha 1, K-alpha 2 and KLL Auger line widths were determined semi-empirically by using K shell fluorescence yields of sulfur even if K-alpha X-ray lines cannot be resolved in our detector system. The samples of 1,2,4-Triazoles were irradiated by an annular 50 mCi Fe-55 radioactive source. It was found that halogens (e.g. Cl) and electron donating groups (e.g. -CH3, -OCH3, -OH etc.) have a crucial effect onto the valence shell structure of sulfur. The expansion of Auger line widths was attributed to the Coster-Kronig transitions in L shells which are energetically possible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB H-2 MAS NMR spectroscopy was applied to investigate the local structure of deuterated paramagnetic Ni2+-containing layered double hydroxides (LDHs) for the first time. Due to significantly smaller electronic dipole interaction, H-2 NMR spectra of NiAl-LDHs show much better resolution than H-1 NMR spectra, and different hydrogen species, including Ni3OD, Ni2AlOD and interlayer water, can be resolved in H-2 NMR spectra. Quantitative analysis of the NMR spectra of LDHs with different Al percentages confirms the ordering of Al3+ ions in the hydroxide sheets (Al-O-Al avoidance). H-2 MAS NMR spectroscopy gives new insight into different hydrogen species in paramagnetic NiAl-LDH and this approach can be extended to study the detailed structural information and properties of other paramagnetic LDHs.

AB This paper reports the colorimetric sensing of Fe3+ ions in water using magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles where a novel and green method to synthesize MgO nanoparticles (NPs) using Syzygium aromaticum extract (clove extract) as reducing agent has been described. The synthesized MgO NPs were characterised by various techniques i.e. UV-Vis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The MgO NPs were used as colorimetric probe for the sensitive and selective sensing of Fe3+ ions in water using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Sensing efficiency of MgO NPs towards Fe3+ was investigated at pH range of 3-10. The best selectivity and sensitivity was obtained at pH 3. Limit of detection was calculated using 3 sigma method and it was found to be 23 mu M. Further, application of MgO NPs in practical sensing of Fe3+ in real water samples was also successfully investigated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Two-color circularly polarized; Nonsequential double ionization;
   Recollision
ID ATOMS
AB Nonsequential double ionization is theoretically investigated in the counter-rotating two-color [frequencies (omega(1); omega(2))] circularly polarized laser fields with classical ensemble approach. It is found that remarkable ionization enhancement is obtained by adjusting the relative electric field amplitude ratios (gamma(E)). The result indicates that there is a broader steerable range of gamma(E) to obtain higher ionization enhancement for omega(2) = 3 omega(1) than that for omega(2) = 2 omega(1). Through the analysis of trajectories, the recollision picture for omega(2) = 3 omega(1) is complicated leading to slow change of double ionization, which is benefit to gentle control mechanism. However, the recollision ionization channel is easily distinguishable and sensitive to control double ionization in omega(2) = 2 omega(1) laser fields and the travel time can be controlled in the order of magnitude of 100 attoseconds.

AB A series of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets/TiO2 nanofibers heterojunctions were fabricated through an electrospinning-hydrothermal two-step process. The ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were intensively and uniformly covered on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers. The ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunctions exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity compared to the individual TiO2 nanofibers and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets in the photodegradation of methyl orange, especially, when the molar ratio of ZnIn2S4 to TiO2 was 20: 100, the ZnIn2S4/TiO2 catalysts exhibited the optimum photocatalytic activity. The improved visible-light photocatalytic performance was ascribed to a Z-scheme photocatalytic process, abundant active sites of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets as well as efficient photogenerated charge separation.

AB Effect of ionic liquid functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (IL-MWCNTs) on mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of MWCNTs-reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/PMMA nanocomposites is investigated. IL-MWCNTs-rGO/PMMA hybrid nanocomposites are prepared by solvent-casing method. Incorporation of IL-MWCNTs improved the tensile strength and modulus by 119% and 58% respectively at 0.5 wt.% than that of PMMA due to better load transfer from PMMA to IL-MWCNTs-rGO. Enhancement in thermal stability is also occurs with incorporation of IL-MWCNTs in rGO/PMMA composite due to strong interaction provided by IL-MWCNTs with the polymer matrix. IL-MWCNTs-rGO/PMMA hybrid nanocomposites also shows more electrical conductivity than IL-MWCNTs/PMMA composite. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum chemistry calculations were done for four nerve agents (NAs): VX, tabun, sarin and soman to correlate their physiochemical and electronic properties with intention to clarify the reason of their high lethality. For isolated NAs, it was observed an excellent correlation between the energy gap values with their lethality and volatility. The water-octanol transference enthalpy is unfavorable for NAs indicating that human body absorption, which it was supported by the TPSA calculated here, is driven by entropic effects. The electronic results for NAs-serine adduct are similar implying that the reactivation mechanism of the acetylcholinesterase can be the same. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Initialstate-resolved reaction probabilities, cross sections and rate constants were obtained taking into account the Coriolis Coupling (CC). The significance of including the CC quantum scattering calculations has been revealed by the comparison between the CC and the Centrifugal Sudden (CS) approximation calculation. The calculated thermal reaction rate constant is in a good agreement with the available experimental data and semiclassical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, based on the density functional theory, three new two-dimensional pentagonal monolayer semiconductors namely penta-XP5 monolayer (X = Al, Ga, In) are reported. The cohesive energy calculation confirms that the predicted structures are energetically stable. Furthermore, the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the structures are testified by phonon dispersion curves analysis and first principles molecular dynamic simulations respectively. Our calculations show that two-dimensional penta-AlP5, penta-GaP5, and penta-InP5 are indirect semiconductors with tunable wide band gaps (2.69 and 2.71, 2.70 eV respectively). The obtained results suggest these materials as promising candidates for application in new electronic devices in nano scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fast small-amplitude motions, such as vibrations or librations, do affect NMR properties of molecules in the solid state. The quantification of these effects is very important for structural studies exploiting Solid State NMR and computational methods, particularly in the field of NMR crystallography. In this work 2D MAS NMR experiments were carried out over a wide range of low temperatures (129-295 K) on a nonstandard high-resolution Solid State NMR equipment to obtain the first experimental determination of the effects of small-amplitude motions on C-13 Chemical Shift Tensors of a multi-carbon molecule (ibuprofen).

AB First principles studies on the geometry, electronic structure and magnetic properties of neutral, cationic, and anionic Fe2Sin (1 <= n <= 12) have been performed to better understand magnetic dopants in silicon. The doubly- Fe doped clusters in the size range 1 <= n <= 12 are marked by finite spin moments at the Fe sites, and Fe2Si3, Fe2Si4, and Fe2Si7 are found to exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling. Fe2Si3 and Fe2Si12 are relatively stable. We find that short Fe-Fe bond distances correlate with ferromagnetic coupling due to the destabilization of antibonding orbitals between the iron sites, while longer Fe-Fe bond distances lead to nonbonding atomic orbitals that favor antiferromagnetic coupling.

AB We examined the most interesting subsystem of the Bray-Liebhafsky (BL) oscillator i.e. oxidation of iodine to iodate in acidic media with hydrogen peroxide. The reaction induction periods and formed iodate are characterized by potentiometric method and stopped-flow technique. Introduction of a very slow mixing, at 27 degrees C, increased standard deviation of results to 124 from 2.5 in experiments without mixing. It is confirmed at two lower temperatures. In such (initially) simple chemical system the stochasticity is related with random fluctuations forming critical oxygen cavities. Possible energetic coupling of the nucleation processes with chemical reactions is discussed in connection with previous results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The first-principles calculations are carried out to explore more intensely on geometric, spectroscopic and electronic properties of M-20 (M = Cu, Ag, Au) species. Computed results show that the global minima of these clusters are compact, nearly spherical structures, while other low-lying isomers exhibit the oblate or probate shapes. For Cu-20, we find it is in a C-3 symmetry form rather than the C-s conformation as previously suggested. The vertical ionization energies for lower-lying isomers are also computed and assigned with respect to available experimental values. Although several isomers were predicted to be similar in energy content, the corresponding vibrational signatures are so distinctive that could be used as fingerprint signals to identify their geometrical forms. More importantly, the enhanced stability of these systems can be understood in terms of the phenomenological shell model. Computed results also recognize that the structures and properties of Ag-20 and Cu-20 clusters are similar and prefer compact structures, while Au-20 cluster exhibits structures different from with a tetrahedral form.

AB Rechargeable lithium/sulfur batteries have been proposed as the most promising high-performance batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the poor electrical conductivity and structural stability of elemental sulfur and the dissolution of the polysulfides have confined the utilization of elemental sulfur and the cyclic retention of capacity. A novel in-situ route by transforming ZnO nanotemplates into sulfur nanoparticles during the preparation of carbon/sulfur composite is reported for synthesizing sulfur nanoparticles/disordered mesoporous carbon composite, which shows a high specific capacity of 660.8 mAh/g (composite) during the first cycle and an excellent cyclic retention of 87.9% after 100 cycles.

AB Size-dependent physicochemical properties of nanoparticles led to certain complications in thermodynamic calculations followed by energy balance as the first step in these calculations. This work reviewed recent studies on nanothermodynamic topics in an attempt to find some thermodynamic methods for establishing energy balance in systems containing nanoparticles. Some thermodynamic paths were introduced to establish energy balance for ease of calculation by avoiding unknown functions. Based on the proposed pathway, enthalpy changes for several processes involving nanoparticles, such as formation of nanoparticles and phase transitions, were investigated and formulated.

The results obtained from methanol oxidation over the graphene hybridized MoNiCoS modified electrode revealed suitable electrocatalytic properties and a considerable diffusion current, confirmed by the Tafel plots through calculating the exchange current (io) as an important kinetic parameter of electron transfer. It was found that the above composite could be an appropriate alternative in designing a DMFC fuel cell as a clean energy generator. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular clusters containing the selected highly oxidized molecule (HOM) C10H14O7, 2-Methyl-5-[(1S, 2S, 3R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl]-3-furoic acid, and common trace neutral and ionic atmospheric species, such as H2SO4, NH3, H2O, methylamine and dimethylamine molecules and airborne HSO4- and NO3- ions, have been investigated using the Density Functional Theory. Optimization of geometries have been conducted at PW91PW91 level using 6-311++ G(3df, 3pd) basis set. The results have been discussed in terms of structural, energetic, and atmospheric perspectives. It is shown that the C10H14O7 may impact new particle formation by forming stable hydrogen-bonded clusters with ionic and neutral species such as strongly bonded HOM-NO3- organonitrates (ONs) and HOM-HSO4- complexes and, possibly, HOMH2SO4-amine clusters.

AB The critical behavior associated with the magnetic phase transition has been investigated by magnetization isotherms in La0.5Ca0.4 Ag0.1MnO3 (LCAMO) powder. The X-ray diffraction characterization has revealed that this sample crystallized in the orthorhombic symmetry with Pnma space group. While the experimental results revealed that this sample underwent a paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition, the magnetic measurements data indicated that the compound exhibited a second-order phase transition. Furthermore, the critical exponents values were found as beta = 0.79, gamma = 0.71 and delta = 1.828 with T-C = 189.87 K. The relative cooling power of the sample was determined as 14.70 J/kg under a magnetic field of 1 T making it a potential working material in magnetic refrigeration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study reports the use of engineering nanocarbon film with confined silicon nanoparticles as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The unique "concave" graphitic nanostructure, prepared in porous templates with morphology of interconnected arrays, makes nanocarbon electrodes a good lithium-ion intercalation medium and, more importantly, robust nanocontainers to effectively confine highcapacity silicon nanoparticles for lithium-ion storage. Open structures of the concave nanocarbon increase the accessibility of Li ions, and allow Li ions to diffuse active materials. In addition, the highly textured concave pores allow the volume expansion of the silicon nanoparticles to be confined to the nanospace during lithium-ion insertion/extraction. The specific capacity of the nanoconfined silicon/nanocarbon anode reaches up to 2500 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g. After long cycling, the anode materials becomes even more stable, showing the invariant lithium-ion storage capacity as the charge-discharge rate is increased by 10 times from 2-20 A/g. The capacity is retained constantly after 200 charge-discharge cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   ADSORPTION; GE; SI
AB Effective controlling of charge and magnetic states is critical to the use of magnetic nanostructures in quantum information devices, but still a challenging task. Substitutional doping of transition metal atoms provides an effective route to tune the magnetism of silicene and to enhance the stability of silicene. Here, by using density-functional theory calculations we explore the structure, stability, electronic, and magnetic properties of Ni-doped silicene. We find that magnetic states show a unique dependence on their site registration on the silicene. Specifically, Ni atoms present antiferromagnetic spin states when Ni atoms in the same lattice substitute two silicon atoms. In contrast, Ni atoms exhibit ferromagnetic spin states once located in different sublattices. Given that the pristine silicene is intrinsically nonmagnetic and unstable in air, through the coupling of ferromagnetic elements with silicene may provide an alternative avenue for widening their applications as spintronics.

AB Total-ion-yield near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectra of pyrimidine nucleobases were recorded. The phenomenon of specific dissociation, such as a larger branching ratio of some ionic fragments at resonant excitation energies, was observed. From the details of the specific dissociation channels, the larger branching yields at pi*-resonant excitations indicate that local bond cleavages around the atom excited is responsible for producing these ions; local excitation thus plays a major role in the site-specific dissociations. Using the NEXAFS spectra, representative ions and their branching ratios, we propose some improved ways to determine the quantities of pyrimidine nucleobases in DNA and RNA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the hydration and structure of the tripeptide GPG-NH2, and the effect of substituting a fluorine or hydroxyl group onto one of the C-alpha positions in the glycinamide portion of the molecule. The fluorinated and hydroxylated peptides both display a slight dehydration of the proline and glycinamide residues and a different conformation of the glycinamide residue backbone than the GPG peptide. These two effects result in a significant decrease in the water-mediated interactions between the Gly1 and glycinamide residues, which had previously been shown to nucleate beta turns in GPG-NH2.

[AlF4] , [AlF5](2) and [AlF6](3) groups coexist in LiF-NaF-AlF3 molten salt, while the amount of [AlF4] groups in LiF-NaF-AlF3 molten salt is quite small. With the increase of LiF, the content of free fluorine ion Ff in LiF-NaF-AlF3 molten salt increases slightly. Adding more LiF can effectively break the F atom bridges and decrease the ionic structure polymerization degree of LiF-NaF-AlF3 molten salt, reducing viscosity and enhancing ionic conductivity correspondingly.

AB Gas sensing properties of C2H4Ti complex for monoxides and dioxides are studied using MP2/6-311++G** level and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Adsorption energies, geometric and electronic properties of an isolated and oxide adsorbed C2H4Ti complexes are studied. Density of state plot is used to study change in electronic properties of C2H4Ti complex after adsorption of oxides. Adsorption of all the oxide molecules is energetically favourable on C2H4Ti complex for entire temperature and pressure range considered. This is also confirmed using MD simulations. The C2H4Ti complex is suitable sensing material for monoxides and dioxides for a wide range of temperature and pressure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study of various molecules located in different positions and of their temporal reactions within a micro-sized particle in its natural phase is essential to deeper understanding the functions of these molecules. Here, we measured the temporal Raman spectra in different submicron positions of a laser-trapped droplet composed of diethyl phthalate and glycerol. Results demonstrated the micro-cavity enhanced effects, the morphology change, dynamics of phase-separation, and evaporation of the mixed droplet. This method offers a powerful tool to monitor various chemical reactions in different positions within a single cell, spore, or particle in life science and atmospheric science.

AB The macroporous alpha-Fe2O3 tubular hierarchical structure has been synthesized by a facile template method. The macroporous alpha-Fe2O3 has high surface area (120 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (0.967 cm(3) g(-1)). To demonstrate its ultrafast mass transfer rate, this porous alpha-Fe2O3 was employed to remove Congo red from simulated waste-water. The adsorption process of Congo red on macroporous alpha-Fe2O3 can be finished within only 5 min, which is much faster than those of the other reported similar materials. This macroporous alpha-Fe2O3 will be very useful for catalysts support, adsorbent, and sensor, wherein accessibility of active sites is an important factor to enhance the performance.

AB Systematical molecular dynamics with different force fields are performed to simulate the structure and dynamics of crystal of hen egg-white lysozyme, including AMBER and three versions of protein-specific charge, PPC. The electrostatic polarization within the crystal is studied with the comparison among four 250 ns trajectories under them. Results show that under appropriate parameterized PPC, the protein can be stable during simulations, indicated by both smaller root-mean-square deviation and closer crystallographic B-factors to the experimental values. This work also shows how the selection of dielectric constant affects the results of utilizing PPC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LIQUID-VAPOR INTERFACE; APPROXIMATION; ENERGY; MODELS
AB In this work, the potential of COSMO-RS for direct prediction of surface tension through a desolvationbased model is explored. It is shown that for most investigated molecules, the model gives reasonable approximation of the surface tension values without any empirical fitting (average absolute error of 4.6 mN/m). Surface tension is overestimated by this simple approach for a few molecules with strong hydrogen bonding association (like water or ethanol). This suggests that these molecules show preferential orientation at the interface, analogously to surfactants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

New La-O and Ce-O Lennard-Jones parameters were optimized to provide an accurate atomistic description of the nitrato complexes at low computational cost. XANES spectra analysis, along with radial and combined distance-angle distributions from MD simulations, indicate that the main metal species in solution is an icosahedral nitrato complex with a 12-fold cation-oxygen coordination and an equilibrium between monodentate and bidentate ligands.

AB The electronic structures of several derivatives of N-benzylidenaniline ligands (NBA) studied previously by HeI UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) have been re-analyzed with outer valence Green's function (OVGF) and ionization-potential equation of motion coupled cluster method (IP-EOMCC) quantum chemical calculations. The calculations allowed us to clearly identify molecular orbitals with predominantly nitrogen lone pair character and correlate their ionization energies with the experimental kinetic data on the cyclopalladation of imines. We have also rationalized the stability (or the lack of it) for NBA complexes with d-block transition metals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorescence spectral shift of singlet oxygen, O-2((1) Delta(g)) was studied in the presence of a nitroxide radical quencher. The O-2-nitroxide complex causes a blue-shifts in both molecular solvents and in ionic liquids. The amount of shift is found to be nearly the same for both solvents, about 50 cm(-1). This shift was attributed to quartet-doublet energy separation of O-2((3)Sigma(g))-nitroxide pair by exchange interaction of O-2 and nitroxide radical. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By means of coupled-cluster calculations we studied the neutral complexes: Na-benzene and K-benzene. They are non-ionic presenting C-6v symmetry. In contrast with the results obtained for Li-benzene, the non-ionic C-2v structure was not a minimum. At the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory, with the inclusion of relativistic and core-valence effects, the dissociation energies for sodium and potassium benzene complexes are 2.4 and 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively. We found that most density functionals overestimate the adsorption energies of alkalis onto benzene. Therefore, special caution must be taken when DFT methods are employed to investigate the interactions between these elements and carbon nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The geometry, the orbit energies, the dissociation properties and the IR spectrum of CF2Br2 under external electrical fields (-0.015 a. u. to 0.065 a. u.) have been calculated at the B3PW91/6-311+ G (2df) level. The potential energy surfaces along single and two C-Br bonds under different external fields were obtained which indicate that the stepwise dissociation will happen under 0.055 a. u. and a generally repulsive pathway towards the concerted dissociation of ground state CF2Br2 exists under 0.065 a. u.(1 a. u. = 5.14225 x 10(11) V.m(-1)).

AB Motivated by the huge potential for two-dimensional materials in gas sensors, the adsorption behavior of gas molecules on the surface of penta-BP5 is investigated by first principles calculations. Results show that CO and CO2 have slight influence on the electronic property of penta-BP5 and the charge transfers are small, revealing that penta-BP5 is not suitable for detecting these two gases. However, penta-BP5 is sensitive to CH2O, SO2, O-2 and NO because that considerable adsorption energies and charge transfers can be found in the adsorption systems, indicating that penta-BP5 could be a potential sensing material for detecting these gases.

AB Er3+ to Eu3+ energy-transfer and frequency upconversion in PbGeO3: PbF2: CdF2 glass are reported. Emission spectra excited at 980 nm was obtained for Er3+-doped samples, while Eu3+ emissions only occurred for double-doped (Er3+/Eu3+) or triple-doped (Yb3+/Er3+/Eu3+) samples. Codoped samples' spectra exhibit bands around 520 (H-2(11/2) - I-4(15/2)), 545 (S-4(3/2) - I-4(15/2)), 590 (D-5(0) - F-7(1)), 610 (D-5(0) - F-7(2)), 660 (F-4(9/2) - I-4(15/2)) and 700 (D-5(0) - F-7(4)) nm. The Er3+ green emissions' lifetimes were examined as a function of Eu3+ content evidencing Er3+-to-Eu3+ energy-transfer. The addition of Yb3+ enhanced the Eu3+ ions' emissions suggesting potential application for upconversion-based white light phosphor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Methyl bromide (CH3Br) is a hazardous ozone depleting substance that is released to the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources. Within the troposphere CH3Br is removed through reaction with (OH)-O-center dot and Cl-center dot radicals. Here, quantum and statistical mechanical calculations are combined with existing experimental data in order to arrive at improved rate coefficient expressions for the reaction of methyl bromide with (OH)-O-center dot and Cl-center dot from 200 to 2000 K. For CH3Br + (OH)-O-center dot k = 9.8 x 10(14) (T/298) 2.9 exp(-3000/RT) and for CH3Br + Cl-center dot k = 1.5 x 10 (12) (T/298)(2.0) exp(-2900/RT), with k in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), T in K, and R = 1.987 cal mol(-1) K-1.

AB We present ultrafast-depopulation-dynamics of higher-lying-excited-states using femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion techniques for two near-infrared (NIR) tricarbocyanine dyes (IR144 and IR140) in primary alcohols. With visible excitation wavelengths, such dyes show two distinct emission-bands with large peak wavelength difference: one at the visible region: S-2 -> S-0, and the other at NIR region: S-1 -> S-0. We show that exact band-positions, intensities, and fluorescence-decay-timescales (tau) depend strongly on viscosity and polarity of solvents. Interestingly, though the faster component of s increased for IR144 with increasing viscosity and chain-length of alcohols, the reverse was seen for IR140, indicating the possible formation of ion-pair of IR140 with alcohols.

AB This report describes how LiI mixes with thin propanol and butanol films at cryogenic temperatures using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy. The glass transition temperature, T-g, is assignable as the uptake onset of LiI additives in the thin film interior. The uptake rate of LiI in the deeply supercooled region is small for 1-propanol and 2-butanol, but concentrated solutions are formed on a LiI film at temperatures higher than 1.2-1.3 T-g. The supercooled 2-propanol and 1-butanol are short-lived; their crystallites form complexes at the interface with LiI because of premelting. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB I84V mutation in HIV-1 protease (PR) has produced drug resistance on multiple inhibitors. Thermodynamic integration (TI), solvated interaction energy (SIE) and dynamic analysis were applied to comparatively probe drug-resistant mechanisms of I84V mutation toward four inhibitors. Dynamic analysis suggests that in the I84V mutants the flaps of PR are more flexible and domains near the flaps of PR and residues 84/84' also change obviously. Binding free energy predictions show I84V mutation mainly drive the decrease in van der Waals interactions of inhibitors with PR. This study is expected to provide theoretical helps for designs of potent inhibitors targeting HIV-1 protease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Steady state magnetic field effect (MFE) on pyrene/di-methyl-aniline exciplex luminescence has been studied in various concentrations of pyrene in acetone and methanol. Photo-induced electron transfer in this system generates radical ion pairs undergoing geminate, non-geminate as well as bulk recombination. It has been observed that MFE in acetone is always greater than that in methanol for identical pyrene concentration. However the exciplex fluorescence yield is always greater in methanol than that in acetone. The data and non-typical behavior of alcoholic solvents with respect to the variation of MFE with permittivity has been explained on the basis of a phenomenological model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The application of sodium percarbonate (SPC) catalyzed by FeOCl under visible light (FeOCl/SPC/Vis), is shown in this paper. The reaction kinetics, degradation mechanism, and catalyst stability were thoroughly investigated using Rhodamine B (RhB) as a simulated pollutant. Experimental results show that the degradation rate of RhB increases due to the participation of visible light. The valence change of iron species in the FeOCl catalyst, before and after the reaction, were characterized by XPS. It is found that the redox cycle of iron species can be accelerated under visible light. This activates SPC to generate radicals, effectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermally reduced graphite oxide and titanium dioxide (TRGO-TiO2) composite is synthesized by using a simple chemical method for supercapacitor applications. The TRGO-TiO2 composites have higher capacitance than that of each precursor, such as GO, TRGO, and TiO2. Electrochemical performance of the composites with different weight ratio of TRGO to TiO2 is also investigated, and optimal ratio for the best performance is 7 to 3, resulting in the specific capacitance of 380 F g(-1). The best performance of the TRGO-TiO2 composite is attributed to synergic effect of the high electrical conductivity supported by TRGO and electroactive property of TiO2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To that, calculated gas phase Gibbs free energies at PBE1PBE/6-311+G(d, p) level of theory and computed solvation Gibbs free energies at (CPCM/IEF-PCM: UAKS, UAHF and UA0)/HF/6-31+ G(d) levels of theory were combined. The most accurate pK(a) values were obtained with thermodynamic cycle involving water and using CPCM-UA0 solvation model with MAD = 0.4. Moreover, for the first time, aqueous pK(a) value of Halazepam was predicted using the best method equal to 3.1. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The solubilities of L-isoleucine and L-serine in aqueous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4) from 298.15 to 308.15 K are presented. The solubilities are measured by 'gravimetric' method. The relative solubility of the amino acids is calculated to explain the salting-in and salting-out effect in the electrolytes solutions. The amino acids solvation thermodynamical parameters are computed. The chemical effects of the transfer Gibbs energies for both the amino acids are estimated by subtracting the cavity effect and dipole-dipole interaction effect from the total transfer energies. The chemical transfer energetics is employed to discuss solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The expression proposed fulfills in a rigorous way the dimensionless criterion and it is strictly positive overall space, the applications were done on the first thirty-six neutral atoms and in a set of 1863 molecules. The results obtained in molecules, permit us to introduce the concept of par-paene-entropic molecules, which means molecules with almost the same entropic content, this permits us to identify some groups of molecules that could be structurally different but some of them could be equivalent from the chemical reactivity point of view.

AB NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires with diameters of 100-150 nm and lengths up to several tens of micrometers have been successfully prepared on a large scale via a simple hydrothermal technique. The growth mechanism and morphology evolution of the NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires were discussed on the basis of the experimental results. The application of the NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires for the removal of Fe(III) ions in water was investigated and the results indicate that the as-prepared NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires showed excellent removal property for Fe(III) ions. Significantly, this is the first time that the NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanostructures was prepared and used as candidates for adsorbing heavy metal ions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hollow biodegradable polymer nanoparticles as drug carrier possess effective low density and higher surface area. Chitosan hollow nanospheres were prepared using poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide as template by single emulsion method. The DLS studies showed increase in size from 125 nm to 186 nm for the formation of core@ shell structure. The BET surface area increased from 62 m(2) g(-1) for chitosan@ poly-D, L-lactideco- glycolide to 111 m(2) g(-1) for hollow chitosan nanospheres. TEM analyses indicated core@ shell, chitosan@ poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide and the hollow morphology of the chitosan nanospheres. Ramipril in acetone (1.5 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL) was physically adsorbed onto hollow chitosan nanospheres and the amount of adsorbed ramipril was determined by HPLC. Higher entrapment efficiency (91%) with 96% of the drug content was observed for the sample with 5 mg/mL of the drug. The in-vitro release of ramipril of 86% and 73% was achieved in acetate (pH-3.3) and phosphate (pH-6.3) buffers respectively while only 48% of ramipril in Tris buffer (pH-8.0) medium. Korsemeyer-Peppas model of drug release indicated the release of ramipril being swelling controlled. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Resistance random access memory (RRAM) is a promising memory technology in the applications of memory device. Herein, the amorphous TiO2 thin film was grown onto titanium (Ti) foil by anodic oxidation. Further, the Ag/TiO2/Ti sandwich structure device was prepared, which displays a resistive switching memory effect with a high HRS/LRS resistance ratio with similar to 27 at room temperature when the TiO2 film was oxidized similar to 5 min. Finally, the formation/rupture models of Ag conductive filaments are suggested to explain the resistive switching memory behavior. This work open a new way for preparing the RRAM device for memory applications in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Significant enhancement of the X acidity upon the formation of X/AlF3 compounds is predicted.

AB We investigated photocatalytic activity of gamma-Ga2O3 nanocrystals with varying compositions. Substitutional doping with In3+ and Zn2+ allows for a control of charge carrier trapping in native defect states, which was studied by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Doping nanocrystals with In3+ decreases while doping with Zn2+ increases the lifetime of the carriers trapped on donor and acceptor sites. The apparent rate constant for the photocatalytic dye degradation correlates well with the average donor-acceptor recombination lifetime, suggesting critical importance of carrier trapping for charge separation. The results of this work demonstrate the design of single-phase photocatalysts by controlling carrier trapping via compositional manipulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding structural changes during microsolvation of a solute by increasing numbers of CO2 molecules provides a path towards improved models of supercritical CO2 solvent properties. Microwave spectroscopic observations of fluoroethylene (FE) microsolvation by CO2 give two FE-(CO2)(2) isomers, each with fragments similar to previously studied planar FE-CO2 dimers. In each trimer, a second CO2 is located above the FE plane, in a position not observed for FE-CO2. Current work on FE/CO2 mixtures focuses on deconvoluting interleaved spectra in the microwave scan, aiming to identify FE-(CO2)(3) and other clusters, with patterns from at least five additional cluster spectra already identified.

AB In this study, we used a light-irradiated environmental cell to directly observe the formation of hydrogen nanobubbles on platinized La5Ti2AgS5O7 photocatalyst particles; this approach enabled us to verify whether the site of hydrogen evolution was governed by the one-dimensional conductivity of the photocatalyst material. This work constitutes substantial progress as such visualization of reaction sites while they are operational and helps us to determine the reaction mechanism, which can lead to the improved performance of particulate photocatalysts.

TI A theoretical study on the phosgenation of methylene diphenyl diamine

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

ID GEOMETRIES; ENERGIES; HEATS
AB G3MP2B3 calculations were used to investigate the mechanism of the phosgenation reactions of 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA) resulted in the formation of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Due to o-dichlorobenzene solvation the reaction barriers are dramatically reduced compared to the gas phase reaction mechanism. The mechanisms of the 'phosgenations first' and 'stepwise phosgenations' are energetically compared. Standard enthalpy of formation for MDI (14.8 +/- 5.2 kJ/mol) and the group additivity increments for OCN and NHCOCl groups linked to phenyl ring are proposed (Delta H-f,i(0)(-NCO) = -61.2 kJ/mol and Delta H-f,i(0)(-NHCOCl) = -195.0 kJ/mol). A thermodynamic stabile charge separated amine hydrochloride intermediate can mask the amine toward phosgene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The assemblies of optically active gold nanoparticles on a functionalized silicon planar substrate were considered in terms of the interface depth density distribution obtained by atomic-force microscopy, X-ray diffraction/reflectometry and neutron reflectometry. Two layers of nanoparticles were sequentially deposited using an additional cross-linking agent. First layer was made of nanoparticles being synthesized in light water while the second one in light/heavy water mixture. The isotope difference in layers observed in the neutron reflectometry experiment was related to water molecules incorporation into the organic shell around nanoparticles. The results are discussed with respect to the possibilities in resolving the structure of complex multilayer assemblies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy is demonstrated for Ag nanocubes with different edge-lengths. A large bisignated MCD response is typical in the dipolar localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) region, which can be explained within a model on the magnetic Lorentz force imparted on the collective electrons that circularly move in the nanocube. In contrast, the MCD signal attributed to multipolar (including quadrupolar) LSPR exhibits a sharp simple (single) peak, but it never corresponds to the extinction peak position. This discrepancy is discussed on the basis of energetically unequal MCD responses for the left-and right-circularly polarized light excitations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interfacial parameters obtained from surface tension were beneficial in deciphering the phenomenon taking place at the interface. Critical micelle concentration (cmc), and various thermodynamic parameters were achieved from conductance. The negative values of Delta G(mic)degrees: and Delta G(ad)degrees: indicate the feasibility of the mixed micellization process. Rubingh and Motomura introduced theoretical model for micellar interaction parameter (beta(m)) have been examined to investigate the interactions between AMT and the SAILs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis is based on the symmetry properties of the electronic Hamiltonian and includes spin-orbit coupling terms. The Taylor series expansion of the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of normal modes is restricted to second order in the electrostatic contributions and to first order in the spin-orbitspin-orbit contributions. The main result of this work is a 6 x 6 vibronic matrix which depends on the t(2) and e vibrational normal modes and is specified by six electrostatic and three spin-orbit coupling constants.

AB Logarithmic mean-force dynamics (LogMFD) is one of free energy calculation methods that utilize fictitious dynamical variables for efficient conformational sampling. In this study, we extend the LogMFD method to incorporate the isokinetic dynamics for the fictitious dynamical variables. The isokinetic LogMFD approach requires no additional parameter for thermostatting and it obviates the issue associated with the dynamics of the thermostat variable in Nose-Hoover type thermostats. These virtues therefore make it easier to set up and undertake LogMFD calculations. The validity of the isokinetic algorithm introduced in LogMFD is examined by a benchmark system of alanine dipeptide in explicit water. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, we investigate the impact of atomic defects on the band edge optical properties of MoS2 nanotubes. Our findings demonstrate the sensitivity of the optical properties of MoS2 nanotube to the details of the defect type. Transition density plot corresponding to the principal peak in the absorption spectrum allowed us to understand the differences in the band edge optical excitation of defected MoS2 nanotubes with respect to the pristine MoS2 nanotube. We found that pristine MoS2 nanotube supports collective plasmon-like excitation and this excitation can be strongly spatially localized depending on the defect type. More precisely, mono-carbon atom defect and/or sulfur vacancy defects favour strong degree of localization near the defected region. While in contrast, in the case of mono-silicon atom defect and/or molybdenum vacancy defects, the collective plasmon-like excitation of the MoS2 nanotube is only marginally affected. The strong degree of localization in combination with the entrance of in-gap states in the case of mono-carbon atom defect and/or sulfur vacancy defects could have wide implications in the field of transition metal dichalcogenides based nanodevices.

AB It is demonstrated that the dispersion of alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles in graphene oxide (GO)-polyaniline (PANi) composite results in significant enhancement of photovoltaic and supercapacitive properties. In order to improve PV and SC properties of GO-PANi composite, 0.5 wt% of alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles were added in composite. Both PV and SC properties of composites becomes strengthen by addition of 0.5 wt% of alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles. The GO-PANi/alpha-Al2O3 composite shows power conversion efficiency (%eta) 9.31%, which is significantly higher than pure alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles and GO-PANi composite. The GO-PANi/alpha-Al2O3 composite achieve considerable specific capacitance of the order 715.5 Fg(-1) at scan rate of 2mV s(-1). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to small shear viscosity of supercritical carbon dioxide, oil drilling leads to viscous fingering. Addition of polymer as thickener in supercritical CO2 has been used for improving the sweep efficiency of flooding. The simulated shear viscosity of supercritical CO2 systems increased with the addition of the polymer. The groups of the polymer have different ability to bind the supercritical CO2 molecules. The binding effect can mainly be attributed to space grid structure of polymer to reduce movement of CO2 molecules, in which the van der Waals interaction was the main constraint interaction.

AB Multicolor excitation is at the core of many fluorescence spectroscopy techniques such as PIE-FRET, ALEX-FRET, or FCCS. However, the influence of the multiple laser excitations on the dye photophysics is often overlooked. Here, we show that green laser pulses can surprisingly quench the fluorescence of common red dyes Alexa Fluor 647 and Atto 647N, even when the conditions leading to photobleaching are avoided. The physical origin of this phenomenon is discussed via a long-lived dark state and/or photorefractive effects. These observations are important to avoid measurement artifacts as both the fluorophore concentration and the fluorescence brightness are affected. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculation has been carried out to yield the coupled-channel reaction probabilities with total angular momentum J up to 60 for the H + CO2 + OH + CO reaction on the PIP-NN PES potential energy surface. Well converged integral cross section (ICSs) for collision energy up to 2.4 eV were obtained for the ground initial state. As compared with previous study, it is found that the CS approximation substantially underestimated ICSs, which is inadequate for the title reaction. In addition, the agreement between QM and QCT ICSs is quite satisfactory, indicating that the QCT method is rather accurate on describing dynamics of this complex-forming reaction.

AB We investigate geometric corrugation for D-2 dissociation on Pt( 1 1 1) by mapping the dependence of the initial reaction probability on incident kinetic energy and polar angle for two different azimuths. In accordance with predictions from dynamical calculations of dissociation on an SRP-based potential energy surface, we find at most a very weak signature of geometric corrugation at large polar angles.

AB The structural, mechanical and electronic properties of the ternary inter-alkali metal oxides KNaO and RbNaO compounds are investigated by using first principle calculations. The structural parameters and atomic positions are in agreement with the experimental values. The bulk, shear and Young moduli, Poisson's ratio, Lame coefficients and Debye temperature have been calculated. The elastic parameters indicate that these compounds have ductile behavior. The calculated band structures indicate that KNaO and RbNaO have an indirect energy band gap. The charge density distributions reveal an anionic character. This theoretical study is likely to stimulate future experimental researches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB First-principle calculations are carried out to interpret the experimental observations and to generate the mechanisms of CO and CH4 conversion with Fe2O1-3. The stabilization of Fe-C bonding involves pi*(C-O) and electron donating from oxygens' LP. The Fe-O bond activation is rate-limiting step of conversions. Stabilization and activation are affected by number of oxygens at the iron active site. Low ORBs are identified for CO + Fe2O1-3 reaction pathways. Significant ORBs are calculated for Fe2O3 + CH4, and the competing mechanism of reduction by H-2 is shown. DFT calculations suggest favorable formation of Fe3C in atmosphere of CH4 and its oxidation in atmosphere of CO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We aim to understand foreign gas effect on A-band of oxygen that is optical forbidden b(1)Sigma(+)(g)(v - 0) <- X-3 Sigma(-)(g)(v - 0) transition. To measure the absorption of weak A-band, a high pressure absorption spectroscopy system was constructed. We found absorbance around A-band of O-2/M (=N-2, CO2, SF6, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) gas mixture were larger than that of pure O-2. This enhancement by foreign gases was discussed from a view point of heavy atom and polarizability effects under the light of the presented mechanism of the heavy atom effect. We performed quantitative analysis on the enhancement by noble gases, which are monoatomic molecules, as a foreign gas. The polarizability effect was examined by using SF6 as a foreign gas, which is a simple molecule with large polarizability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peptidomimetics are a broad family of compounds designed to mimic the main structural features of peptides, avoiding their metabolic drawbacks. In particular, universal peptidomimetics use only peptide side-chain analogs to mimic different secondary structures. In this work, a novel method is proposed to identify universal peptidomimetics. It is based on a single Meta-Dynamics simulation which allows the reconstruction of the Free Energy Surface of the compound of interest. Subsequently, cluster analysis is carried out to obtain representative structures. Such conformers are then compared to ideal secondary structures to assess their mimicking ability. This protocol was validated against known universal peptidomimetics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Infrared spectra of Ca(NH3)(n) complexes in the gas phase have been recorded for the first time. The spectra are consistent with structures where the Ca atom resides inside one or more solvation shells of NH3 molecules. IR spectra were recorded using a photodissociation technique. A comparison of the spectra with those predicted from ab initio calculations suggests that Ca(NH3)(8) has all NH3 molecules in a single solvent shell around the Ca atom, whereas the spectra of Ca(NH3)(9) and Ca(NH3)(10) are consistent with two-shell structures.

AB Diffuse agricultural pollution, especially from intensively managed agricultural land is a major cause of eutrophication, therefore it is important to reduce the diffuse load to surface water. Constructed wetlands (CW) are an effective measure for improving water quality and reducing nutrient runoff from agriculture by using natural water treatment mechanisms. We studied treatment efficiency of an in-stream free surface flow (FSW) Vanda CW in southern Estonia from 16th of March 2017 fill 11th of January 2018. Vanda CW has a catchment area of 2.2 km(2) and of which approximately 62% is under intensive agricultural management. The CW consists of a sedimentation pond followed by two shallow water wetlands planted with cattail (Typha latifolia). Our analyses showed that the CW retained 17.5 kg phosphorus (P) ha(-1) yr(-1). During the warm period phosphate removal was up to 41.8% whereas annually it was only 14.4%. Phosphate removal efficiency showed strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.001) with flow rate and therefore it can be seen that shorter retention time reduces significantly the overall P removal efficiency. The yearly reduction of total organic carbon was up to 3300 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) while surprisingly the CW increased total nitrogen up to 1375 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The results demonstrate that the acclimatization period of newly established in-stream FWS CWs in northern countries can be relatively long and after two years of establishment we still cannot see satisfactory treatment processes, especially in nitrogen.

AB As building-integrated vegetation, green roofs can improve thermal performance of buildings and their am-bience. Research efforts tended to focus on thermal behavior of extensive green roofs outside the tropics, with inadequate attention on intensive type and tropical region. Using detailed microclimatic monitoring, this study investigated the thermal behavior of a native-woodland intensive green roof in subtropical Hong Kong. Three summer weather days denoting sunny, cloudy and rainy were chosen from long-term monitoring data for comparison with a nearby bare control roof. Shading and evapotranspiration by the woodland canopy respectively reduced roof surface temperature and air temperature by latent-heat absorption. The most notable maximum surface and air cooling, respectively at 19.80 degrees C and 6.21 degrees C, was achieved in daytime sunny condition, with cooling effect extending into nighttime. Surface cooling was mainly governed by daily pattern of solar irradiance, whereas air cooling was more pronounced nearer ground surface except in nighttime period on rainy days. Slight near-surface air warming occurred in rainy nighttime. The woodland vegetation filtered 90% of the incoming shortwave radiation during most of the daytime, serving as an insolation filter which contributed to surface cooling. The substrate experienced net heat loss in cloudy and rainy weather, exporting its antecedent stored heat. At 0.5 m substrate depth, the temperature stayed at a stable level, suggesting restricted heat exchange in subsoil. With appropriate design and regular maintenance, an intensive green roof with dense woodland canopy and 1-m substrate could provide effective above-ground and soil cooling and buffer against outdoor-to-indoor heat ingress.

AB In gravel-bedded streams and rivers, silk nets of hydropsychid caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) can increase the critical shear stress, required for sediment particle motion, reduce bedload flux, and provide a low flow refuge for other organisms. However, there is still a limited understanding of the mechanisms that regulate how biological silk structures might influence near-bed fluid dynamics. Part of the challenge in identifying both the per capita and population level influences of caddisfly silk nets lies in the difficulty of modelling such fine-scale and detailed architecture of the structures. Here, we use a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to evaluate the impact of silk nets on shear stress and pore space velocity by varying silk net aerial density within a modelled gravel bedded stream where the silk nets are simulated as small rigid bodies of realistic distribution, geometry, and orientation. The model revealed that silk net densities of 330 and 735 nets/m(2) reduce the average shear stresses by an average 6.0% and 11.6%, respectively, over a range of inflow velocities. Silk nets also result in near-bed flows close to 0 m/s by reducing velocity by up to 60%. Our research sheds light on the important influence of small but numerous aquatic animals on water flow paths and highlights the significance of adding biological complexity into water flow models in lotic ecosystems to improve erosion models that may be used in river channel and riparian habitat design.

AB Many metropolitan cities around the world are promoting the implementation of Green Roofs (GR) as effective stormwater management systems to mitigate adverse effects of urbanization. Hourly water balance calculations are necessary for accurate prediction of the antecedent soil moisture conditions of a GR, a key parameter for rainfall-runoff modeling. However, existing evapotranspiration (ET) models have substantial errors for hourly ET predictions over a range of moisture conditions to accurately assess the hydrological performance of the GRs during storm events. Therefore, a modified Penman-Monteith equation was developed to provide improved prediction of hourly ET specifically for GR applications. ET rates predicted by the modified and established Penmen-Monteith equations were compared with ET data collected from a GR lysimeter over the summer and fall of 2016. The proposed modified Penman-Montieth equation eliminates the water availability factor (theta(i)/theta(fc)) included in the equation's advection term and separates the effect of plant coefficients on radiation/energy and advection terms. The modified equation was found to improve ET estimates by 8-9% (RMSE: 0.535-0.493, MAD: 0.375-0.343), under non-water limited conditions. For water-limited conditions, errors were significantly reduced. RMSE improved by 37% (0.703-0.440) and MAD was improved by 31% (0.429-0.294).

AB Climate change is a primary driver that alters water pollution hotspots in watersheds, which complicates the use of Best management practices (BMPs) for diffuse pollution mitigation strategies. The objective of this study is to evaluate future changes in BMPs on total phosphorus (TP) loads to the river system, depending on climate change. Current weather data were collected from 2000 to 2010 and future weather data from 2040 to 2050 were obtained from regional climate model simulations based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios. This study describes various BMP implementation plans at affordable cost that are adapted to different weather conditions, current (for 2000-2010) and future climate scenarios (for 2040-2050). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), i.e., one of the deterministic models for watershed management, was used to estimate total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency of various types of BMP at two crop fields (rice paddy and soybean fields) in the Yeongsan River (YR) watershed of Korea. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support framework, was applied to obtain allow for trade-off analysis between two conflict objectives, the maximum TP load reduction against implementation costs. The SWAT simulation results showed that the model performance based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent bias was acceptable for simulating three parameters; daily flow discharge, monthly sediment loads, and TP loads in the river. As a result, monthly sediment loads and TP loads increase remarkably under all future climate change scenarios except for July, when a comparable amount of precipitation is recorded during the present and future conditions. New implementation of BMPs, therefore, will be required for future climate change scenarios to achieve 50% TP load reduction in the given watershed condition. Interestingly, parallel terraces which showed good efficiency in reducing TP loads at both fields under the current weather condition cannot be effective any more under the worst-case weather scenario in the future climate. In such a case, detention ponds can be proposed as BMP alternative to parallel terraces. Overall, this study not only demonstrates that watershed management plans using BMPs should be adjusted according to climate change scenarios, but also that the hybrid use of SWAT model and AI can help in refining existing and future BMPs at affordable cost.

AB The absence of evidence regarding the ecosystem services of habitats affected by sand mining has had direct effects on the destiny of landscapes affected by human disturbances. Active sand pits and gravel-sand pits cover 0.1% of the study area, the Czech Republic. In many sand pits, various types of oligotrophic wetlands may form; these range from periodic pools to peat bogs and purposefully formed water bodies. In the present study, we aimed to provide the first conclusive evidence of ability of sand pit wetlands to serve as secondary strongholds for both common and threatened wetland-associated epigeic spiders. We examined 21 anthropogenic wetlands in Czech sand pits and gravel-sand pits using pitfall trapping (17,764 trap-days) for the presence of spiders, and characterized various abiotic variables and the cover and composition of plants in the analyzed microhabitats. We found 5,842 individuals from 224 spider species, including 52 Red-Listed species and one previously un-described Scutpelecopsis sp. All types of examined anthropogenic wetlands were associated with low dominance and high entropy, with the least stable assemblages present in gravel-sand pit tailing ponds. The examined anthropogenic wetlands hosted 60% of the species that were previously found in (near-)natural wetlands within the study region, and hosted numerous species that were absent from (near-)natural wetlands. During the sampling period, four study sites were affected by severe June floods, which caused prominent changes in species-specific spider abundances but caused a disappearance of only a few species, including Pardosa prativaga and Xerolycosa miniata. Oligotrophic anthropogenic wetlands occurring in sand pits and gravel-sand pits serve as local biodiversity hotspots, and their value should be taken into consideration when planning restoration and rehabilitation of areas affected by sand and gravel-sand mining.

AB Patterns of spatial and temporal variability of algal bloom in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) of China were investigated using Semi-implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian Finite Element (SELFE) model, an unstructured grid, 3-dimensional, hydrodynamic model fully coupled with an extended version of Water Quality Analysis Program (WASP) and the Carbon and Nutrients Diagenesis (CANDI) model. The coupled model was driven by the discharge , operational water level of the TGR, nutrients and phytoplankton from the upstream, climate condition included the solar radiation, heat fluxes and precipitation observed in the hydrometric and meteorological stations. The simulations were conducted to study the dynamic process of the algal blooms occurred in September 2007 and June 2008, and the modeling results agreed well with the field data included nutrients, chlorophyll-a concentrations in the TGR. The results indicated that the nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations showed obvious difference in the mainstream and the tributaries affected by the diurnal evolution of the phytoplankton during the algal bloom period. The location of algal bloom in the tributary Xiangxi River where the maximum chlorophyll-a concentration was greater than 30 mu g/L was about 20 km from the river mouth, which coincided with the position of backwater tail controlled by the operation of the TGR. Meanwhile, the nutrients concentration near the river bed reached nearly 10 times of the concentration near the water surface after considering the nutrients released from the re-suspended sediment and the biogeochemical process in the river bed sediment. Finally, the climate change affected the aquatic ecosystem in the TGR was investigated and the countermeasure to inhibit the algal bloom in the tributary was suggested through the scenario modeling.

AB This work aims at preparing different nano-minerals using bio-precipitation method (BPM). Nano-calcite (NC), nano-giorgiosite (NG), nano-witherite (NW) have been prepared by the addition of plant-derived urease enzyme (PDUE) to urea/CaCl2, urea/Ca(CH3COO)(2), urea/MgCl2 and urea/BaCl2 solutions, respectively. Nano-Mg-calcite (NMC) was precipitated by dissolving PDUE and urea in ground water (GW). Salt type plays an important role in the morphology, crystallinity, and particle size of nano-minerals. PDUE has higher effectiveness on Ca2+ removal from GW; meanwhile, it has a lower impact on Mg2+ removal. Where, the Ca-hardness varied from 1460 to 20 mg/l after the treatment of GW with PDUE. At the same pH, the Mg-hardness (1833 mg/l) slightly reduced to be 1210 mg/l. By raising pH, using one-molar sodium hydroxide solution, the removal of Mg2+ enhances. The BPM not only used to prepare innovative NMC-mineral from GW, but also applied to reduce GW-hardness.

AB The present study investigates different strategies for the treatment of a mixture of digestate from an anaerobic digester diluted and secondary effluent from a high rate algal pond. To this aim, the performance of two photo-sequencing batch reactors (PSBRs) operated at high nutrients loading rates and different solids retention times (SATs) were compared with a semi-continuous photobioreactor (SC). Performances were evaluated in terms of wastewater treatment, biomass composition and biopolymers accumulation during 30 days of operation. PSBRs were operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days and SRT5 of 10 and 5 days (PSBR2-10 and PSBR2-5, respectively), whereas the semi-continuous reactor was operated at a coupled HRT/SRT of 10 days (SC10-10). Results showed that PSBR2-5 achieved the highest removal rates in terms of TN (6.7 mg L-1 d(-1)), TP (0.31 mg L-1 d(-1)), TOC (29.32 mg L-1 d(-1)) and TIC (3.91 mg L-1 d(-1)). These results were in general 3-6 times higher than the removal rates obtained in the SC1040 (TN 29.74 mg L-1 d(-1), TP 0.96 mg L-1 d(-1), TOC 29.32 mg L-1 d(-1) and TIC 3.91 mg L-1 d(-1)). Furthermore, both PSBRs were able to produce biomass up to 0.09 g L-1 d(-1), more than twofold the biomass produced by the semi-continuous reactor (0.04 g L-1 d(-1)), and achieved a biomass settleability of 86-92%. This study also demonstrated that the microbial composition could be controlled by the nutrients loads, since the three reactors were dominated by different species depending on the nutritional conditions. Concerning biopolymers accumulation, carbohydrates concentration achieved similar values in the three reactors (11%), whereas < 0.5% of polyhydrohybutyrates (PHB) was produced. These low values in biopolymers production could be related to the lack of microorganisms as cyanobacteria that are able to accumulate carbohydrates/PHB.

AB When rivers flood, nutrients exchange between the river and the floodplain, enhancing floodplain vegetation productivity, as described by the flood pulse concept. However, river water may not reach the edge of the floodplain if there are other sources of inundation water. Also, particulate nutrients travel less far from the river than dissolved nutrients and are more likely to remain available to vegetation during the growing season. This would mean that high nutrient input by river water, and associated high floodplain plant productivity, likely occurs only in the vicinity of the river channel. This paper tests 3 hypotheses derived from these observations related to the validity of the Flood Pulse concept and the relation between floodplain plant productivity and dissolved resp. particulate nutrients.
   We mapped particulate nutrient and dissolved nutrient concentrations in floodplain inundation water across the Biebrza floodplain (Poland), and assessed their spatial relationships with topographical parameters, aboveground biomass and species richness. Particulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition and dissolved N decreased significantly with distance from the river and with elevation, and increased significantly with water depth. Dissolved P was not significantly correlated with topographical parameters or water depth. Aboveground biomass correlated significantly with particulate N and P deposition, but not with dissolved N or P.
   We conclude the edge of inundation is a poor predictor of the zone of high productivity. Nutrient input is higher near the river channel due to deposition of particulate nutrients, which are thus more relevant for vegetation productivity than dissolved nutrients. Spatial particulate nutrient patterns should therefore be integrated in monitoring programmes for policy and research. We further recommend refining the flood pulse concept to take into account the spatial deposition of river derived particulate nutrients, as well as non river-derived inundation water sources.

AB This study strove to enhance the efficiency of sediment capping using active thin-layer capping (ATC) with natural zeolite to simultaneously prevent the release of nutrients (PO43- and NH4+) and heavy metals (Pb2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) from polluted reservoir sediment. A series of lab-scale column experiments were performed in different conditions by varying capping thickness, ionic strength of Na+ and Ca2+, and the redox environment in overlying water. Results showed that the release of nutrients and heavy metals could be prevented effectively using ATC with zeolite. There was no significant difference in the efficiency of nutrient (except PO34-) and heavy metals inhibition among three capping thicknesses. The greatest efficiency was obtained with 2 cm thickness, which the inhibition rates of NH4+, PO43-, Cd2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ were 91.9%, 57.7%, 35.7%, 85.7%, 65.6%, and 57.8%, respectively. And, the capping thickness of 1 cm was sufficient to simultaneously prevent the release of nutrients and heavy metals from sediment. The presence of high Ca2+ concentration in the overlying water promoted the release of nutrients and heavy metals. However, aerobic environment could enhance the efficiency of inhibition of nutrient and heavy metal (except Cd2+) release from sediment. Additionally, fluxes of NH4+, PO43-, and Pb2+ in aerobic conditions with capping were significantly lower than those in anaerobic conditions without capping in an in situ capping simulated experiment. Therefore, the efficiency of inhibiting the release of nutrients and heavy metals from sediments could be enhanced by ATC with natural zeolite through a series of measures, including increasing suitable capping thickness, creating an aerobic environment, and reducing the content of Ca2+ in overlying water.

AB Doping strategy has demonstrated to be one effective approach to modify the band structure of oxide semiconductors, which usually introduce the discrete mid-gap states to extend the light absorption range. However, the localized mid-gap states have limited benefit to photocatalytic activity. In the present work, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that indium (In) doping in bismuth oxyhalides (BiOXs, X = F, Cl, Br and I) could overcome this issues through increasing the light absorption and improving the potential for water reduction. Substitutional In (Subln) doping in BiOXs (X = F, Br and I) leads to band gap narrowing through shifting the conduction band edge to lower energies, which can improve the light absorption without creating the mid-gap states. Specifically, the Subln-doped BiOCl increases band gap due to the increased energy levels of the In 5s states. Although Subln-doped BiOCl cannot extend the light absorption of the photocatalyst into the visible light spectrum, it indeed improved the necessary redox potentials for splitting water and preventing from trapping charge carrier. We believe that the DFT calculation results on Subln-doping BiOXs will guide the further development of highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the structural, electronic and optical properties of Cu2ZnSnSe4 alloys. The lattice constants linearly decrease with the increment of the Si concentration and the mean atomic weight. The Cu2ZnSixSn1-xSe4 alloys are miscible with low formation enthalpies. A tunable bandgap is obtained in a wide energy range (1.06-2.26 eV) and primarily due to the upward shift of the conduction band minimum. The alloy Cu2ZnSi0.5Sn0.5Se4 has an optimal bandgap (1.49 eV) and a higher optical absorption coefficient than that of the well-studied CuZnSnS4. The bandgap-tunable Cu2ZnSixSn1-xSe4 alloys can be promising for their photovoltaic applications. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Recently there have been calls to strengthen integration of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention messages, spurred by increasing use of long-acting reversible contraception. To assess the extent to which public health/clinical messages about unintended pregnancy prevention also address STI prevention, we conducted a content analysis of web-based health promotion information for young people.
   Study Design: Websites identified through a systematic Google search were eligible for inclusion if they were operated by a United States-based organization with a mission related to public health/clinical services and the URL included: 1) original content; 2) about sexual and reproductive health; 3) explicitly for adolescents and/or young adults. Using defined protocols, URLs were screened and content was selected and analyzed thematically.
   Results: Many of the 32 eligible websites presented information about pregnancy and STI prevention separately. Concurrent discussion of the two topics was often limited to statements about (1) strategies that can prevent both outcomes (abstinence, condoms only, condoms plus moderately or highly effective contraceptive methods) and (2) contraceptive methods that confer no STI protection. We also identified framing of condom use with moderately or highly effective contraceptive methods for back-up pregnancy prevention but not STI prevention. STI prevention methods in addition to condoms, such as STI/HIV testing, vaccination, or pre-exposure or post exposure prophylaxis, were typically not addressed with pregnancy prevention information.
   Conclusions: There may be missed opportunities for promoting STI prevention online in the context of increasing awareness of and access to a full range of contraceptive methods. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Trichloroethylene (TCE) is able to induce trichloroethylene hypersensitivity syndrome (THS) with multi-system immune injuries. In our previous study, we found kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) activation, including the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R), which contributed to immune organ injury in TCE sensitized mice. However, the mechanism of B1R mediating immune dysfunction is not clarified. The present study initiates to investigate the potential mechanism of B1R on liver injury. We establish a TCE sensitized BALB/c mouse model to explore the mechanism with or without a B1R inhibitor R715. We found B1R expression was increased in TCE sensitization positive mice. As expect, hepatocyte intracellular organelles and mitochondria disappeared, glycogen particles reduced significantly as well in TCE sensitization-positive mice via the transmission electron microscopic examination, meanwhile, R715 alleviated the deteriorate above. The blockade of B1R resulted in a significant decreased p-ERK1/2 and increased p-AKT expression. The expression of CD68 kupffer cell and its relative cytokine, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, increased in TCE sensitization-positive mice and decreased in R715 pretreatment TCE sensitization-positive mice. Together, the results demonstrate B1R plays a key role in ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signal pathway activation and inflammation cytokine expression in immune liver injury induced by TCE. B1R exerts a pivotal role in the development of TCE induced liver injury.

AB The etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) as severe neurodevelopmental ailments is not known. However, several evidences point to dysregulation of immune system as an underlying cause of ASD. In the present study we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-gamma, IFN-gamma, CXCL8, IL-1 beta, IL-2, 1L-4, IL-6, IL-17 in whole blood samples of 30 ASD patients and 41 age and sex-matched healthy subjects with means of real-time PCR. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17 have been shown to be significantly up-regulated in ASD patients compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.0001, P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001 respectively). IL-2 has been shown to be significantly down-regulated in total ASD patients (P < 0.0001). No significant difference has been found in expression levels of other cytokines between patients and healthy subjects. The present study provides further evidences for dysregulation of immune response in ASD patients.

AB Therapeutic resistance leading to tumor relapse is a major challenge in breast cancer (BCa) treatment. Numerous factors involved in multiple mechanisms promote the development of tumor chemo/radio-resistance. Cytokines/chemokines are important inflammatory factors and highly related to tumorigenesis, metastasis and tumors responses to treatment. A large number of studies have demonstrated that the network of cytokines activates multiple cell signaling pathways to promote tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and migration. Particularly in BCa, cytokines-enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process plays a pivotal role in the progression of metastatic phenotypes and resistance to the traditional chemo/radio-therapy. Virtually, therapeutic resistance is not entirely determined by tumor cell intrinsic characteristics but also dependent upon synchronized effects by numerous of local microenvironmental factors. Emerging evidence highlighted that exosomes secreted from various types of cells promote intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules including miRNAs and cytokines, suggesting that exosomes are essential for sustentation of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance within the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which cytokines promote therapeutic resistance of BCa and suggest a potential approach for improving BCa therapeutics by inhibition of exosome function.

AB Fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), a natural flavonoid, is a therapeutic agent for respiratory inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, detailed molecular mechanisms regarding the target protein of fisetin remain unknown.
   Fisetin significantly reduces tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced interleukin (IL)-8 levels by inhibiting both nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) transcriptional activity and the phosphorylation of its upstream effectors. We show that fisetin prevents interactions between protein kinase C (PKC)delta and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), thereby inhibiting the inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK)/NF-kappa B downstream signalling cascade. Furthermore, we found that fisetin directly binds to PKC delta in vitro. Our findings provide evidence that fisetin inhibits the TNF-alpha-activated IKK/NF-kappa B cascade by targeting PKC delta, thereby mediating inflammatory diseases such as COPD.
   These data suggest that fisetin is a good therapeutic drug for the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, such as COPD, by inhibiting the TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B signalling pathway.

AB The loss of global biodiversity is one of the major challenges of our time and urbanisation is seen as a main cause of this. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for Odonata in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on dragonfly species richness and density of 35 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 35 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed significant differences in environmental conditions between STOPON and CONTROL. At the habitat level, STOPON were larger, had a warmer microclimate, and lower concentrations of phosphate. STOPON were predominantly situated in suburbs, while CONTROL occurred mostly in rural areas. Accordingly, at the landscape level, STOPON had greater cover of built-up area as well as a lower cover of arable land and woodland. In line with this, the dragonfly assemblages at STOPON and CONTROL differed. Overall species richness was greater at STOPON than at CONTROL, and indicator species were only identified for STOPON. Especially threatened species benefited from STOPON, having higher species richness as well as higher adult and exuviae densities than CONTROL.
   In conclusion, our study shows that stormwater ponds in urban areas play an important role in the conservation of dragonflies in general and threatened species in particular. At STOPON, as a result of regular management, the habitat quality was high and compensated for the low landscape quality stemming from significant urbanisation effects.

AB As an ecological sludge treatment technology, sludge treatment wetlands (STWs) have the advantages of low investment and low energy consumption, have attracted more and more attention around the world. However, the role of earthworm on biosolids characteristics in STWs is not well known. In the present study, six STWs with two plant species (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia) and earthworm addition were investigated to evaluate their effects on sludge characteristics. Furthermore, feasibility for sludge land application after STWs was assessed. The results showed that the best sludge dewatering (total solids 38.3% during the feeding period) and stabilization condition (volatile solids to total solids 21.1%, dehydrogenase activity 0.65 g (TPF-tetrazole red formazan)/g (sludge) after two months of rest period) were determined in the earthworm assistant STWs planted with P. australis. The rapidly available phosphorus and available potassium contents in sludge were increased by the earthworm addition. The lowest Escherichia coli (600 MPN/g) and volatile fatty acid content (188.7 g/kg) were detected in the earthworm assistant STWs planted with P. australis. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that sludge structure in the bottom was more loosen than in the surface, and the most loosen structure was observed in the earthworm assistant STWs planted with P. australis. The highest germination index (95%) and highest biomass (100 g/m(2)) of the tested crop (Brassica chinensis) were observed in the system with sludge (from STWs planted with P. australis): soil = 1:3 and 1:1, respectively. Overall, the addition of earthworm in STWs exhibited a positive effect on sludge characteristics, which enhanced the quality of treated sludge for land application.

AB Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are natural hormones and synthetic hormone analogues. Types of PGRs reviewed in this paper include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids and jasmonates. At low concentrations, PGRs have the capacity to influence cell division, cell expansion, and cell structure and function, in addition to mediating environmental stress. The direct application to plant roots, shoots, leaves, buds and flowers has been shown to increase resilience to abiotic and biotic stress, break seed dormancy, improve drought tolerance and water use efficiency, improve temperature tolerance, improve nitrogen use efficiency, promote shoot elongation and generation, increase shoot and root mass, stimulate root growth and lateral root development, and promote photosynthesis. PGR products are commonly used throughout agriculture, viticulture, and horticulture to improve plant growth and crop yield under non-ideal soil and environmental conditions. PGR products have yet to be trialed and registered for reclamation purposes in Canada. Their use may improve reclamation success by enhancing growth of slow-growing native plants and transplanted seedlings and cuttings; promoting the redevelopment of soil bacterial communities (including rhizobacteria); enhancing plant growth under environmentally stressful conditions; and, increasing adaptation and resiliency during climate change. There are significant opportunities for seed development, plant propagation and bioengineering in North America for both greenhouse-based and field-based applications. If successful, PGR use on native plants may improve the ecological function of disturbed lands by reducing the timeframe for reclamation and facilitating the achievement of reclamation end goals.

AB Plant communities and selected environmental parameters were studied at the intermittent Lake Cerknica. Seventeen plots (16 m(2)) were defined down a 600-m transect on a gentle sloping shore with an elevation decrease of 2.7 m, to investigate the different types of wetland vegetation characteristic of the different habitats. Vegetation was investigated using the standard Central European method. Soil samples were measured for pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous and potassium, cation exchange capacity, and texture. Large differences in floristic composition of the plant communities were found. Vegetation of mesic meadows was seen for the rarely flooded most elevated plots, with transition downwards to wet grassland communities from the alliance Molinion and from the alliance Deschampsion. The lower habitats with soils waterlogged until July were colonized by marsh communities, while community of emergent hydrophytes was at the lowest end of transect. Over 100 vascular plant species were recorded in the plots. Species richness increased with elevation and decreased with moisture, with > 50 taxa in three most elevated plots, and 9-15 taxa per plot for the nine most frequently flooded plots. The hydrological gradient corresponded to the elevation gradient, and together with duration of flooding had a crucial role in shaping plant community composition, distribution and diversity. The flooding arose from Ca-rich lake water, while elevated habitats were rainwater fed, which the consequent enhanced nutrient leaching and lowered pH and electrical conductivity. This produced negative correlations between plant community diversity and species richness versus pH, Ca2+ and electrical conductivity, since these influences were overridden by hydrological gradient.

AB An innovative method of inoculation of contaminated soils tested under laboratory conditions resulted in increased efficiency of PAH biodegradation in an aged industrial soil by almost 40% compared to biostimulation alone. The process encompassed inoculation of a small amount of contaminated soil with exogenous degraders. This first step was followed by a necessary propagation period of the introduced microbes. The material was further used as the inoculant for next step of the bioaugmentation procedure for a larger amount of contaminated soil in various ratios from 1:200 to 1:1000 and the process was repeated once more. The results showed that even the most diluted soil sample was very successful in terms of biodegradation of PAHs, resulting in 72.9% removal of PAHs including substantial biodegradation of heavy 4-5 ring PAHs. The employed next generation sequencing method provided evidence that one of the bioaugmentation strains, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, was the dominant bacterial species in the soil and the results documented its involvement in the successful bioremediation experiment. The novel bioaugmentation method seems to be a promising strategy avoiding complications connected with the large-scale production of inoculant in bioreactors.

AB Seedling establishment mostly occurs beneath the canopies of shrubs which act as nurse plants. Nurse effects of patch-canopy soil microhabitats on seedling establishment of herbs were investigated by studying shrub patches in which the nurse species Artemisia ordosica was removed or kept in a comparative way. The results showed that keeping shrubs greatly increased soil moisture and soil organic carbon content, but greatly decreased soil temperature and soil bulk density. The herbs richness and individual numbers in patches with the canopy kept were significantly higher than those with the canopy removed (p < 0.05). Small shrub patches increased soil moisture and decreased the surface soil temperature more significantly than large shrub patches. Herbs richness and individual numbers in small shrub patches were significantly higher than those in large shrub patches (p < 0.05). The results suggested that small shrub patches, which acted as nurse plants, decreased soil temperature and soil bulk density, increased soil moisture, species richness and individual numbers under the canopies. Nurse plants can provide a favourable surface habitats for herbs in semi-arid sandy lands.

AB Vegetation controls concentrated runoff and erosion in the European loess belt by increasing hydraulic roughness and sediment retention. Studies of plant effects on runoff velocity are usually based on a taxonomical characterisation and do not consider the effects of aboveground plant functional traits in attempts to understand soil erosion by water. This trait-based plant study investigates aboveground plant functional trait effects of herbaceous hedges on the hydraulic roughness to understand soil erosion. Eight aboveground morphological traits were measured on fourteen indigenous and perennial plant species (caespitose or comprising dry biomass in winter) from north-west Europe with a high morphological variability. For each trait, density-weighted traits were calculated. The effects of traits and density-weighted traits were examined using a runoff simulator with four discharges. The leaf density and area, as well as density-weighted stem and leaf areas, stem diameter and specific leaf area were positively correlated with the hydraulic roughness. Generalised linear models defined the best combinations of traits and density-weighted traits: (1) leaf density and leaf area, (2) density-weighted leaf area and density-weighted projected stem area, and (3) density-weighted leaf area and density-weighted stem diameter. Moreover, the effects of leaf density, leaf area and density-weighted specific leaf area, varied depending on the discharge. This study is one of the first characterisation of aboveground trait effects on hydraulic roughness and highlights that vegetation with large stem density, diameter and leaf area plays a significant role in minimising soil erosion. The selection of plant species can derive from these plant trait effects to design reconstructed herbaceous hedges to minimise soil erosion.

AB In constructed wetlands (CWs) with forced aeration and vertical flow, plants can suffer from iron (Fe) deficiency due to Fe immobilization in the gravel substrate as a consequence of the oxic condition. The common reed (Phragmites australis) is the most commonly used plant species in CWs and frequently displays Fe-deficiency symptoms particularly in new-established systems. The aim of this study was therefore to study the Fe-nutrition of P. australis in order to gain knowledge on how Fe-deficiency in P. australis can be alleviated. For this purpose, we grew two genetically distinct phylogeographic groups of P. australis hydroponically with seven different Fe concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 20.0 mg Fe-EDDHA ([iron (3+) ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid]) L-1) in a phytotron. Both groups responded strongly to the increasing Fe supply. The belowground biomass allocation ratio, light-saturated photosynthesis rates, chlorophyll content and leaf Fe tissue concentration all significantly increased with increasing Fe availability. Phragmites australis in the 0 mg FeEDDHA L-1 treatment suffered strongly from Fe deficiency, and plants in the high 20.0 mg Fe-EDDHA L-1 treatment also had reduced growth and Fe toxicity symptoms. The 'critical deficiency concentration' of Fe in leaves of juvenile P. australis was 40-50 mg kg(-1) DM, and the 'critical toxicity concentration' of Fe in leaves of juvenile P. australis were approximately 150 mg kg(-1) DM. Overall the two genetically distinct P. australis groups differed in their ecophysiological traits, and the two groups also responded differently to the different Fe-supply rates which may be the result of adaptations obtained in their native growth habitats. We suggest that the Fe-deficiency in CW systems with unsaturated vertical flow and/or forced aeration can be alleviated by application of a foliar spray containing chelated iron. However, the application rate and frequency should be further studied.

AB The Loess Plateau in China exhibited high magnitudes of soil erosion, where multiple soil conservation schemes have been implemented over the past decades. Understanding the efficacy and rationality of conservation practices on erosion mitigation is critical for contemporary strategy adjustment, which currently is hampered by the unavailability of historical observations on sediment yields at most ungauged catchments. Check dams were built with the primary purpose of sediment retention, while the infilling archives register historical sedimentary dynamics. A 485-cm long sediment core was extracted from a check dam in a restored agricultural catchment in the hilly Loess Plateau. Sedimentary stratigraphy was defined at 5-cm resolutions by continuous equivalent sectioning, and differentiated according to absolute grain-size composition and Cesium-137 (Cs-137) profile. Discernable stratigraphic laminations, featured by a fine-grained layer overlying on a coarse-grained layer, were observed, which were conducted by particle selectivity associated with soil detachment and sediment transport processes. Erosion and sediment dynamics across this semiarid landscape is strictly defined by extreme summer storms with large magnitude, low frequency and short duration. Sediment chronology was determined by ascribing the identified laminations to historical storm events. We found that the core profile showed evidence of at least 11 depositional events, which finally were connected with 11 major storms over the time period 1981-1983. We concluded that integrating stratigraphy differentiation of equivalent core segments along depositional profiles with storm records is diagnostic for inferring historical sedimentary dynamics.

AB Among different decentralized wastewater treatment systems, constructed wetlands are particularly robust, reliable and cost-effective technologies. However, traditional treatment wetland designs have a limited capacity to remove total nitrogen. The recirculating vertical-flow constructed wetland (RVFCW) system is a novel modification of the vertical flow wetland (VFW), allowing for increased denitrification by circulating the nitrified effluent back into a recirculation tank, where it is mixed with primary treated wastewater. Microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the effects on nitrogen removal of mixing recirculated VFW effluent with raw wastewater after different degrees of primary treatment, with and without attached growth media. The results show that the inclusion of attached growth media in the first chamber of the recirculation tank resulted in enhanced total nitrogen removal. The microcosms that contained a mixture of raw wastewater and VFW effluent showed denitrification efficiency of 83% after 48 h of contact time. An increase in the denitrification efficiency (up to 99.5%) was observed in microcosms that also contained attached growth media. The majority of nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal was achieved in the first 24 h. Inclusion of media increased the denitrification efficiency after 48 h contact time from 36 to 93% and from 31 to 88% in microcosms containing VFW effluent mixed at a ratio of 3: 1 with wastewater after 1 and 2 days residence time in a septic tank respectively. It was inferred that the lower the degree of pre-treatment of wastewater into which the recirculated VFW effluent was mixed, the greater is the denitrification rate and thereby the lower TN concentration in the effluent.

AB Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the status of post-abortion care (PAC) provision in Eastern and Southern Africa with particular reference to reach, quality and costs of these services.
   Study design: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, Science Direct, POPLINE and Web of Science for articles published between 2000 and October 2017 presenting primary or secondary data from one or more countries in the region.
   Results: Seventy articles representing data from fourteen countries were abstracted and included in the review. Implementation of PAC services was found to be patchy across countries for which data was available. However, there is evidence of efforts to introduce PAC at lower level health facilities, to use mid-level providers and to employ less invasive medical techniques. Eleven countries from the region were not represented in this review, exposing a considerable knowledge gap over the state of PAC in the region. The disparate access for rural women and girls, the suboptimal service quality and the neglect of adolescent-specific needs were critical gaps in the current PAC provision.
   Conclusion: PAC provision and research in this domain cannot be detached from the broader legal and societal context, as social stigma constitutes a major blockage to the advancement of the service.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess if structured integration of a comprehensive family planning (FP) training into a medical school curriculum improves FP knowledge and skill scores of medical interns.
   Study design: We compared mean contraception knowledge scores of interns in a medical school with the integrated FP curriculum [intervention school] (n=56) to interns at four conventional medical curriculum schools without structured reinforcement of FP content [control schools] (n=161) in Ethiopia. A survey with 19 multiple choice contraception questions was administered. We also compared the mean contraception skills scores of the two groups at four Objective Structured Clinical Examination stations. The survey included self reported number of contraception procedures and self-assessed competencies on a Likert scale.
   Results: A total of 217 interns who have completed an Obstetrics and Gynecology rotation participated in the study. Interns from the intervention school reported performing substantially higher numbers of contraception procedures and rated themselves as being competent/highly competent across all procedures compared to the control schools (p<.001 for both). The mean knowledge score was significantly higher in the intervention school [13.1 vs. 8.7, difference 4.5, 95% CI: (3.7-5.2), p<.001]. The mean contraceptive implant insertion skill score was twofold higher for interns in the intervention school [22 points vs. 11, difference 10.7, 95% CI: (8.6-12.8), p<.001 out of a maximum possible point of 30]. Statistically significant differences in skill scores were also observed for intrauterine device IUD insertion [15 vs. 12, p<.01] and implant removal [11 vs. 9, p=.01].
   Conclusion: A structured integration of family planning curriculum was associated with higher scores in knowledge, clinical skills and self-assessed competencies.
   Implications: Integrating comprehensive family planning training in medical curriculum can lead to graduating physicians who are more competent to offer the full range of FP options. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess whether second-trimester surgical abortion practices of U.S. providers agree with evidence based policy guidelines.
   Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of abortion facilities in the U.S. identified via publicly available resources and professional networks from June through December 2013.
   Results: Of 703 identified facilities, 383 (54%) participated, including 172 clinicians providing second-trimester surgical abortions (dilation and evacuations [D&Es]). The majority of clinicians were obstetrician-gynecologists (87%), female (67%), and less than 50 years old (62%). Most clinicians (93%) ever use misoprostol as a cervical preparation agent, including in the setting of a uterine scar (87%). Some clinicians refer to a hospital-based provider if the patient has a placenta previa and a history of cesarean section (31%) or a complete previa alone (17%). Many clinicians have weight or body mass index restrictions for cases performed under iv moderate sedation (32/97, 33%) or deep sedation (23/50, 46%). Most clinicians (69%) who report performing D&Es at 18 weeks last menstrual period or greater do not routinely induce fetal demise preoperatively. Clinicians employ routine intraoperative ultrasound (79%) more commonly than routine postoperative ultrasound (47%), with no difference by years of provider experience. Most clinicians routinely use prophylactic uterotonic agents, most often postoperatively. Most clinicians (80%) routinely give perioperative antibiotics, most often doxycycline (75%).
   Conclusion: Overall, the second-trimester surgical abortion practices revealed in our survey agree with professional evidence-based policy guidelines. Wider variability was reported for practices lacking a strong evidence base.
   Implications: In this third cross-sectional survey of U.S. abortion practices (prior 1997 and 2002), second-trimester surgical abortion providers are younger than before, reflecting an improvement in the "graying" of the abortion provider workforce. Facility restrictions on gestational age along with hospital restrictions on referrals pose barriers to outpatient abortion access. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID 2ND-TRIMESTER ABORTION; FETAL DEMISE; DIGOXIN; COMPLICATIONS; OBESITY;
   SAFETY; RISK
AB Objective: To compare procedure duration, complications, and acceptability of dilation and evacuation (D&E) with and without feticide by intra-cardiac potassium chloride (KCL) injection.
   Study design: We evaluated outcomes with D&E at 18-24 weeks of gestation in the 6 months before and 6 months after removing feticide with KCL from the guidelines of a national British abortion provider. We extracted demographic and procedure-related data from medical records and electronic databases. We surveyed women undergoing D&E in both time periods about acceptability and side effects.
   Results: We analyzed 291 cases with and 257 cases without KCL. Unadjusted mean procedure duration was shorter with KCL than without (12.7 vs. 16.1 min, respectively, p<.001). After adjustment for age, parity, Cesarean deliveries, gestational age, body mass index, surgeon, and number or duration of osmotic dilators used, KCL remained associated with a 3.5 min (95% CI 2.4-4.6) reduction in D&E duration. Uterine atony was more common with KCL than without (3% vs. 0%, respectively, p=.004), despite more frequent administration of prophylactic utero-tonics to women who received KCL (82% KCL vs. 73% no-KCL, p=.001). Women who had KCL reported more pain in the period between feticide and dilator placement and the evacuation than women who had not received feticide (49% vs. 25%, respectively, p<.001). Most women in both groups found their procedure very acceptable or acceptable (79% KCL vs. 87% no-KCL, p=.2).
   Conclusions: Feticide with intra-cardiac KCL reduced D&E procedure duration, but was associated with more pain and uterine atony. Treatment acceptability was high with and without feticide.
   Implications.
   Inducing fetal demise before dilation and evacuation with intra-cardiac potassium chloride may result in shorter operative times but does not appear to improve safety or acceptability. Level I evidence remains needed to support the use of feticide before surgical abortion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To explore the acceptability of advance provision of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) to young men seeking health care.
   Methods: For this exploratory study in a clinic setting, we approached young men aged 16-35 to participate in a survey eliciting socio-demographics, sexual and contraceptive history, and knowledge about ECPs. We offered young men advance provision of ECPs and compared characteristics of 126 young men who did and did not accept the ECPs.
   Results: Most (76%) of the participants accepted advance provision and left with an ECP pack, with even higher proportions among males whose sexual histories were suggestive of increased risk of involvement in an unintended pregnancy.
   Conclusions: This study holds promise to inform scale up of advance provision of ECPs among young men. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI Emergency contraception in Albania: a multimethods qualitative study of
   awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Eastern Europe; Emergency contraception; Provider training; Qualitative
   research; Reproductive health
AB Objectives: Contraceptive prevalence is relatively low in Albania, and abortion is the mainstay of family planning. Although levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills are available, uptake of this method is minimal. Emergency contraception (EC) could play a significant role in addressing women's need for an effective and discreet pregnancy prevention method. However, information about the dynamics surrounding EC is limited.
   Study design: In 2016-2017, we conducted a multimethods qualitative study that aimed to explore awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices toward EC in Albania. This project comprised four components: a community-based survey with 115 respondents, six focus group discussions with women of reproductive age, 19 semistructured key informant interviews, and 16 structured interviews with retail pharmacists. We analyzed our data using descriptive statistics and for content and themes.
   Results: Our findings suggest that EC is widely available in pharmacies in Albania. However, a quarter of our survey participants did not know whether EC was available, and more than a third did not think EC was safe to use. Women face numerous barriers to accessing this form of contraception. Misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives, in general, and about progestin-only EC in particular, lack of training among providers, and stigma and fear of judgment were common obstacles identified by participants.
   Conclusions: Misinformation and lack of knowledge about EC among women and providers in Albania appears common. Training health service providers, raising awareness among women, and developing linguistically and culturally resonant materials for distribution could be keys to improving access to and use of EC.
   Implications: Although the availability of progestin-only EC is widespread in Albania, our findings suggest that more work needs to be done to align national regulatory policies with international standards, facilitate evidence-based service delivery, and increase access to medically accurate information in Albanian.

AB Background: Unprotected intercourse is common, especially among teens and young women. Access to intrauterine device (IUD) as emergency contraception (EC) can help interested patients more effectively prevent unintended pregnancy and can also offer ongoing contraception. This study evaluated young women's awareness of IUD as EC and interest in case of need.
   Study design: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from young women aged 18-25 years, not desiring pregnancy within 12 months, and receiving contraceptive counseling within a cluster-randomized trial in 40 US Planned Parenthood health centers in 2011-2013 (n=1500). Heath centers were randomized to receive enhanced training on contraceptive counseling and IUD placement, or to provide standard care. The intervention did not focus specifically on IUD as EC. We assessed awareness of IUD as EC, desire to learn more about EC and most trusted source of information of EC among women in both intervention and control groups completing baseline and 3- or 6-month follow-up questionnaires (n=1138).
   Results: At follow-up, very few young women overall (7.5%) visiting health centers had heard of IUD as EC. However, if they needed EC, most (68%) reported that they would want to learn about IUDs in addition to EC pills, especially those who would be very unhappy to become pregnant (adjusted odds ratio EaOR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6, p<.05). Most (91%) reported a doctor or nurse as their most trusted source of EC information, over Internet (6%) or friends (2%), highlighting providers' essential role.
   Conclusion: Most young women at risk of unintended pregnancy are not aware of IUD as EC and look to their providers for trusted information. Contraceptive education should explicitly address IUD as EC.
   Implications: Few young women know that the IUD can be used for EC or about its effectiveness. However, if they needed EC, most reported that they would want to learn about IUDs in addition to EC pills, especially those very unhappy to become pregnant. Contraceptive education should explicitly address IUD as EC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the 12-month discontinuation rates of levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg (LNG-IUS 13.5) and subdermal etonogestrel (ENG) implant in the US.
   Study Design: We identified women aged 18-44 who had an insertion of LNG-IUS 13.5 or ENG implant from the MarketScan Commercial claims database (7/1/2013-9/30/2014). Women were required to have 12 months of continuous insurance coverage prior to the insertion (baseline) and at least 12-months after (follow-up). Discontinuation was defined as presence of an insurance claim for pregnancy-related services, hysterectomy, female sterilization, a claim for another contraceptive method, or removal of the index contraceptive without reinsertion within 30 days. Using Cox regression we examined the potential impact of ENG implant vs. LNG-IUS 13.5 on the likelihood for discontinuation after controlling for patient characteristics.
   Results: A total of 3680 (mean age: 25.4 years) LNG-IUS 13.5 and 23,770 (mean age: 24.6 years) ENG implant users met the selection criteria. Prior to insertion, 56.6% of LNG-IUS 13.5 and 42.1% of ENG implant users had used contraceptives, with oral contraceptives being most common (LNG-IUS 13.5: 42.1%; ENG implant: 28.5%). Among users of LNG-IUS 13.5 and ENG implant, rates of discontinuation were similar during the 12-month follow-up (LNG-IUS 13.5: 24.9%; ENG implant: 24.0%). Regression results showed that women using LNG-IUS 13.5 vs. ENG implant had similar likelihood for discontinuation (hazard ratio: 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.90-1.05, p=.41).
   Conclusion: In the real-world US setting, women aged 18-44 using LNG-IUS 13.5 and ENG implant have similar discontinuation rates after 12 months.
   Implications: In the United States, women aged 18-44 using levonorgestrel intrauterine system (13.5 mg) and subdermal etonogestrel implant have similar discontinuation rates after 12 months. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Our objective was to compare continuation and complication rates of subdermal etonogestrel implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) using Medicaid insurance claims.
   Study design: We performed a retrospective cohort study using insurance claims data for 15- to 4-4-year-old subjects receiving implants or IUDs from 2012 to 2015 in a Medicaid managed care organization in Washington, DC, and Maryland. We performed a planned Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) continuation, defined as the absence of a claim for LARC removal, during periods of continuous insurance plan enrollment.
   Results: Three thousand one hundred three subjects received 1335 implants and 1970 IUDs, with implants more common than IUDs among subjects 15-19 years old (rate ratio=2.42), and implants less common than IUDs for subjects 20-44 years old (rate ratio=0.54). Implants had higher continuation rates at 1 year than IUDs (81.0% vs. 76.7%, p=.01). The difference was larger among subjects 25 to 44 years old (84.1% vs. 793%, p=.03) compared with subjects 15 to 19 years old (895% vs. 86.8%, p=.09) and subjects 20 to 24 years old (75.7% vs. 73.2%, p=.44). Claims for potential complications were similarly uncommon for both implants and IUDs (8.09% vs. 6.95%, p=.65), as were claims for pregnancies prior to LARC removal (0.82% vs. 0.86%, p=.86).
   Conclusion: Among a sample of 15- to 44-year-old Medicaid recipients, both implants and IUDs had high continuation rates and low complication rates; however, implants were slightly more likely than IUDs to remain in use 1 year after insertion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Understanding the effect of contraceptives on the development of precancerous lesions of the cervix and cervical cancer may provide information that is valuable to women in contraceptive decision-making. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between recent intrauterine device (IUD) use (by type) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 3, adenocarcinoma in situ or cancer (CIN2+ or CIN3+).
   Study Design: Case-control study of 17,559 women age 18-49 with incident CIN2+ cases and 5:1 age-matched, incidence-density selected controls (N=87,378) who were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California Healthcare System from 1996 to 2014. Recent IUD use, within 18 months prior to index, was the exposure of interest.
   Results: We identified 1,657 IUD users among the cases and 7,925 IUD users among controls. After adjusting for sexually transmitted infection testing, smoking, HPV vaccination, hormonal contraceptive use, parity, race and number of outpatient healthcare system visits, IUD use was associated with an increased rate of CIN2+ [rate ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (1.05-1.18), p<0.001] but not CIN3+ [RR 1.02 (0.93-1.11), p=0.71]. Levonorgestrel-IUD use was associated with an increased rate of CIN2+ [RR 1.18 (1.08-130), p<0.001] but not CIN3 + [RR 1.05 (0.91-1.21), p=0.48]. Copper-IUD use was not associated with CIN2 + [RR 0.88 (0.75-1.04), p=0.13] or CIN3+ [RR 0.81 (0.64-1.02), p=0.07].
   Conclusion: Recent IUD use had variable weak associations with CIN2 + but was not associated with increased risk of CIN3+. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The intent of this study (primary outcome measure) is to assess the expulsion rate of a newly developed copper releasing frameless intrauterine IUD GyneFix Cesarean Section (Gyn-CS) at 3 months' followup, compared to the TCu-380A IUD, inserted immediately postplacental expulsion following cesarean section delivery.
   Study design: This is a randomized trial from one hospital research center in Istanbul, Turkey. Eligible pregnant women, the majority undergoing elective cesarean delivery (n=106), and the remaining emergency cesarean section cases (n=34), received intracesarean insertion of Gyn-CS or TCu380A insertion. Follow-up ended with a 3 month-visit. The Zeynep Kamil University Hospital Ethics Committee approved this study.
   Results: The study explores the retention of 140 insertions, 70 Gyn-CS and 70 TCu380A. There were two follow-up visits after discharge from hospital at 6 weeks and 3 months. A single Gyn-CS expulsion occurred after approximately 6 weeks likely a consequence of improper anchoring. Expulsion was more common in the TCu380 A IUD group (11.4% vs 1.4%, p=.039). There were 4 removals for medical reasons in the Gyn-CS patients and 4 in the TCu380A patients, respectively, with 4 non-medical removals occurred, 2 in each group. No serious adverse events (e.g., PID, perforation) were reported. At the study conclusion of 3 months, 61 Gyn-CS (88%) and 54 TCu380A (79%) IUDs remain in place.
   Conclusion: This immediate postplacental study in cesarean section patients suggests that the anchoring technique employed resulted in the excellent retention of Gyn-CS. Insertion was easy, safe and quick requiring minimal physician training. The possibility of direct visualization of the anchor by ultrasound at insertion and follow-up allows the surgeon to verify the position of the IUD serving to enhance provider and patient confidence and assurance.
   Implications: The frameless anchored intrauterine IUD is effective in minimizing displacement and expulsion. The results of this study suggest that the Gyn-CS IUD is appropriate for wider intracesarean use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPERMATOGENESIS; RATS
AB Objective: Vitamin A deficient females have reduced fertility due to decreased retinoic acid production. WIN 18,446 inhibits retinoic acid biosynthesis and functions as a contraceptive in males. We tested whether WIN 18,446 treatment would suppress fertility in female mice.
   Study Design: Female mice were treated with WIN 18,446 and mated. Pregnancy rates were compared using Fisher's exact test.
   Results: WIN 18,446 reduced pregnancy compared with control (p=.03). However, one animal became pregnant with malformed embryos.
   Conclusions: WIN 18,446 treatment significantly reduces fecundity, but teratogenicity in the setting of contraceptive failure limits the appeal of this approach to female contraception. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The literature lacks data on the use of the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) technique for the evaluation of insulin resistance (IR) in depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users. This study assessed carbohydrate metabolism in non-obese users of DMPA using the HEC technique.
   Study Design: A prospective, non-randomized, comparative study conducted at the Family Planning Clinic/Metabolic Unit, University of Campinas, Brazil. Forty-eight women aged 18-39 years underwent HEC: 30 initiating use of DMPA and 18 initiating use of a copper intrauterine device (IUD). Data from 15 women in each group, who completed the follow-up and underwent HEC at12 months, were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. All women were advised to perform aerobic physical exercise for 150 min/week; body composition and total energy intake were evaluated. Main outcome measures were IR defined by M-value <4 mg/kg/min, and blood levels of insulin. Additional outcomes were total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, LDLcholesterol, adipokines and free fatty acids.
   Results: At 12 months, two women in the DMPA group and none in the IUD group had developed IR. The groups were similar in in M-values and in blood levels of insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, adipokines or free fatty acids. Triglyceride levels increased in the DMPA group when compared to the IUD group, 80.0 (SD 47.8) versus 61.8 (SD 35.8) mg/dL respectively, (p=.033); and increased the total daily energy intake, 1828.3 (SD 518.9) versus 1300.8 (SD 403.4) kilocalories/24hs, respectively in the same groups, (p=.041). All the DMPA users showing higher insulin sensitivity at 12 months reported performing physical activity regularly.
   Conclusions: Changes occurred in carbohydrate metabolism in DMPA users in the first year of use of the method. It is possible that the regular aerobic exercise may exert a beneficial and protective effect against the factors that trigger these changes.
   Implications statement: Carbohydrate metabolism undergoes adverse changes in few young non-obese women during the first year of DMPA use and regular aerobic exercise may exert a beneficial and protective effect against these changes. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of two novel levonorgestrel (LNG) only contraceptive patches.
   Study Design: This multi-center Phase I/II trial randomized participants to use a 7-day transdermal patch designed to deliver a 40 mcg or 75 mcg daily LNG dose for 11 consecutive weeks; randomization was stratified by body mass index (BMI) <32 or 32-40 kg/m(2). Evaluations occurred twice weekly for 5 weeks, then once weekly with supplemental visits for participants reporting a urinary LH surge. We evaluated pharmacokinetics via the weekly trough serum LNG concentrations (>= 180 pg/mL considered therapeutic). The primary pharmacodynamic outcomes were cervical mucus and ovulation, evaluated using modified Insler cervical mucus scores and serum markers of ovulation.
   Results: Randomization yielded similar groups. Of 121 enrolled women, 117 contributed analyzable data. Overall, mean LNG concentrations achieved with use of the 75 mcg patch [value] were roughly double those seen with the 40 mcg dose. Concentrations achieved in higher-BMI women (BMI=32-40 kg/m(2)) were 50% lower compared to lower-BMI women for both patches. During the study, 94/117 (80%) participants had at least one LNG concentration <180 pg/mLInsler scores were at least once in 102/117 (87%) of participants, and ovulation occurred at least once in 81/117 (69%). Sixty participants (51%) had at least one ovulation following an Insler score >= 5; this occurred most frequently among higher-BMI participants using the lower-dose patch (19/25, 76%).
   Conclusions: Women using two investigational LNG patches did not achieve consistent concentrations of LNG >180 pg/mI, an efficacy benchmark established in other studies with LNG implants, and they experienced high rates of ovulation as well as cervical mucus scores not supportive of high contraceptive efficacy.

AB Objective: Most pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) in the US are affiliated with national organizations that have policies against promoting or providing contraceptives, yet many provide information about contraception on their websites. In 2016, the state of Georgia passed a new law to publicly fund PRCs. This study sought to describe the contraceptive information on Georgia PRC websites.
   Study design: We systematically identified all accessible Georgia PRC websites April-June 2016. We downloaded entire websites and used defined protocols to code and thematically analyze content about contraceptives.
   Results: Of the 64 websites reviewed, 20 (31%) presented information about contraceptives. Most of the content was dedicated to emergency contraception. Emphasis on risks and side effects was the most prominent theme. However, no site presented information about the frequency or prevalence of risks and side effects. Sites also emphasized contraceptive failure and minimized effectiveness. We found a high degree of inaccurate and misleading information about contraceptives.
   Conclusions: Georgia PRC websites presented skewed information that may undermine confidence in the safety and efficacy of contraceptive methods and discourage use. Public funding for PRCs, an increasing national trend, should be rigorously examined. Increased regulation is urgently needed to ensure that online information about contraceptives presented by publicly funded centers is unbiased, complete and accurate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Experimental observations of vibrational spectra of strong electrolyte solutions with increase in the molarity suggest a self-organization of water molecules depending on the concentration, and not on the ions' nature. Three different regimes can be observed. At very low concentrations, ions shielding does not change the water molecules intramolecular bonds. Whenever the concentration increases, a distortion of the vibrational peak is observed that increases linearly on a log-log scale, and can lead up to a maximum deformation limit. This might contribute to shed a light on the nature of the two-fluid structure of liquid water reported in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using first-principles calculations, the electronic properties of SiSe monolayer under in-plane strains are studied. It is found that the band gap of SiSe monolayer is increased linearly under the tensile strains along armchair direction. The tensile strain of 7% along zigzag direction makes a transition of band gap from indirect to direct. Under the biaxial compressive strains from 0% to -5%, we found that the band gap of SiSe monolayer is decreased continuously. Moreover, the SiSe monolayer exhibits metallic behavior under the -5% biaxial compressive strain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Density functional theory calculations were performed to explore catalytic activity of BCmNn -doped graphene sheets (Gr-BCmNn; m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3 and m + n = 3) towards the reduction of N2O reductionby CO molecule. Our results indicate that an enhancement in catalytic activity of BN co-doped graphene can be achieved by increasing the number of N atoms coordinated to the B atom. The calculated activation energies reveal that Gr-BCN2 and Gr-BN3 graphene sheets exhibit higher catalytic activity for N2O reduction reduction than Gr-BC3 and Gr-BC2N. These results highlight the possibility to improve the catalytic performance of the graphene by BN co-doping. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Element co-doping is an effective fashion to improve the properties of carbon-based film and amplify its application area. Here, (Cu, Ce)-DLC and (Cu, Ce)/Ti-DLC films were successfully prepared via magnetron sputtering. Evolutions of surface/interface morphology, microstructure and wettability of as-prepared films were investigated systematically to in-depth analysis the relationship between their microstructure and anti-corrosion capability. (Cu, Ce)/Ti-DLC film possessed a thicker thickness compared to (Cu, Ce)DLC film. Raman spectra of as-prepared films exposed quintessential features of carbon peak. Scanning vibrating electrode technique revealed the local electrochemical corrosion process of films. Particularly, (Cu, Ce)/Ti-DLC film could demonstrate superior anti-corrosion ability.

AB The interactions between atoms and small metal clusters are of great significance in the exploration of novel bonding mechanism. We present the strong chemisorption abilities of ultrasmall iron clusters interacting with large numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms from first-principles calculations. Geometric structures show that, the maximum numbers of the sequential hydrogen (oxygen) chemisorption on Fe-1 to Fe-4 clusters can be 11 to 28 (only 5 to 11). Using ab initio molecular dynamics, different kinds of hydrogen diffusion behaviors are found in the Fe-H systems, and two main types of Fe-O bonds are addressed in the stable Fe-O systems.

The Pd atoms can be viewed as an integral cluster unit interacting with C-2 frameworks and have very weak interactions with each other.

AB We report the H-I bond activation on free and confined silver tetramer clusters using the first principles approach. The objective of this study is to underscore the effect of confinement on the chemical reactivity of Ag-4. All calculations were carried out under the density functional theory formalism using both atomic and plane wave basis sets. We have used armchair carbon nanotube as a model system for confinement. The results show that the interaction energy is increased inside nanotube, leading to enhanced bond stretching. The origin of such effect has been demonstrated using molecular orbital theory and electronic density of state analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the artificial chromatophore was constructed by reconstitution of light harvesting complex 2 (LH2) and core complex (LH1 RC) from Thermochromatium tepidum in egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome. By calcium ion dependent absorption changes, the orientations of protein complexes in liposomes solely were assigned. Ultrafast EET dynamics were studied by fs time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on both the artificial and natural chromatophores at their RC 'open' and 'close' states, respectively. The results indicated that these two membrane systems have similar EET dynamic profiles, and the orientations of LH2 and LH1-RC complexes in artificial chromatophores were opposite to those in natural chromatophores.

AB Relative stability between manganese hydroxide (H2O)(2)(OH)(4)Mn(IV)-OH (1) and manganese oxo (H2O)(3)(OH)(3)Mn(IV)=O (2) species were investigated by coupled cluster (CC) SD and SD(T), DMRG CASCI, CASSCF, CASPT2 and CASDFT methods. The DMRG CASCI and DMRG CASSCF based on thirteen active orbitals and thirteen active electrons {13, 13} CAS space indicted the greater stability of 2 than 1. On the other hand, the relative stability between 1 and 2 was reversed by UCC SD, DLPNO-UCC SD, CASPT2 and CAS-DFT, indicating an important role of dynamical electron correlation corrections. Implications of present results are discussed to elucidate scope and applicability of hybrid DFT (HDFT) methods for 1 and 2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the unicellular protozoan parasite of genus Leishmania. Tryparedoxin (TXN) is a low molecular mass dithiol protein belonging to oxidoreductases super-family; which function in concert with tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx) as a system in protozoan parasites including Leishmania. Leishmanial hydroperoxides detoxification cascade uses trypanothione as electron donor to reduce hydroperoxide inside the macrophages during infection. However, the mechanism by which tryparedoxin can contribute in progression of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its impact on host's cellular immune response during infection in Indian VL patient is unknown. In this study, we purified a similar to 17 kDa recombinant cytosolic tryparedoxin (cTXN) protein of Leishmania donovani (rLdcTXN) and investigated its immunological responses in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) isolated from VL patients. The protein significantly enhanced the promastigotes count after 96 h of culture showing a direct correlation with parasite growth. Furthermore, stimulation of PBMC isolated from VL patients with rLdcTXN resulted in up-regulation of IL-4 and IL-10 production whereas IL-12 and IFN-gamma was significantly down-regulated suggesting a pivotal role of cTXN in provoking the immune suppression during VL. Our study demonstrates the importance of cTXN protein which can potentially modulate the outcome of disease through suppressing host protective Th1 response in VL patients.

AB Relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is associated with a failure of the host immune system to control the invading Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Severe immunodeficiency or immune disorders may be the main reason for TB recurrence. This study aimed to quantify serum inflammatory cytokine and soluble adhesion molecule levels in Re-treated smear-positive PTB patients before and after re-anti-TB drug therapy. Serum samples were collected from 30 healthy controls and 215 Treated active PTB patients at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 months post-re treatment. Levels of 18 serum cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules were measured by a high-throughput Cytometric Bead Array. At baseline, IL-1, IL-2, IL-12P70, and soluble CD62E levels were significantly higher in PTB patients than those in the healthy controls (p < 0.05); IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-21, soluble CD54, MIG, and TGF-beta levels in PTB patients were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (p < 0.05), of which TGF-beta, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, soluble CD54, and MIG were most notably (p < 0.0005). After re treatment, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-7, and soluble CD54 levels and IL-2/IL-10 and IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratios showed an upward trend during the re-treatment period. They were more sensitive than other cytokines and adhesion molecules and could be effective as serum indicators for re-treatment response. The immune response was imbalance in treated smear-positive PTB patients: Th1 response was elevated, but Th2 and Th17 responses were reduced. Systematic and comprehensive understanding of the cytokine and soluble adhesion molecule profiles provides a theoretical basis for immuno-diagnosis, immunotherapy, and immuno-monitoring of Re-treated PTB patients.

AB Skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ that secretes several proteins, which are collectively termed myokines. Although many studies suggest that exercise regulates myokine secretion, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and all the exercise-dependent myokines have not yet been identified. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to identify novel exercise-dependent myokines by using our recently developed in vitro contractile model. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were cultured with or without electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) for 24 h to induce cell contraction, and the myokines secreted in conditioned medium were analyzed using a cytokine array. Although most myokine secretions were not affected by EPS, the secretion of Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)) was significantly reduced by EPS. This was further confirmed by ELISA and quantitative PCR. Contraction-dependent calcium transients and activation of 5'-AMP activating protein kinase (AMPK) appears to be involved in this decrease, as the chelating Ca2+ by EGTA blocked contraction-dependent CCL5 reduction, whereas the pharmacological activation of AMPK significantly reduced it. However, Ccl5 gene expression was increased by AMPK activation, suggesting that AMPK-dependent CCL5 decrease occurred via post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, mouse experiments revealed that voluntary wheel-running exercise reduced serum CCL5 levels and Ccl5 gene expression in the fast-twitch muscles. Overall, our study provides the first evidence of an exercise-reducible myokine, CCL5, in the mouse skeletal muscle. Although further studies are required to understand the precise roles of the skeletal muscle cell contraction-induced decrease in CCL5, this decrease may explain some exercise-dependent physiological changes such as those in immune responses.

AB The stimuli inducing expression of single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR) and the relevant regulatory mechanisms are not well defined. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) delays intemalization of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) and subsequently enhances cellular signaling. This study investigated the effect of TGF beta 1 on SIGIRR protein production by human M1 macrophages in response to stimulation with substance P (SP).
   SP caused upregulation of SIGIRR expression in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas aprepitant (an NK1R inhibitor) blunted this response. Silencing p38 gamma MAPK or TAK-1 partially attenuated the response to SP stimulation, while TGF beta 1/2/3 siRNA dramatically diminished it. SP induced much greater SIGIRR protein production than either lipopolysaccharide (a TLR4 agonist) or resiquimod (a TLR7/8 agonist). Unexpectedly, silencing of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) led to significant upregulation of SIGIRR expression after SP stimulation, while KLF2 siRNA only partially enhanced it and Fli-1 siRNA reduced it. SP also upregulated TGF beta 1 expression, along with a corresponding increase of SIGIRR protein, whereas silencing TGF beta 1/2/3 blunted these responses. Spl siRNA or mithramycin (a gene-selective Spl inhibitor) significantly enhanced the expression of TGF beta 1 and SIGIRR by macrophages after SP stimulation. Importantly, this effect of Spl siRNA on TGF beta 1 and SIGIRR was blunted by siRNA for Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4, but not by TAK-1 siRNA. Next, we investigated the influence of transcription factor cross-talk on SIGIRR expression in response to SP. Co-transfection of macrophages with Spl siRNA and C/EBP beta or TIF1 beta siRNA attenuated the upregulation of SIGIRR by SP, while a combination of Spl siRNA and Fli-1 siRNA dramatically diminished it.
   In conclusion, TGF beta 1 may be an intermediary between SP/NK1R activation and SIGIRR expression in Spl siRNA-transfected macrophages. In addition, Sp1 modulates TGF beta 1/Smad signaling and negatively regulates SIGIRR protein production by macrophages after SP stimulation.

AB Vicenin-2, a C-glycoside flavone that is present in many plant sources, exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects in a number of cell and animal models of inflammation. Ten-eleven translocation (TET)-2 has recently gained considerable attention due to the role it plays in regulating the inflammasome. We studied the ability of Vicenin-2 (V-2) to regulate a range of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated inflammatory activities in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and human primary mononuclear cells. We also investigated the action of V-2 on the secretion of NLRP3 inflammasome regulated cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-18) by ELISA, and determined if V-2 can regulate the expression of NLRP3, IL-10, IL-1Ra and TET-2. The effect of V-2 on NF-kappa B signalling was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and gene reporter assay. Additionally, the effect of V-2 on LPS-induced phosphorylation of IKB-alpha was also investigated by Western blot analysis.
   V-2 down-regulated LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta), in both THP-1 and primary mononuclear cells. V-2 also decreased the LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-18 in THP-1 cells. V-2 significantly down-regulated TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa B reporter activity in HEK293T transfected cells and attenuated IKB-alpha phosphorylation in THP-1 cells. V-2 treatment also induced enhanced nuclear staining of the p50 subunit and reduced p65 subunit of NE-kappa B.
   V-2 treatment alone increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and the regulator of the inflammasome; IL-1Ra, in the presence of LPS. V-2 also significantly decreased LPS-induced NLRP3 expression while concomitantly increasing TET-2 expression.
   This study demonstrates that the anti-inflammatory actions of V-2 are associated not only with increased IL-10 and IL-1Ra expression, but also with TET-2 up-regulation. Further work is required to establish if the effects of V-2 can be definitively linked to TET-2 activity and that these actions are mirrored in a range of relevant cell types.

AB IL-35, a novel IL-12 family member, is a potent inhibitory cytokine predominantly produced by regulatory T and B lymphocytes that exerts optimal suppression in immune response. However, it remains unclear whether IL-35 plays an inhibitory role on human dendritic cells. In the present study, we focused on the possible immunosuppressive effect of IL-35 on the differentiation, maturation and function of monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs). Addition of exogenous IL-35 was able to partially suppress MoDCs differentiation in vitro. Subsequently, LPS was used for the maturation of MoDCs and IL-35 was found to mainly restrain the maturation of MoDCs, characterized by the remarkable down-regulation of costimulatory molecules, CD83 and HLA-DR as well as a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha). Furthermore, IL-35-treated MoDCs exhibited strong inhibition in the proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Meanwhile, IL-35-treated MoDCs also suppressed the polarization of naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes towards Th1 phenotype and impaired CD8(+) T cells allogeneic responses. And the foregoing suppression of MoDCs maturation and function by IL-35 might be due to the aberrant activation of STAT1/STAT3 and inhibition of p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated for the first time that IL-35 played a critical role in modulating not only adaptive immune response, but also innate immune response. The inhibitory effect of IL-35 on MoDCs maturation and function may facilitate the development of promising therapeutic interventions in tumors and other diseases.

ID INFLAMMATION; PRETERM; CHILDREN
AB Objective: Oxidative stress is involved in several maternal conditions characterized both by an increase in free radicals synthesis and a parallel decrease in the antioxidant activity. Parturition induces considerable oxidative stress and many inflammatory mediators, among which HMGB1, are involved from the beginning of pregnancy to the birth of the infant. We evaluated serum cord blood HMGB1 levels in a population of neonates to investigate correlation with mode of delivery, as well as the influence of labour.
   Setting and patients: The study subjects were 325 neonates delivered at University Hospital "G. Martino" of Messina over an 18-month period. Following cord separation, venous blood sampling was performed on umbelical cords.
   Results: In the cord venous blood, we found HMGB1 values significantly more elevated in spontaneous vaginal group when compared to elective or emergency caesarean section group. Regarding labour, umbilical cord venous blood HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in the spontaneous and induced labour group, compared to non-labouring women.
   Conclusion: These results could highlight a possible role of HMGB1 during birth time related to mode of delivery and labour.

AB The relationship between the interleukin (IL)-11 levels and semen quality of infertile males remains unknown. In this study, 120 semen samples from 60 normozoospermic volunteers and 60 infertile males were examined. The semen pH of the normozoospermic group was not significantly different from that of the infertile group. The semen volume, semen density, forward movement percentage, activity, survival rate and normal morphology rate of the sperm of the infertile group were significantly lower than those of the normozoospermic group. The semen IL-11 levels of the infertile group were significantly lower than those of the normozoospermic group. In the infertile group, semen IL-11 levels were positively correlated with sperm motility, vitality, survival rate and normal sperm morphology rate and negatively correlated with IL-17 and IL-18 levels. Therefore, semen IL-11 levels could be used as an index of male infertility.

DT Article
DE Pregnancy; Obesity; BMI; Low-grade inflammation; IL-10; MCP-1
ID RISK
AB Maternal cytokine profiles during pregnancy are characterized by significant deviations, varying substantially between gestational time points and tissues. Obesity, in turn, is linked with low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue and increased concentrations of systemic inflammatory mediators. However, the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in obese pregnancy has remained elusive. In view of the demonstrations that the obesity is a global epidemic in the population at reproductive age with a strong intergenerational impact, we investigated the relation of gestational immune adaptations and obesity-induced inflammation. We found a significant decrease in systemic IL-1 beta and MCP-1 concentration from 1st to 3rd trimester of pregnancy while IL-10 concentration increased, respectively. However, in obese pregnancies this reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators was not detected. This may constitute an additional risk factor in obese pregnancies in which the concentration of MCP-1 is already upregulated compared to normal weight mothers.

AB In vitro electroporation gene transfer was first performed in 1982. Today, this technology has become one of the major vehicles for non-viral transfection of cells. All non-viral transfections, such as calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, and magnetic transfection, have been shown to achieve a transfection efficiency of up to 70% in commonly used cell lines, but not in primary cells. Here we describe the use of electroporation to transfect primary mouse bone marrow-derived cells, such as macrophages (M phi) and dendritic cells (DCs) with high efficiencies (45%-72%) and minimal cell death. The transfection efficiencies and cell death varied depending on the culture duration of the DCs and M phi. Moreover, the electroporation efficiency was increased when conditioning medium was used for culturing the cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that measuring the plasmid-encoded secreted proteins is a highly sensitive method for determining the transfection efficiency. In summary, electroporation with plasmid vectors is an efficient method for producing DCs and M phi with transient expression of immunoregulatory proteins.

AB Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in host defense against invading pathogens. By initiating a signal transduction cascade, TLRs lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the inappropriate activation of TLR signaling could result in inflammatory disorders or autoimmune diseases. Osteopontin (OPN) has been reported to be an inflammatory cytokine participating in cell-mediated immunity. However, the role of OPN in TLR-mediated immune responses is poorly understood. In the present study, OPN-deficient (OPN-/-) macrophages exhibited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our study also demonstrated that the intracellular OPN (iOPN) isoform acted as a negative regulator to inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Compared to WT macrophages, OPN-/- macrophages had lower Akt phosphorylation levels and higher GSK3 beta phosphorylation levels, which were downregulated by p-Akt. Moreover, as a down-stream target of Akt, 4EBP1 was hypo-phosphorylated in OPN-/- macrophages compared to 4EBP1 in WT macrophages. These findings reveal that iOPN can regulate GSK3 beta and 4EBP1 phosphorylation to inhibit TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses.

AB There are indications for elevated CXCL8 levels in abdominal aortic aneurysm disease (AAA).
   CXCL8 is concurrently involved in neutrophil-mediated inflammation and angiogenesis, two prominent and distinctive characteristics of AAA. As such we considered an evaluation of a role for CXCL8 in AAA progression relevant.
   ELISA's, real time PCR and array analysis were used to explore CXCL8 signaling in AAA wall samples. A role for CXCL8 in AAA disease was tested through the oral CXCR1/2 antagonist DF2156A in the elastase model of AAA disease.
   There is an extreme disparity in aortic wall CXCL8 content between AAA and aortic atherosclerotic disease (median [IQR] aortic wall CXCL8 content: 425 [141-1261] (AAA) vs. 23 [2.8-89] (atherosclerotic aorta) mu g/g protein (P < 1.10(-14))), and abundant expression of the CXCR1 and 2 receptors in AAA. Array analysis followed by pathway analysis showed that CXCL8 hyper-expression in AAA is followed increased by IL-8 signaling (Z-score for AAA vs. atherosclerotic control: 2.97, p < 0.0001).
   Interference with CXCL8 signaling through DF2156A fully abrogated AAA formation and prevented matrix degradation in the murine elastase model of AAA disease (p < 0.001).
   CXCL8-signaling is a prominent and distinctive feature of AAA, interference with the pathway constitutes a promising target for medical stabilization of AAA.

AB Dendritic cells produce IL-12 and IL-23 in response to viral and bacterial infection and these cytokines are responsible for successful pathogen clearance. How sequential viral and bacterial infections affect the production of IL-12 and IL-23 is currently not known. Our study demonstrates that in dendritic cells infected with Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), TLR activation with bacterial PAMPs resulted in reduced IL-12 and IL-23 expression compared to non-infected cells. Furthermore, expression of other proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-6, were not inhibited under these conditions. We discovered that TLR-induced phosphorylation of p38 was significantly inhibited in LCMV-infected cells. We detected enhanced expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-3 and IL-10. Yet, neutralizing IL-10 did not restore IL-12/IL-23 expression. Taken together, these results show that virus infection interferes with the magnitude of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses by repressing specific cytokine expression.

AB Deregulated immunity is one of the most important factors implicated in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The possible role of interleukin-33 (IL-33) and forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (Foxp3) in RPL have not been fully investigated. We aimed to evaluate IL-33 rs1929992 and Foxp3 rs2232365 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their serum levels in Egyptian RPL females.
   Blood samples were collected from 142 RPL patients and 123 women as healthy controls. IL-33 rs1929992 SNP was determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and Foxp3 rs2232365 SNP was determined using allele specific polymerase chain reaction. The serum IL-33 and Foxp3 levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
   Foxp3 rs2232365 SNP showed statistically significant association with RPL. The risk of RPL was significantly higher in women carrying Foxp3 G allele than those carrying A allele. Lower serum levels of Foxp3 and IL-33 were observed in RPL patients than controls (P < 0.001). Foxp3 serum levels were much lower in carriers of G allele than those carrying A allele in all studied groups.
   Foxp3 rs2232365 SNP could be considered as a risk factor for RPL. The lowered serum levels of IL-33 and Foxp3 in RPL patients suggested that they might have an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 polymorphisms may be important in RPL pathogenesis.

AB Introduction: A complex network of cytokines in the bone marrow microenvironment has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). Different cytokines have been studied in MM, both in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow, but there are few data correlating cytokines in leukapheresis product with post-transplant response depth to treatment.
   Materials and Methods: In a retrospective cross-sectional study, levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in peripheral hematopoietic stem cells/leukapheresis product (PHSC) of patients with MM eligible for transplantation were evaluated. Association of these cytokines with certain factors such as mobilized CD34 + cells/kg, staging, response to treatment and outcome were analyzed.
   Results: The median baseline IFN-gamma level was 826.4 pg/mL. IFN-gamma levels in the leukapheresis product were significantly lower in patients who achieved complete response (CR) three months post-transplant when compared to patients with very good partial response (VGPR) (674.75 +/- 80.32 pg/mL versus 939.6 +/- 106.8 pg/mL, p = 0.02), respectively. Patients who lost depth of response at the third-month post-transplant had a median level of IFN-gamma 1133, being considered "high-expressors" of IFN-gamma, while those reaching improved response were called "low-expressors" (median level IFN-gamma 485 pg/mL). Overall and progression free survival did not have a statistically significant correlation with TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1 or IFN-gamma, as well as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 levels in post-transplant response assessment.
   Conclusion: IFN-gamma in PHSC seems to be an important biomarker of loss of response in MM, suggesting a role in early post-transplant therapeutic management.

AB Antrodia camphorata mycelium is used in traditional Chinese medicine in Taiwan. The wild-type mycelium is rare and expensive, so a solid-state-cultured mycelium of A. camphorata (SCMAC) has been developed. Previous studies have found SCMAC to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the immunomodulatory effects of SCMAC and of its active phytosterol compounds EK100 and 9A on asthma remain unknown. In this study, BALB/c mice were repeatedly exposed to Dermatogoides pteronyssinus (Der p) at 1-week intervals and were orally administered crude SCMAC extract before the Der p challenge. The mice were sacrificed 72 h after the last challenge to examine the airway remodeling, inflammation, and expression profiles of cytokines and various genes. Then, 30-mu g/mL Der p-stimulated MH-S cells with 9A or EK100 were collected for real-time PCR analysis, and the effects of 9A and EK100 on macrophages were evaluated. The crude extract reduced Der p-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, total serum immunoglobulin E levels, and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid through cytokine downregulation and Th1/Th2/Th17 response modulation. Additionally, 9A and EK100 inhibited IL-1 beta and IL-6 expression in alveolar macrophages. These results indicate that the pharmacologically active compounds in a crude SCMAC extract exert synergistic effects on multiple targets to relieve asthma symptoms.

AB Objective: Laboratory models suggested that Fetuin-B impaired insulin action in myotubes and hepatocytes and caused glucose intolerance in mice. We aimed to explore the independent associations and pathways among serum Fetuin-B, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 1318 obese adults who underwent serum Fetuin-B test and hepatic ultrasonography scanning was conducted in Xiamen, China. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of serum Fetuin-B level and NAFLD for T2D in different models with adjustment for potential confounders. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the paths among NAFLD, serum Fetuin-B, metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome and T2D.
   Results: Subjects with T2D or NAFLD showed significantly increased serum Fetuin-B levels compared to their controls (4.25 +/- 1.35 vs. 4.08 +/- 1.38 mu g/ml for diabetes; and 4.26 +/- 1.41 vs. 4.07 +/- 1.33 mu g/ml for NAFLD; both p-values < 0.05). NAFLD and higher serum Fetuin-B were significantly associated with higher risk of T2D with adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle habits; and the adjusted ORs (95%CIs) were 2.90 (2.17-3.87, p < 0.001) and 1.16 (1.01-1.32, p = 0.032), respectively. With further adjustment for metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome (BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, HOMA-IR and serum uric acid), NAFLD but not serum Fetuin-B was significantly associated with increased risk of T2D (ORs (95%CIs): 1.58 (1.12-2.21, p = 0.009) and 1.07 (0.92-1.23, p = 0.384), respectively). A one pathway model by using SEM fitted well (chi(2) = 497.92, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.965; TLI = 0.926; and RMSEA = 0.097) and showed that NAFLD increased serum Fetuin-B and elevated Fetuin-B increased fasting insulin level, which in turn induced insulin resistance and T2D. Besides, NAFLD increased the risk of T2D directly in addition to its indirect effects of inducing metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome which in turn increased the risk of T2D.
   Conclusions: Fetuin-B links NAFLD to T2D via inducing insulin resistance, and NAFLD contributes to the pathogenesis of T2D via multiple mechanisms.

AB Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuro-Behcet's Disease (NBD) are two recurrent disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS) by causing inflammation and irreversible damage. Inaugural clinical symptoms for both diseases might be very similar and definitive diagnosis could be delayed. The present study aimed to find out possible differences at early stages in the transcription factors/cytokines expression profiles in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS and NBD patients which could be useful discriminative markers. Cytokines and transcription factors related to Th1, Th2, Th17 and T regulatory populations were studied by quantitative RTPCR simultaneously in PBMCs and CSF, from 40 patients presenting a first episode of clinical features related to CNS inflammation and 22 controls with non inflammatory neurological diseases enrolled mainly for severe headache. The follow up of 12 months did allow a definitive diagnosis of remitting relapsing MS (RRMS) in 21 patients and of NBD in the other 19 among those with CNS inflammation compared to controls. In initial blood samples, T-bet was significantly increased in NBD patients only while IFN-gamma was elevated in patients who evolved into RRMS or NBD. IL-17a, GATA-3 and IL-4 were significantly lower in RRMS patients than in the NBD group. In initial CSF samples, ROR-gamma t, IL-17a and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in patients compared to controls. The most striking finding was the significant increase of CSF IL-10 that we did observe in NBD patients only. Thus, we propose CSF IL-10 as a predictive marker to help clinicians discriminating between these two neurological disorders.

AB To investigate the clinical significance of serum soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) II level and sTNFR II/I ratio as indicators of the development of coronary artery lesions (CALs) in Kawasaki disease (KD), we measured levels of serum sTNFR I and II, interleukin IL-18, and neopterin in 63 patients with KD, including nine patients with CALs and 20 healthy controls. At the time of diagnosis of KD before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, serum sTNFR I and II levels were found to be significantly higher in non responders to IVIG treatment than in responders. On the contrary, serum sTNFR II levels and sTNFR II/I ratio were significantly higher in patients with KD having CALs than in those without CALs. Longitudinal observation in a patient with KD who is unresponsive to IVIG revealed sustained elevation of serum sTNFR II level, and elevated sTNFR II/I ratio was linked to the CALs development. Increase in serum sTNFR II level and elevated sTNFR II/I ratio may be promising indicators of the development of CALs in KD.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose etiology remains poorly understood. Since the genetic basis of disease is known in only a small subset of cases, there has been substantial interest in determining whether environmental factors act as triggers of ALS. Viruses have received longstanding attention as potential ALS triggers. Yet, existing studies have not provided a compelling case for causation. This review summarizes the evidence supporting a link between viral infection and motor neuron disease, with a focus on ALS. Limitations of prior studies are discussed and contextualized, and recent work that has provided stronger mechanistic evidence for viruses in disease pathogenesis is highlighted. Finally, we offer a new perspective on the association of viruses with ALS, and underscore the need for multidisciplinary approaches bridging neurology and infectious diseases research to move the field forward in the future.

ID T-CELLS; FREQUENCY
AB IL-21 is a much studied cytokine that has been implicated in the regulation of TH1, TH2, TH17 and regulatory immune responses; its signalling is a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases.
   Despite its biological importance, measuring IL-21 reliably has proved difficult. ELISAs are commonly used to measure cytokines in various biological samples. However, results obtained are only as good as the quality of the sample. Here, we show that when using fresh samples, a significant increase in IL-21 was measured in the intestinal homogenate of mice infected with the intestinal worm Heligmosomoides polygyrus. This difference disappeared when samples were frozen in either liquid nitrogen for two days or at -80 degrees C for three weeks, with levels in both naive and infected animals decreasing. This was not observed for the IL-13 cytokine, where freezing had no impact on levels measured.
   Our study highlights the importance of sample storage to measuring biomarkers. Since modulating IL-21 signalling is such an important potential therapeutic avenue, accurately measuring the levels of this cytokine is key to assessing its role in various research models and clinical settings.

AB The mechanisms leading to the disruption of self-tolerance in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain elusive. Herein, we aimed to decipher the molecular basis of the impaired response of mononuclear cells to TGF-beta 1. The Smad3-pathway was explored on CD3+ lymphocytes in either active or non active SLE patients. An impaired transcription of TGF-beta 1 target genes was demonstrated in the CD3+ lymphocytes of active SLE patients confirming that the defect involves T cells and pointing to its extrinsic nature. We further demonstrate that the defect did not result from an impaired TGF-beta RII expression or Smad2/3 phosphorylation suggesting that the mechanism lies downstream Smad2/3 translocation. Interestingly, the TGF-1 signaling defect did not correlate with an increased expression of soluble or membrane-bound IL-15. However, it was associated with an over expression of IL-22. This suggests that an excessive activation of AhR pathway (through UV radiations, infections, etc.) could lead to the inhibition of immunosuppressive actions of TGF-beta thus disrupting immune homeostasis in SLE. Collectively, our data suggest that the impaired response to TGF-beta in SLE patients is associated with disease activity and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SLE since it could establish the link between the environmental factors and the aberrancies of the immune system usually described in SLE.

AB Although IL-10 is known to be an important cytokine in the immune response to TB, very little is known about the role of IL-20 subfamily of cytokines in the host response to TB. To identify the role of CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells producing IL-20 subfamily of cytokines in human TB, we enumerated the frequencies of IL-10, IL-19 and IL-24 expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells following Mtb-specific antigen stimulation of cells from individuals with pulmonary TB (PTB) and latent TB (LTB). We first demonstrated that Mtb-specific antigen induce an expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing IL-10, IL-19 and IL-24 in PTB and LTB individuals, with frequencies being significantly higher in PTB. Next, we demonstrated that IL-10, IL-19 and IL-24 play an important role in the regulation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing Th1/Tc1 and Th17/Tc17 cytokines in PTB but not LTB individuals. Thus, active PTB is characterized by an IL-10, IL-19 and IL-24 mediated down modulation of Th1/Tc1 and/or Th17/Tc17 cytokines in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. This suggests that the IL-20 subfamily of cytokines, similar to IL-10 might play a potentially crucial role in the modulation of T cell responses in active TB disease.

AB To investigate whether the microRNA-144 (miR-144) had immune regulation effect on matured immune cells, we firstly used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to detect the expression changes of miR-144 between the matured and immature dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Then we went on inspecting the expression changes of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-23 in the matured DCs treated with miR-144 mimics or inhibitors using qRT-PCR, and also performed western blot to test phosphorylation state of ERK, JNK, p38 and p65 in these cells. Next, TargetScan was conducted to forecast the target gene of miR-144, receptor activator for nuclear factor-KB ligand (RANKL), and double luciferase reporter system was applied to research their banding sites. We also determined the expression changes of RANKL in the DCs treated with miR-144 mimics or inhibitors using qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The siRNA of RANKL was synthesized and transfected into DCs to inspect how the immune regulation effect of miR-144 was conducted to inhibit the expression of TNF-alpha using qRT-PCR, and lastly we used flow cytometry to investigate whether this effect applied to Th17 cells. As results, we found that miR-144 was down-regulated in the matured DCs, macrophages and PBMCs of liver transplantation patients, and the miR-144 mimics could inhibit the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-23 in the matured DCs. Furthermore, miR-144 interacted with RANKL at position 679-685 of RANKL 3'UTR, and suppressed the translation of RANKL mRNA to realize the negative-regulation. Besides, the silence of RANKL enhanced the suppression effect of miR-144 on TNF-alpha and this immune regulation effect was applied to Th17 cells, too. In conclusion, this study clearly illustrated that miR-144 could inhibit the expression of cytokine in matured immune cells through suppressing the translation of RANKL mRNA.

AB Toll like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in adipose tissue and promote adipose tissue inflammation during obesity. Recently, anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed to TLR10 in myeloid cells, the only member of the TLR family with inhibitory activity. In order to assess whether TLR10-induced inhibition of inflammation may be protective during the development of obesity and metabolic abnormalities we used transgenic human TLR10 mice (hTLR10tg) and wild type (WT) controls on a C57B6J background. HFD-feeding enhanced TLR10 expression in the adipose tissue, and HFD-fed hTLR10tg mice displayed reduced adipocyte size, adipose tissue weight, and a trend toward lower plasma insulin levels compared to WT mice.
   In humans, obese individuals with polymorphisms in the TLR10 gene displayed reduced macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue accompanied by a trend to lower leptin levels and higher adiponectin levels in plasma. In healthy individuals with the same polymorphisms in the TLR10 gene we did not observe any difference in plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin.
   We conclude that TLR10 impacts adipose tissue morphology in obesity. Larger studies in humans are warranted to assess its potential value as therapeutic target in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

AB The common gamma-chain cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays a significant role in regulating innate and adaptive lymphocyte homeostasis and can stimulate anti-tumor activity of leukocytes. We have previously shown that the circulating IL-15 in the plasma is the heterodimeric form (hetIL-15), produced upon co-expression of IL-15 and IL-15 Receptor alpha (IL-15R alpha) polypeptides in the same cell, heterodimerization of the two chains and secretion. We investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and toxicity of purified human hetIL-15 cytokine upon injection in rhesus macaques. We compared the effects of repeated hetIL-15 administration during a two-week dosing cycle, using different subcutaneous dosing schemata, i.e. fixed doses of 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/kg or a doubling step-dose scheme ranging from 2 to 64 mu g/kg. Following a fixed-dose regimen, dose-dependent peak plasma IL-15 levels decreased significantly between the first and last injection. The trough plasma IL-15 levels measured at 48 h after injections were significantly higher after the first dose, compared to subsequent doses. In contrast, following the step-dose regimen, the systemic exposure increased by more than 1 log between the first injection given at 2 mu g/kg and the last injection given at 64 mu g/kg, and the trough levels were comparable after each injection. Blood lymphocyte cell count, proliferation, and plasma IL-18 levels peaked at day 8 when hetIL-15 was provided at fixed doses, and at the end of the cycle following a step-dose regimen, suggesting that sustained expansion of target cells requires increasing doses of cytokine. Macaques treated with a 50 mu g/kg dose showed moderate and transient toxicity, including fever, signs of capillary leak syndrome and renal dysfunction. In contrast, these effects were mild or absent using the step-dose regimen. The results provide a new method of optimal administration of this homeostatic cytokine and may have applications for the delivery of other cytokines.

AB Cytokines and chemokines are intricately connected to cancer initiation, progression and metastasis as well as to innate and adaptive host defense mechanisms against transformed cells. The Aegean Conference on Cytokine Signaling in Cancer (ACCSC) aims to bring together researchers in this highly targeted area of cancer research in a lovely and relaxing Greek-Mediterranean backdrop to discuss latest developments. Being small in size with about one hundred participants, this conference fosters scientific and social interactions among established and emerging scientists in clinical and basic research in diverse fields of oncology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics and immunology. The 2nd ACCSC held at Heraklion on the Greek island of Crete was organized by Serge Fuchs (University of Pennsylvania), Mathias Muller (University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna), Leonidas Platanias (Northwestern University, Chicago) and Belinda Parker (La Trobe University, Melbourne) between May 30 and June 04, 2017, was a great success in every single aspect of a high level scientific meeting. Signaling within cancer cells as well as in stromal and immune cells is the common thread of this conference series. An outline of the research topics discussed at this conference is presented here to emphasize its high quality and to stimulate interest among cytokine researchers to participate in future ACCSC meetings.

AB Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a well-known monomeric T-cell growth factor that is produced primarily by activated CD4+ T cells following exposure to antigen. IL-2 structural analysis among primates showed a few polymorphisms as well as a 3-nucleotide deletion (c.305del3) in Hominoidea superfamily including Homo sapiens. On the other hand, the interaction of IL-2 with its alpha subunit of the receptor (IL-2R alpha) is the first step for assembly of the whole IL-2R and considered as a species-specific phase. Four models of human IL-2, IL-2R alpha, and their ancestral forms were made and were used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Subsequently, the final structures were docked to each other and finally, the complexes were used for MD simulation. Our results showed that the above mentioned deletion led to weaker interaction of human IL-2 to its receptor relative to ancestral IL-2. Association study of lymphocyte counts, as an indicator of IL-2 function, in 78 primate species with or without this deletion showed significant association of this deletion with their overall lymphocyte counts (P<.01). Therefore, it can be suggested that p.81delThr in IL-2 in Hominides superfamily interfered with interaction of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha and led to overall decrease in lymphocyte counts in this superfamily of primates in comparison with other primates.

AB Background: Vitamin D is a molecule that modulates the immune response and shows anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial for the control of chronic diseases such as asthma. The trial aim was to explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of allergic asthmatic patients.
   Methods: This study was conducted in 86 patients between 18 and 50 years of age who were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups received the treatment recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). One group also received calcitriol (1,25-(OH)(2)D-3), and the other group received a placebo. At baseline and 6 months, skin prick tests were conducted, pharyngeal bacterial cultures were performed, and cathelicidin LL-37 was measured in sputum. Serum levels of IgE, eosinophils, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN gamma were quantified at the beginning and the end of the study.
   Results: Serum levels of IL-10 and IFN gamma increased significantly in the group of patients with vitamin D supplementation, while IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 decreased significantly. At the end of the trial, IgE and eosinophil levels significantly decreased but allergen sensitivity did not show any changes from baseline. Respiratory infections were drastically reduced, and this decrease was related to the number of patients who had high serum levels of IL-10 and IFN gamma and expressed LL-37 in their sputum.
   Conclusion: Treatment of asthma patients with vitamin D reduced respiratory infections, and this effect was related to the increase of cathelicidin LL-37.

AB Water quality is strongly related to a river's ecosystem composition at landscape scale. Key water/sediment interfaces, referred to here as functional compartments (FCs), are the epilithic biofilm, the fine sediment at the bottom of the river and the macroporous medium or hyporheic zone, which is primarily located in the active channel where subsurface flow occurs. The function of each FC (consumption or production of organic matter and nitrate) at river reach scale was examined through modelling and calibrated within field measurements to quantify the regulation service for water quality improvement. These functions were tested on a river reach of a dominant interface function (DIF) river, the Garonne River in south-west France. It was found that: a) functions differed between the FCs as a result of biotic (organisms involved) and abiotic (hydrological and morphological) conditions, b) functions varied within each FC over time (measured, but not discussed) and c) FCs acted as transient storage zones and contributed to the development of the river's self-purification capacity. It was concluded that in relation to the concept of river continuum, the upper reaches in the catchment were dominated by epilithic biofilm, where the main function was the production of organic matter (OM) (mean of 0.3 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from 0.08 to -1.7), the middle course was dominated by the hyporheic zone, where the most important function was to serve as a nitrate sink (-1.25 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from -45.6 to -0.19), and the downstream parts of the river, whose main function was the degradation of OM within the fine sediment FC (mean of - 1000 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from - 960 to - 1440). Hence, the morphological heterogeneity of rivers that mimic the natural mosaic of functional compartments with exchanges of water, organic matter and nutrients between compartments could contribute to enhancing their self-purification function and thus to improving water quality and system health. This study is a first step in testing the influence of the different FCs on the water quality regulation service provided by a river reach. The final objective was to be able to upscale the modelling of the different interfaces involved in a watershed's water quality regulation service. The present study demonstrates the need to take the biophysical diversity of reaches into account in order to accurately model this regulation service. Thus the BIODIF concept of BIO-physical (biological and physical) Diversity for rivers Dominated by river-bed Interface Functions (DIF rivers) was investigated for its ability to identify the theoretical relationships between the structure and the function of regulation of a river.

AB There has been an increase in the abundance of small hydropower (< 10 MW) installations. These tend to be 'run-of-river', thereby reducing or averting the need for impoundment and water storage, and so are considered to have lower environmental impact. The Archimedes screw turbine (AST) has been described as 'fish friendly' based on magnitude of observed first order impacts, i.e. low rates of direct damage and mortality due to blade strike. However, potential second order effects, such as altered fish behaviour prior to or after passage, and consequences for long-term survival and fitness, have been largely ignored. This two-year study employed acoustic and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry and dual frequency imaging sonar to investigate the influence of an AST and associated fish passes (Larinier super-active baffle pass and upstream eel ladders) on the movement patterns and behaviour of five species of potadromous fish and European eel (Anguilla anguilla). Seaward-migrating adult (silver) eels successfully descended the AST, but under high flows most individuals took an alternative route via an overshot weir which resulted in faster passage rates. There was no immediate silver eel mortality as a result of passage through the turbine and no effect on subsequent migration behaviour through the lower freshwater catchment and estuary. Some eels were delayed at the complex and exhibited frequent rejection and milling on their approach to the AST and fish passes. Upstream passage rate (%) at the Larinier pass varied among species with highest for dace (81%) and the lowest for roach (10%). Fish that aggregated up- and downstream of the AST rapidly dispersed on turbine start-up. Although ASTs can be considered a potential downstream passage route for both eels and potadromous species, adult eels milled and rejected at the upstream entrance, while other fish exhibited startle response on turbine start-up. Potential delay to seaward migration of silver eel and the energetic costs of observed behaviours should be considered during future impact assessments, particularly where there is no alternative migration route or there are multiple such facilities in a watercourse.

AB Restoring degraded ecosystems is a global challenge. Wherever applicable, forest restoration is one of the most effective tools for reversing degradation processes and enhancing multiple ecosystem services. In Mediterranean semiarid conditions the main limiting factor for tree establishment is the low and irregular precipitation regime, which has a particularly harmful effect in areas where the soil has a poor water retention capacity. We tested, alone and combined, two types of cost-effective and locally applied plantation techniques that aim to promote early seedling establishment: i) various mulches including biodegradable and reusable prototypes and commercial models; ii) two soil conditioners with water-superabsorbing polymers in their formulation, one of which includes a new polyacrylamide-free polymer, which was tested at various doses. In a three-year study we examined their effects on Pinus halepensis performance (survival, shoot and root growth and tree water status) and on soil moisture on a north-facing and a south-facing slope in Mequinenza, NE Spain. The use of mulches led to slight increases in seedling growth and soil moisture compared to untreated seedlings, without great differences between the models tested. Therefore the new prototypes can be considered as suitable alternatives to commercially available ones. On the other hand, the new soil conditioner led to much clearer positive effects. Compared to untreated seedlings, the new soil conditioner improved seedling survival, root and shoot growth and water status, as well as soil moisture. The benefits of the new soil conditioner were highest when applied at doses of 40 or 80 g per seedling. We found that this new formulation achieved similar performance as the commercially available one. Combining mulches and soil conditioners resulted in additive outcomes, rather than in synergistic ones. We conclude that in conditions limited by low precipitation and coarse textured soils the use of small mulches does not seem a priority technique, in contrast with the application of soil conditioners, which seems an effective option for enhancing early seedling performance.

AB Burrowing mammals are often considered to be ecosystem engineers as burrowing disturbs the soil, thereby potentially changing resource availability and affecting habitat conditions for other species. After their excavation, burrows may strongly impact local plant communities through several mechanisms, including resource trapping, altered chemical and physical soil properties, and amelioration of microclimatic conditions. We studied ecosystem engineering by aardvark (Orycteropus afer) burrowing by comparing soil and vegetation characteristics between three microsites (burrow entrances, excavated soil mounds and adjacent control sites). We were able to identify several engineering effects and distinguish between potential mechanisms. Burrow soils were cooler, drier and less compact than the other microsites, with all three microsites representing unique combinations of abiotic conditions. Mean species richness was higher at older burrows than mounds and non-burrowed controls, despite burrows having a smaller seedbank and not differing in soil fertility from mounds and control sites. However, the opposite was observed at fresh burrows and mounds, where control plots contained more species on average than the other two types of microsites. Burrow age and microsite type also affected species composition, although only a small proportion of species were significantly associated with specific microsites and just two species were limited to a single microsite type. We suggest that trampling and the physical digging action at burrow entrances, and burial by deposited soil at mounds, prevents the establishment of many plant species at active burrows. However, once abandoned, burrow entrances provide good physical conditions for seedling survival, allowing the establishment of more species. Therefore, as suggested previously for other ecosystem engineers, it is important to explicitly consider the age and degradation processes of engineered structures. In addition, our results highlight biologically-important differences in engineering impacts between burrow entrances, where soil is removed, and mounds, where soil is deposited. Such microscale differences are important to consider when examining bioturbation or, more generally, ecosystem engineering.

AB Cost-effective UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technologies were utilized to map both submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation in natural rivers. This study was undertaken along reaches characterized by vegetative conditions ranging from homogeneously distributed to strongly heterogeneous and anisotropic. Spatial extent of vegetation was identified using both manual and automated image post-processing methods. For the study reaches assessed here, if 13,000 pixels/m(2) image resolution is maintained (which mostly depends on flight elevation and camera resolution) aquatic vegetation can be detected accurately. The methods presented here can be used to inventory aquatic vegetation in under one hour, as opposed to field data collection methods which would require approximately 9.5 h to achieve a comparable level of spatial resolution. Results were also applied to re-evaluate the accuracy of flow resistance formulations based on plants spatial distribution found in literature. It was found that there can be up to a 20% difference if vegetation is inventoried at the cross-sectional scale rather than at the planform scale, however for dense vegetation cover this difference is much lower.

AB Agricultural drainage is significant source of nutrients, which contributes to eutrophication of reservoirs and coastal areas. Constructed wetlands and vegetated ditches are promising techniques used for elimination of nutrients and suspended solids from agricultural drainage. While constructed wetlands have been successfully used for several decades vegetated drainage ditches have been used only recently. The current study presents the results from a two-year monitoring (2015-2016) of a naturally vegetated drainage ditch in the Czech Republic. The drainage ditch was 200m long with Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia and Glyceria maxima being the dominant macrophytes growing in the ditch. Removal of nitrogen averaged 1070 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with 804 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) being removed through denitrification of nitrate nitrogen. Plant uptake was responsible for 26.3% of the removed nitrogen. The removal of TP averaged 142 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with plant uptake being responsible for 14% of the removed load. Mean removal of suspended solids amounted 20 437 kg TSS ha(-1) yr(-1). Removal of BOD5 and COD averaged 1500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 7000 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The removal of nitrogen and organics was strongly dependent on water temperature while removal of phosphorus and suspended solids were temperature-independent. The results of this study revealed that the naturally vegetated drainage ditch has comparable treatment efficiency with constructed wetlands in terms of nutrients, suspended solids and organics.

AB Input variable selection using data-driven combined with statistical methods have received more attention to analyse the probability of freshwater organisms' occurrence. Eight different sampling sites (from the source to the mouth of Gamasiab River basin, Iran) were considered to study the occurrence of Alburnoides mossulensis during one year study period (2008-2009). A set of river characteristics together with abundance of target fish (based on presence/absence data) were recorded at each sampling site. Logistic regression was optimized with an input variable selection, greedy stepwise search algorithm, to select the most important explanatory variables for analysing the occurrence of fish. According to the optimization method, almost one-third of total recorded variables in the sampling sites including electric conductivity (EC), bicarbonate (HCO3-), river width, river depth, water temperature, pH, sulphate (SO4(2-)) and orthophosphate (PO4(3-) -P) might influence the probability of occurrence of fish in the river while based on the outcomes of binary logistic regression model, electrical conductivity and bicarbonate were the most important ones (p < 0.05 for both variables).

AB The presence of anoxia and hypoxia is increasingly observed in the bottom waters of many estuaries and coastal embayments, and remains a management challenge due to detrimental effects on estuarine biodiversity and overall amenity. As part of a multi-pronged strategy to tackle the problem of eutrophication in the Swan-Canning estuary, oxygenation plants have been installed in the upper reaches of the estuary to counteract the high oxygen demand and prevent hypoxia. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to simulate oxygen dynamics and assess the cost-benefit of different oxygenation operation regimes (e.g., night operation, all day operation or tidally-optimised operation). The model accurately captured the salt-wedge dynamics and the extent and severity of hypoxia under low and high flow conditions. The artificial oxygenation is shown to significantly improve oxygen conditions in the targeted zone under low flow conditions. The scenario assessment revealed a two-term power relationship between total oxygen supply and areal benefit, with scenarios highlighting that adding more oxygen would improve the oxygen conditions to a greater extent up to a limit (i.e., the law of diminishing returns). The total areal benefit achieved was found to be dependent on the total oxygen load rather than the timing of the oxygen input regime. The results also suggest that when designing an artificial oxygenation plant for an estuarine environment, the locations of oxygen addition should be carefully selected within the context of the local hydrology to achieve optimum results in target areas.

AB Large wood (LW) plays an essential role in aquatic ecosystem health and function. Traditionally, LW has been removed from streams to minimize localized flooding and increase conveyance efficiency. More recently, LW is often added to streams as a component of stream and river restoration activities. While much research has focused on the role of LW in habitat provisioning, geomorphic stability, and hydraulics at low to medium flows, we know little about the role of LW during storm events. To address this question, we investigated the role of LW on floodplain connectivity along a headwater stream in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Specifically, we conducted two artificial floods, one with and one without LW, and then utilized field measurements in conjunction with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify floodplain connectivity during the experimental floods and to characterize potential management variables for optimized restoration activities. Experimental observations show that the addition of LW increased maximum floodplain inundation extent by 34%, increased floodplain inundation depth by 33%, and decreased maximum thalweg velocity by 10%. Model results demonstrated that different placement of LW along the reach has the potential to increase floodplain flow by up to 40%, with highest flooding potential at cross sections with high longitudinal velocity and shallow depth. Additionally, model simulations show that the effects of LW on floodplain discharge decrease as storm recurrence interval increases, with no measurable impact at a recurrence interval of more than 25 years.

AB Greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions from human activities continue to alter the climate and are likely to have significant impacts on watershed hydrological cycles and stream water quality. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate how CO2 impacts the hydrology of a watershed. The goal of this study is to evaluate how potential CO2 changes would impact the hydrologic components in the forest-dominant Seolma-cheon watershed (8.48 km(2)) in South Korea. Using an image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra, the CO2 flux was estimated as the sum of the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (Rec) following the method of Lloyd and Taylor (1994). To assess the water cycle impact, the SWAT results for certain hydrological components, such as total runoff (TQ), surface runoff (SQ), lateral runoff (LQ), soil water content (SW) and evapotranspiration (ET), were analysed to generate Budyko curves. In the field of watershed management, SWAT modelling using CO2 concentrations as an additional parameter provides a better understanding of the role of ET and soil moisture in ongoing and future climate changes.

AB Increasing terrestrial input of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to temperate softwater lakes has reduced transparency, distribution of pristine rosette plants and overall biodiversity in recent decades. We examined microbial and UV-induced reduction of absorption by CDOM and dissolved organic carbon pools (DOC) in humic water from a groundwater-fed softwater lake as well as groundwater received from surrounding heathland and coniferous forest. An experimental setup that mimics naturally coupled continuous UV-exposure and microbial degradation was introduced and compared with experiments applying a single initial or no UV-exposure. We found that decreases of CDOM and DOC concentrations were negligible in groundwater and very small in lake water over 30 days in the absence of UV-exposure. Initial UV-exposure increased degradation rates, but further degradation ceased after 20 days preventing determination of the natural time course of degradation. Coupled continuous UV-exposure and microbial degradation showed high and constant degradation of CDOM (340 nm) over 30 days removing 87% of the initial absorption in heathland groundwater, and 20% in forest groundwater and lake water. Declines in DOC concentrations over 30 days were 34%, 28% and 13% of the initial levels in heathland groundwater, forest groundwater and lake water, respectively. Model estimates showed that a shift in land use from a forest dominated to a heathland dominated catchment could increase lake transparency from 0.6 to 2.5 m. and expand plant-covered area from 3 to 35%. The main time delay to a new steady state of better light climate would be degradation of soil organic pools and exchange of groundwater magazines, while the delay in the lake water after a complete shift to inflow of CDOM-poorer groundwater would last only 1-2 years. Consequently, changes in CDOM levels in groundwater input should have relatively rapid and marked influence on light conditions and plant distribution in shallow softwater lakes.

The nanoporous Au shows highly selective conversion behavior for CO2 to CO. And, the CO faradaic current density on the basis of geometric area and electrochemical surface area of the nanoporous structured Au is significantly improved than the Au film, which is mainly due to highly and increased active sites at the catalytic surface.

AB Based on the considerations in environmental and economic benefits, Cr2O72 as the major chromium pollutant is employed for applications in energy storage. A novel Cr2O3 ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) (<5 nm) filled carbon nanocapsule configuration is achieved through a surfactant-free solvothermal route with renewable furfural as the carbon source. The confinement effect that Cr2O3 NPs are restrained in the outer robust carbon shell and the plenty space among Cr-2 O-3 NPs result in substantially enhanced Li-storage performances, such as stable capacity of 568 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after more than 200 cycles and high capacity retention at large current density.

AB Many properties of bulk polymers are closely related to the molecular chain conformation. It is ideal if guidance exists to link molecular features to polymer chain conformation to significantly narrow down the design space. Here, we analyze a series of molecular descriptors derived from empirical forcefields and relate them to single chain conformation characterized by radius of gyration calculated from molecular dynamics simulations. Using data analyses and machine learning techniques, we identify that the weakest dihedral angle, characterized by the energy constants, along the chain backbone is the most influential descriptor determining the single chain radius of gyration.

A host-guest material composed of a cyclic aromatic as the guest and an amorphous steroidal compound as the host was used to modulate n. The guest material exhibited a triplet lifetime longer than 1 s, and a high-density triplet excited-state population was obtained upon excitation with blue-violet light. The refractive index could be changed by 0.002, even when using a relatively low excitation power level of 100 mW cm(2). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spin transport properties of a single ferrocene molecule connected between gold electrodes by amine (NH2), sulfur (S) and titanium (Ti) linkers are investigated using density functional theory through a non-equilibrium Green's function approach. The results clearly reveal that the anchoring groups can significantly modify the spin-dependent properties due to shift of the frontier orbitals. This will give rise to some interesting phenomena including robust spin-filtering effect and obvious negative differential resistance behavior. Importantly, the linkers dramatically influence the bias region of spin-filtering diagram. The numerical results suggest that such single molecular junctions would be efficiently implemented for developing spintronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By theoretically exploring the synergistic effects of electron donating (ED) and electron withdrawing (EW) substituents on intramolecular charge movement in disperse yellow (DY)119 dye, series of new azopyridone disperse dyes with improved aqueous solubility and chemical reactivity have been predicted using VWN-BP/DNP model. Aqueous solubility and reactivity of DY119 were found to be greatly dependent on the nature and position of substituent(s) on the primary DY119 structure. Momentous increase in solubility was observed with -CN and -NH2 substituents compared to other substituents. The new derivatives of DY119 showed appreciable thermodynamic stability. TiO2 and ZnO were predicted to be the most promising photocatalysts for the dyes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop the theory of chirp mixing in NMR spectroscopy. The working principle is simple, given coupled homonuclear spins with offsets in range [-B, B], we adiabatically sweep through the resonances. This achieves cross polarization between the z magnetization of the coupled spins. We repeat this basic operation many times with a supercycle to achieve appropriate mixing time. When we sweep through the resonances, midway between the resonances of the coupled spin I and S, the effective field seen by two spins is the same and hence they precess at same frequency around their effective fields. This means the coupling, which normally gets averaged out due to the chemical shift difference is no more averaged out for a short time and we get mixing. In this paper, we develop these basic ideas. By virtue of its design, the chirp mixing is much more broadband compared to state of the art methods. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on C-13 mixing in a sample of Alanine.

AB A new stable structure of Au-28(SR)(20) cluster is predicted, which has the same gold core as two known structures but different Au-S framework. The new Au-28(SR)(20) cluster is proposed to be a key link in the evolution of Au-22(SR)(18), Au-34(SR)(22) and Au-40(SR)(24) clusters. The four clusters belong to a homogenous Au-16+(6N)(SR)(16+)(2N) series (N = 1-4). The relative stabilities of the new Au-28 isomer structure were confirmed by density functional theory calculations including dispersion corrections (DFT-D). It is found that upon protection of certain SR ligands, the new isomer structure has lower or comparable energies to two known cluster structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Furfural is a key biomass-derived chemical to produce important biofuels, such as 2-methylfuran. The furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1)/ZnO catalyst has been investigated by the catalytic evaluation experiments. In order to elucidate the reaction temperature-oriented selectivity, density functional theory calculations were used to study the furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1) surface. Furfural alcohol forms via F-CHO + 2H -> F-CH2O + H -> F-CH2OH, and 2-methylfuran forms via dehydration of furfuryl alcohol (F-CH2OH + 2H -> F-CH2 + OH+ 2H -> F-CH3 + OH + H -> F-CH3 + H2O). Furthermore, the reaction rates at different temperature (403, 453 and 503 K) have been calculated. As a result, high temperature plays a significant role in enhancing the reaction rate and prompting the reaction selectivity towards 2-methylfuran. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The selective hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene on Au-13 and Au-55 nanoclusters has been systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT), allowing for a comparison with Au-20 nanocluster. All possible adsorption configurations of relevant intermediates are identified. The adsorption energy of all species exhibit the following trend: Au-13 > Au-20 > Au-55. The detailed reaction barriers show that Au-55 nanocluster has the least hydrogenation reaction barrier of the rate-limiting step, whereas the dechlorination reaction is least likely to cause on Au-55 nanocluster. These observations suggest that the 55-atom gold cluster is predicated to be the appropriate catalyst for practical application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CaMoO4 catalyst was synthesized by a facile and direct co-precipitation method. The original and calcined catalysts were characterized by a variety of techniques. The acidity of the catalysts was studied and correlated with the catalytic activity. The obtained results clearly revealed that CaMoO4 was an active and selective catalyst towards the formation of anhydrous formaldehyde. The highest conversion of methanol and yield of formaldehyde obtained were 100 and 98%, respectively. In addition, the moderate strength of Bronsted acid sites created on the surface of catalyst plays the main role in the formation of formaldehyde. Finally, the CaMoO4 catalyst exhibited a remarkable stability towards anhydrous formaldehyde production up to 120 h. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NiCo2S4/rGO, with the morphology consisted of flower-like NiCo2S4 and rGO nanosheets, was successfully fabricated based on a simple method of one-step solvothermal at 200 degrees C for 12 h. The composite was characterized by XRD, SEM and XPS, and the first time used as gas sensors. Compared with flower-like NiCo2S4, NiCo2S4/rGO possessed ascendant gas sensitive properties, such as lower working temperature about 100 degrees C, shorter response/recovery time and better selectivity to ethanol. The extraordinary performance was because of the introduction of rGO with fast electron transport rate. Also, the possible formation mechanism of NiCo2S4/rGO composite was preliminary discussed.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess changes in long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method uptake at Utah's Title X clinics before and after introduction of a new, low-cost levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg IUD (Liletta (R)).
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of LARC visits occurring at seven Title-X family planning clinics in Utah before the introduction of the low-cost LNG IUD (preintroduction period: 01/01/2014-04/30/2015) and after (postintroduction period: 05/01/2015-03/31/2016). We ran segmented, interrupted time series ordinary least squares regression models using Newey-West standard errors to assess both the change in numbers of women initiating any LARC method and the average payment amount per LARC method. We evaluated both the low-cost LNG IUD and all LARC methods.
   Results: At the outset of preintroduction period, there were 29.2 [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.1-38.41 monthly LNG IUD insertions. Immediately postintroduction, there was a significant level of increase of 14.4 LNG IUD insertions the first month (95% CI: 2.0-26.8) followed by a significant trend increase each month of 2.4 additional LNG IUD insertions (95% Cl: 0.32-4.47). Postintroduction, there was a significant level of remitted-payment decrease from all sources of -$240.43 per LNG IUD (95% CI: 311.02 to 168.87) followed by a significant monthly trend decrease of -$23.01 per LNG IUD (95% CI: -32.02 to -13.98). There were minimal changes in uptake and payment of other LARC methods following the introduction of the low-cost LNG IUD.
   Conclusions: Following introduction of a low-cost LNG IUD at Title X clinics, LNG IUD initiation increased and average payment for the method decreased. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Muscle wasting is a decline in skeletal muscle mass and function that is associated with aging, obesity, and a spectrum of pathologies including cancer. Cancer-associated wasting not only reduces quality of life, but also directly impacts cancer mortality, chemotherapeutic efficacy, and surgical outcomes. There is an incomplete understanding of the role of tumor-derived factors in muscle wasting and sparse knowledge of how these factors impact in vivo muscle regeneration. Here, we identify several cytokines/chemokines that negatively impact in vitro myogenic differentiation. We show that one of these cytokines, CXCL1, potently antagonizes in vivo muscle regeneration and interferes with in vivo muscle satellite cell homeostasis. Strikingly, CXCL1 triggers a robust and specific neutrophil/M2 macrophage response that likely underlies or exacerbates muscle repair/regeneration defects. Taken together, these data highlight the pleiotropic nature of a novel tumor-derived cytokine and underscore the importance of cytokines in muscle progenitor cell regulation.

AB Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease characterized by proliferative changes in pulmonary arteries. There is growing evidence suggesting that soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) and P-selectin could be involved in PAH development and progression. Here we investigate whether circulating platelets may be a source of sTWEAK and contribute to diminished availability of sTWEAK and P-selectin in PAH patients.
   We have prospectively enrolled two independent study groups of stable patients with confirmed PAH and age matched controls: derivation (10 PAH; 15 controls) and validation (20 PAH; 12 controls). P-selectin and sTWEAK concentrations were measured in platelet-poor plasma and platelet lysate. To avoid procedural bias, in each group we employed different protocols for platelet isolation.
   Consistently, both in derivation and validation groups PAH patients presented significantly lower sTWEAK content in platelets than control group with no significant differences in plasma levels. Similarly, patients presented comparable to controls plasma P-selectin concentrations and lower concentration in platelet lysate. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with low platelet sTWEAK/total protein concentration ratio had more frequently detoriation of PAH in the follow-up (16.51 +/- 3.32 months), log-rank test, p = .03.
   Patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension present diminished sTWEAK and P-selectin storage capacity in platelets. Thrombocytes appear to be a major source of sTWEAK that could be released upon local injury and its decreased availability could have an impact on pathophysiology and prognosis in PAH.

AB Up-regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) in parenchymal hepatocytes with cholestatic injury has been previously demonstrated to exert hepatoprotective effects in an autocrine manner; however, the overall impact of NGF up-regulation remains elusive. This study aimed to profile the effects of exogenous NGF on cultured primary rat hepatocytes using transcriptome analysis. Total RNA was isolated from hepatocytes with and without 24 h of NGF exposure, and subjected to RNA enrichment by PCR and RNA sequencing procedures. Comparison of transcriptome profiles between control and NGF-stimulated hepatocytes demonstrated that NGF significantly up regulated 10 genes and down-regulated 23 genes in hepatocytes. Subsequent KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NGF significantly affected the retinol metabolism pathway via increased retinol dehydrogenase 16 (RDH16) expression. In a mouse model of bile duct ligation-induced cholestatic liver injury, NGF supplementation significantly enhanced RDH16 expression, whereas administration of anti-NGF neutralizing antibodies prominently decreased RDH16 expression in cholestatic livers, supporting the positive role of NGF in the regulation of RDH16 in diseased livers. In vitro study further demonstrated that NGF triggered de novo synthesis of RDH16 in primary rat hepatocytes, mainly through an NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the up-regulation of RDH16 by NGF in cultured rat hepatocytes and mouse cholestatic livers, and provides novel insights on the mechanistic role of NGF in the retinol metabolism of livers.

AB Natural product derivatives have proven to be cutting edge window for drug discovery and development. BA-25 (3-alpha-o-acetoxy-4 beta-amino-11-oxo-24-norurs-12-ene) an amino analogue of beta-boswellic acid exhibited inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in THP-1 cells as demonstrated previously, however, the effect on principal inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the pathways that mediate this function remains unknown. This study was designed to examine the comparative anti-inflammatory activity of BA-25 with its parent compound, beta boswellic acid both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of BA and BA-25 on suppression of NO, PGE(2), LTB4, COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was determined by ELISA, RT-PCR and ROS by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of NF-kBp65, IKB degradation was determined by western blotting and also the nuclear localization of NF-kBp65 was assessed by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, this study was extended on Carrageenan induced paw oedema modelled BALB/c mice. A novel derivative BA-25, reported first time notably decreased the LPS (1 mu g/mL) induced upregulation in the transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2. Also the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 as well as their downstream products NO and PGE2 respectively, were also decreased efficiently at a concentration of 10 mu M than BA. Moreover, LPS upregulated NF-kB p65 expression and I kappa B degradation was significantly decreased after BA-25 treatment. In addition, the treatment of BA-25 also restored the paw oedema and decreased the magnitude of histopathological alterations. Our data together suggested that BA-25 might be regarded as prospective therapeutic anti-inflammatory alternative and demands further investigation in pharmacological studies.

AB Vegetation-induced changes of soil hydrology (i.e., infiltration rate and soil matric suction) has important implication to the stability of earthen infrastructure. Predicting the plant hydrological effects is challenging when multiple species are present. Most existing models consider only single-species due to lack of reliable and relevant experimental data and difficulty to partition solar radiant energy into individual species in a mixedspecies condition. This paper aims to develop an improved hydrological model that can determine the water infiltration rate and suction responses under both single-and mixed-species (one tree and one grass species) condition. The model is verified by double-ring infiltration tests and field monitoring conducted in bare, grassonly, tree-only and mixed tree-grass plots. The model was subsequently used for parametric analyses. The mixed species plot had the lowest infiltration rate and preserved the greatest suctions because the tree-grass competition for water created high soil moisture deficit. Parametric study identifies a threshold ratio of tree and grass leaf area index of 2.0, beyond which the effects of grass root-water uptake on water competition with the adjacent tree were negligible. Induced suction in the mixed tree-grass plot was close to that in a tree-only plot. Contribution of tree root-water uptake to induced suction in a mixed species plot did not increase further when the leaf area index ratio exceeds 5.0.

AB The restoration of grasslands is a key management practice that supports biodiversity across Europe. On species poor grasslands and ex-arable fields, the establishment of plant species is often limited by the availability of habitat niches, in particular space to germinate. We investigated the impacts of full inversion tillage and its interaction with site conditions and functional traits on the abundance of 51 plant species sown into a 2 ha exarablesite in Poland. Soils of the donor site were characterized by high levels of heterogeneity in terms of water content and plant availability of N, P and K. One year after sowing the cover of species typical of semi-natural grasslands was significantly higher on the tilled plots than on the non-tilled plots. However, in the case of widespread generalist species the tillage of soil resulted in no significant effect on their establishing percentage cover. The establishment of plants on the tilled area was more successful where soils were relatively rich in mineral N. It was also more successful for species with low Ellenberg's N values. Species indicative of moist soil established poorly where the soil was tilled. This study has clear implications for the applied restoration of grasslands, demonstrating a vital role of soil tillage to promote the establishment of species typical of seminatural grasslands. This is particularly important where seed mixtures may contain both desirable and undesirable competitive species that would disproportionately benefit from the absence of tillage management.

AB Tropical montane cloud forest is a priority ecosystem for restoration due to the diversity and ecosystem services it provides and because it is under severe threat. Forest restoration can be achieved by active interventions and/or natural regeneration (passive restoration). However, there has been little comparison of the effectiveness of active versus passive restoration strategies and even fewer studies have monitored the long-term success of forest restoration practices. We assessed the effectiveness of active (mixed plantation with native species) and passive (areas adjacent and non-adjacent to mature cloud forest) restoration strategies implemented in pastures with 21 years of exclosure, and compared these to a mature cloud forest (reference system), in eastern Mexico. In the mature forest and in the areas represented by each restoration strategy, similar to 15 plots (200 m(2)) were established in order to assess forest structure, tree diversity and soil properties as indicators of restoration success. Active restoration proved more effective than passive restoration at recovering forest structure (e.g. higher basal area, tree density and height). Adult tree diversity was similar across all restoration sites and the mature forest, while composition differed greatly between the mature forest and each of the restoration sites, from which the characteristic mature cloud forest tree species were mostly absent. The restoration sites presented very low tree seedling density (0.39 individuals/m(2)) relative to the mature forest (1.68 seedlings/m(2)), probably due to the higher cover of climbers, ferns, grasses and shrubs found in the understory of the restoration sites (similar to 78%), compared to that of the mature forest (8%). In all of the restoration sites, soil pH was higher, and carbon content in both the soil and litter was lower, than in the mature forest. This denotes a slow recovery of soil properties after use of the land as cattle pasture. In general, the passive restoration site non-adjacent to the forest presented the lowest recovery (lower canopy cover, composition similarity and seedling density), indicating the importance of proximity to seed sources. Our results highlight the need, in both actively and passively restored areas, for management practices such as enrichment planting, in order to assist tree seedling recruitment of key species and recovery of forest attributes. Active and passive restoration strategies could be implemented as complementary strategies for the restoration of cloud forest landscapes.

AB This study attempted to determine an efficient flocculant that was used for the recovery of microalgal species, namely Scenedesmus. The biomass was grown in a pilot-scale raceway pond receiving domestic wastewater discharges. The microalgae achieved treatment efficiencies of 76.5% NH4+-N, 83.1% PO43--P, 73.9% biological oxygen demand (BOD), and 42.8% chemical oxygen demand (COD). During microalgal harvesting, the highest biomass recoveries of 99.0%, 97.5%, and 96.5% were obtained by alum 300 mg/L at pH 7, chitosan 100 mg/L at pH 7, and cationic polymer 10 mg/L at pH 10, respectively. The protein, carbohydrate, and lipid yields of polymer-harvested biomass were 28.0%, 12.4%, and 17.4% (dry cell weight), respectively, which were higher than those obtained when applying either alum or chitosan flocculants. Moreover, the cationic polymer provided no detrimental effects on the fractions of fatty acids derived from the harvested microalgal cells. The microalgal biomass subjected to flocculation by either polymer or chitosan were entire and intact, whereas the lysis of cells was noticed during the alum flocculation process.

AB Wetlands are an effective edge-of-field conservation practice for reducing agricultural nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loads, but their removal performance varies with hydrologic conditions and other factors difficult to capture with traditional grab sampling schemes. We quantified NO3-N retention in a large Iowa constructed wetland using high-frequency (15-min) in situ NO3-N sensors and a physically- based hydrologic model that estimated discharge. Monitoring from May-Nov over a 3-yr period (2014-16) indicated the wetland reduced incoming NO3-N concentrations 49% and loads by an estimated 61 kg day-1 (0.48 gm(-2) day(-1) based on wetland area removal). Monthly and seasonal (May-Nov) wetland retention performance were significantly influenced by hydrologic conditions, as NO3-N concentration reductions ranged from 23% in a year that received nearly 50% more seasonal precipitation than average (2016) to 59-65% in years that received average seasonal precipitation (2014-15). On a monthly basis, NO3-N mass retention was highest in Jun when NO3-N loading was highest, while retention efficiency - the percent of the incoming NO3-N load retained by the wetland - was highest in Jul and Aug when water temperature and hydraulic residence time were higher. The high-frequency monitoring captured NO3-N dynamics not possible with lower-frequency sampling. Extrapolating the May-Nov 3-yr average wetland NO3-N retention estimated in this study to a much larger scale, over 5600 wetlands treating more than 60% of Iowa's area and totaling an estimated $1.5 billion in design and construction would be required to reduce the state's baseline NO3-N load by 45%, indicating the sizable investment in wetland construction and restoration needed to achieve Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia water quality goals.

AB Rocky desertification is currently the most serious ecological and environmental problem in karst region of southwestern China. Its negative consequences for both natural ecosystems and the human inhabitants of the karst region have created a need for effective ecosystem restoration strategies, but success in these efforts has been limited. We hypothesized that scarcity of mineral nutrients could be a crucial factor in vegetation recovery, but relatively little information is available about the limiting roles of various mineral elements. We investigated responses of aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations of a degraded karst grassland to nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) additions over a period of three years. Nutrient additions significantly increased aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations for both the plant community and individual plant functional groups. Total aboveground biomass was significantly increased by N (by 35.6%), P (by 35.3%) and K (by 11.7%) fertilization over three years of nutrient additions. The interaction effects of year x N and year x P on total biomass were significant. Additions of N and P increased the biomass of grasses by 39.2% and 15.0%, respectively, and additions of P increased the biomass of forbs by 69.3%. The biomass of shrubs was significantly increased by P (by 111.3%), K (by 45.3%) and N (by 38.5%), and there were strong interaction effects of N, P and K on shrub biomass. P and K additions significantly increased the relative biomass of shrubs but decreased that of grasses, especially under the NPK treatment. Our results suggest that the productivity of degraded grassland in the karst region of China is co-limited by N, P and K, with N and P being the primary limiting factors. Among functional groups, grasses are mainly limited by N and P, forbs by P, and shrubs by all 3 elements, with P being the most limiting factor overall. Mineral fertilization stimulates plant growth and may be a useful tool in efforts to restore woody vegetation in degraded grasslands, thus counteracting the process of rock desertification in the karst region of southwestern China.

AB Relations between diversity of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in 16 karst ponds on the outskirts of SE Alps (Slovenia) were investigated. Inventory of macrophytes was performed and their cover values were estimated. Macroinvertebrates were sampled with hand net. Correlations between environmental factors and parameters of taxonomic richness and diversity of the communities were calculated. Influences of environmental parameters on the structure of communities were analyzed. Results confirmed significant positive correlations between diversity of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates. The most abundant and most species-rich group of plants were emergent macrophytes. Richness and diversity of macrophytes were more important than their coverage for diversity of macroinvertebrates. A negative direct influence of the cattle to macrophytes as well as to macroinvertebrates was calculated. We can conclude that diversity of macrophytes had a positive influence on diversity of macroinvertebrate community. High diversity of emergent macrophytes supports high diversity of macroinvertebrate communities - directly as higher number of hiding places, oviposition sites or food sources and indirectly with more efficient uptake of excessive nutrients. Despite the negative direct influence of the cattle to macrophytes that we calculated, trampling positively influences macrophytes and indirectly also macroinvertebrates in karst ponds, since it enables the existence of these specific waterbodies in the long run.

AB A successful design and operation of up-flow constructed wetlands combined with microbial fuel cell (UCW-MFC) were assessed for wastewater treatment and bioelectric production. One of the main aims of present study is also to investigate effect of various types of filtration media on wastewater treatment process and bioelectric production in UCW-MFC systems, and determine the most efficient media type in order to obtain higher wastewater treatment performance and generate higher bioelectric production. In the present experiment, UCW-MFC system with zeolite (clinoptilolite) as filtration media had higher treatment efficiency compared to other UCW-MFC systems with sand and volcanic cinder, and average COD, NH4+, NO3-, and TP removal efficiency were 92.1%, 93.2%, 81.1%, and 96.7%, respectively. This superior performance in the zeolite medium in the UCW-MFC system was due to its larger specific surface area, different framework structure, and more porous composition. On the other hand, the maximum average output voltage, power density, and Coulombic efficiency were also obtained for zeolite wetland system which 1.008 +/- 0.14 V, 15.1 mWatt/m(2), and 1.64%, respectively. In this respect, we found that the formation of electrogenic bacteria-zeolite media-graphite surface facilitate the degradation of organic substrate and increase electrogenic bacteria' activities which are catalyzed during the electron flow from anode to the cathode. Thus, the results suggest that zeolite-based filtration media can be use for improving the treatment efficiency and bioelectric production in UCW-MFC.

AB Satellite earth-observation monitoring of the extent of cultivated land leads to a decrease in allocated subsidies for farmers when temporary wetlands are detected on their arable land. In this study, we examined 34 wetlands in Czechia that formed spontaneously de novo in arable fields, 21 of which were on former fish ponds and 13 of which formed at other sites in arable fields. The wetlands were either plowed within the previous two years, located at field-watercourse ecotones or were set-aside for more than two years. We analyzed the diversity of bees and wasps, and the cover and composition of vegetation. The examined wetlands served as secondary strongholds for both common and threatened wetland-and open habitat-associated bees and wasps, and the species composition of these wetlands was affected by differences in the microhabitat management. These wetlands hosted not only abundant populations of threatened wetland specialists among bees and wasps but also a broad spectrum of species that were previously thought to be specialized for drift sands, other open sandy habitats and loessic steppes. The examined sites were characterized by the presence of vegetation of halophilous wetlands or wetlands on nutrient-rich soils, with numerous and abundant threatened species. The identification of wetlands that spontaneously formed de novo on arable fields as a previously unknown stronghold of drift sand "specialists" among bees and wasps has direct implications for the conservation of these threatened species in the future.

AB As concerns about sea-level rise mount, municipalities in coastal areas are looking to nature-based protection and adaptation. Oftentimes such projects are marsh creations or restorations, where areas of open water are filled with dredged material to an elevation where emergent vegetation can grow. We are investigating ways biosolids can be used as an amendment to dredged material to enhance project outcomes. Marsh mesocosms were constructed in San Francisco Bay and planted with native cordgrass, Spartina foliosa. Some mesocosms contained a subsurface layer of biosolids. Vegetation grown with biosolids had significantly increased number of new shoots, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass. Vegetation with only dredged material had greater rooting depths but this result was not significant. By combining natural processes with human infrastructure, the application of biosolids for marsh creation is a sustainable practice.

AB Establishing semi-natural grasslands by using seeds from wild harvesting is an effective method to restore vegetation with high natural value. However, studies implementing this strategy for the revegetation of coarse soils are scarce. In this study, different types of propagation material (green hay, dry hay, and hay-flower from seed stripping) harvested at a species-rich European vegetation typical for calcareous soils (Mesobromion) were used at different sowing densities (range, 450-3000 seeds perm(2)) to restore a very unfertile soil consisting of coarse wastes from a calcareous quarry. The experiment, organised in a randomised block design with three replicates, was established in 2009, and the species composition and structure were surveyed over five years. The threshold of 70% vegetation cover effective against erosion was achieved within two years after sowing. Neither the type of propagation material nor the sowing density influenced the number of species transferred or the final vegetation cover. However, seed density affected the time of achieving the 70% threshold of plant cover important for erosion control (two or three years after sowing depending on the seed density). Of the seventy-three donor site species, fifty-nine were recorded at least during one year on the restored site (absolute transfer rate of 81%), but only forty-six were recorded in the last year (final transfer rate of 63%). Vegetation development was characterised by loss or decrease of donor site species not well adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and increase by species typical for coarse textured soils. The very low soil nitrogen content caused an abundance of nitrogen-fixing species (legumes) compared with that at the donor site. Restoring very coarse calcareous quarry wastes, even without soil improvement, is possible provided the climatic conditions are favourable and seeds of good quality are available.

AB Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the main cause of death in children under-5 years worldwide and Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial agent. However, it is difficult to identify pneumococcal infection among children with CAP. We aimed to assess association between any cytokine/chemokine and pneumococcal infection in childhood CAP. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic value of cytokine/chemokine for pneumococcal infection. This prospective study was conducted at an Emergency Room, in Salvador, Brazil. Children < 5-years-old hospitalized with CAP in a 21-month period were evaluated. On admission, clinical and radiological data were collected along with biological samples to investigate 20 etiological agents and determine serum cytokines (interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 beta, IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, gamma-interferon), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10) concentration. From 166 patients with etiology detected, pneumococcal infection was detected in 38 (22.9%) cases among which the median IL-6(pg/ml) was 31.2 (IQR: 12.4-54.1). The other 128 cases had other causative agents detected (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catorrhalis, atypical bacteria and viruses) with the median IL-6 concentration being 9.0 (IQR: 4.1-22.0; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for IL-6 to predict pneumococcal CAP was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65-0.83; p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, with pneumococcal CAP as dependent variable, IL-6 was an independent predictor for pneumococcal infection (OR = 5.56; 95%CI: 2.42-12.75, cut-off point = 12.5 pg/ml; p = 0.0001). The negative predictive value of IL-6 under 12.5 pg/ml for pneumococcal infection was 90% (95%CI: 82-95%). Independently significant difference was not found for any other cytokines/chemokines. Serum IL-6 concentration on admission is independently associated with pneumococcal infection among children under-5 years hospitalized with CAP.

AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that results in the impairment of the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. It can give rise to various complications, mainly caused by chronic exposure of cells to high glucose concentrations, including changes in the immune response processes. The aim of this study was to verify the chemokine and cytokines production profile in the presence of different glucose concentrations and infection/inflammatory stimuli. To this end, cell viability and the production of chemokines, cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) were analyzed in RAW 264.7 cell culture. Results demonstrated that there was no change in cell viability after 6, 24 and 72 h. Different stimuli were unable to modify the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Groups stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and LPS and recombinant interferon (rIFN)-gamma down-regulated interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-10 and IL-12 and up-regulated IL-6 production. NO production maintained a pattern of increase, according to the increase in glucose concentrations, reaching its peak at 72 h. In summary, the results demonstrated that high glucose concentrations alone may be sufficient to alter the in vitro mediators' production of RAW 264.7 cells.

AB It is known that long-term exposure to stressful situations can produce severe consequences affecting behavioral, endocrine and immunological parameters. We have previously shown that stressed BALB/c mice had poor learning performance, which was reverted by glatiramer acetate treatment through a mechanism that likely involved the regulation of the cytokine balance and adult neurogenesis. In addition, recent results suggest that cytokine and neurotrophin expression in the hippocampus displayed similar tendencies as those in the serum. However, if lymphoid cells could be good candidates as peripheral markers of memory impairment have not yet been investigated. For this purpose, we analyzed the spatial memory and the neutrophin and cytokine mRNA levels in lymph nodes and hippocampus in mice submitted to chronic stress treated or not with glatiramer acetate. Results indicated that there was a correlation between the cytokine and neurotrophin mRNA levels in the hippocampus and in the peripheral lymph nodes, and the cognitive performance in BALB/c mice. In particular, our results suggest that altered IFN-gamma levels could be used as peripheral biomarker of cognitive deficit and treatment response.

AB Object.
   Th17 cytokines have been identified in several types of human cancers. In this pilot study, the expression of Th17 cytokines profiling in enteroviruses 71 (EV71) associated colorectal cancer (CRC) were explored.
   Methods: 66 patients with CRC were enrolled in this study; immune- histochemical analyses were performed on cancerous tissues and adjacent non- cancerous tissues of the patients. Serum Th17 cytokines of CRC patients and healthy controls were measured using a Luminex 200 analyzer.
   Results: Cancerous tissues had more positive EV71 antigen expression than adjacent non- cancerous tissues. In TNM II-III CRC, 59.9% of cancerous tissues were observed to be EV71 positive; on the contrary, 65.2% of the adjacent non- cancerous epithelium was EV71 negative. In TNM I CRC, all adjacent non- cancerous epithelium was virus negative, but in TNM IV, half of adjacent non- cancerous tissues were virus positive. Serum IL-10 were significantly higher in CRC patients than in healthy controls, and IL-10 concentrations in the EV71 positive group were higher than those of the EV71 negative group, with the highest IL-10 levels being observed in CRC patients with strong positive group (P < 0.05). Similar results were found for IL-21 and IL-23. IL-17 levels were higher in CRC patients than in healthy controls, there was no significant difference in IL-17 between the viral positive and viral negative groups (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Persistent existing EV71 viral antigens in intestinal tissues are positively associated with TNM III/IV CRC. EV71 latent infection recruits Th17 cells in the colorectal tumor site, stimulating Th17 cytokine production that closely associated with CRC carcinogenesis.

AB Objective and design: The aim of this study is to investigate the inflammatory alterations due to the use of smokeless tobacco and dual use of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes, relative to smoking.
   Subjects: Plasma and saliva samples were collected from healthy smokers (SMK-100 subjects), moist snuff users (MSC-89 subjects), the dual users (DUSMK-49 subjects), and non-tobacco consumers (NTC-99 subjects) from two cross-sectional studies.
   Methods: Luminex Human InflammationMAP (R) 1.0 panel, a multiplex immunoassay.
   Results: SMK and DUSMK exhibited larger number of alterations in the expression of inflammatory analytes compared to NTC. Eight analytes were significantly elevated (p <= .05) within plasma samples of SMK compared to NTC, while one 1 analyte was elevated between the MSC and NTC groups. DUSMK exhibited different levels of 11 analytes, relative to NTC.
   MSC displayed fewer alterations in inflammatory protein expression compared to smoker groups, and the inflammatory profile of MSC resembles NTC. Five analytes (ICAM-1, VEGF, MMP-9, ferritin and fibrinogen) emerged as potential biomarkers distinguishing tobacco consumers (p < .02).
   Conclusions: We identified a set of five proteins as potential biomarkers that can inform of inflammation status due to tobacco usage. Our findings contribute a better understanding of how the use of different tobacco products contributes to inflammation.

AB Converging evidence suggests important implications of immuno-inflammatory pathway in the risk and progression of schizophrenia. Prenatal infection resulting in maternal immune activation and developmental neuroinflammation reportedly increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring by generating pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6. However, it is not known how prenatal infection can induce immuno-inflammatory responses despite the presence of immuno-inhibitory Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G) molecules. To address this, the present study was aimed at examining the correlation between 14 bp Insertion/Deletion (INDEL) polymorphism of HLA-G and IL-6 gene expression in schizophrenia patients. The 14 bp INDEL polymorphism was studied by PCR amplification/direct sequencing and IL-6 gene expression was quantified by using real-time RT-PCR in 56 schizophrenia patients and 99 healthy controls.
   We observed significantly low IL6 gene expression in the peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of schizophrenia patients (t = 3.8, p = .004) compared to the controls. In addition, schizophrenia patients carrying Del/Del genotype of HLA-G 14 bp INDEL exhibited significantly lower IL6 gene expression (t = 3.1; p = .004) than the Del/Ins as well as Ins/Ins carriers. Our findings suggest that presence of "high-expressor" HLA-G 14 bp Del/Del genotype in schizophrenia patients could attenuate IL-6 mediated inflammation in schizophrenia. Based on these findings it can be assumed that HLA-G and cytokine interactions might play an important role in the immunological underpinnings of schizophrenia.

AB Myocardial depression, frequently observed in septic shock, is mediated by circulating molecules such as cytokines. TNF-alpha appears to be the most important pro-inflammatory cytokine released during the early phase of a septic shock. It was previously shown that TNF-alpha had a negative inotropic effect on myocardium. Now, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the activation of PKC by TNF-alpha on heart function, and to determine if this cytokine could induce a decrease of membrane excitability. Isolated rat hearts (n = 6) were perfused with Tyrode solution containing TNF-alpha at 20 ng/ml during 30 min by using a Langendorff technique. Expressions of PKC-alpha and PKC-epsilon were analysed by western blot on membrane and cytosol proteins extracted from ventricular myocardium. Patch clamp was performed on freshly isolated cardiomyocytes (n = 8).
   Compared to control situation, 30 min of TNF-alpha perfusion led to cardiac dysfunction with a decrease of the heart rate (-83%), the force (-20%) and speed of relaxation (-18%) and the coronary flow (-25%). This is associated with an activation and a membrane targeting of both PKC-alpha and PKC-epsilon isoforms in ventricle with respectively +123% and +54% compared to control hearts. Nevertheless, TNF-alpha had no significant effect on voltage-gated sodium current (109.0% +/- 12.5) after addition of the cytokine when compared to control.
   These results showed that TNF-alpha had a negative inotropic effect on the isolated rat heart and can induce PKC activation leading to an impaired contractility of the heart. However the early heart dysfunction induced by the cytokine was not associated to a decrease of cardiomyocytes membrane excitability as it has been evidenced in skeletal muscle fibres.

AB Background: Dilatative pathology of the ascending thoracic aorta (DPATA) is characterized by the aortic wall expansion more than 1.5 and could be accompanied by aortic wall rupture. Mutations of TGFBR2 gene demonstrated an association with syndromic DPATA and altered pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Elevated TGF-beta 1 level has been found in blood samples in DPATA group. Moreover, elevated osteopontin (OPN) level was associated with mutations of TGFBR2 gene. Based on recently published findings, we aimed to evaluate genotyping results of TGFBR2 rs4522809 and the association with circulating OPN and TGF-beta 1 concentrations within DPATA patients.
   Methods and findings: TGFBR2 SNP genotyping assay was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, TGF-beta 1 and OPN concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping results showed G allele to be associated with DPATA (p = .01), the presence of G allele significantly increased the possibility of DPATA by 1.67 times (OR = 1.67, 95%, CI = 1.12-2.47). TGF-beta 1 concentration was significantly higher in DPATA subjects compared with Reference group (p = 0,001). Finally, we found moderate inverse correlation (r = -0,524) between circulating TGF-beta 1 and OPN levels within DPATA subjects (p = 0,002), as increasing levels of TGF-beta 1 cytokine significantly decrease concentration of OPN.
   Conclusions: This is the first report on the association between previously defined TGF beta R2 SNP rs4522809 linked with dilatation of ascending thoracic aorta. Also, for the first time we report the inversed correlation between circulating TGF-beta 1 and OPN concentrations in DPATA subjects indicating the possible biomarkers for DPATA.

AB Objective: Gestational diabetes Mellitus has been considered an inflammatory disease involving different cells and mediators in its development. The role of innate immune cells in GDM physiopathology remains unclear, therefore this study was conducted to assess monocyte profile in GDM patients.
   Design: This was a case-control study including 20 glucose-tolerant pregnant women (controls) and 18 GDM patients.
   Methods: Flow cytometry was used to assess peripheral blood monocytes subsets (classical, intermediate, non-classical), the expression of TLR4 and CCR2 chemokine receptor (CD192) and cytokines (TNFA, IL6, IL10) secretion by monocytes subsets. In addition, sCD14 serum levels were evaluated by ELISA.
   Results: We observed increased percentage of CD14(+) cells, decreased frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14(+)CD16(+)), and lower percentage of circulating monocytes (classical, intermediate and non-classical) that express TLR4 in the diabetic group compared to controls. Soluble CD14(+) serum levels were higher in GDM patients compared to controls. There were no differences in the expression of the CCR2 chemokine receptor and cytokines (TNFA, IL6 and IL10) secretion between the studied groups.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that GDM patients present impaired monocyte profile in the peripheral blood, suggesting that these cells are involved in GDM physiopathology.

AB Background and objective: Inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of most complications seen in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients. We aimed to evaluate serum levels of two newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-27 and IL-37), and pro-inflammatory cytokines among Brazilian SCA patients that are not on hydroxyurea therapy (HbSS), compared with hydroxyurea-treated patients (HbSSHU) and healthy controls (HbAA). Furthermore, we demonstrated the effect of IL-27, IL-37, and heme on in vitro secretions of IL-8 in human neutrophils and monocytes.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 82 consenting SCA (35 HbSS and 47 HbSSHU) patients in steady state and 49 HbAA consenting individuals. Clinical details were obtained from interviews and medical records. Serum levels of IL-27, IL-37, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutrophils and monocytes were isolated from healthy controls, and cultured separately with or without cytokines (IL-27 and IL-37) and heme. Supernatant IL-8 concentration was determined by ELISA.
   Results: Serum levels of IL-27, IL-37, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly elevated in HbSS patients compared to HbAA controls. Serum IL-8 levels were significantly higher in HbSS and HbSSHU patients than in controls. IL-27 and IL-37 were positively correlated in both HbSS and HbSSHU patients. In vitro IL-8 production by IL-27 and IL-37 pre-treated neutrophils and monocytes was significantly inhibited even after heme addition.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that IL-27 and IL-37, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines, are elevated in HbSS patients compared with controls, suggesting that the secretion of these anti-inflammatory cytokines is driven by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This role is probably sufficient in preventing further cellular or tissue damage but not potent enough to prevent inflammation. Therefore, IL-27 and IL-37 may be potential immuno-targets for ameliorating complications associated with elevated heme levels seen in SCA and other hemolytic anemias.

AB ALT-803 is a fusion protein complex consisting of an interleukin (IL)-15 superagonist and a dimeric IL-15 receptor alpha sushi domain IgG1 Fc fusion protein. When administered to mice, ALT-803 is capable of inducing natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation and activation, and effectively promoting potent anti-tumor responses. Currently, ALT-803 is in clinical trials for treatment of various solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In the initial phase of these clinical studies, intravenous (iv) injection was used according to the route used in pre-clinical efficacy studies. In order to evaluate the possible advantage of subcutaneous (sc) injection versus iv injection, this study compared the biological activity of the two treatment regimens of ALT-803 in pre-clinical in vivo models. The pharmacokinetics, immune stimulation, and anti-tumor efficacy of iv and sc injection routes of ALT-803 in C57BL/6 mice were compared. The half-life of ALT-803 was 7.5 h for iv versus 7.7 h for sc with the maximal detected serum concentration of ALT-803 to be 3926 ng/ml at 0.5 h time-point following iv injection versus 495 ng/ml at 16 h post sc injection. Biodistribution studies indicated that sc ALT-803, similarly to iv ALT-803 as previously reported, has a greater tissue distribution and longer residence time in lymphoid tissues compared to recombinant IL-15. Notably, ALT-803 when administered either iv or sc induced comparable proliferation and activation of CD8(+) T and NK cells and resulted in similar reductions of tumor burden. A toxicity study of mice receiving multiple injections of ALT-803 for 4 weeks by iv or sc routes revealed equivalent immune-related changes. The gradual absorbance into the blood stream and lower maximal blood levels of ALT-803 in sc-injected mice, along with similar anti-tumor efficacy support the administration of ALT-803 by sc injection in patients with various malignancies and infectious diseases.

AB Hypothesis: Proinflammatory cytokines are increased in saliva of mother/children pairs with caries. Design: Case-control study involving caries-free children (n = 20) and children with early childhood caries (ECC) (n = 20), and their mothers (n = 40). The maternal variables analyzed were waist circumference (WC), decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) and sugar intake; and in the children were body mass index (BMI), def-t and sugar intake. Salivary levels of VEGF, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were analyzed of mother/children pairs. Results: In the mothers, salivary VEGF levels were correlated with DMFT (r = 0.35; p = .03), WC (r = 0.35; p = .02), and sugar intake (r = 0.32; p = .04). Higher salivary IL-6 levels were also correlated with maternal DMFT (r = 0.45; p = .004) and WC (r = 0.32; p = .04). In the children, higher salivary VEGF levels were correlated with higher def-t scores (r = 0.42; p = .008). Children with caries had a 63% higher median salivary VEGF and twofold higher mean IL-6 levels compared to caries-free children. Mothers of children with ECC showed higher mean of salivary IL-6 levels compared to those of children without ECC (p = .03). Conclusion: Salivary proinflammatory cytokines are correlated with the severity of caries in the mother-children pair. Obesity and excessive sugar consumption seem to underlie the associations between proinflammatory cytokines and caries in the family environment.

AB Obesity is often associated with metabolic disorders. However, some obese people can present a metabolically healthy phenotype, despite having excessive body fat. Obesity-related cytokines, such as myostatin (MSTN), leptin (LP) and adiponectin (ADP) appear to be key factors for the regulation of muscle and energy metabolism. Our aim was to compare lipid, glucose-insulin and inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha; TNF-alpha) profiles, muscle function, energy expenditure and aerobic capacity between healthy normal-weight (NW) adults, metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) adults; to study the associations between these outcomes and the cytokines MSTN, ADP, LP; and to establish cutoffs for MSTN and LP/ADP to identify the MUHO phenotype. Sixty-one young adults (NW, n = 24; MHO, n = 16; MUHO, n = 21) underwent body composition (body fat -BF and muscle mass - MM), energy expenditure at rest (RER) and aerobic capacity (VO2peak) evaluation, muscle strength and endurance tests and blood profile characterization (glucose-insulin homeostasis and serum MSTN, ADP, LP and TNF-alpha). MHO and MUHO had a BMI >= 30 kg m(-2). MUHO was defined as presenting >= 3 criteria for metabolic syndrome (NCEP/ATPIII) in association with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR >= 3.46). MSTN and LP/ADP were associated with MM, MetS and glucose-insulin profile; MSTN was associated with TNF-alpha and only LP/ADP was associated with parameters of obesity and VO2peak. Neither MSTN nor LP/ADP was associated with muscle functions (p < .05 for adjusted correlations). Both of them were able to discriminate the MUHO phenotype: MSTN [AUC(95%CI) = 0.71(0.55-0.86), MSTN > 517.3 pg/mL] and LP/ADP [AUC(95%CI) = 0.89(0.81-0.97), LP/ADP > 2.14 pg/ng]. In conclusion, high MSTN and LP/ADP are associated with MetS, glucose-insulin homeostasis impairment and low muscle mass. Myostatin is associated with TNF-alpha and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio is associated with body fatness and aerobic capacity. Neither MSTN nor LP/ADP is associated with energy expenditure, muscle strength and endurance. Myostatin and adipokines cutoffs can identify the metabolically unhealthy obese phenotype in young adults with acceptable accuracy.

TI The effect of minocycline on indolamine 2, 3 dioxygenase expression and

   primary rat microglia

AB Microglia are one of the most important neural cells in the central nervous system (CNS) which account for 10-15% of all cells found in the brain. A vast majority of studies indicate that microglia play a pivotal role in protection and damage of the CNS. It has been shown that microglia are mainly scavenger cells but also produce a barrage of factors that are involved in tissue repair and neural regeneration. Several lines of evidence indicate that unregulated activation of microglia in response to either endogenous or exogenous insults results in the production of toxic factors that propagate neuronal injury. Studies demonstrated that the activated microglia secret the excessive amounts of quinolinic acid (QA) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) which are highly toxic for the neuronal cells. In line with this, indolamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme producing KYNA and QA has been shown to be elevated during the inflammation in microglia. In this study, we established primary microglial cell cultures obtained from cerebral cortices of 1-day neonatal Wistar rats. Minocycline (20-60 mu M) or its vehicle was added to the culture media 60 min prior to 48 h incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 ng/mL). Using a specific process of adhesion and shaking of the cultured glial cells, a purified culture of approximately 94% enriched microglia was obtained and then, corroborated by immunocytochemistry (ICC). The cell viability after minocycline treatments was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay. The expression of IDO was evaluated using qPCR. The levels of KYNA and QA were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that minocycline significantly decreased the levels of both KYNA and QA in glia cells exposed to LPS. Moreover, minocycline decreased the expression of IDO in treated LPS-induced microglia. It seems that minocycline has a potent ability to oppress the inflammatory process via the decrease in production of IDO expression and the concentrations of KYNA and QA.

AB It was posited that the initial host response to Staphylococcus aureus is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia. Having previously observed that T cells play a negative role in the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia to S. aureus the contribution of the CD80/CD86 pathway in pathogenesis was investigated. Mice lacking CD80 and CD86 had significantly improved survival in a mouse model of acute S. aureus pneumonia. This was accompanied by significant reductions in several proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, MIP-2, IL-1 beta, IL-17 and IL-6, as well as increased numbers of viable alveolar macrophages. Early during infection reductions in cytokine production were evident and cytokine production in response to S. aureus in bone marrow derived macrophages showed decreases in TNF, KC, IL-1 alpha and GM-CSF. Our data suggest that CD80/CD86 signaling plays a significant role in the initial inflammatory response to S. aureus in the airway and could be a potential acute target to reduce the initial inflammatory insult.

AB Background: Women living with HIV (WLHIV) experience high rates of unmet contraceptive need and unintended pregnancy. Contraceptive method-specific continuation rates and associated factors are critical for guiding providers tasked with both reproductive health (RH) and HIV care. We conducted this systematic review to determine whether contraceptive continuation rates differ between WLHIV and uninfected women and, for WLHIV, whether differences are impacted by method type, antiretroviral therapy use or other factors.
   Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, POPLINE and PubMed.gov for studies published between January 1, 2000, and August 31, 2016. Inclusion criteria comprised prospective data of WLHIV, nonbarrier method continuation as an outcome measure, and recorded method switching and/or discontinuation.
   Results: Of 939 citations screened, 22 articles from 18 studies were eligible. For studies with comparator groups, data quality was moderate overall based on Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations and Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scales. Of four studies comparing women by HIV serostatus, two showed higher rates of contraceptive continuation among WLHIV versus uninfected women, while two others detected lower continuation rates for the same comparison. Generally, baseline method continuation exceeded 60% for studies with >12 months of follow-up. Studies providing contraception had higher continuation rates than studies not providing contraception, while women allocated to contraceptive methods in trials had similar continuation rates to those choosing contraceptive methods. Across all studies, continuation rates differed by method and context, with the copper intrauterine device showing greatest variability between sites (51%-91% continuation rates at months). Implant continuation rates were 86%, though use was low relative to other methods and limited to few studes.
   Conclusions: Contraceptive continuation among WLHIV differs by method and context. More longitudinal studies with contraceptive continuation as a measured outcome following >= 12 months are needed to strengthen integration of RH and HIV care. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The object of this study is to examine factors and symptoms associated with low-lying IUDs as defined by ultrasound.
   Study Design: This is a cross-sectional sub-study of participants in the Study of Environment, Life-style, and Fibroids (SELF). SELF participants had screening ultrasounds for fibroids at study enrollment; those with an IUD in place are included in this sub-study. Low-lying IUDs were identified and localized. Logistic regression was used to identify factors and symptoms associated with low-lying IUDs.
   Results: Among 168 women with IUDs at ultrasound, 28 (17%) had a low-lying IUD. Having a low-lying IUD was associated with low education level (<= high school: aOR 3.1 95% CI 1.14-8.55) and with increased BMI Women with a low-lying IUD were more likely to report a "big problem" with dysmenorrhea (the highest option of the Likert scale) as compared to women with a normally-positioned IUD (OR 3.2 95% CI 1.07-9.54).
   Conclusion: Our study found that women with a low-lying IUD are more likely to be of lower education and higher BMI, and to report more dysmenorrhea. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UP; MIFEPRISTONE; FEASIBILITY; MISOPROSTOL
AB Objectiye: The objective was to summarize data on the accuracy and acceptability of a strategy for identifying ongoing pregnancy after medical abortion treatment using a low-sensitivity pregnancy test (LSPT).
   Study design: We searched PubMed to identify studies that evaluated the use of a single posttreatment LSPT for detection of ongoing pregnancy after treatment with mifepristone and misoprostol. We extracted, assessed and summarized data from each study.
   Results: We found 10 studies that evaluated 6 LSPTs with human chorionic gonadotropin detection thresholds of 1000, 1500 or 2000 mIU/mL. The three earliest studies compared the pregnancy test strategy to standard assessment in the same women; the sensitivity of a positive or invalid LSPT result for detecting ongoing pregnancy ranged from 67% to 100%. Three randomized trials found no significant difference in detection of ongoing pregnancy between the LSPT strategy and routine in-person follow-up. Four noncomparative studies found that of the 12 women who had ongoing pregnancies diagnosed after performing an LSPT, 8 (67%) had positive or invalid LSPT results. Across the 10 studies, 30 of the 59 total ongoing pregnancies (51%) were identified based on symptoms without a positive or invalid LSPT result. Women expressed satisfaction with the LSPT strategy. Risk of bias in the seven later studies was high.
   Conclusions: Despite their limitations, most studies showed that the LSPT strategy had moderate sensitivity for identifying ongoing pregnancy and can enable the majority of medical abortion patients to assess treatment outcome at home. However, the LSPT itself had a limited role in the detection of treatment failures in the studies. Implications statement: The LSPT strategy shows promise for reducing the need for in-person follow-up after medical abortion. A range of home-based options should be validated to meet the varied needs of women and abortion providers in diverse settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We explore the patterns of adolescents' need for contraception in 46 low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods: Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, we estimate the prevalence of never-use, ever-use and current contraceptive use of sexually active adolescent girls ages 15-19. We use weighted fixed-effects meta-analytic techniques to estimate summary measures. Finally, we highlight country profiles of adolescent contraceptive use.
   Results: More than half (54.4%) of sexually active or girls in unions report never using contraception, while 13.3% report having used contraception but not currently doing so. Nearly a third report currently using a contraceptive.
   method: 24.6% are using a modern short-term method, 2.5% are using a most effective method, and 5.2% are using a traditional method.
   Conclusions: We find significant heterogeneity across countries as well as within countries based on adolescents needs for spacing, limiting and method preference. With more than half of sexually active adolescents having never used contraception, the potential for unwanted pregnancies is high. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Use among Women in Rakai, Uganda
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Covert; secret; contraception; HIV; family planning; reproduction
ID COUPLES; GENDER; KENYA; MEN
AB Objectives: Covert contraceptive use (CCU) is the use of family planning without a partner's knowledge. This study sought to examine CCU prevalence among women living in Rakai, Uganda, predictors of CCU, and why women resort to CCU.
   Study Design: We used data from women (15-49 years) currently using contraceptives (oral contraceptives, Depo Provera, implants, intrauterine devices, and periodic abstinence) during Round 15 (2011-2013) of the Rakai Community Cohort Survey (n=2206). We utilized logistic regressions to analyze the association between self-reported CCU and current contraceptive method, sexual activity, experience of violence, and demographic data. We also used data from in-depth interviews (IDI) on HIV and reproductive health conducted in 2013-2016.
   Results: CCU prevalence was 26%. In the multivariable model, being previously married (aOR=2.2 [1.7-2.9]), having no formal education (aOR=2.1 [1.1-3.9]), and experiencing physical violence (aOR=1.7 [1.3-2.2]) or having more than 1 sex partner (aOR=1.6 [1.2-2.2]) in the past 12 months were CCU predictors. Advancing past primary school decreased the odds of CCU (aOR=0.7 [0.6-0.9]), HIV was positively associated with CCU in the unadjusted model, but not the adjusted. In the IDIs, women primarily resorted to CCU because of discordant fertility desires-coupled with financial insecurity, negative stereotypes towards contraceptives use, deteriorating health, and familial pressure to reproduce. One woman employed CCU because she feared being ostracized from her community.
   Conclusions: CCU is common amongst users of contraception and is used to hide family planning from partners and communities. Women that diverge from Uganda's cultural norms had higher odds of CCU. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To explore the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviors, health insurance coverage and use of SRH services of women in the United States (U.S.) by nativity, disaggregated by race and ethnicity.
   Study design: We analyzed publicly available and restricted data from the National Survey of Family Growth to assess differences and similarities between foreign-born and U.S.-born women, both overall and within Hispanic, non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black and NH Asian groups.
   Results: A larger proportion of foreign-born women than U.S.-born women lacked health insurance coverage. Foreign-born women utilized SRH services at lower rates than U.S.-born women; this effect diminished at the multivariate level, although race and ethnicity differences remained. Overall, foreign-born women were less likely to pay for SRH services with private insurance than U.S.-born women. Foreign-born women were less likely to use the most effective contraceptive methods than U.S.-born women, with some variation across race and ethnicity: NH white and NH black foreign-born women were less likely to use highly effective contraceptive methods than their U.S.-born counterparts, but among Hispanic women, the reverse was true.
   Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the SRH behaviors, needs and outcomes of foreign-born women differ from those of U.S-born women within the same race/ethnic group. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: The relationship between unintended pregnancy and interpregnancy interval (IPI) across maternal age is not clear.
   Methods: Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth, we estimated the percentages of pregnancies that were unintended among IPI groups (<6, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23, 24+ months) by maternal age at last live birth (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-44 years).
   Results: Approximately 40% of pregnancies were unintended and 36% followed an IPI<18 months. Within each maternal age group, the percentage of pregnancies that were unintended decreased as IPI increased.
   Conclusion: Unintended pregnancies are associated with shorter IPI across the reproductive age spectrum. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effect of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) on sexual function, either alone or together with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
   Study design: An exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, crossover study was conducted in 81 OC users. Subjects discontinued their OC for one cycle before being randomized for 10 cycles to a 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/levonorgestrel (LNG) OC or a 30-mcg EE/drospirenone (DRSP) OC, along with daily use of 50 mg dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or placebo during five OC cycles before crossing over from DHEA to placebo or the reverse for another five cycles. First, the effect on sexual function of five OC cycles + placebo was compared to baseline. Then, the effect of five OC cycles + DHEA was compared to the OC + placebo. Results regarding endocrine changes have been published separately. Primary efficacy outcomes of the current study were genital response (measured by vaginal pulse amplitude [VPA]) and sexual feelings (measured by the subjective self-assessment questionnaire [SSAQ]) to self-induced erotic fantasy and visual sexual stimuli in a laboratory setting and measures of desire and arousability using a sexual function diary (SFD). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised.
   Results: Eighty-one women were enrolled, and 74 women completed the study. Five cycles of OC + placebo resulted in a significant decline compared to baseline of four out of six SFD self-ratings of sexual desire and arousability with both OCs. The LNG OC also resulted in significant declines in the FSFI scores (baseline vs. LNG OC + placebo: total score, 28.7 +/- 3.7 vs. 25.6 +/- 7.4; arousal, 5.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.4; lubrication, 5.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.6 +/- 1.7; pain, 4.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.4), but no changes were observed using the DRSP OC. In the laboratory setting, five cycles of OC + DHEA showed no significant differences with placebo except for a significant increase in genital sensations (SSAQ) during erotic fantasy (DC + placebo vs. OC + DHEA: 3.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.5; p<.05). No significant changes were observed for genital response (VPA) and the other two variables of the SSAQ assessed after visual erotic stimulus exposure. Using the SFD, 5 out of 10 variables showed a significant improvement with DHEA. Partner's initiative was rejected less often with OC + DHEA compared to placebo (DC + placebo vs. OC + DHEA: 1.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 0.8 +/- 1.0; p<.05). Women with free testosterone levels in the upper quartile during DHEA co-administration showed significantly better effects on sexual arousal and desire compared to the three lower quartiles (lower vs. upper quartiles: sexual arousability: 25.0 +/- 19.8 vs. 41.2 +/- 29.0; sexual desire: 5.6 +/- 3.7 vs. 9.6 +/- 8.0; desire for sex with partner: 4.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 8.6 +/- 7.4; number of sex fantasies: 3.0 +/- 32 vs. 5.5 +/- 4.4; all p<.05).
   Conclusions: In this exploratory study, OC use was associated with decreases in some measures of sexual functioning, whereas others remained unchanged. Maintaining or restoring physiological testosterone concentrations by the co-administration of DHEA to the OC may prevent these effects on sexuality, particularly in women with relatively high but physiologic levels of free testosterone during DHEA co-administration.

ID MISINFORMATION
AB Objectives: Investigations into Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) have documented the provision of deceptive information about abortion, but it is unclear how many pregnant women actually visit CPCs and what impact visits have on their pregnancy decision-making.
   Study design: We conducted a mixed-methods study. We surveyed patients at one of two local abortion clinics and three prenatal clinics in Southern Louisiana about whether they had visited a CPC for this pregnancy and conducted in-depth interviews with prenatal patients who reported a CPC visit about their experience.
   Results: We surveyed 114 abortion patients and 269 prenatal patients, and interviewed 12 prenatal patients about their CPC visit. Just 6% of abortion patients (n=7) and 5% of prenatal patients (n=14) visited a CPC for this pregnancy. Prenatal patients went to CPCs primarily for free pregnancy tests and reported receiving information about abortion from CPC staff that was inaccurate. They also generally recognized the CPC was antiabortion, ideologically Christian, and not a medical establishment. Only three had been considering abortion at the time of their visit and reported that the visit impacted their plan for the pregnancy. However, all three also faced additional barriers to abortion, including inability to find an abortion provider, difficulty securing funding, gestational limits, ambivalence about choosing abortion, and opposition to abortion from family members.
   Conclusions: We do not find evidence that pregnant women regularly seek CPC services or that CPCs persuade women who are certain abortion is the right decision for them to continue their pregnancies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Transgender men need contraception if engaging in intercourse with a cis-gender male partner. The copper IUD is an effective, non-hormonal contraceptive well suited for trans-males even while utilizing gender affirming hormone therapy. A gender-neutral medical facility with well-trained and sensitive staff is the ideal setting to provide such contraceptive care. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
